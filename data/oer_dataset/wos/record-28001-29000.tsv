Moreover, the so crafted noble metal free Co@S-rGO electrocatalyst, well characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, FTIR, XRD, SEM, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, exhibits promising activity toward electrochemical sensing of H2O2. For OER in an alkaline medium, the Co@S-rGO composite exhibits a Tafel slope of ca. 49 mV dec(-1), with an overpotential requirement of just 389 mV for a specific current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In the OER electrochemical stability tests, the Co@S-rGO electrocatalyst could maintain its peak OER performance for a time span of about 50 000 seconds during chronoamperometric measurements, while in the linear sweep voltammetry records almost negligible difference was observed between the final and the initial scan in a total of 1000 scans recorded over 25 hours for OER over Co@S-rGO. These chronoamperometric and voltammetric observations establish the excellent activity and long-term electrochemical stability of Co@S-rGO for OER in alkaline media. These current/potential and stability parameters observed for the OER performance of the Co@S-rGO composite are far better than that reported for various non-noble metal based state-of-the-art materials specifically crafted for OER. For the electrochemical sensing of H2O2, the Co@S-rGO composite exhibits a limit of detection as low as 23 nM with a sensitivity of 22743.85 mu A M-1 cm(-2). The excellent OER performance and H2O2 sensing activity of the Co@S-rGO composite can be attributed to the special synergism between the Co and S-rGO components and the extended electrochemically active surface area of Co nanodeposits in this noble metal free electrocatalyst.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000683045700001

Herein Co nanoparticles (NPs)/N-doped carbon (Co/N-C) hybrid electrocatalysts with biactive sites, hierarchical porosity and high specific surface area were successfully designed and fabricated. The detail mechanism of hydrogen evolution through Co*-/N-C*-biactive sites was demonstrated by DFT calculations and was further confirmed via in situ Raman spectra. The coupled effects between the Co NPs and N-doped carbon of Co/N-C hybrids can facilitate water adsorption, activation and dissociation, and the Co/N-C hybrid electrocatalysts exhibit the superior catalytic activity with a low overpotential of only similar to 84 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and excellent stability for hydrogen evolution in alkaline media. This study will provide an insight into the biactive sites nature in the Co/N-C hybrids and will offer a new strategy for the design of high-performance electrocatalysts.									40	0	0	0	5	0	39			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000591696500006		
J	BOERNER, RJ; NGUYEN, AP; BARRY, BA; DEBUS, RJ								EVIDENCE FROM DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS THAT ASPARTATE-170 OF THE D1 POLYPEPTIDE INFLUENCES THE ASSEMBLY AND OR STABILITY OF THE MANGANESE CLUSTER IN THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC WATER-SPLITTING COMPLEX								BIOCHEMISTRY				31	29			6660	6672		10.1021/bi00144a005				JUL 28 1992	1992	To identify amino acid residues that influence the assembly or stability of the manganese cluster in photosystem II, we have generated site-directed mutations in the D1 polypeptide of the cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Indirect evidence has suggested that the DI polypeptide provides some of the ligands that are required for metal binding. Mutations at position 170 of D1 were selected for characterization, since an aspartate to asparagine mutation (DN170D1) at this position completely abolishes photoautotrophic growth, while retention of a carboxylic acid at this position (aspartate to glutamate, DE170D1) supports photoautotrophic growth. Photosystem II particles were purified from control, DE170D1, and DN170D1 cells by a procedure that retains high rates of oxygen evolution activity in control particles [Noren, G.H., Boerner, R.J., & Barry, B.A.(1991) Biochemistry 30, 3943-3950]. Spectroscopic analysis shows that the tyrosine radical, Z+, which normally oxidizes the manganese cluster, is rapidly reduced in the DE170D1 mutant, but not in the DN170D1 mutant. A possible explanation of this block or dramatic decrease in the rate of electron transfer between the manganese cluster and tyrosine Z is an alteration in the properties of the metal center. Quantitation of manganese in these particles is consistent with aspartate 170 influencing the stability or assembly of the manganese cluster, since the aspartate to asparagine mutation results in a decrease in the manganese content per reaction center. Photosystem II particles from DN170D1 show a 60% decrease in the amount of specifically bound manganese per reaction center, when compared to control particles. Also, we observe a 70% decrease in the amount of specifically bound manganese per reaction center in partially purified DN170D1 particles and at least an 80% decrease in the amount of hydroxylamine-reducible manganese in DN170D1 thylakoid membranes. Single-turnover fluorescence assays and steady-state EPR measurements demonstrate that the remaining, endogenous manganese does not rapidly reduce tyrosine Z+ in the DN170D1 mutant. Additional evidence that aspartate 170 influences the assembly or stability of the metal site comes from analysis of the DE170D1 mutant. Although this mutant assembles a functional manganese cluster, as assessed by oxygen evolution and spectroscopic assays, the properties of the manganese site are perturbed.									111	1	1	0	94	0	113			0006-2960			WOS:A1992JF65400005	1322168

Herein, we report the fabrication of a unique conducting polymer alloy thin film electrocatalyst based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and a polymeric additive, polyethylene glycol-polydimethylsiloxane-polyethylene glycol. These polymeric films displayed electrocatalytic activity for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) higher than that of platinum or other polymeric electrodes. Furthermore, the metal-free polymeric electrodes were not susceptible to 'poisoning' when exposed to methanol. The fabrication parameters affecting the ORR performance of the polymeric electrodes and the mechanism of the improvement of the ORR catalysis were comprehensively investigated and benchmarked against commercial Pt electrodes. The application of the conducting polymer alloy electrode in a zinc-air battery demonstrated high power output and stable performance.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				2046-2069		WOS:000372610200077

Current water desalination technologies are a growing user of fossil fuel-derived electricity. A recently developed technology, termed the desalination fuel cell (DFC), can address this issue by instead using hydrogen gas to drive both feedwater desalination and green electricity generation simultaneously in a single cell. The main bottleneck is the use of Pt-based catalysts, which leads to high device costs and catalyst surface poisoning due to chloride ions (Cl-) present in the feedwater. We here propose and demonstrate the first use of non-platinum group metal (non-PGM) catalysts toward DFCs. We synthesized a Fe/N/C based catalyst which demonstrated effective and Cl- tolerant oxygen reduction reaction ex situ and while used as a DFC cathode. The synthesis temperature and the metal concentrations were optimized using rotating disk electrode measurements, with an onset potential of up to 0.84 V vs RHE, on par with that of commercial Pt/C catalysts in a Cl- environment. When using the optimized Fe/N/C catalyst as a cathode in a prototype DFC, open circuit voltage was significantly improved relative to Pt/C, and measured cell voltage and desalination performance versus current density were nearly equivalent. Overall, these results show that non-PGM catalysts maintain or improve cell performance while significantly reducing cell costs, improving greatly the outlook for this nascent technology.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000757903500001

Herein, theobromine, a compound composed of an imidazole ring and a pyrimidine ring, was first copolymerized with urea to prepared doped PCN. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations indicate that, a narrowing in band gap and a positive shift in valence band positon happened to the theobromine doped PCN, owing to the synergistic effect between the pyrimidine ring and the imidazole ring in the theobromine molecule. Moreover, it is shown that the doping with theobromine at a suitable mass fraction makes the obtained sample exhibit decreased photo luminescent emission, enhanced photocurrent density, and reduced charge-transport resistance. Consequently, an enhancement in the photocatalytic activity for water oxidation is found for the sample, which oxygen evolution rate is 4.43 times higher than that of the undoped PCN. This work sheds light on the choice of the molecular dopants for PCN to improve its photocatalytic performance. (C) 2019, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

A series of NiSn electrodes were prepared by electrodeposition of NiSn alloys at different current densities onto a Ni40 mesh substrate. The surface morphology and chemical composition were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The electrochemical surface characteristics were studied by cyclic voltammetry in order to find interdependence between the nickel oxyhydroxide surface electrochemistry and the activity of the electrode for the OER Quasi steady-state polarization measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to determine kinetically significant parameters including the Tafel slopes and exchange current densities. Two well-defined Tafel slopes, the same for all investigated NiSn electrodes, were observed at the polarization curves, indicating that the OER was controlled by the same mechanism. It was demonstrated that any anodic polarization pretreatment led to a shift of the anodic and cathodic current peaks corresponding to the Ni(II)/Ni(III) redox transition towards cathodic potentials and, consequently, to some activation of the NiSn electrodes. The opposite behavior was obtained for the Ni electrode. Prolonged anodic polarization led to a loss of the initial catalytic activity of the Ni electrode, which was explained by the increase in the portion of gamma-NiOOH at the Ni electrode surface. Among the investigated NiSn electrodes, the NiSn100 electrode, prepared by electrodeposition at the highest cathodic current density of - 100 mAcm(-2), exhibited the highest apparent catalytic activity for the OER, entirely due to surface roughness effects. Despite the fact that the NiSn electrodes did not exhibit better intrinsic catalytic activity than Ni, their high stability during the OER and acceptable apparent activity made them promising anodes for alkaline water electrolysis.

We have realized hydrogen production and water desalination with on-demand electricity output via an electrochemical neutralization chemistry strategy that couples acidic hydrogen evolution and alkaline hydrazine oxidation with ionic exchange. The electrochemical neutralization cells allow efficient use of chemical energy and low-grade heat from the surroundings to output 0.81 kWh electricity per m(3) of hydrogen. Cell function can be rapidly switched to electricity output with a high peak power density up to 85.5 mW cm(-2) or spontaneous hydrogen production at a high rate up to 70.1 mol h(-1) m(-2) without breaking cell operation or changing cell configuration. Fast water desalination is simultaneously achieved at a high salt removal rate of 56.1 mol h(-1) m(-2) without an external electricity supply.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000804480500001	35452186

In this regard, semiconductor-oriented heterogeneous photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and photoelectrocatalysisviafuel cell technology are green and sustainable technologies that have been receiving wide attention by the scientific community for tackling these two issues. In addition, in the present scenario, the synthesis of cost-effective and robust catalysts with high stability, corrosion resistance in any medium, and size and morphology oriented in the micro and nanoscale is a hot topic of research. Therefore, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) and their composite-based catalysts are extensively used in these fields, replacing previously used noble metals such as Pt, Au, and Ag due to scarcity, instability, and high price. Predominantly, nickel phosphide-based materials among all TMPs have proven to be excellent catalysts regarding these fields of application. The metal-phosphorus bonding, basically the Ni-P bonding present in the catalyst, and its resemblance with the [NiFe] hydrogenase makes it more stable and resistive. Several phases of nickel phosphides are available with different lattice structures. Moreover, according to their metal and phosphorus proportion, they can be divided in two categories as metal-rich nickel phosphides and phosphorus-rich nickel phosphides. With respect to this, their activities are also reflected by their elemental contents; the phosphorus-rich nickel phosphides are excellent in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), whereas metal-rich nickel phosphides are excellent in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution (OER). However, some metal-rich nickel phosphides with high P/Ni ratio,i.e., Ni5P4, show better activity towards HER because of the high P content. The Ni2P phase also plays an active role in both HER and OER, though it belongs to the metal-rich phase. This shows good catalytic behavior towards HER due to presence of well-defined exposed facets and proper proportion of Ni and P atoms. Furthermore, different types of composites are still being developed by modifying their morphology and size through different synthetic strategies with the expectation of more enhanced activity. This review gives an overview of the design and development of nanostructured nickel phosphide-based materials and their recent significant trends in electrocatalytic, photoelectrocatalytic, and photocatalytic water splitting reactions. Moreover, we present the state-of-art various nickel phosphide materials in last five years, which highlight challenges and future prospects involving some critical issues in these emerging fields that await further exploration, and opportunities in the present and future research.									94	3	0	0	0	0	95			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000573889000005

Modulating the electronic structure of electrocatalysts through constructing metal-semiconductor heterointerface represents an effective strategy to promote the electrochemical performances. Herein, we construct a Mott-Schottky bifunctional electrocatalyst by in-situ growth of NiS/MoS2 hetero-nanoflowers on the conductive carbon cloth (CC) substrate (abbreviated as NiS/MoS2@CC hereafter) for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Thanks to the Mott-Schottky effect, the self-driven charge transfer occurs across the NiS/MoS2 heterointerfaces, which results in the built-in electric field, the accelerated charge transfer rate, and the modified chemisorption free energies for reaction intermediates, ultimately expediting the dissociation of water and urea molecules. Consequently, the as-fabricated NiS/MoS2@CC electrode only requires an overpotential of 87 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1.0 M KOH and a potential of 1.36 V for UOR in 1.0 M KOH solution with 0.5 M urea to attain a current density of 10 mA cm-2, respectively. Moreover, when served as the free-standing anode and cathode simultaneously, the NiS/MoS2@CC-assembled urea electrolyzer requires a cell voltage of 1.46 V at 10 mA cm-2, which is 200 mV smaller than that of the pure water splitting counterpart. This study may deepen the understanding of electronic modulation via Mott-Schottky establishment. All rights reserved Elsevier.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1873-3212			INSPEC:21891221

For both surfaces the protruding bridging O atoms are imaged in STM as bright features. The reaction mechanism is identical on both orientations of RuO2. CO molecules adsorb on the undercoordinated surface Ru atoms from where they recombine with undercoordinated O atoms to form CO2 at the oxide surface. In contrast to the RuO2(110) surface, the RuO2(100) surface stabilizes also a catalytically inactive c(2 x 2) phase may play an important role in the deactivation of RuO2 catalysts in the electrochemical Cl-2 evolution and other heterogeneous reactions.									60	1	0	0	2	0	62			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000220019100001	15038276

However, industrial hydrogen production is primarily via conversion of natural gas, which consumes a large amount of energy and emits large volumes of greenhouse gases. Electrochemical water electrolysis is a promising, pollution-free method for the production of hydrogen from water. Efficient, cost-effective, stable and abundant catalysts that can drive hydrogen production in water with minimal electrical bias are a major goal towards achieving electrolysis on a large scale. Recently, tungsten oxide-based materials have emerged as one of the most promising electrocatalytic compounds, due to their activity, low cost and durability in both acid and base conditions. There are often oxygen vacancies in metal oxides, whether intentional or not, which can potentially promote the water electrolysis. In this review, we provide an overview of tungsten oxide-based materials used for electrocatalytic water splitting. In addition, mechanisms to improve the electrocatalytic activities of oxygen vacant tungsten oxide are summarized and discussed, with proposals for future research. This review article will provide a valuable resource for scientists pursuing materials for electrochemical water splitting. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Based on metal cofactors, four known metalloforms of SOD enzymes have been identified: they contain either Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn, or Ni. Orthologs of all metalloforms are present in oxygenic photoautotrophs. The expression of SOD is highly regulated, with specific metalloforms playing an inducible protective role for specific cellular compartments. The various metalloforms of SOD are not distributed equally within either cyanobacteria or eukaryotic algae. Typically, cyanobacteria contain either an NiSOD alone or combinations of Mn and Ni or Fe and Mn metalloforms (CuZn is rare among the cyanobacteria). The bacillariophytes and rhodophytes retain an active MnSOD, whereas the chlorophytes, haptophytes, and embryophytes have either FeSOD or multiple combinations of Fe, Mn, and CuZnSODs. The NiSOD is a relatively novel SOD and has been generally excluded from evolutionary analyses. In both cyanobacteria and chlorophyte algae, the FeSOD metalloform appears to be associated with PSI, where its primary role is most likely to deactivate reactive oxygen produced by the Mehler reaction. The CuZnSOD also appears to be associated with the plastid but is phylogenetically more restricted in its distribution. In eukaryotic algae, SODs are all nuclear encoded and, based on nucleotide sequence, protein structures, and phylogenetic distributions, appear to have unique evolutionary histories arising from the lateral gene transfer of three distinct genes to the nucleus after the endosymbiotic acquisition of mitochondria and plastids. The varied phylogenetic histories and subcellular localizations suggest significantly different selection on these SOD metalloforms after the endosymbiont organelle-to-host gene transfer.									156	9	0	0	136	0	167			0022-3646	1529-8817		WOS:000229426700002		
J	Wu, Mengxue; Liu, Ziyi; Wang, Guandong; Liu, Huize; Ma, Jinfu								Electrostatic Spinning Strategy to Prepare Cage-like PAN-Fiber Network-Wrapped Co-N-C Structures for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction br								ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS											10.1021/acsaem.2c02695		OCT 2022			2022	Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-derived carbon materials are highly desirable cathode catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Unfortunately, ZIF-derived materials undergo microscale migration, structural collapse, and aggregation of Co atoms during high-temperature pyrolysis. Here, we used an electrospinning technique to combine polyacrylonitrile (PAN) with carbonized ZIF-67 that can obtain cage-like nanocomposite catalysts (Co-N-C@PAN) by repyrolysis. It is found that the obtained composite Co-N-C@PAN has a hierarchical structure, and a high surface area and pore space with a volume is favorable for the adequate disclosure of ORR active sites. More importantly, this cage-like structure forms a stable Co-N-C structure and allows Co nanoparticles to be uniformly found in the Co-N-C substrate, which improves the active site of Co-NX. The as-prepared samples exhibit superior performance for the ORR with an onset potential (Eonset) of 1.05 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.93 V versus the RHE, both of which are higher than commercial Pt/C. In addition, Co-N-C@PAN was applied as a cathode for zinc-air batteries and display a superior power density (132 mW cm-2) at a discharge current density of 219 mA cm-2. Furthermore, at a constant discharge current density of 10 mA cm-2, a specific capacity of 761 mA h gZn-1 was obtained. This study may provide an idea for the design and synthesis of nanostructures prepared by electrostatic spinning/ZIF composites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000874043900001		
J	Zhu, Qijia; Lian, Jie; Chen, Xu; Zhao, Jinyu; Gao, Yu; Wang, Xiaomin								Dual optimization strategy to construct hierarchical reticulated porous framework with enriched Fe-N-x active species for the highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				47	38			16840	16851		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.03.045				MAY 1 2022	2022	Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are severely restricted by slow cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics and expensive noble metal platinum catalysts. In particular, the ORR serves as a key process in electrochemical conversion, which significantly impacts the overall performance of the related devices. Accordingly, we proposed a facile and novel dual-optimization strategy to construct abundant Fe-N-x active site embedded hierarchical reticulated porous structure catalysts. Initially, an extensive encapsulated Fe and Fe-N complexes is created in Fe modified zeolitic-imidazolate-frameworks-8/graphene oxide (Fe-ZIF-8/GO) precursor, subsequently, the thermal melting and restructuring process fosters the structural transformation of the precursor to robust and open nano-porous frameworks. In the meanwhile, the encapsulated Fe in the pores of the precursors and the pre-existing Fe-N coordination structures are converted into new Fe-N-x active sites. This approach realizes the dual optimization of Fe-N-x active site density enhancement and utilization, making the optimal catalyst Fe and N-doped porous carbon/graphene nanosheets-1 (Fe-NPC/GNs-1) exhibits a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.771V under acidic medium, and E-1/2 of 0.917 V toward the ORR in alkaline conditions. The activity and stability under alkaline conditions exceed even that of commercial Pt/C (with negligible potential decay after 10,000 cycles under alkaline conditions), and also showed its capacity to substitute platinum-based catalysts and the potential application in Zn-air batteries.

Surface morphology, elemental composition, microstructure and surface chemical state of the modified graphite films are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. Results indicate that the surface of the pristine graphite can be refined to effectively improve the surface area by etching using the KOH solution with a moderate concentration. The graphite catalyst etched with 4.8 mg mL(-1) KOH solution shows a higher catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction and a superior methanol tolerance than that of the un-etched and the other etched graphite catalysts. The stability of the etched graphite materials needs to be improved.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4				2046-2069		WOS:000457379300056	35520526

Saturated calomel electrode was used as a reference electrode and graphite plate as the auxiliary electrode to study the electrochemical properties of disc working electrode in the vanadium redox battery solution. The results indicated that the higher nano-carbon black content was, the higher electrochemical activity and the worse corrosion resistance in the nano-carbon black polypropylene disc working electrode would be. The suitable nano-carbon black content was 45%. The disc working electrode with 45% nano-carbon black content possessed a hydrogen evolution potential at -1.0 V and an oxygen evolution potential at +2.5 V in the vanadium redox battery solution.

Both nanoparticles and nanoneedles co-existed in the (Cu0.30Co0.70) Co2O4 spinel, which exhibited a high intrinsic electrical conductivity and surface-tovolume ratio, resulting therefore in a large electrochemically active surface area for the HRR. In addition, (Cu0.30Co0.70) Co2O4 showed an onset potential at approximately -0.14 V in the HRR, with a limiting current density of similar to 104 mA/cm(2) at 0.43 V. The synthesised material followed the direct HRR pathway and exhibited good stability. In addition, the HRR activity of (Cu0.30Co0.70) Co2O4 was comparable to that of commercial Pt/C electrodes. The present results therefore demonstrate the significant potential of (Cu0.30Co0.70) Co2O4 for future applications in fuel cells as a cathode catalyst. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Electron transfer reactions involving a redox couple and impedance investigations were performed in order to obtain information about the electronic conductivity, dielectric properties and thickness of the oxide film as well as the kinetics of the processes taking place on it. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to characterize the composition and dopant distribution profile within the modified film and to correlate the electrochemical behaviour with the structure and composition of the films. A transition from n-type semiconductor tb an insulator behaviour was observed at lower Pt content with increase of the final formation potential which is in agreement with platinum distribution through the oxide. At higher Pt content, on the other hand, the oxygen evolution reaction prevails over oxide growth reaction, These results are discussed in terms of a physical model for the system.									18	0	0	0	0	0	19			0013-4686			WOS:A1995TA15500003

Am. Chem. Soc., 2004, 126, 8084). The derivative with 4'-chloro-2,2':6',2 ''-terpyridine (Clterpy), [(OH2)(Clterpy) Mn(m-O)(2)Mn(Clterpy)(OH2)](NO3)(3) (2(NO3)(3)) was synthesized and characterized by UV-visible absorption spectroscopic and magnetic susceptibility measurements. 2 is instable in aqueous solution at room temperature, but the stability of 2 in solution significantly increased at 5 degrees C. The reaction of a 2-mica adsorbate with Ce-IV in water produced a significant amount of O-2, although the reaction of 2 with CeIV in a homogenous solution did not. However, the maximum turnover number (TN = 0.52) of 2 on the mica adsorbate was less than unity, indicating the non-catalytic O-2 evolution by 2 on mica in contrast to the cooperative catalysis by 1 on mica with TN = 15. The kinetic analysis showed that O-2 evolution follows first order kinetics with respect to 2 adsorbed on mica, with the first-order rate constant given to be 6.8 X 10(-5) s(-1). The first order kinetics can be explained by O-2 evolution involved in the unimolecular decomposition of 2 adsorbed on mica, which might be ascribed to the destabilized higher oxidation state of 2 due to the electron-withdrawing chloro-substitution.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1474-905X	1474-9092		WOS:000263113000010

However, many issues still exist before their practical realization. Herein, the sole complexity of electrode reaction in Liair batteries is presented. And the critical components that influence the electrochemical performance of aprotic Li-air batteries operating in ambient air are discussed. These include the mechanisms and pathways of CO2/Li2CO3 and H2O/LiOH, catalysts of CO2 reduction/evolution reactions, and reactions between the Li anode and air constituents. If these challenges can be solved, Li-air batteries will soon be realized for practical application. Some hot topics in field of Li-air batteries should be focused, such as the fundamental mechanism research referring to interfacial reactions of atmosphere components on porous electrode and Li metal anode, highefficiency solid catalyst design, and discovery of suitable soluble redox mediators.									26	4	0	0	0	0	26				2575-0356		WOS:000576639900003

Herein, we developed a facile strategy to introduce two different phases such as alpha-MnO2 or gamma-MnO2 on porous hexagonal bimetallic beta-NiCo(OH)(2)-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets for an enhanced bifunctionality and to ease out interfacial redox reaction kinetics. Due to the rational intend of LDH morphology and well-retained starlike gamma-MnO2 nanostructures, the bifunctional LDHs exhibit commendable activities toward ESs and in the OER study. Importantly, the gamma-MnO2 phase loaded at beta-NiCo(OH)(2) LDHs shows superior ESs or electrocatalytic OER performance in comparison with the alpha-MnO2 phase on LDHs. Besides, the assembled fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor (FASC) device possesses convincing energy (24.43 W h/kg) and power densities (5312 W/kg) and enabled us to glow a 1.4 V light-emitting diode for 45 s. Accordingly, three-/two-electrode systems or the solid-state FASC device has exhibited high efficiency in ESs. Also, the optimized gamma-MnO2 phase on beta-NiCo(OH)(2) LDHs with the detailed mass ratio of Ni and Co has displayed the OER performance comparable to commercial RuO2. The electrochemical studies and structural classifications offer in-depth analysis on the electrochemical behaviors, especially the stability in both ES and OER studies, signifying a promising aspirant in the alternative energy field.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0743-7463			WOS:000654294100023	33950691

The model considers the analytical chemistry between helium, nitrogen, oxygen and water species and it is verified with experimental results to ensure its correctness. The simulation results show that water admixtures highly affect the discharge characteristics and the dominant ions in the mixture. In particular, it was observed that the increase of water in the mixture up to 600 ppm causes the reduction of the breakdown voltage, while above 600 ppm the breakdown voltage increases. Furthermore, the simulation results show that the most important positive ion in the mixture is H(2)O(+ )for 20-100ppm of water admixtures and H11O5+ for 100-2000ppm of admixtures. The most abundant negative charged species is found to be electrons for the range of water admixtures considered in this study. To interpret these results and to get an insight into the discharge evolution, the main reaction pathways of ion production are investigated and analyzed.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000460449400003

The Pd nanoparticles are then electrodeposited on RCQDs and the Pd-NPs/RCQDs/GCE is fabricated. The fabricated electrodes are characterized by some characterization techniques. The electrocatalytic performance of the electrodes for methanol oxidation reaction, MOR, and hydrogen evolution reaction, HER, are investigated using different electrochemical measurement techniques in alkaline and acidic media, respectivly. Cyclic voltammetry, CV, Linear sweep voltammetry, LSV, Chronoamperometry, CA, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, EIS, measurements are used to evaluate the bifunctional catalytic behavior of the Pd-NPs/RCQDs/GCE. All results are compared with Pd-NPs/GCE and the effect of decorating the GCE substrate with RCQDs is discussed. The results indicate that modification of GCE with a layer of RCQDs increases the active surface area from 0.12 for Pd-NPs/GCE to 0.22 cm(2) for Pd-NPs/RCQDs/GCE.

The G/hBN differs from previously demonstrated vdW heterostructures, where it has a chemical bridging between graphene and hBN allowing a direct charge transfer - resulting in high ORR activity. The ORR efficacy of G/hBN is compared with that of graphene-hBN vdW structure and individual layers of graphene and hBN along with that of benchmark platinum/carbon (Pt/C). The ORR activity of G/hBN is found to be on par with Pt/C in terms of current density but with much higher electrochemical stability and methanol tolerance. The onset potential of the G/hBN is found to be improved from 780 mV at a glassy carbon electrode to 930 mV and 940 mV in gold and platinum electrodes, respectively, indicating its substrate-dependent catalytic activity. This opens possibilities of new benchmark catalysts of metals capped with G/hBN atomic layers, where the underneath metal is protected while keeping the activity similar to that of pristine metal.

Iron oxide (alpha-Fe2O3) films were formed at low substrate temperatures (250-350 degrees C), whereas the additional growth of an underlying NiO film occurred at substrate temperatures above 350 degrees C. The electrochemical activities of the as-formed binder-free and noble metal-free electrodes were tested for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. An overpotential reduced by 250 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2)and a lower Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1)compared to bare nickel foam were found for the best-performing electrocatalyst, while the long-term stability of the as-formed electrodes was proven by chronopotentiometry. The surface morphology of the iron oxide films was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, whereas the crystallographic phase as well as the elemental composition were determined by X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry in the pre- and the post-catalytic state.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000573592100001	32926764

The data suggest that in the presence of oxygen, NO is effectively adsorbed (at a Ba site in proximity of a Pt site) through stepwise oxidation to form at first nitrites that are progressively transformed into nitrates. NO is also oxidized to NO2 over Pt in the presence of oxygen. NO2 is directly adsorbed to form Ba nitrates according to a disproportionation reaction, which occurs with the evolution of NO. The stepwise oxidation route seems to play a major role in NOx storage from NO/O-2 mixtures. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Two different paths wherein CuO is formed were distinguished. [Cu-II (bdmpza)(2)] can be oxidized at high potentials to form CuO, which was observed by a slight increase in catalytic current over time. When [Cu-II(bdmpza)(2)] is initially reduced at low potentials, a more active water oxidation catalyst is generated, yielding high catalytic currents from the moment a sufficient potential is applied. This work highlights the importance of catalyst pre-treatment and the choice of the experimental conditions in water oxidation catalysis using copper complexes.

This contribution gives an overview of recent experimental and theoretical efforts in designing carbon-based materials for CO2RR and provides hints for further tuning the electronic structure of carbon-based materials for highly efficient CO2RR catalysis. Using combined density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental evidence, we show that graphene-based materials without embedded metal atoms exclusively reduce CO2 to CO. We also show that in order to see any post CO reduced products, the presence of metal atoms is essential. By examining a variety of metal-doped at single vacancy of graphene, we demonstrate facile reduction of CO to methane.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0888-5885			WOS:000456351200041

However the essential role played by the 1T/2H phase interface is still obscure. Herein, periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed to study the HER mechanism at two types of 1T/2H phase interfaces of MoS2 ("zigzag" and "armchair"). By analyzing the free energy of atomic hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H)) as the descriptor, we suggest that the optimum evolution of H-2 proceeds at similar to 10% H coverage for the "zigzag" and "armchair" interfaces. Under this H coverage, the Volmer-Tafel mechanism is the dominant reaction pathway for both interfaces, in which the Volmer reaction is the rate determining step, and the HER would proceed more easily at the "zigzag" interface with lower energy barriers. The results show that the HER activity along the 1T/2H phase interface is comparable with those at the Mo-edge of 2H MoS2 and the basal plane of 1T MoS2. In addition, we investigate the effect of metal (Fe, Co, Ni, and Zn) and non-metal (N, P, and O) dopants for the "zigzag" type interface, and propose that the HER activity could be improved by doping with Ni for the interfacial Mo atom or with N for the interfacial S atom.									15	1	0	0	1	0	15			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000509894100016

In various synthetic methods for preparation of TMO electrocatalysts, electrochemical reconstruction, as one of the most efficient and controlled way, attracts much attentions. However, most of reported electrochemical reconstruction is usually carried out on the surface of anode via electrochemical oxidation reaction, and the investigations of cathode electrochemical reconstruction are rarely reported. Here, V-doped CoO nanosheets (V-CoO) are successfully prepared via cathode electrochemical reconstruction of amorphous VCoO. The reconstruction process and principle are studied in detail. Compared with the previous oxides, the obtained V-CoO possesses the promoted HER performance with overpotential of 280 mV at -100 mA cm-2 and superior durability at -1.07 V vs. RHE for 20 h. DFT calculations further reveals that vanadium doping effectively improves the intrinsic activity of oxides and HER active sites located at Co side of V-CoO (1 1 1) facet is the favorable H* adsorption site of reconstructed oxides. This work highlights the importance of electrochemical reconstruction on cathode to improve the HER activity of TMOs.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773397000003

We performed quantitative evolved gas analysis (EGA) for several HLW melter feeds with temperatures ranging from 100 to 1150 degrees C, the whole temperature span in a cold cap. EGA results were supplemented with visual observation of batch-to-glass transition using the feed expansion tests. Upon heating, most of the gasesmainly H2O, CO2, NO, NO2, N-2, and O(2)evolve at temperatures below 700 degrees C and escape directly to the atmosphere through open porosity. However, as open porosity closes when enough glass-forming melt appears at 720 degrees C, the residual gas evolution leads to the formation of primary foam. We found that primary foaming is mostly caused by the decomposition of residual carbonates, though oxygen evolution from iron-redox reaction can also play a role. We also show that the gas evolution shifts to a higher temperature when the heating rate increases. The implications for the mathematical modeling of foam layer in the cold cap are presented.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2041-1286	2041-1294		WOS:000443390700004

Notably, the evaluated method is environmentally friendly and involves sustainable techniques. It was determined that a ternary alloy nanostructure on graphite, consisting of Au, Pd, and Ni, exhibits superior catalytic activity toward ethanol electro-oxidation reaction in an alkaline medium in comparison to the corresponding unimetallic or bimetallic alloy nanostructures.

Increasing the active sites and improving conductivity of catalysts are the effective ways to enhance the catalytic performance. Here, nanoparticle-stacked porous NiCoO2@C microflakes arrays grown on Ni foam (NiCoO2@C-NF) was synthesized through a simple high temperature heat treatment reaction of the corresponding NiCo2O4-NF. The nanoparticle-stacked porous microflakes arrays provide a large amount of exposed active sites. Thus, NiCoO2@C-NF with 0.072 g of glucose used for their preparation exhibits remarkable performance with -10 and -100mA cm(-2) for HER at overpotentials of -128 and -184mV in 1.0M NaOH solution, respectively. It is much better than that of NiCo2O4-NF (a eta(10) of -221mV and eta(100) of -379 mV). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately, the original formation mechanism of these layered oxides during synthesis is not completely elucidated, that is, how is lithium and oxygen inserted into the matrix structure of the precursor during lithiation reaction? Here, a promising and practical method, a coprecipitation route followed by a microwave heating process, for controllable synthesis of cobalt-free lithium-excess layered compounds is reported. A series of the consistent results unambiguously confirms that oxygen atoms are successively incorporated into the precursor obtained by a coprecipitation process to maintain electroneutrality and to provide the coordination sites for inserted Li ions and transition metal cations via a high-temperature lithiation. It is found that the electrochemical performances of the cathode materials are strongly related to the phase composition and preparation procedure. The monoclinic layered Li[Li0.2Ni0.2Mn0.6]O-2 cathode materials with state-of-the-art electrochemical performance and comparably high discharge capacities of 171 mAh g(-1) at 10 C are obtained by microwave annealing at 750 degrees C for 2 h.									65	1	0	0	1	0	65			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000459313500008

Among various hydrogen production methods, water electrolysis is a sustainable approach to gain pure hydrogen in useful amounts, but its use is still limited by the lack of efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts. Here, a convenient and straightforward mechanical alloying (MA) process is reported that can be used to produce heterostructured catalysts with good performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A NiTiO3/Ni hybrid was reconstructed, which was always considered to be an average HER catalyst,viathe ball milling of TiO(2)with Ni powder in a vacuum. The resulting material exhibits an ultra-low overpotential of similar to 10 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)(eta(10)) with a Tafel slope of similar to 31 mV dec(-1), and maintains its stability after running for 200 h in 1 M KOH. In addition, catalysts produced by directly ball milling NiTiO(3)with Ni, Co, or Fe powder also delivered high performance with eta(10)values of similar to 13 mV, 27 mV, and 50 mV, respectively. The enhanced properties are attributed to the introduction of oxygen vacancies into NiTiO(3)and the heterostructures producedviaMA, which fully utilize the potential of NiTiO(3)to accelerate water dissociation for the HER in basic media. Because MA is a mature industrial technique, this approach is promising for large-scale applications. The versatile strategy might also benefit and promote the exploration of catalysts for use in other important electrocatalytic fields.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000555361700005

This myoglobin is a monomer carrying one protoheme group; the molecular mass was estimated by SDS-PAGE to be about 40 kDa, 2.5 times larger than that of usual myoglobin. The cDNA-derived amino acid sequence of 375 residues was determined, of which 327 residues were identified directly by chemical sequencing of internal peptides. The amino acid sequence of Turbo myoglobin showed no significant homology with any other usual 16-kDa globins, but showed 36% identity with the myoglobin from Sulculus diversicolor (Haliotiidae) and 27% identity with human indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, a tryptophan-degrading enzyme containing heme. Thus, the Turbo myoglobin can be counted among the myoglobins which evolved from the same ancestor as that of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. The absorbance ratio of gamma to CT maximum (gamma/CT) of Turbo metmyoglobin was 17.8, indicating that this myoglobin probably possesses a histidine residue near the sixth coordination position of heme iron. The Turbo myoglobin binds oxygen reversibly. Its oxygen equilibrium properties are similar to those of Sulculus myoglobin, giving P-50 = 3.5 mm Hg at pH 7.4 and 20 degrees C. The pH dependence of autoxidation of Turbo oxymyoglobin was quite different from that of mammalian myoglobin, suggesting a unique protein folding around the heme cavity of Turbo myoglobin. A kinetic analysis of autoxidation indicates that the amino acid residue with pK(a) = 5.4 is involved in the reaction. The autoxidation reaction was enhanced markedly at pH 7.6, but not at pH 5.5 and 6.3 in the presence of tryptophan. We suggest that a noncatalytic binding site for tryptophan, in which several dissociation groups with pK(a) greater than or equal to 7.6 are involved, remains in Turbo myoglobin as a relic of molecular evolution.									15	0	0	0	13	0	15			0277-8033			WOS:000078226100010	9988528

Here we review the mechanism behind the CISS effect and its implication for processes in Biology. Specifically, three processes are discussed: long-range electron transfer, spin effects on the oxidation of water, and enantioselectivity in bio-recognition events. These phenomena imply that chirality and spin may play several important roles in biology, which have not been considered so far.									131	3	0	0	24	0	131			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000389318100005	27734046

Non-precious electrocatalysts for efficient and durable hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) are of paramount significance. Herein, we report that the heterostructured nitrides composites that are made of poor HER electrocatalysts of Ni3N and VN show remarkable activity and durability for HER in a neutral medium. Ni3N-VN composite rivals the state-of-the-art Pt/C electrocatalyst, requiring an overpotential of only 85 mV to deliver a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M phosphate-buffered saline. The HER kinetics are significantly promoted in comparison with Ni3N and VN, showing 6-17 times higher current densities and lowered Tafel slopes (73 mV decade for Ni3N-VN and >120 mV decade(-1) for Ni3N and VN). The promoted kinetics is ascribed to the interfacial heterostructures, where the electronic structures are tailored for optimal hydrogen absorption and promoted water adsorption and dissociation. This research demonstrates a powerful interfacial engineering strategy in promoting the sluggish kinetics of nitrides for HER in a neutral medium, which deserves further attention to electrocatalysts in other reactions.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000742853700003

In this study, we have designed a superior bifunctional catalyst for OER and HER in alkaline media based on the Co-Mo-P/Zn-Co-S multicomponent heterostructure. The as-prepared multicomponent heterostructure was successfully obtained via a simple three-step hydrothermal-sulfidation-electrodeposition process consisting of star-like Co-Zn-S covered with Co-Mo-P. The structure and morphology evaluation of the prepared catalysts were performed via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and elemental mapping techniques. The electrochemical tests show that Co-Mo-P/Co-Zn-S exhibits outstanding activity toward both OER and HER with OER overpotentials of 273 mV and 312 mV to drive the benchmark current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1). In addition, the HER overpotentials of 120 mV and 165 mV were required to reach the benchmark current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a Tafel slope of 61.7 mV dec(-1) that outperforms most other state-of-the-art catalysts. In the case of HER, the prepared catalyst required an overpotential of 202 mV to reach the current density of 200 mA cm(-2) that was much lower than the overpotential of Pt/C (286 mV) to achieve the same current density. Co-Mo-P/Co-Zn-S also exhibits a suitable stability length of 10 h for OER and HER during the chronoamperometric tests. The superior performance of the Co-Mo-P/Co-Zn-S multicomponent heterostructure toward OER and HER may be related to the large specific surface area, accelerated mass and electron transport, and synergistic effect of multiple hybrid materials. These merits suggest that Co-Mo-P/Co-Zn-S can be considered as a promising catalyst for bi-functional OER and HER, and can be offered a great promise for future applications.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000708115200001	34661211

It has been frequently stressed, however, that these methods often cannot bring about complete mineralization of several compounds, and to this end various methods broadly classified as AOPs (Advanced Oxidation Processes) provide complementary and alternative means of environment remediation, as outlined in comprehensive recent surveys. These AO systems include ozone, hydrogen peroxide as well as a mixture of them called "Peroxone" which can be activated by Fenton reactions leading to formation of a large amount of OH radicals and, consequently, to a highly oxidizing environment. In this work we investigate incineration of some phenolic compounds (4-chlorophenol, 4-nitrophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, trans-3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid) and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) using different electrochemical systems involving ozone formation at PbO2 based anodes: (1) direct electrolysis at constant current; (2) ex-situ use of O-3 and (3) combined use of anodically generated O-3 and H2O2 produced at a graphite cathode. According to the results described in this work, what we called direct electrolysis actually turns out to be a mediated process by oxygenated radical intermediates. Subsequently, the active oxygen intermediates can react with the organic pollutants. The homogeneous chemical decomposition by ozone is the basis of the ex-situ methods. It involves the direct reaction of O-3 with the organic substrate and/or a radical chain reaction initiated by radicals formed in the reaction of O-3 with OH- or with HO2-. The latter pathway is favoured by an increase of the pH. The examination of the results shows that the combined use of anodically generated O-3 and H2O2 produced at cathode is the most efficient approach.

Study of the hydrogen peroxide reduction at silver rotating-disc electrodes in alkaline NaF/NaOH electrolytes has proved the existence of a slow chemical step in the reaction mechanism, its rate being strongly affected by the submonolayer surface oxidation.

It possesses large surface areas leading to sufficient exposed electrochemical active sites. Meanwhile, its moderate graphitization degree and suitable nanosized hierarchical porosity distributions would lead to the sufficient interaction between O-2 and the electrocatalyst surface which would benefit the transports of electrons and the electrolyte ions for ORR. As an electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction, the ZNC-1000 presents a better catalytic property than the commercial Pt/C with 6/1 mV positive shifts for onset/half-wave potentials and 1.567 mA cm(-2) larger for limiting current density respectively. The stability of ZNC-1000 is also much better than that of Pt/C with negative shifts of 0/-2 mV (vs 5/31 mV) for onset/half-wave potentials and 6.0% vs 29.2% loss of limiting current density after 5000 cycles of accelerated durability test, as well as the relative current of 87.5% vs 40.2% retention after 30,000 s continuous chronoamperometric operation.									21	1	0	0	2	0	21			2045-2322			WOS:000424743500079	29434228

In this study, N-doped carbon@ CoN/Cu3N/copper foam (namely, NC@CoN/Cu3N/CF) nanoarrays with a hollow tubular structure have been successfully synthesized through a facile method. The as-produced NC@CoN/Cu3N/CF with a 3D hierarchical structure was highly beneficial for electrocatalysis; it displayed improved electrical conductivity, abundant exposed active catalytic sites, numerous highways for charge transport and synergistic effect of each component. The enhanced characteristics resulted in largely improved kinetics and activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The NC@CoN/Cu3N/CF electrode exhibited low overpotentials of 303 mV to reach a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for OER and 134 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER in an alkaline solution. Furthermore, as an electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, NC@CoN/Cu3N/CF served as both the anode and cathode, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a quite low cell voltage of 1.62 V, and it displayed excellent long-term stability (15 h at 20 mA cm(-2)). This study provides a rational strategy and approach to fabricate transition metal nitrides with 3D hierarchical structures as efficient electrocatalysts in renewable energy applications.									20	2	0	0	2	0	22			2052-1553			WOS:000453914100022

N-CSs are directly synthesized from polybenzoxazine (PBz) by carbonization followed by KOH activation. PBz was prepared from eugenol, melamine, and paraformaldehyde through ring-opening polymerization. FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy confirmed the corresponding chemical structures of the new benzoxazine monomer. The morphology, structure and surface properties of the N-CSs are investigated by Raman spectroscopy, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The catalytic activity of N-CSs towards HER is thoroughly investigated by electrochemical techniques. In N-CSs, it is established that nitrogen gratified electrocatalytic activity, and hence nitrogen atoms should enhance the electrocatalytic properties by increasing the active sites. As the kinetic current is stabilized by the outer nitrogen atom as such, HER is proposed to proceed on these active sites by the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. The N-CSs show outstanding catalytic activity towards HER with lowest onset-potential (-10 mV(RHE)) and Tafel slope (45 mV dec(-1)) in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte.

Measurements of the redox state of Q(A) were performed using chlorophyll fluorescence. Cells of Scenedesmus obliquus were grown in the dark to obtain PS II lacking the oxygen-evolving complex. Growth in the light leads to photoactivation. The midpoint potential of Q(A) was shifted, upon photoactivation, from + 110 mV to - 80 mV. In cells of a low-fluorescence mutant, LF1, that is unable to assemble the oxygen-evolving complex but that has an otherwise normal PS II, the higher potential form of Q(A) was found. NH2OH treatment of spinach FS II, which releases the Mn and thus inactivates the oxygen-evolving complex, causes an upshift of the redox potential of Q(A) (Krieger and Weis (1992) Photosynthetica 27, 89-98). Oxygen evolution can be reconstituted by incubation in the light in the presence of MnCl2, and CaCl2. Such photoactivation caused the midpoint potential of Q(A), to be shifted back from around +55 mV to lower potentials (- 80 mV), typical for active PS II. The above results indicate that the state of the donor side of PS II has a direct influence on the properties of the acceptor side. It is suggested that the change from the high- to the low-potential form of Q(A) may represent a mechanism for protection of PS II during the assembly of the O-2-evolving enzyme.									159	0	2	0	127	0	163			0005-2728	1879-2650		WOS:A1995QV74500009

The reaction can be carried out at a total pressure up to 1 atm, a regime that has not been accessible to comparable in situ techniques and thus closes the pressure gap to many industrial standard conditions. Two alternate catalyst geometries were tested: (A) a thin film evaporated directly onto an x-ray transparent membrane with a flowing reaction gas mixture behind it or (B) a powder placed behind both the membrane and a gap of flowing reaction gas mixture. To illustrate the working principle and feasibility of our reaction cell setup we have chosen ethylene epoxidation over a silver catalyst as a test case. The evolution of incorporated oxygen species was monitored by total electron/fluorescence yield O K-XAS as well as O K-RIXS, which is a powerful method to separate contributions from inequivalent sites. We find that our method can reliably detect transient species that exist during catalytic reaction conditions that are hardly accessible using other spectroscopic methods.

However, their self-stacking leads to limited active sites and low conductivity. In this work, a three-dimensional (3D) core-shell architecture with spatially separated active sites has been fabricated based on layered ternary nickel cobalt iron hydroxide (NiCoFe-LTH) nanosheets and cobalt iron Prussian blue analog (CoFe-PBA) on nickel foam (NF) (i.e., CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF) with CoFe-PBA as self-sacrificial templates that are partially in situ transformed into NiCoFe-LTH nanosheets. The CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF has a well-defined core-shell 3D flower-like nanostructure in which NiCoFe-LTH nanosheets create the larger shell while CoFe-PBA nanocubes form the small core. This hybrid structure is evaluated as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and found to exhibit a low overpotential of 228mV at 10mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 36mV dec(-1), and good catalytic stability for 72 h in 1.0 M alkaline solution. The strong performance is attributed to the unique 3D core-shell flower-like nanosheet architecture that avoids the stacking of the 2D LTH, provides abundant spatially separated active sites, and enhances electron transport and stability. Furthermore, the OER mechanism and growth process of the electrocatalysts were systematically studied. These results suggest that such electrocatalysts with unique architecture are promising for efficient and durable OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0003-6951	1077-3118		WOS:000691612100002

The obtained CdS/NC@Mo2N composites show greatly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen generation abilities. Among all studied samples, CdS/5% NC@Mo2N exhibited the optimal photocatalytic activity, owning a H-2-production rate of 7294 mu mol h(-1)g(-1) and showing an apparent quantum yield of 13.7%, which are almost five times higher than for the pure CdS. Moreover, through introducing the co-catalyst NC@Mo2N, the composites become more stable under a long term photocatalytic reaction as compared to pure CdS. The improved photocatalytic capability of the CdS/NC@Mo2N is mainly ascribed to the following two reasons: (1) Mo2N supplies abundant active sites for the water-spitting reaction and lowers the overpotential. (2) The nitrogen-doped carbon matrix promotes charge transfer and greatly enhances the conductivity of the composites. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J	Ma, Zhong; Zeng, Dewang; Zhang, Shuai; Xiao, Rui								Effect of Supports on the Redox Performance of NiFe2O4 in a Chemical Looping Process								ENERGY TECHNOLOGY				7	9					1900374	10.1002/ente.201900374				SEP 2019	2019	NiFe2O4 oxygen carrier (OC) presents higher oxygen carrying capacity than single metal oxides (NiO and Fe2O3). However, the redox ability of NiFe2O4 gets deactivated due to phase segregation. Herein, the investigation of the effect of supports (CeO2, CeZrO2, and ZrO2) on the phase stability and the redox performance of NiFe2O4 during the chemical looping (CL) process are presented. The structure of NiFe2O4-based OCs is characterized using different characterization methods. The CL reaction is conducted in a fixed-bed reactor at 900 degrees C under alternate 5% CO/N-2 and 5% O-2/N-2 atmospheres. The results indicate that the redox performance and the phase stability of NiFe2O4-based OCs are significantly affected by the supports. According to experimental results, CeO2 can improve the oxygen mobility of NiFe2O4. The CeO2-NiFe2O4 OC has the best performance in terms of both recyclability and phase stability during the redox cycles. The results show that CeO2-NiFe2O4 can reduce the tendency of Fe segregation due to the high concentration of oxygen vacancies. It can be reduced and reoxidized to the original crystalline phase of NiFe2O4. Nevertheless, the CeZrO2-NiFe2O4 and ZrO2-NiFe2O4 OCs have drawbacks related to serious sintering and phase segregation into Fe2O3.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000483721900008

Herein, we have investigated the mechanism of CO2 electroreduction to HCOOH on the Pb(111) surface using density functional theory calculations. We find that the effects of solvation and cations lead to different active intermediates for CO2 electroreduction (HCOO in gas-phase condition, both HCOO and COOH in solvent condition, and COOH in cation solution). In particular, the size and hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature of the cations are found to significantly affect the reaction selectivity and efficiency of CO2 electroreduction at different overpotentials. These findings rationalize several experimental observations and contribute to a thorough understanding of CO2 electroreduction.									29	3	0	0	2	0	29			1932-7447			WOS:000411171800024

The evolution of morphology and microstructure of the coating during ablation is investigated and the ablation mechanism is proposed. Results show that the coating shows an outstanding ablation resistance. After ablation, three distinct regions (central, transitional and outer ablation region) can be detected on the coating surface. In the former two regions, four layers can be divided from the cross-section of the ablated coating. Both molten HfO2 and HfCxOy could act as oxygen diffusion barrier during ablation.

Interface modulation between metal and supports is an attractive strategy to improve oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Therefore, the design of electrocatalysts via interface modulation would provide new opportunities for the ECL amplification involving reactive oxygen species (ROSs). Herein, we have fabricated an Ag single-atom catalyst with an oxygen-bridged interface (Ag-O-Co) through the electrodeposition of Ag on a CoAl layered double hydroxide (LDH) modified indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode (Ag-s/LDH/ITO). Interestingly, it was found that the cathodic ECL intensity of the luminol-dissolved O-2 system at the Ag-s/LDH/ITO electrode was extraordinarily enhanced in comparison with those at bare ITO and other Ag nanoparticle-based electrodes. The enhanced ECL performances of the Ag-s/LDH/ITO electrode were attributed to the increasing amounts of ROSs by electrocatalytic ORR in the Ag-O-Co interface. The electron redistribution of Ag and Co bimetallic sites could accelerate electron transfer, promote the adsorption of O-2 and sufficiently activate O-2 through a four-electron reaction pathway. Finally, the luminol cathodic ECL intensity was greatly improved. Our findings can provide inspiration for revealing the interface effects between metal and supports, and open up a new avenue to improve the luminol cathodic ECL.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000779948100032	35274939

Although many metal oxides have been investigated for the encapsulation of MNPs, ceria (CeO2) has received significant attention due to its unique properties, such as being highly stable, low-cost, and capability of producing active oxygen. Its specific electronic configuration makes it a unique material for oxygen production. Depending on the application, different methods for encapsulating MNPs by CeO2 have been developed. The current review presents the various fabrication methods used to date for encapsulating MNPs by CeO2 nanoshells, as well as their catalytic applications, with an emphasis on defect chemistry and oxygen storage capacity. The review begins with an overview and discussion of the synthetic methods for encapsulating MNPs in CeO2 before moving on to the electrocatalytic applications of CeO2- encapsulated MNPs. Finally, the conclusion summarizes the review and addresses current research challenges and future research development opportunities in this field.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1387-7003	1879-0259		WOS:000840717600003

Based on UV-vis DRS, in-situ FTIR and XPS results, it was revealed that BA would be efficiently chemisorbed and activated on ZnTi-LDH forming the surface coordination species, which contributed to harvesting visible light and induced the photocatalytic reaction. The ESR spectra suggested that oxygen vacancies would be produced in ZnTi-LDHs after the adsorption of BA molecules. More exposed surface OH groups would induce more oxygen vacancies, which would serve as the centers for capturing photoelectrons from the photoexcited surface coordination species and act as active sites for enhanced O-2 adsorption and activation, resulting outstanding photocatalytic activity. Finally, a possible mechanism was proposed to illustrate the photocatalytic process which mediated by surface coordination species formed by the interaction between ZnTi-LDH and BA.									65	3	0	0	4	0	66			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000496894300056

In moderate iron deficiency, the decrease in actual photosystem II efficiency under illumination was related to closure of photosystem II reaction centers, whereas in severe iron deficiency it was associated to decreases of intrinsic photosystem II efficiency. The O-2 evolution, on an absorbed light basis, decreased more than the actual photosystem II efficiency, suggesting the presence of a significant fraction of electron transport to molecular oxygen or the existence of some form of cyclic electron flow. Iron-deficient leaves reduced the excess of light absorbed that cannot be used in photosynthesis not only by decreasing absorptance, but also by dissipating a large part of the light absorbed by the photosystem II antenna. This mechanism, that protects the photosystem II reaction centers through the enhancement of energy dissipation, was related to the de-epoxidation of violaxanthin (V) to antheraxanthin (A) and zeaxanthin (Z) in iron-deficient leaves. These data provide additional support for a role of Z+A in photoprotection under conditions of excess photosynthetic light absorption.									63	2	0	0	55	0	65			0310-7841			WOS:000074645400001

While the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been suggested to be responsible for this phenomenon, the mechanistic origin has not been clearly explained. Herein, we investigate the potential-dependent competition between NRR and HER using the constant electrode potential model and microkinetic modeling. We find that the H coverage and N-2 coverage crossover leads to the premature decrease of NRR activity. The coverage crossover originates from the larger charge transfer in H+ adsorption than N-2 adsorption. The larger charge transfer in H+ adsorption, which potentially leads to the coverage crossover, is a general phenomenon seen in various heterogeneous catalysts, posing a fundamental challenge to realize practical electrochemical NRR. We suggest several strategies to overcome the challenge based on the present understandings. Practical electrochemical N-2 reduction reaction is challenged by competing side reactions. Here a combination of DFT and mikrokinetic modelling reveals the potential-dependent competition between electrochemical ammonia production and hydrogen evolution on a single-site iron catalyst embedded in N-doped graphene.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			2041-1723			WOS:000677489800006	34272379

Herein, a one-dimensional TiO2 array photoanode was sheathed with an ultrathin overlayer of phosphated nickel-chromium double-metal hydroxide by a photoassisted modification and deposition strategy. The core/shell array photoanode resulted in a large cathodic shift of photocurrent onset potential (approximate to 200mV). Nearly 100% oxidative efficiency for PEC water oxidation was achieved over a wide range of potential. Mechanism studies show that the modification of phosphate leads to significantly improved charge separation. The amorphous hydroxide sheath could efficiently inhibit oxygen reduction reactions. Therefore, this strategy enables the simultaneous suppression of surface carrier recombination and back reactions, which is promising to improve the water oxidation efficiency of currently prevailing photoanodes.									84	7	0	0	3	0	87			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000354365000007	25711390

Three-dimensional porous copper foam (Cuf) when electrochemically decorated with transition metal selenide results in a highly active electrocatalyst for adequate water electrolysis. In terms of water splitting, the role of cobalt selenide and Cuf has already proven to be remarkable. The introduction of a Ni buffer layer between Cuf and cobalt selenide (Cuf@Ni-CoSe2) acts as a valve to enhance the electron thrust from the substrate to the material surface with no compromise in the overall material conductivity, which not only increases the efficiency and activity but also improves the stability of the catalyst. The self-supported synthesized catalyst material showed an admirable activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline media. The performance of the catalyst was found to be significantly better than that of the noble catalyst RuO2. The catalyst was very stable up to 93 h and attained a full cell voltage of only 1.52 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Therefore, for large-scale hydrogen production, this as-synthesized catalyst hss the potential to replace conventional fossil fuel-based energy systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000874833200001	35943819

The atomic percentage of nitrogen and sulfur for the prepared N-S-G can be adjusted by controlling the pyrolysis temperature. Furthermore, the catalyst pyrolysed at 1000 degrees C, denoted N-S-G 1000, exhibits the highest catalytic activity for ORR, which displays the highest content of graphitic-N and thiophene-S among all the pyrolysed samples. The electrocatalytic performance of N-S-G 1000 is significantly better than that of PAMTa and reduced graphite oxide composite. Remarkably, the N-S-G 1000 catalyst is comparable with Pt/C in terms of the onset and half-wave potentials, and displays larger kinetic limiting current density and better methanol tolerance and stability than Pt/C for ORR in an alkaline medium.									27	0	0	0	3	0	29			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000343750700031	25255312

Compared to DI water, PAW owns distinctly higher diffusion coefficient and electron transfer rate constant for electrochemical reactions. In this work, we discuss the more efficient oxygen (or hydrogen) evolution reaction (OER or HER) performed in PAW solutions, as compared to DI water solutions, in different concentrations of electrolytes at different applied potentials. Basically, the higher recorded currents based on PAW solutions are more significant when experiments are performed in lower concentrations of electrolytes and at lower applied overpotentials. Interestingly, the increased current density in percentage for OERs and HERS performed in PAW solutions compared to experiments performed in DI water solutions is less significant as the applied overpotential is increased. These interesting findings suggest that utilizing PAW with higher diffusion coefficient and electron transfer rate constant for more efficient electrochemical reactions is suitable in well diffusion- and kinetics-controlled systems. Also, in the Randles-Sevcik reaction, using the PAW solution takes more advantages in a lower concentration of K3Fe(CN)(6) at a lower scan rate. This innovative concept has emerged as a promising strategy for effectively utilizing PAW in electrochemical reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000467664700015

Such a nanohybrid as an electrocatalyst shows high catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in O-2-saturated 0.1 m KOH media. In addition, it demonstrates a comparable catalytic activity, longer working stability, and much better alcohol tolerance compared with commercial Pt/C behavior in same experiment condition. The obtained results are attributed to synergistic effects from the enhanced electrocatalytic active sites on the rich pore channels of porous hollow-structured LaNiO3 spheres and heteroatom doped efficiency on graphene structure. In addition, N,S-Gr can meritoriously stabilize monodispersion of the LaNiO3 spheres, and act as medium bridging for high electrical conductivity, thereby providing large active surface area for O-2 adsorption, accelerating reduction reaction, and improving electrochemical stability.

J	Hederos, S; Baltzer, L								Nucleophile selectivity in the acyl transfer reaction of a designed enzyme								BIOPOLYMERS				79	6			292	299		10.1002/bip.20351				DEC 15 2005	2005	The acyl transfer reaction of S-glutathionyl benzoate (GSB) is catalyzed by a rationally designed mutant of human glutathione transferase Al-1, A216H. The catalyzed reaction proceeds via the formation of an acyl intermediate and has been studied in the presence of nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur nucleophiles to determine the selectivity with regards to nucleophile structure. Methanol was previously shown to react with the acyl intermediate and form the corresponding ester, methylbenzoate, under a significant rate enhancement. In the present investigation, the dependence on nucleophile structure and reactivity has been investigated. Ethane thiol gave rise to a larger rate enhancement in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction than ethanol, whereas ethylamine did not increase the reaction rate. The reactivities toward the acyl intermediate of primary and secondary alcohols with similar pK(alpha) values depended on the structure of the aliphatic chain, and 1-propanol was the most efficient alcohol. The reactivity of the oxygen nucleophiles was also found to depend strongly on pK(alpha) as 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, with a pK(alpha) of 12.4, was the most efficient nucleophile of all that were tested. Saturation kinetics was observed in the case of 1-propanol, indicating a second binding site in the active site of A216H. The nucleophile selectivity of A216H provides the knowledge base needed for the further reengineering of A216H towards alternative substrate specificities. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Au nanoparticles of 2.2-2.4 nm with narrow particle size deviation ( +/- 0.6-0.7 nm) were monodispersed on the SnO2 substrates. Au/SnO2 interfacial structures with structurally defined oxide substrate and comparable Au particle size and morphology were accomplished. The systems achieved made it possible to study the distinct interfaces in catalytic benzene combustion and methanol oxidation. H-2 TPR, O-2 TPD, and XPS characterizations revealed that the specific Au-SnO2 interaction has a strong effect on the reactivity of surface and bulk lattice oxygen, the oxidation state of surface Sn atoms, and the sort and relative concentration of surface oxygen adspecies. The Au/SnO2 {110) and Au/SnO2 {101) interfaces favor selective oxidation of methanol, whereas Au/SnO2 {111) enhances total oxidation of both benzene and methanol. These interfacial structures were rather stable in both reactions. Through structural analysis of SnO2 facets, the evolution of active oxygen species and the possible reaction pathways of benzene combustion have been proposed. The involved reaction pathways are notably influenced by the specific Au/SnO2 interfacial structure and the nature of the reactant molecule, as well as the reaction temperature. The current study gained insight into the significance of specific Au/SnO2 facets determining the catalytic activity of benzene and methanol oxidation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In addition to the high sensitivity, the tunability of the laser source allows to deeper investigate the photoinduced reactions taking place under deep-UV illumination. Under these conditions, nitrate ions decompose into oxygen and nitrite through different reaction pathways. Analysis of the evolution of nitrate and nitrite Raman modes as a function of the excitation wavelength allows for estimating the photo-energy dependent quantum yield of the photolysis process. The results highlight the limits and capabilities of deep UV Raman as a on-line nitrate and nitrite monitoring method.

The Co/C catalyst with a thin-layer overcoating of TiO2 (ALD(TiO2)-Co/C) demonstrated 2.5 times higher turnover frequency (TOF) than the Co/C catalyst for the reaction. The TOF of the ALD(TiO2)-Co/C catalyst increased when the ALD(TiO2) coating cycle number was increased from 5 to 60. In addition, the stability of the 60 cycle ALD(TiO2)-Co/C catalyst was enhanced compared to the Co/C catalyst. This work shows how the ALD synthesis technique can be used to improve the catalytic activity and stability of nonprecious-metal-based catalysts like Co/C for electrochemical water oxidation.									42	3	0	0	2	0	43			2155-5435			WOS:000355964300034

Successive ion adsorption and reaction (SILAR) is applied to decorate an electrochemically formed TiO2 nanotube electrode. The anodic photo electrochemical behavior of pure TiO2-NT's and modified electrodes are investigated in a sulfate containing solution at pH =9.2. It is shown that such a modification leads to an increase of anodic photoactivity, as well as that at the same current density, the photoelectrochemical cell with a modified electrode operates at a voltage lower by 0.7 V. The band gap and flat band potentials are estimated, and the structure of the band gap and possible charge transfer reactions and mechanism are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Mi et al. Nano Lett., 2011, 11 (6), pp 2353-2357]. In the present paper we report a theoretical investigation on the dissociation process of water molecules on wurtzite GaN (100) surface (M-Plane) using the density functional theory (DFT). We calculated the structure and energetic of the water adsorption, reaction barrier energies and pathway for water dissociation. The results suggest that the adsorption of H2O is more favorable near Gallium atoms than near Nitrogen atoms and we determined the likely binding sites of water molecules on GaN (100) surface. We also analyzed a model for hydrogen evolution reaction on GaN (100) that involves three steps, where a water molecule first dissociates into a hydrogen atom plus the OH group, followed by the dissociation of the hydroxyl group, and finally the two hydrogen atoms recombine to form molecular hydrogen. For these reactions, the atomic positions and the reaction barriers were determined.

Herein, the photocatalytic properties of anisotropic beta-PtX2 (X = S, Se) and Janus beta-PtSSe monolayers were investigated based on the density functional theory. The small cleavage energy for beta-PtS2 (0.44 J m(-2)) and beta-PtSe2 (0.40 J m(-2)) endorses the possibility of mechanical exfoliation from their respective layered bulk materials. The calculated results revealed that the beta-PtX2 monolayers have an appropriate bandgap (similar to 1.8-2.6 eV) enclosing the water redox potential, light absorption coefficient (similar to 104 cm(-1)), and exciton binding energy (similar to 0.5-0.7 eV), which facilitates excellent visible-light-driven photocatalytic performance. Remarkably, the inherent structural anisotropy leads to an anisotropic high carrier mobility (up to similar to 5 x 10(3) cm(2) V-1 S-1), leading to a fast transport of photogenerated carriers. Notably, the required small external potential to realize hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction processes with an excellent solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency for beta-PtSe2 (similar to 16%) and beta-PtSSe (similar to 18%) makes them promising candidates for solar water splitting applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000853099000001	36098214

However, it is limited by the sluggish reaction kinetics and high energy barrier. These shortcomings necessitate the construction of 1D nanocatalysts with abundant catalytically active sites, high electrical conductivity, and easy tunable composition. Electrospinning has been demonstrated to be the most promising strategy for the fabrication of well-defined 1D nanostructures since it is highly efficient, ecofriendly, and economical. Herein, a comprehensive review regarding the design and development of advanced electrospun nanomaterials for electrocatalytic reactions has been summarized.

The cyclic voltammetric results show that benzyl alcohol oxidation is mediated by perruthenate ion electrogenerated at the electrode surface. Evaluation of kinetic parameters in relation to Tafel lines allows the postulation of a plausible reaction scheme in which benzyl alcohol adsorbs on the RuO2 electrode surface and the rate determining step is chemical reaction between perruthenate and adsorbed species. The reaction orders with respect to benzyl alcohol and OH- concentrations are 0.85 and 1, respectively. The results in galvanostatic electrolysis show that the major product for benzyl alcohol oxidation in an aqueous solution is benzaldehyde, and the organic yield is affected by such electrolysis conditions as t-butanol concentration, electrolysis current density, KOH concentration and electrolysis temperature.									37	1	0	0	3	2	38			0021-891X			WOS:A1995QB09500012

However, some latest reports have demonstrated that the chemical driving force can also govern electrocatalytic water splitting. This finding provides a transformative approach to designing advanced energy materials, which calls for a thorough understanding of the underlying correlation between the chemical driving force and the corresponding water splitting performance. This review timely summarizes chemical driving force in three different scenarios. Effects of chemical driving forces on surface reconstruction, reaction rate/mechanism, and interfacial redox reactions are discussed. Finally, an outlook on the chemical driving force is provided. We aim to raise the energy community's awareness of this new vision and hope it could contribute to material design for energy storage and conversion applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2567-3173		WOS:000865848600001

The assembly of surfactant micelles on Co nanochains plays a key role in the formation of mesoporous Pt layers. The evolution of the mesoporous Pt layers is carefully studied at different time intervals. As the reaction time increases, the mesoporous Pt layers become thicker, and well-defined mesoporous structures gradually develop. The obtained mesoporous Pt skin exhibits high activity and superior CO tolerance in the electro-oxidation reaction of methanol. The mesoporous Pt skin also shows very high durability, and only a 20.2% loss of the Pt electrochemical surface area is found even after a harsh durability test.									31	3	0	0	0	0	32			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000332747400004	24615950

Reasonably reducing CO2 in the atmosphere has become a new research hotspot. Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers an appealing strategy to reduce the atmospheric CO2 concentration and to produce value-added chemicals simultaneously. In this paper, two-dimensional (2D) N-decorated graphene (NG)-supported bimetallic trimers (Fe2M@NG) were designed as triple-atom catalysts (TACs). Theoretical calculations showed that Fe2M@NG can effectively activate CO2, and among the 23 TACs examined, Fe2Ir@NG not only has a good catalytic activity for CO2RR (limiting potential is 0.49 V for CH4 formation) but also limits the competing side reaction of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Our theoretical study not only further extends the triple-atom catalysts, but also opens a new door to boost the sustainable CO2 conversion.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2470-1343			WOS:000812813900001	35571807

Loading water oxidation cocatalyst can effectively improve water oxidation performance. It is challenging to efficiently load water oxidation cocatalyst on photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water oxidation. In this work, CoOx was loaded on BiVO4 by a facile spin coating and calcination method. The photocurrent of the as-prepared CoOx/BiVO4 photoanode reached 2.73 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs RHE, which is comparable to that of CoOx/BiVO4 photoanode prepared using other methods. The H-2 and O-2 production reach 130.8 and 61.9 mu mol respectively in 3 h test. All experiment results show that the improved photocurrent could be ascribed to enhanced charge separation efficiency and charge injection efficiency.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000647792400012

The shape change in cyclic voltammograms recorded at a carbon-paste electrode with decamethylferrocene in NPOE also indicates a (electro)catalytic reaction. Hydrogen peroxide was electrochemically detected at a Pt microelectrode tip positioned next to the carbon-paste electrode.

Oxidation of iron at 1123K using CO-CO2-O2 gas mixtures								Report of the Research Laboratory of Engineering Materials, Tokyo Institute of Technology					10			13	24						1985	1985	Iron has been quickly inserted into the pre-heated furnace and oxidized. When the sample temperature reaches the alpha-gamma transition point of iron, the sample temperature increases abruptly by sime100K in air, whereas that is negligibly small in CO2. The temperature increase is caused by the rapid heat evolution by the direct reaction between oxygen and iron, which is permitted by cracks in the thin oxide layer formed during the heating period. Iron has been oxidized at 1123K under various oxygen partial pressures. The oxidation kinetics obey the linear rate law in the two pressure ranges: one is the range where a single phase of wustite is formed and the other is the range where two phases of wustite and magnetite are the oxidation products. The oxidation rates are controlled by the phase boundary reactions at the wustite/gas interface and at the magnetite/gas interface in the respective pressure ranges. The rate constant of the reaction in the latter range is greater than that in the former range. The rate constant is independent of oxygen pressure in both ranges. The kinetics obey the parabolic rate law in the pressure range where three phases of wustite, magnetite and hematite are formed. The oxidation process is governed by the diffusion of iron in wustite layer.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0385-3799			INSPEC:2536498

The prepared Nf/g-C3N4/AuAg NHs were characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), absorption spectroscopy, high resolution transmission electron spectroscopy (HRTEM), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive Xray spectrophotometer (SEM-EDX), SEM-EDX elemental mapping, SEM-EDX lines scan spectra and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques. The absorption spectra of Nf/g-C3N4/AuAg NHs showed the characteristic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption band for AuAg alloy NPs and was found in between the wavelength regions of the monometal NPs (Au and Ag NPs). The bimetal alloy formation was confirmed from the observation of single SPR absorption band and further a blue shifting in the SPR band was observed with increasing Ag content in the g-C3N4 /AuAg NHs. The HRTEM images explicitly demonstrated the formation of Au, Ag and alloy AuAg NPs on g-C3N4 surface where the size of the bimetal AuAg NPs are found to be smaller than the corresponding monometals (Au and Ag NPs). The electrochemical characteristics of bimetal AuAg NPs at the Nf/g-C3N4/Au, Nf/ g-C3N4/Ag and Nf/g-C3N4/AuAg NHs modified electrodes were studied using cyclic voltammetry. The combination of Nf/g-C3N4 and bimetal AuAg alloy NPs enhanced the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction at the modified electrode. The GC/Nf/g-C3N4/Au75A825 modified electrode showed the highest catalytic current among the other controlled NI-Is materials towards the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction in alkaline medium. The Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plots obtained from the modified RDE studies showed four-electron transfer of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the GC/Nf/g-C3N4/Au75Ag25 modified electrode.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000490046000045

Various doped alpha-MnO2 based electrocatalysts were prepared by microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis and electrochemically characterized to validate density functional theory (DFT) based predictions of the oxidation state and local structure effects on the catalytic activity of alpha-MnO2 catalysts in ORR. Both theory and experiments conclude that the highest activity in ORR is to be expected in the case of clustered Mn3+ sites which yield activity comparable with that of the polycrystalline Pt. These active sites have to be formed under in-operando conditions and their formation is hindered in doped alpha-MnO2 catalysts. The activity of the other conceivable active sites based on non-clustered Mn3+ or Mn4+ is inferior to that of clustered Mn3+. The activation of Mn3+ or Mn4+ based active sites leads to a shift in selectivity of the ORR process towards 2 electron formation of hydrogen peroxide. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

One mass loss stage around 140 degrees C ascribed to the polymerization of glyceraldehyde to intermediates is slightly influenced by the atmospheres. Another two main mass loss stages termed as the decomposition of produced intermediate and the sequent combustion of char residue was notably enhanced by the increased oxygen concentration. Two multi-step kinetic models considering the complex consecutive and competitive reactions are proposed to describe the decomposition process of glyceraldehyde under oxidative atmospheres. The acceptable fitting performance between experimental and calculated data can be obtained for both two kinetic models.

We have experimentally mimicked starting points in this process by introducing primitive iron and oxygen binding sites at various locations in thioredoxin, a small protein lacking metal centers, by using computational design. These rudimentary active sites show emerging enzymatic activities that select to varying degrees between different oxygen chemistries. Even within these nascent enzymes, mechanisms by which different reactions are controlled can be discerned. These involve both stabilizing and destabilizing interactions imposed on the metal center by the surrounding protein matrix.									99	1	0	0	68	0	103			0027-8424			WOS:000087526300014	10841535

Herein, a novel top-down strategy involving the in situ transformation of one-dimensional MoO3 nanorod arrays grafted with two-dimensional NiS nanosheets supported on a three-dimensional nickel foam skeleton is proposed. Namely, a heterostructured electrocatalyst on the Ni foam skeleton containing MoO3 nanorod arrays decorated with NiS nanosheets is synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method followed by one-step sulfidation treatment. Experimental analysis confirmed that this novel composite has the merits of a large quantity of accessible active sites, unique distribution of three different spatial dimensions, accelerated mass/electron transfer, and the synergistic effect of its components, resulting in impressive electrocatalytic properties toward the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, an advanced water-splitting electrolyzer was assembled with NiS/MoO3/NF as both the anodic and cathodic working electrode. This device requires a low cell voltage of 1.56 V to afford a water-splitting current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) in basic electrolyte, outperforming previously reported electrocatalysts and even state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. More significantly, this work provides a way to revolutionize the design of heterostructured electrocatalysts for the large-scale commercial production of hydrogen using direct water-splitting devices.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000585977000032	33104135

Although many analytical models describing the photocurrent-voltage response of these devices exist, they have difficulty to reproduce full numerical simulations under small anodic bias. Herein, we derived an analytic model of a weakly absorbing n-type semiconductor/electrolyte interface with a slow rate of water oxidation reaction, fast recombination rate, and under small anodic bias. Excellent overlap of our model was demonstrated with full numerical simulations. The analytic model enabled us to derive an equation for impedance of the semiconductor/electrolyte interface in the dark and under illumination. The comparison of analytic and measured impedance allows to extract the reaction rate for redox reaction from the dark impedance and the direct bulk recombination constant of the semiconductor from the impedance under illumination.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000508467700003

Although this compound is always specified as an intermediate in the light-production reaction, this is the first report of its identification by HPLC in a luciferase assay medium. Under a low-oxygen atmosphere, luciferase can catalyze the synthesis of luciferyl coenzyme A from luciferin, ATP, and coenzyme A, but in air dehydroluciferyl coenzyme A was produced. The luciferase-catalyzed synthesis of these coenzyme A derivatives may be a consequence of the postulated recent evolutionary origin of firefly luciferases from an ancestral acyl-coenzyme A synthetase.									36	1	0	0	27	0	38			1439-4227	1439-7633		WOS:000189182600014	14695520

A high Pt loading is often required to achieve a practical power density in fuel cells, thus leading to high costs and limited applications. Meanwhile, the high Pt loading promotes aggregation during cycling under harsh electrocatalytic conditions, which reduces the surface area of the catalyst and leads to a decrease in catalytic activity. The formation of alloy or intermetallic nanocrystals via the addition of non-precious metals along with precious metals is one strategy to effectively reduce the cost. Due to the electronic and geometric effects introduced by the non-precious metals, the catalytic performance of these bimetallic nanocrystals can be retained or even improved. Compared to the metallic alloy nanocrystals, the intermetallic ones are more stable in critical catalytic conditions. Due to their highly ordered structures, Pt-based intermetallic nanocrystals are widely used as electrode materials for various electrocatalytic reactions in fuel cells, and they show high stability against oxidation and etching. PtCo intermetallic nanocrystals have attained performances that exceed the 2020 target of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for Pt activity and stability for the cathode reaction of fuel cells (oxygen reduction reaction). Decreasing the size of intermetallic compounds to the nanometer scale can significantly increase their active site densities due to the large specific surface area. However, the preparation of intermetallic nanocrystals is more complicated than that of alloys. Therefore, to further improve the electrocatalytic properties of intermetallic nanocrystals, an in-depth study of the factors affecting the electrocatalytic properties of nanocrystals is necessary. This review summarizes recent advances in Pt-based intermetallic nanocrystals. First, we highlight the controlled synthesis strategies, including direct liquid-phase synthesis, the thermal annealing approach, and chemical vapor deposition. Of these strategies, direct liquid-phase synthesis is the most common approach to prepare the intermetallic nanocrystals. Second, the diverse potential applications of different electrocatalytic reactions are summarized. The reactions include the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), as well as the oxidation reactions of formic acid (FAOR), methanol (MOR), and ethanol (EtOR). Of these reactions, ORR is the most important, and it has been widely studied. Some advanced characterization techniques and machine learning research based on density functional theory (DFT) are also mentioned. Finally, the challenges and the future perspectives of intermetallic nanocrystals are outlined.									20	7	0	0	0	0	19			1000-6818			WOS:000572421800014

Deprotonation of the amine group of Glyphosate studied by XPS and DFT								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				567						150753	10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.150753		AUG 2021		NOV 30 2021	2021	Glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, C3H8NO5P) in aqueous solutions undergoes three deprotonation reactions generally assigned to the carboxylate oxygen (pKa1 - 2.2), the phosphonate oxygen (pKa2 - 5.5), and the amine group (pKa3 - 10.2). A couple of recent studies (J. Phys. Chem. A 2015, 119, 5241-5249 and J. Phys. Chem. B 2016, 120, 2132-2137), however, have put forward a new sequence in which the amine group deprotonates before the phosphonate oxygen. In this study we present experimental and theoretical data with the aim of resolving the controversy over the order of the last two deprotonations. On the experimental side, we analysed the evolution of the N1s photoemission spectrum with the pH of the aqueous solution, finding conclusive evidence that the last deprotonation occurs at the amine group. On the theoretical side, we compared the stabilities of several configurations for each glyphosate moiety, finding again that the last group that undergoes deprotonation is the amine group.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000691175700004

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as a promising technique to provide conformal and ultrathin coating for LIB materials. In this work, an iron oxide (FeOx) ALD was performed on LiMn1.Ni-5(0).O-5(4) (LMNO) cathode particles, followed by an annealing process. Fe was doped into LMNO during the ALD process; and it was found that lattice oxygen loss and structural change of LMNO occurred at a reaction temperature of 450 degrees C under vacuum. Meanwhile, Fe diffused from the surface to the bulk of LMNO. After post-annealing, FeOx-coated LMNO recovered its structure and lattice oxygen under proper annealing conditions, and exhibited significant enhancement of specific capacity, rate capability, and cyclic stability.

This differs from previous studies that considered precious metals to be responsible for the catalytic reaction in precious alloys. Intermetallic AuCu3/C nanoparticles with a diameter of 3 nm were developed for the first time, with uniform dispersion and a narrow size distribution. The ca. 3 nm as-synthesised AuCu3/C showed superior catalytic performance for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in alkaline solutions, with comparable half-wave potential and 1.5 times mass current density of commercial Pt/C at 0.80 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)). The advanced catalytic activities are mainly attributed to the synergetic effects of electro-active atomic Au and Cu on the particle surface, in which Cu helps to activate the O-2 molecule and Au benefits OH- desorption. The excellent durability and methanol tolerance exhibited in alkaline solutions provide another advantage for AuCu3/C to be considered as a potential alternative cathode catalyst in alkaline fuel cells.									51	2	0	0	2	1	51			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000338992900020	24678060

Following this, BiVO4 particles are converted from the BiOI-(V species) precursors by annealing. However, it is challenging to evenly distribute vanadium species among the BiOI flakes. As a result, the conversion reaction to form BiVO4 does not proceed simultaneously and uniformly. To address this limitation, in Step 2, we developed a new electrochemical deposition method that allowed the even distribution of V2O5 among Bi-O-I flakes to enhance the conversion reaction uniformly. Furthermore, when lactic acid was added to the electrodeposition bath solution, BiVO4 crystals with an increased (040) peak intensity of the X-ray diffractometer (XRD) pattern were obtained. The photocurrent of the BiVO4 photoanode was 2.2 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under solar simulated light of 100 mW/cm(2) illumination. The Faradaic efficiency of oxygen evolution was close to 100%. In addition, overall water splitting was performed using a Ru/SrTiO3:Rh-BiVO4 photocatalyst sheet prepared by the BiVO4 synthesis method. The corresponding hydrogen and oxygen were produced in a 2:1 stoichiometric ratio under visible light irradiation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2073-4344		WOS:000610021400001

The interface structure represents a model system for field effect transistors with a SiO2 dielectric layer. Electrical bias was applied across the interfaces of cross sectional TEM samples using a scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) tip. Atomic structure modifications of the dielectric layer due to the applied electrical field were observed by this in situ STM-TEM technique. Constant bias (+5.0 V) and ramped bias (+3.0 to +10.5 V) stresses applied to the CoSi2 gate electrode resulted in a loss in capacitance of the dielectric layer consistent with descriptions of soft dielectric breakdown (SBD) and hard dielectric breakdown (HBD). It was found that SBD events are characterized by fluctuations within uniform current step increase of 21 nA and increased roughness of the SiO2 film due to oxygen vacancy percolation. HBD, however, was found to be preceded by multiple SBD events between +6.5V and +10 V, cobalt atom migration into the dielectric layer, partial crystallization of the amorphous gate dielectric (dielectric breakdown induced epitaxy), and significant diffusion of oxygen from the SiO2 layer into the silicon substrate through a reduction-oxidation reaction of the Si/SiO2 interface. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of in situ STM-TEM experiments for studying time-dependent dielectric breakdown behaviors to obtain a direct correlation of individual defect structures and their corresponding electrical signatures. Experimental limitations of this new technique are critically discussed. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

The PS-II-membrane-coated electrode produced an anodic steady-state current under illumination that was attributable to a PS II reaction with DMQ as an electron-transfer mediator between the PS II and the electrode. The magnitude of the steady-state photocurrent depended upon the applied potential, the intensity of the illumination, the amount of DMQ mixed in the carbon paste electrode and the amount of immobilized PS II membranes. The DMQ-mediated photoelectrochemical behavior could be described by an equation of the steady-state kinetics of the PS-II reaction linked to the electrode reaction of DMQ. 2-Methylbenzoquinone, tetramethylbenzoquinone and phenylbenzoquinone, which are sparingly soluble or practically insoluble in aqueous solution, also worked as the mediators when mixed in the carbon paste electrodes.									13	1	0	0	3	0	14			0022-0728			WOS:A1993MP83800007

The surface of each pole of the bipolar electrode may contain redox active functional groups that generate misleading or interfering electrochemical responses. Herein, a 4-electrode CBPEC configuration was studied with the opposite poles of the bipolar electrode resting in separate aqueous and organic electrolyte solutions. Using gold mesh wire electrodes as the poles, we systematically investigated the many experimental variables that influence the observed voltammetry upon addition of a reductant (decamethylferrocene) to the organic phase. External bias of the driving electrodes forced electrons released by decamethylferrocene at the organic pole to flow along the bipolar electrode and reduce redox active surface functional groups at the aqueous pole, such as oxide or hydroxide groups, or carry out the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The 4-electrode CBPEC configuration diminishes capacitive currents, permitting observation of voltammetric signals from electron transfer processes related to surface functional groups at the aqueous pole at much lower scan rates than possible with working electrodes in conventional 3-electrode electrochemical cells. Surface modification, by oxidative or reductive electrochemical pre-treatment, changes the potential window experienced by the aqueous pole in the 4-electrode CBPEC in terms of its position versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) and dynamic range. In a related observation, the electrochemical responses from the surface functional groups on the aqueous pole completely disappear after oxidative pre-treatment, but remain after reductive pre-treatment. The flow of electrons from decamethylferrocene to the surface of the aqueous pole is limited in magnitude, by the decamethylferrocene concentration, and kinetically limited, due to decamethylferrocene diffusion to the organic pole, in comparison to the infinite supply of electrons delivered to the surface of a working electrode in a 3-electrode cell. This unique feature of the 4-electrode CBPEC facilitates a very gradual evolution of the surface chemistry at the aqueous pole, for example from fully oxidised after oxidative pre-treatment to a more reduced state after repetitive cyclic voltammetry cycling. Perspective applications of this slow, controlled release of electrons to the electrode surface include spectroelectrochemical analysis of intermediate states for the reduction of metal salts to nanoparticles, or conversion of CO2 to reduced products at catalytic sites. The use of indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes in CBPEC experiments for specific reactions is recommended to avoid misleading or interfering electrochemical responses from redox active functional groups prevalent on metallic surfaces. However, the electronic bridge to implement entirely depends on the reaction under study, as ITO also has drawbacks such as a lack of electrocatalytic activity and the requirement of an overpotential due to its semiconducting nature.

The results show that Cu-upd has a strong inhibiting effect on both the ORR and the HOR. The deactivation is linked to an enhanced anion adsorption on platinum atoms adjacent to Cu-upd atoms. This mechanism explains the anomalously large inhibition by a very small amount of Cu-upd. The ORR on Cu-upd-modified electrodes proceeds mostly as a 4e(-) reaction pathway with negligible solution phase peroxide formation, ca. 3%. The physical model that appears to realize this result is one in which the active sites for the adsorption of molecular O-2 are a small number of platinum islands which are created when desorption of anions takes place from Cu-upd-unmodified platinum sites. The same sites are also active centers for the HOR.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			0743-7463			WOS:000168100700020

In 1 m KOH, to reach the current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, it only needs 252 and 370 mV overpotentials, respectively, beyond commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. At the high current density, it also presents outstanding electrochemical stability. Then the electrolyzer apparatus assembled with Ru-CoOx/NF, just requires the ultra-low voltage of 2.2 and 2.62 V to support the current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) in alkaline water and seawater electrolysis, respectively, for hydrogen production, better than that of the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. This work demonstrates that Ru-CoOx/NF is one of the most promising catalysts for industrial applications and provides a possibility for exploration of high-current-density water electrocatalysis by changing the crystallinity of the catalyst.									46	2	0	0	0	0	47			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000684431700001	34390190

To simplify the overall synthesis by combining consecutive reaction steps, the concept of a molecular assembly line promises to yield high reaction rates and selectivities. In this study, mixtures of carbon nanotube (CNT)-supported catalysts were used to demonstrate the potential of this concept on hand of the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene via aniline to cyclohexylamine. Mixtures of Pt/CNT, having a high activity in nitrobenzene hydrogenation, and of Ru/CNT, highly selective for the hydrogenation of aniline to cyclohexylamine, provided high activity at constant high selectivity. Varying the Pt:Ru ratio to 5:95 was found to be the best case scenario, for which the rates of the two consecutive reaction steps are balanced. The use of catalyst mixtures rather than bimetallic catalysts avoids complex phenomena such as phase separation or migration of one of the metals to the surface of the bimetallic particles.									8	1	0	0	1	0	8			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000370029900011

Bell, Alexis/0000-0002-5738-4645			An Investigation of Thin-Film Ni-Fe Oxide Catalysts for the Electrochemical Evolution of Oxygen								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				135	33			12329	12337		10.1021/ja405351s				AUG 21 2013	2013	A detailed investigation has been carried out of the structure and electrochemical activity of electrodeposited Ni-Fe films for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes. Ni-Fe films with a bulk and surface composition of 40% Fe exhibit OER activities that are roughly 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of a freshly deposited Ni film and about 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of an Fe film. The freshly deposited Ni film increases in activity by as much as 20-fold during exposure to the electrolyte (KOH); however, all films containing Fe are stable as deposited. The oxidation of Ni(OH)(2) to NiOOH in Ni films occurs at potentials below the onset of the OER. Incorporation of Fe into the film increases the potential at which Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH redox occurs and decreases the average oxidation state of Ni in NiOOH. The Tafel slope (40 mV dec(-1)) and reaction order in OH- (1) for the mixed Ni-Fe films (containing up to 95% Fe) are the same as those for aged Ni films. In situ Raman spectra acquired in 0.1 M KOH at OER potentials show two bands characteristic of NiOOH. The relative intensities of these bands vary with Fe content, indicating a change in the local environment of Ni-O. Similar changes in the relative intensities of the bands and an increase in OER activity are observed when pure Ni films are aged. These observations suggest that the OER is catalyzed by Ni in Ni-Fe films and that the presence of Fe alters the redox properties of Ni, causing a positive shift in the potential at which Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH redox occurs, a decrease in the average oxidation state of the Ni sites, and a concurrent increase in the activity of Ni cations for the OER.									1638	72	0	0	110	0	1651			0002-7863			WOS:000323536100031	23859025

Detailed geochemical characterisation and sediment incubation experiments identified pyrite (20-100%), sedimentary organic matter (SOM; 3-56%), siderite (3-28%) and Fe(II)-aluminosilicates (8-55%) as the main O-2 reductants. Trace-levels of carbonate acted as a pH buffer, while a lower boundary pH of 3 indicated acid buffering by K-feldspar dissolution. The processes identified were used to formulate a kinetic reaction modelling framework that was able to reproduce (i) the observed, transient O-2 consumption and CO2 production (ii) the major ion composition at completion, and (iii) the observed trace metal releases in each of the treatments. The experiments showed that the approach was useful for identifying and quantifying key geochemical reactions that affect the water quality evolution in artificially recharged anoxic aquifers.					13th International Symposium on Water-Rock Interaction (WRI)13th International Symposium on Water-Rock Interaction (WRI)	AUG 16-20, 2010AUG 16-20, 2010	Consejo Nacl Ciencia & Tecnologia; Centro Investigac Cientifica Educac Super Ensenada; Int Assoc GeoChemistry; WRI 7 USGS; Inst Mexicano Tecnologia Agua, Schlumberger Water Serv; Univ Guanajuato; Deutsche Gesell Tech Zusammenarbeit; Deutscher Akademischer AustauschdienstConsejo Nacl Ciencia & Tecnologia; Centro Investigac Cientifica Educac Super Ensenada; Int Assoc GeoChemistry; WRI 7 USGS; Inst Mexicano Tecnologia Agua, Schlumberger Water Serv; Univ Guanajuato; Deutsche Gesell Tech Zusammenarbeit; Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst	Guanajuato, MEXICOGuanajuato, MEXICO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4398-6299-5; 978-0-415-60426-0	WOS:000392008600088

Composites of transition-metal sulfides (TMSs) and nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) are promising alternative ORR catalysts because of their high catalytic activity. However, the agglomeration of TMS particles limits practical applications. Here, a confinement catalyst composed of Co9S8@NC with a flower-like morphology was derived from metanilic intercalated Co(OH)(2) through interlayer-confined carbonation accompanied with host-layer sulfidation. The surface of the Co9S8 particles is covered with a few layers of nitrogen-doped graphene, which can prevent the Co9S8 particles from agglomeration and also produce catalytic activity affected by internal Co9S8. Thus, the Co9S8@NC material achieves excellent ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.861 V-RHE. In addition, an oxide layer on the surface of Co9S8@NC is fabricated shortly after the ORR starts. Further tests and density functional theory calculations indicated that this cobalt oxide layer can increase the electrochemically active area of Co9S8@NC as well as reduce the ORR energy barrier, thereby providing more catalytic active sites and enhancing the intrinsic catalytic activity, thus achieving a self-activation effect during the electrochemical reaction process.									20	2	0	0	1	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000557854700029	32633487

Effects of oxygen carrier, temperature, CO2 concentration were evaluated and modeled. An experimentally-fitted function was used for expressing the char characteristics evolution. The red mud remarkably enhanced char gasification due to the fast consumption of CO. Thus, a simplified Langmuir-Hinshelwood equation by neglecting the influence of CO was applied for evaluating the intrinsic kinetics. A model coupling the kinetics of char gasification and mass transfers throughout and surrounding the whole char were established. A good agreement between modelling and experimental results was obtained. With the reaction progressing, the dynamic of concentration gradients suggested the mass transfer resistance within the char particle. The gradients increased until the carbon conversion was about 0.3, which was corresponding to the pore structure change.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000766453500002

The physico-chemical properties of electrodes were characterized through scanning electron spectroscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electrochemical measurements. SEM result showed that TiO2-O2NTs/Sb-SnO2 electrode has morphology of vertically sphere-stacking coralline. Compared with Ti/Sb-SnO2, TiO2-NTs/Sb-SnO2 electrode has smaller grain size and greater specific surface area which can provide with more active sites. Compared with Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrode, TiO2-NTs/Sb-SnO2 has a higher oxygen evolution potential and stronger phenol oxidation peak, indicating an improved catalytic activity for phenol degradation. The kinetic analysis of electrochemical phenol degradation showed that the first-order kinetics rate constant on TiO2-NTs/Sb-SnO2 electrode is 1.33 times as much as that on Ti/Sb-SnO2, confirming that the sphere-stacking Sb-SnO2 based on TiO2 nanotube has a good electrocatalytic activity.

Stellar Nucleosynthesis 50 Years after B2FH		EAS PUBLICATIONS SERIES		32				369	393		10.1051/eas:0832011				2008	2008	Galactic globular cluster (GC) stars exhibit abundance patterns which are not shared by their field counterparts, namely the well-documented C-N, O-Na and Mg-Al anticorrelations. Recent observations provided compelling evidence that these abundance anomalies were already present in the intracluster gas from which the presently observed stars formed. A widely held hypothesis is that the gas was polluted early in the history of the GC by material processes through H-burning at high temperature and then lost by stars more massive than the observed long-lived stars. However the "polluters" have not been unambiguously identified yet. Most studies have focused on AGB stars, but rotating massive stars present an interesting alternative. Here we critically analyse the pros and cons of both potential stellar polluters. We discuss the constraints that the observational data bring on stellar nucleosynthesis and hydrodynamics as well as on nuclear reaction rates and we try to answer to the following question: "Are GC ideal laboratories to test stellar nucleosynthesis and hydrodynamics?"					16th Summer School on Stellar Physics16th Summer School on Stellar Physics	DEC 04-08, 2006DEC 04-08, 2006	Ctr Natl Rech Sci; Paris ObservatCtr Natl Rech Sci; Paris Observat	Aussois, FRANCEAussois, FRANCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1633-4760		978-2-7598-0365-1	WOS:000262457000011

Only then do subsequent larger scale formulations proceed to detonation testing, which will be covered in this paper. Recent advances in characterization techniques have led to unparalleled precision in the characterization of early-time evolution of detonations. The new technique of photo-Doppler velocimetry (PDV) for the measurement of detonation pressure and velocity will be shared and compared with traditional fiber-optic detonation velocity and plate-dent calculation of detonation pressure. In particular, the role of aluminum in explosive formulations will be discussed. Recent developments led to the development of explosive formulations that result in reaction of aluminum very early in the detonation product expansion. This enhanced reaction leads to changes in the detonation velocity and pressure due to reaction of the aluminum with oxygen in the expanding gas products.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1940-087X			WOS:000372504100003	26966969

However, the structure reconstruction is limited to the shallow surface, not achieving full utilization of inner active components. Herein, the full bulk-structure reconstruction into highly active amorphorized cobalt-iron oxyhydroxide nanosheets through the electrochemical oxidation of the cobalt-iron phosphide precatalyst is reported. As confirmed by ex situ X-ray diffraction and photoelectron, Raman, and electron energy-loss spectroscopies, the phosphorus species leached from the phosphide provide etching effect, promoting the oxidation of residual cobalt-iron species for in-depth bulk amorphorization. The unique core-shell structure of amorphorized cobalt-iron oxyhydroxide nanosheets encapsulated by the carbon shell (denoted as Co0.8Fe0.2OOH @ C) is constructed to offer highly exposed abundant active sites and fast charge transfer capability. The excellence of the full structure reconstructed Co0.8Fe0.2OOH@C electrocatalysts is confirmed demonstrating greatly improved activity (low overpotentials of 254 and 292 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2)) and long-term durability (negligible activity decay for continuous operation of 15 days at 100 mA cm(-2)) for oxygen evolution reaction applications.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			2366-9608			WOS:000564417700001

The phase transition behaviors of LiCoO2 were investigated with various heating temperature and time. The rate of transition was directly proportional to the concentrations of reactant, and activation energy of reaction was around 6.76kcal/mol. When CoO(rock salt structure) was used as a starting material instead of Co3O4(spinel structure), layered structure of LiCoO2 was obtained at low temperature. In the case of LiNiO2, ,the transition from layered structure to rock salt structure occurred easily by disordering/ ordering reaction, but did not occur in LiCoO2. The difference in metal ion radii in LiCoO2 and LiNiO2 results in different behaviors of phase transitions.				출발원료로 Li2CO3, Co3O4와 NiO를 사용하여 고상반응법으로 LiMO2(M=Co,Ni)를 합성하였다.

In this work, a diamine-assisted synthesis of ultrathin Pt-Pd alloy nanosheets is developed. Wrinkled Pt-Pd nanosheets of different compositions, with a size of up to 2 mu m and a thickness of only 2 nm, can be obtained via a one-pot solvothermal method. With a systematic study of ligand generality, aliphatic terminal diamine, diethylenetriamine, and in situ formed dimethylamine are shown to play vital roles in the formation of nanosheets. The ultrathin nature and the presence of Pt provide the alloy nanosheets with enhanced catalytic activity towards electrocatalytic reactions. In particular, the freestanding Pd19Pt1 nanosheet delivers activities of 1.831 A mg(metal)(-1) at 0.330 V vs. RHE in the formic acid oxidation and 6.65 A mg(Pt)(-1) at 0.9 V vs. RHE in the oxygen reduction reaction, significantly better than those of the standard Pt/C. This new synthetic strategy opens up a facile route to synthesize ultrathin Pt-alloy nanosheets, and has great potential for future development of catalysts.									55	4	0	0	2	0	55			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000481578000013

The reaction is initiated at room temperature by feed stirring and produces off-stoichiometric ammonium fluorotitanate and ammonium fluoroferrate. The composition of the complexes depends on the admission of atmospheric oxygen. Iron(II) is responsible for the production of ammonium fluoroferrate with the perovskite structure; iron(III), for the production of complexes with the elpasolite structure. The thermal behavior of the latter, as well as that of ammonium fluorotitanate, is characterized by a reduction in the oxidation number of the metal due to the ammonium eliminated upon dissociation and by the formation of phases of variable composition.

The integration of an Fe dopant and amorphous interface into Co-MOF to improving the electrocatalytic performance of pristine MOFs (metal-organic frameworks) is demonstrated and the origin of the remarkable electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst is elucidated. The comprehensive characterization data of Fe@Co-MOFs illustrate that there is a crystallinity transition during the doping of Co-MOF, which increases the electron transfer rate of the material and ensures increased exposure of the ligand unsaturated active site on the surface, and modulates the electronic structure of the Co center in a synergistic manner. As a result, the optimized catalytic Fe@Co-MOF-3 with an amorphous structure exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance for the OER, with only 248 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability after 11 h of testing in alkaline solution.

Nevertheless, the extremely narrow bandgap of BP (<= 1. 5 eV) is detrimental for the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs that limits the photoreactivity. And the isolated BP suffers from the severe degradation upon long-term exposure due to PxOy species formed by the reaction between the lone pair electrons onto the BP surfaces and oxygen in ambient environment, then BP will gradually corrode in water through the formation of phosphoric acid. Therefore, the lower photoreactivity and instability of BP material restrict its industrial implementation. To overcome these obstacles , various effective strategies like creating a wide range of plasmonic hybrid nanostructures and mixed-dimensional heterojunctions have been developed. Herein, the recent progress on BP-based nanostructures through hybridization with dissimilar components like metals, semiconductors, carbon materials, etc. has been summarized and its applications in photocatalytic reactions such as water splitting for hydrogen evolution , organic pollutant removal , CO2 photoreduction and N-2 fixation have also been reviewed , together with the insights into the photocatalytic mechanism for the boosted photoreactivity and good recyclability. Lastly,the challenges and potential directions of BP-based nanostructures toward high-efficiency photocatalytic reactions are analyzed and provided.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1005-281X			WOS:000797375100003

Oxynitrides, oxysulfides, and oxyhalides that contain d(0) transition-metal or d(10) typical-metal cations have absorption bands in the visible-light region and band-edge potentials suitable for these reactions. In general, visible-light absorption by these materials arises from the p orbitals of anions that are less electronegative than oxygen, forming a valence band above the level of oxygen 2p orbitals. Less electronegative anions in mixed-anion compounds are essential for visible-light absorption but are inherently less stable than oxygen, potentially causing oxidative decomposition of the materials during photoreaction. More importantly, mixed-anion compounds are more difficult to synthesize than single-anion compounds like oxides, and reducing the density of defects that act as recombination centers for photogenerated charge carriers in the material remains challenging. There is therefore much room for improving the activities of mixed-anion photocatalysts. Herein, the development of mixed-anion materials for solar-to-fuel conversion over the past 10 years is highlighted with a focus on key milestones in research developments.									12	0	0	0	0	0	11			2367-198X			WOS:000587474200001

During the synchronous reduction/precipitation reaction between Co2+-oleylamine and NaHSe at the toluene-water interface, the hydrated Co-O and Co-Se clusters are generated and sequentially assemble under strong extrusion driven by the interfacial tension. Owing to the enriched vacancies on the lateral surfaces, the obtained loose and porous Co-Se NS presents low crystallinity. Moreover, electrons could spontaneously transfer from the CoCo LDH to the neighboring CoSex nanocrystallites due to the stronger electron-withdrawing capability of metallic CoSex, and thus more Co atoms in the CoCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) present a high oxidation state. This synergistic manipulation in the structure, component, and electron configuration of the Co-Se NS can increase the density of the OER active-sites, improve the electrical conductivity, and also offer a large accessible surface area and permeable channels for ion adsorption and transport. As a result, the resulting Co-Se NSs feature high catalytic activity towards OER, in particular a low onset potential of 1.48 V and an overpotential of only 290 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the Co-Se-2 NS, as well as good stability in an accelerated durability test. The strategy developed here provides a reliable and valid way to synthesize multicomponent NSs, and is able to be extended to other areas of application.									32	3	0	0	1	0	32			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000414349100019	29043351

Photoresponsive semiconductors play a key role in this field. In this work, we demonstrate visible light-responsive, mixed-valence, molybdenum oxide (MoO3-x, 0 <= x <= 1) thin films with oxygen vacancies that are electrochemically deposited in a period of seconds through an ammonium heptamolybdate electrolyte. XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, EPR, Raman, and electrochemical techniques (Linear Sweep Voltammetry, Chronoamperometry, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, Tafel analysis) have been utilized to characterize the MoO3-x films. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and the Mott-Schottky (MS) plot reveal that the as-deposited semiconductive MoO3-x film possesses an optical bandgap of similar to 2.53 eV and a flat band potential of similar to 0.40 eV, respectively. The MoO3-x films exhibit up to 152% electrocatalytic current improvement in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) upon illumination with visible light compared to in the dark. The superior electrocatalytic activity of the as-deposited MoO3-x films under illumination is attributed to the lower bandgap, lower overpotential, decreased electronic resistivity, and a smaller Tafel slope. Our experimental exploration suggests that MoO3-x can be potentially applied as an effective, low-cost electrode material for high-performance solar energy-assisted hydrogen fuel production.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000773093300001

Herein, we report an effective way to synthesize 1D Co-ZIF microfibers using an electrospinning method, where a zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF) with CoCl(2)6H(2)O was prepared as the precursor for electrospinning. The synthesized microfibers were labeled after their post-spinning processing temperature as Co-ZIF-RT (without annealing), Co-ZIF-350 (annealed at 350 degrees C in air and a N-2 atmosphere) and Co-ZIF-550 (annealed at 550 degrees C in air and a N-2 atmosphere). All five microfibers were evaluated for the first time in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) studies both in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH electrolytes. For the OER in 0.5 M H2SO4, Co-ZIF-550-N-2 delivered a superior activity and required an overpotential of 405 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope value of 281 mV dec(-1). For the OER in 1 M KOH, Co-ZIF-350-air gave better activity and required an overpotential of 370 mV and a lower Tafel slope value of 55 mV dec(-1). Fabricated materials showing promising activity for the OER both in acid and alkali implied that they can be adapted as a cost-efficient, cheaper alternative to commercially available IrO2/C electrocatalysts. Moreover, in the future, the same synthetic protocol can be easily extended to the fabrication of other active metals incorporating ZIFs and the zeolite derived networks can also be utilized for other energy related applications.									34	4	0	0	0	0	35			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000465404200010

This report explores a hard-template-assisted pyrolysis method to fabricate IrO2 electrocatalyst powders with hierarchically ordered porous structure. The effect of the calcination temperature on the pore structure and electrocatalytic property of periodically ordered macroporous IrO2 material is studied. XRD, BET, and SEM characterizations show that the templated IrO2 powders at 450 A degrees C exhibit the honeycomb array of macropores with cross-linking mesopores on the pore walls. The calcination temperature above 450 A degrees C will further lead to a growth of crystallite size and a loss of surface area. Once the calcination temperature exceeds 700 A degrees C that is higher than the glass-transition temperature of the SiO2 template, the ordered porous structures of IrO2 material are prohibited from the formation. The templated IrO2 at 450 A degrees C shows substantially reduced electrocatalytic overpotentials for the OER, i.e., the efficiency increases as compared with other samples treated at higher calcination temperatures. As compared with the untemplated IrO2 prepared by a simple pyrolysis method at 450 A degrees C, the 3-DOM IrO2 (450 A degrees C) exhibited more than 2 times enhancement in BET area, voltammetric charges, and OER activity. It clearly reveals the control effect of the pore structure on the surface catalytic properties of iridium oxide. The present method is effective in improving the utilization of precious metals.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000349321600015

The particle-in-box nanostructure was composed of N-doped graphene layer coated Fe-Ni alloy nanoparticles encapsulated within an N-doped carbon hollow nanobox. The nanobox serves as a nanoreactor with the reactant, water, and catalyst nanoparticles confined within for intimate contact and effective reaction. The particle-in-box nanostructure was created through a spatially confined pyrolysis process by taking polydopamine coated Ni-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2)center dot H2O nanocubes as the precursor, calcination of which leading to formation of an N-doped porous carbon shell from the carbonization of the polydopamine coating layer and formation of interior N-doped graphene layer coated Fe-Ni alloy nanoparticles from reduction of both iron and nickel ions and graphitization of the CN groups. The particle-in-box nanostructured catalyst exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activities, achieving overpotentials of 270 and 201 mV for the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively at 10 mA/cm(2), and thus is suitable of serving as a high performance bifunctional catalyst for the overall water splitting reaction, achieving a low full cell overpotential of 471 mV at 10 mA/cm(2). The excellent electrocatalytic activity may be attributed to the advantageous particle-in-box nanostructure offering confined and effective reaction environment and the synergistic effects resulting from the conductive, hollow, and porous carbon shell and the small size of the Fe-Ni alloy nanoparticle core and its N-doped graphene layer shell. This new nanostructure of particle-in-box is superior and advantageous for a wide range of applications, not only for electrocatalytical reactions but also for other heterogeneous reaction systems.									69	1	0	0	1	0	69			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000432604600057

Oxygen was found to be necessary for AN decomposition and H2O in the reactant gas enhanced the reaction between AN and O-2. The dependence of AN decomposition on contact time indicated that HCN, HNCO, NH3, and NO, behaved like intermediates. Temperature-programmed surface reaction of adsorbed AN revealed that H2O suppressed desorption of AN and lowered the temperature of N-2 evolution. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy revealed that AN was mostly converted to isocyanate (-NCO), which was probably converted to adsorbed NH3 by hydrolysis. N-2 was formed by the reaction of adsorbed NH3 and adsorbed nitrate or by oxidation of adsorbed NH3. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The heterostructure was formed by depositing around 200 nm thin layer of n-type alpha-Fe2O3 on a macro-porous silicon substrate with aluminium as a back contact. Por-Si was fabricated by electrochemical etching, and Fe2O3 was spin-coated on it. SEM image on surface of the por-Si sample confirmed a homogeneous macro-porous layer with Fe2O3 on the surface as well as inside the pores. Deposition of naturally n-type alpha-Fe2O3 onto p-type por-Si formed p-n junction reducing onset potential of water splitting. The fabricated photocatalyst heterostructure alpha-Fe2O3/por-Si/c-Si/Al was found to reduce the required bias of > 1.23 V in 0.1 M H2SO4 solution for both oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reaction. This was also confirmed from the Mott-Schottky plot of the fabricated heterostructure. The experimental results indicated that the problem of Fe2O3 as a photocatalyst in water splitting can be overcome with a reduced onset potential by incorporating it with a por-Si structure. Also, the fabricated "Al/c-Si/por-Si/alpha-Fe2O3" heterostructure showed good performance in low bias region (V < 0.8 V vs. V-RHE).					26th International Materials Research Congress (IMRC)26th International Materials Research Congress (IMRC)	AUG 20-25, 2017AUG 20-25, 2017	Soc Mexicana Mat; Mat Res SocSoc Mexicana Mat; Mat Res Soc	Cancun, MEXICOCancun, MEXICO	5	0	1	0	0	0	5			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000444200300027

A highly detailed soot formation reaction mechanism flowing through the reactor, involving 276 species, 2158 conventional gas phase reactions and 1635 surface phase reactions, was modeled as a plug flow reactor (PFR). The reaction temperature and pressure were varied in the range 1073-1873 K and 0.1-2 MPa. The effect of temperature on product concentration was more emphasized than that of pressure. The effect of O-2/CO2 input on product concentration was investigated. O-2 concentration was important in reducing PAHs at low temperature. Below 1473 K, an increase in the O-2 concentration decreased PAH and soot production. However, if the target of CO2 concentration was higher than 0.22 in mass fraction terms, temperatures above 1473 K reduced PAHs and increased CO. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, MoOx, was grown on the surface of lithium-rich material (LLO) via in situ hydrolysis deposition to ameliorate these problems. The surface of LLO was successfully coated with an amorphous MoOx modification layer, and a spine] phase was induced on the interlayer between the bulk material and the cladding layer, which was characterized by XRD, SEM, XPS and TEM. The Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2 modified with 3 wt% MoOx exhibits the excellent electrochemical performance. The material performs higher capacity retention of 85.8% with 224.2 mAh g(-1) compared with the pristine one which retains 75.1% with 187.4 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5 C (1 C = 250 mA g(-1)) and exhibits high rate performance of 192.0 mAh at 5 C. These outstanding electrochemical properties are attributed to the presence of oxygen vacancies in the MoOx that can effectively accommodate the oxygen from the Li2MnO3 during the first cycle of activation and promote oxygen reversible redox process. The MoOx coating layer can also eliminate side reactions on the surface of the material and maintain the integrity of the oxygen array. Furthermore, the 3d orbitals of lower oxidation state Mo in MoOx extend and partially overlap to form wide t(2g) bands, combined with the spinal phase possessing fast Li+ diffusion channels, which can significantly reduce the Li+ diffusion energy barrier and improve its rate performance.									17	3	0	0	0	0	17			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000452570300054

Nevertheless, some problems like sluggish kinetic reaction and instability hugely impede the practical use of Li-O-2 batteries. In this work, Mo2C/MoO2@RGO heterostructures was fabricated by in-situ growth of Mo2C between MoO2 and RGO during calcination and being employed as cathode to explore the synergistic effect in Li-O-2 batteries. As a result, Mo2C/MoO2@RGO exhibits good specific capacity with 2365 mAh g(-1), high round-trip efficiency (89% at first cycle) and improved cycling performance. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the Mo2C/MoO2@RGO heterostructures have better capability of oxygen adsorption than sole constituent (Mo2C@RGO or MoO2@RGO), which triggers the formation of film-like amorphous discharge products, leading to lower over-potential and stable performance. Our study reveals the important role of heterostructures in Li-O-2 batteries system and demonstrates a promising design strategy for heterostructured catalyst.									18	2	0	0	0	0	18			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000544260600006

The results showed that the photocatalytic H-2 production rate increased up to 8 times when the reaction temperature increased from 150 degrees C to 250 degrees C, demonstrating the significant influence of temperature on the photocatalytic activity. The UV-vis DRS, photocurrent response, EIS and Mott-Schottky results at different temperatures revealed that the heat can improve the absorption of visible light by narrowing the bandgap, increase the concentration of carriers, and promote the effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, thus resulting in the enhancement of photocatalytic performance. In addition, in situ FTIR analysis showed that the increase of temperature can accelerate the formation of surface peroxide hydrogen species and bridge hydroxyl groups to enhance the surface photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), improving the photocatalytic efficiency.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000857937900001

Consequently, the underlying molecular mechanisms and evolutionary steps remain elusive, especially in nonmodel systems. Here, we utilized the natural history of invasive parasites to document the molecular underpinnings of co-evolutionary trajectories. We applied a dual-species transcriptomics approach to experimental cross-infections of blue mussel Mytilus edulis hosts and their invasive parasitic copepods Mytilicola intestinalis from two invasion fronts in the Wadden Sea. We identified differentially regulated genes from an experimental infection contrast for hosts (infected vs. control) and a sympatry contrast (sympatric vs. allopatric combinations) for both hosts and parasites. The damage incurred by Mytilicola infection and the following immune response of the host were mainly reflected in cell division processes, wound healing, apoptosis and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, the functional coupling of host and parasite sympatry contrasts revealed the concerted regulation of chitin digestion by a Chitotriosidase 1 homolog in hosts with several cuticle proteins in the parasite. Together with the coupled regulation of ROS producers and antagonists, these genes represent candidates that mediate the different evolutionary trajectories within the parasite's invasion. The host-parasite combination-specific coupling of these effector mechanisms suggests that underlying recognition mechanisms create specificity and local adaptation. In this way, our study demonstrates the use of invasive species' natural history to elucidate molecular mechanisms of host-parasite co-evolution in the wild.									12	0	0	0	12	0	12			0962-1083	1365-294X		WOS:000430183100013	29453888

They are however known to be less stable than pure oxides and may lose nitrogen, in particular in the early stages of their operation. Under OER conditions, nitrogen vacancies are likely to be filled with oxygen, thus altering the stoichiometry of the surface. Here, we investigate, using density functional theory calculations, the effect of this substitution on the surface electronic structure and catalytic activity under OER conditions. We show that the investigated oxynitride SrNbO2N, due to the multivalent nature of the Nb cations, behaves differently than the related SrTaO2N. In particular, we show that under OER conditions, the substitution of N by O does enhance the reactivity, which is optimal around 3/4 substitution, given the ideal balance of excess charge injection and the suppression of O-N dimer formation. These results highlight the rich surface chemistry of oxynitrides, which strongly depends on the surface stoichiometry that represents a potential tuning knob for the activity of these materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000618526300022

Sulphur-oxygen co-doping could modulate the band structure of pristine g-C3N4, resulting in an absorption edge of up to 600 nm, which is well consistent with DFT calculation. Thus, its photocatalytic properties were enhanced.									25	1	0	0	3	0	25			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000400974000002

An optimized photocurrent density of 3.6 mA cm(-2) at 2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode is obtained in a sacrificial free electrolyte system (AM 1.5G 100 mW cm(-2)). Indoping increases the difficulty to form bonds between Bi atoms and O atoms in the crystal bulk. Thus, quasi-oxygen vacancies in the bulk of the BiVO4 crystal can be induced under anoxic annealing to increase the mobility, lifetime, and concentration of the photogenerated carriers. On the other hand, anoxic annealing can inhibit the conversion rate of the BiOI nanosheet arrays to BiVO4 to form a nanonet structure with a large surface reaction area. Therefore, through a simple In-doping and controlled anoxic annealing process, the photogenerated carriers and the nanomorphology of BiVO4 photoanode are synergistically optimized.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2168-0485			WOS:000543715400032

Using a gravimetric technique, uncatalyzed and Cu(II)-catalyzed rate constants for oxygen evolution and CIO- loss were measured and consolidated with previous results. Activation parameters of the uncatalyzed rate-limiting reactions to ClO2- and oxygen could be approximated as linear functions of ionic strength mu, allowing estimation of the respective rate constants k1 and k(o) at 40-70-degrees-C in the mu range 2-5. For Cu(II) catalysis at 40-70-degrees-C in the mu range 4.2-4.7, E(a), DELTAH(double dagger), and DELTAS(double dagger) values of 83 300 J g-mol-1, 80 550 J g-mol-1, and -14.6 J K-1 g-mol-1, respectively, were derived from previous and current results, allowing k(Cu) also to be estimated and used in the system of integrated equations.									24	0	0	0	6	0	24			0888-5885			WOS:A1994MX33900010

Herein, we prepared amorphous MoSx-encapsulated Co(OH)(2) nanosheets (aMoSx/Co(OH)(2) NSs) as strongly robust and active OER electrocatalysts via a three-step procedure: first, Co(OH)(2) nanosheets with catalytically active octahedral MO6 structures were synthesized by the hydrothermal process; second, violent ultrasonication was applied to exfoliate individual nanosheets from stacked Co(OH)(2) sheets and break them down into smaller sheets and attach MoS42- ions uniformly on the nanosheets; third, MoS42- ions were thermally decomposed into amorphous MoSx on the Co(OH)(2) nanosheets. The role of the incorporation of the amorphous MoSx nanostructure was to enhance the surface hydrophilicity for the availability of H2O and accelerate the electron transport capability for kinetic activities. Furthermore, the interaction between MoSx and Co(OH)(2) is proposed to induce electron transfer from amorphous MoSx to Co(OH)(2), which will promote the basic environment for cobalt sites, break the Co-O bond, favor the release of O-2 molecules, and thus enhance the OER process. Optimization of the Co/Mo molar ratio demonstrated that aMoSx/Co(OH)(2) NSs with the Co/Mo molar ratio of 8 had the best OER activity and delivered the overpotential of 350 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope of 65.4 mV dec(-1) in 0.1 M KOH. This study enriches the research on non-first-row (3d) metal incorporation for high-efficient OER catalysts and offers an alternative to noble metal catalysts.									49	0	0	0	1	0	49			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000415070100026

Smaller sizes of ZnO micro/nanoflowers were synthesized with different amounts of PVP as surfactant. Possible morphology evolution and formation mechanism of the flower-like micro/nanostructures were postulated. Concentrations of PVP in the reaction mixtures served as key role for morphology-controlled synthesis of ZnO as PVP can assist the oriented crystal growth during the synthesis. The as-synthesized ZnO samples prepared at 12.5 mg/mL PVP displayed higher photoactivity for the simultaneous degradation of methyl orange and methyl green mixtures. The photocatalytic tests also indicated that process parameters such as the initial dye concentration and solution pH exerted their individual influences on the dye mixtures degradation. Under determined experimental conditions, 94.1% chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of dye mixtures was attained after 240 min of reaction. The ZnO photocatalytic degradation of real textile wastewater was then evaluated and a lower COD removal efficiency (similar to 75%) was observed at similar treatment duration. Other real textile wastewater quality parameters of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), turbidity, total suspended solid (TSS), colour, ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N) and pH were also investigated.

Notably, the Ti-MOFs/NG nanocomposite has been for the first time investigated in detail, as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst of cathodic materials for fuel cells. The results show that the Ti-MOFs/NG nanocomposite possesses excellent ORR performances, whether in alkaline or acidic medium, due to existences of the Ti3N2-x, C2O7Ti2.3, H2Ti5O11, Ti and TiO active ORR segments. Specifically, the onset potential (E-0) and the Tafel slope value of the Ti-MOFs/NG nanocomposite are 1.14 V and 17.84 mV dec(-1) in 0.1 M HClO4, respectively. Similarly, high ORR efficiency of the Ti-MOFs/NG nanocomposite also exhibit in alkaline medium. The relative current density can still keep 99.88% of the original value after 10800 s measurements in 0.1 M KOH. Additionally, small electrochemical impedance and excellent tolerance toward fuel molecules have been exhibited in both electrolytes. These ORR properties are superior to those of most of previously reported materials derived from other MOFs, in both alkaline and acidic media. Thus, the Ti-MOFs/NG nanocomposite is as a novel promising candidate for ORR catalyst to solve the main problems of sluggish reaction kinetics of the ORR, high cost of precious metal catalysts and low durability of the traditional catalysts, applied to fuel cells, metal-air batteries and further to water splitting in energy conversion and storage devices.

However, there is still no simple method to construct a satisfactory structure of carbon-based catalysts with copious and well exposed active sites, rendering the development of such a method for tuning the structure of catalysts timely and ultimately relevant. Here, we apply a facile and universal solid-state reaction to fulfil structural manipulation of carbon-based catalysts by iron, and report the successful production of a series of catalysts with distinct structures, i.e. carbon nanotubes, 3D crumpled and porous graphene nanostructures, and densely stacked graphene nanosheets. As a direct consequence of the superior nanostructure of 3D crumpled and porous graphene with Fe and N doping at the surface (Fe-N-G), the Fe-N-G catalyst produced with a modest content of Fe precursor displays the most outstanding ORR activity, even superior to that of Pt/C catalysts, and holds substantial promise as a substitute for noble-metal-containing Pt/C catalysts. We demonstrate for the first time that Fe species can be used to effectively modulate the nanostructures of carbon materials, offering new insight into the synthesis and applications of carbon materials as nextgeneration noble-metal-free catalysts.									36	4	0	0	0	0	36			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000434624800030

Amorphous Co(OH)(2) nanosheet electrocatalyst and the physical mechanism for its high activity and long-term cycle stability								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				119	3					034902	10.1063/1.4940207				JAN 21 2016	2016	Good conductivity is conventionally considered as a typical reference standard in terms of selecting water electrolysis catalysts. Cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)(2)) has received extensive attention for its exceptional properties as a promising electrocatalysis catalyst. However, research on Co(OH)(2) so far prefers to its crystal phase instead of amorphous phase because the former generally exhibits better conductivity. Here, we have demonstrated that the amorphous Co(OH)(2) electrocatalyst synthesized via a simple, facile, green, and low-cost electrochemistry technique possesses high activity and long-term cycle stability in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The as-synthesized Co(OH)(2) electrode was found to be a promising electrocatalyst for mediating OER in alkaline media, as evidenced by the overpotential of 0.38V at a current density of 10mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 68mV dec(-1). The amorphous Co(OH)(2) also presented outstanding durability and its stability was just as well as that of crystalline Co(OH)(2). Generally, the integrated electrochemical performances of the amorphous Co(OH)(2) in the OER process were much superior to that of the crystalline Co(OH)(2) materials. We also established that the short-range order, i.e., nanophase, of amorphous Co(OH)(2) creates a lot of active sites for OER which can greatly promote the electrocatalysis performance of amorphous catalysts. These findings showed that the conventional understanding of selecting electrocatalysts with conductivity as a typical reference standard seems out of date for developing new catalysts at the nanometer, which actually open a door to applications of amorphous nanomaterials as an advanced electrocatalyst in the field of water oxidation.

However, the effectiveness of this approach rests on the strength of the relationships between calculated parameters and experimental measurements. These relationships are complicated by the intricacy and dynamic behaviour of catalytic active sites, and by the non-trivial relationship between calculated reaction energetics and observed rates. In this Perspective, we highlight opportunities to enhance the connection between computation and experiment in electrocatalysis. These include measuring the intrinsic kinetic behaviour of catalysts, creating precise models for the active site and its environment, and forming clear relationships between calculated reaction energetics and observed rates. As experimental and computational methods continue to become more powerful, clear connections between the two will maximize their utility to guide the design of efficient and selective electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2520-1158			WOS:000801852700007

Albeit the "pi back-donation" process enables N2RR activity on transition metals with empty d-orbitals, given its dilemma in overcoming hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) competition, exploring p-block-element. based catalysts with relatively inferior HER activity is achievable for high selectivity. The challenge lies in designing rational structure to improve N2RR activity. Here, we synergistically integrate oxygen vacancy (V-O) with hydroxyl on Bi4O5I2 (V-O-Bi4O5I2 -OH), which render this p-block-element-based material active to mimic "Tr back-donation" behavior because of sufficient vacant orbitals. In neutral media, the electrocatalytic N2RR performance of V-O-Bi4O5I2 -OH in terms of splendid faradic efficiency (32.4%) is superior to most of the prior reports using p-block-element-based catalysts. Our findings show a new strategy toward standout N2RR activity, which holds great potential in exploiting other p-block-element-based electrocatalysts.									54	3	0	0	0	0	55			2451-9294			WOS:000580615300015

We show that an active particle-active electrode can provide mechanistic insight into electrochemical reactions. When an individual Pt electrocatalyst adsorbs to the surface of a partially active electrode, further reduction of electrode-produced species can proceed on the nanocatalyst. Current transients obtained during hydrogen evolution allow simultaneous measurement of the Pt catalyst over different length scales, size dependency suggests H atom intercalation as a catalytic deactivation mechanism. Although results show that outer-sphere redox probes are unproductive for particle characterization, the breadth of inner-sphere electrochemical reactions makes this a promising method for understanding the properties of catalytic nanomaterials, one at a time.									10	0	0	0	1	0	9			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000563909800001	32745310

Traditional solution state cobalt insertion reactions into a free base porphyrinoid to generate the corresponding cobalt complex generally require fairly harsh conditions, involving the heating of the reactants in high-boiling solvents for extended period of times. We report here an alternative method of cobalt insertion: A solvent-free (at least for the insertion step) mechanochemical method using a planetary ball mill with Co-2(CO)(8) as a cobalt source. The scope and limits of the reaction were investigated with respect to the porphyrinic substrate susceptible to the reaction conditions, the influences of different grinding aids, and bases added. While the mechanochemical method is, like other metal insertion methods into porphyrinoids, not universally suitable for all substrates tested, it is faster, milder, and greener for several others, when compared to established solution-based methods.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000540914400027

For this, the current contribution reports the successful synthesis of binary/ternary metal ferrites (Co(x)Ni(1-x)Ferrite; x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1.0) by a simple one-step microwave technique and subsequently discusses its chemical and electrochemical properties. The X-ray diffraction analysis substantiated the phase purity of the as-obtained catalysts with various compositions. Additionally, the morphology of the nanoparticles was identified via transmission electron microscopy. Further, the vibrating sample magnetometer justified the ferromagnetic character of the as-prepared products. The electro-chemical measurements revealed that the as-prepared materials required the overpotentials of 422-600 and 419-467 mV for HER and OER, respectively, to afford current densities of 10 mA cm(-2). In the general sense, Ni cation substitution with Co influenced favorably toward both HER and OER. Among all synthesized electrocatalysts, Co(0.9)Ni(0.1)Ferrite displayed the highest performance in terms of OER in 1 M KOH solution, which is related to the synergistic effect of multiple parameters including the optimal substitution amount of Co, the highest Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, the smallest particle size among all samples (26.71 nm), and the lowest charge transfer resistance.

Various techniques including N2 adsorption/desorption, XRD, HRTEM, XPS, H2-TPR, CO2-TPD, O2-TPD, Raman, and thermogravimetric techniques were applied to study the structural evolution under the preparation/reaction conditions. The incorporation of metal elements distorted the lattice, the difference of interaction resulted in the differences of redox, oxygen activity, basicity and surface etc. properties. The catalytic conversion of ethane with CO2 exhibited dry reforming feature on Ni doped ceria because of the in situ formed metallic Ni0, and selective oxidation feature on Fe, Mn and Ti doped samples. The number and activity of lattice oxygen played the dominant role in affecting activity and selectivity. The solid solution catalysts revealed good coke resistance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000783072000006

However, the traditional oxygen electrode (La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta, LSCF) still faces insufficient activity for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction as well as instability due to Sr segregation. Herein, a simple strategy is adopted to improve the catalytic activity and stability by coating Pr2Ni0.8Cu0.2O4+delta (PNCO) layer onto LSCF oxygen electrode (PNCO-LSCF). The cell with PNCO-LSCF oxygen electrode achieves a maximum power density of 1.358 W/cm(2) at 750?, exhibiting a significant performance promotion compared with bare LSCF oxygen electrode (0.907 W/cm(2)) in fuel cell mode. The cell also presents a high electrolysis current density of 1.953 A/cm(2) at 1.5 V with 50% H2O at 750?, leads to a reduction of R-p from 0.141 omega center dot cm(2) to 0.105 omega center dot cm(2) after coating in electrolysis cell mode. Furthermore, PNCO-LSCF single cell exhibits long-term stability of 160 h under reversible operation mode without noticeable degradation. Therefore, coating LSCF with PNCO has been proven to be an effective method to achieve high performance. It also opens a door for the modification of the electrode in other fields such as metal air battery, water splitting etc.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000863286200004

Due to the collaborative contribution of alpha-PbO2 and PTFE, the stability of the Ti/SnO2-Sb/alpha-PbO2/Fe-beta-PbO2-PTFE electrode was found to be significantly improved. The oxygen evolution overpotential of the electrode was measured to be 1.95 V versus saturated calomel electrode (SCE). Also, the contact angle of the optimized superhydrophobic electrode reached 156.8 degrees. The optimized superhydrophobic electrode modified with PTFE exhibited lower charge-transfer resistance and good oxidative ability towards organics. The electrocatalytic activity of the devised electrodes was studied using methyl orange degradation. Factors affecting the decolorization of methyl orange were optimized. After 30 min of electrolysis, a maximum removal efficiency of 83% was achieved at a current density of 30 mA cm(-2) for an initial methyl orange concentration of 40 mg L-1 at pH 5. The results confirmed that the decolorization followed a first-order kinetics model. The color of the methyl orange solution changed from orange to colorless upon completion of the degradation reaction. Such superhydrophobic Ti/SnO2-Sb/alpha-PbO2/Fe-beta-PbO2-PTFE electrodes could effectively degrade organic pollutants under low voltages, which is of great significance for reducing energy consumption.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			0361-5235	1543-186X		WOS:000515822800013

Morphology engineering of graphene is now shown to modulate the electronic structure of carbon skeleton and in turn endow it with excellent ability of proton reduction. Three-dimensional (3D) graphene networks with a high density of sharp edge sites are synthesized. Electrocatalytic measurements indicate that the obtained 3D graphene networks can electrocatalyze H-2 evolution with an extremely low onset potential of about 18 mV in 0.5 m H2SO4 solution, together with good stability. A combination of control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) investigations indicates that the exceptional H-2 evolution performance is attributed to the abundant sharp edge sites of the advanced frameworks, which are responsible for promoting the adsorption and reduction of protons.									86	3	0	0	7	0	86			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000418798600019	29127743

A smaller steady-state current was observed in experiment as compared to that anticipated for a diffusion limited process. To facilitate physical insight into this system, a simulation model based on the Tafel-Volmer mechanism for the hydrogen oxidation reaction was developed. Under conditions of reversible electron transfer, the adsorption kinetics k(a) and k(d) are found to have distinctly different influences upon the voltammetry responses. Correspondence between the simulated and the experimental voltammograms is found, confirming the decrease of the steady-state current is caused by the slow adsorption process. The combined adsorption parameter k(a)Gamma(2)(max) on the Tafel-Volmer mechanism was approximately 5.0 x 10(-4) m s(-1), where Gamma(max) (mol m(-2)) is the maximum surface coverage of adsorption hydrogen atoms.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1932-7447			WOS:000358337700038

The composites were synthesized by easy and simple procedures by the reaction of Mn(II) and MnO4- in the presence of ND (1), the reaction of MnO4- and ND at different temperatures (2 and 4) and by the simple mixing of Mn-Ca oxide and ND (3). The compounds were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and atomic absorption spectroscopy. The water-oxidizing activities of these compounds were also considered in the presence of cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate. A Mn oxide/nanodiamond resulting from the reaction of MnO4- and ND shows a turnover frequency of similar to 1 (mmol O-2/mol Mn.s).

Proton transfer plays an integral role in the catalytic cycle of water oxidation by maintaining charge balance to regulate and ensure the efficiency of the process. The hydrogen-bonded amino-acid residues that surround the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) provide an efficient pathway for proton removal. Hence, it is crucial to identify these pathways to provide deeper insights into the proton-transfer mechanisms. In this study, we have used bicarbonate as a mobile exogenous proton-transfer reagent to recover the activity lost by site-directed mutations in order to identify amino-acid residues participating in the proton-transfer pathway. We find that bicarbonate restores efficient S-state cycling in D2-K317A PSII core complexes, but not in D1-D61A and CP43-R357K PSII core complexes, indicating that bicarbonate chemical rescue can be used to differentiate single-point mutations affecting the pathways of proton transfer from mutations that affect other aspects of the water-oxidation mechanism.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0005-2728	1879-2650		WOS:000480668900002	31247173

The electrodes were characterized using SEM, EDS, XRD, FT-IR, the oxygen evolution potential test and their electro-catalytic abilities were evaluated though nitenpyram degradation. XRD and FT-IR results showed that the structure of the electrodes were Sn-base sosoloid without Er and Sb phases. The Er3+ iron entering the unit cell of SnO2 (Sn4+) could cause the grain refinement, the surface enrichment of Sb and Er, stronger water absorbability, and higher anode potential. These consequently generated more active sites and less oxygen vacancies on the anode surface, leading the improving of the electro-catalytic performance. The grain refinement mechanism for Er doping may be ascribed to the increase of the surface composition supercooling, the acceleration of the SnO2 generation rate, and the restrain of its growth rate.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1022-6680			INSPEC:14175282

Earth-abundant transition-metal-based catalysts are gradually replacing precious metal catalysts due to the scarcity of noble metals and their high cost. Herein, we report a facile method to synthesize an efficient electrode containing NiOOH and CuO-Cu2O components for the OER. Nickel foam (NF) was immersed in a mixed alcohol solution containing transition metal nitrate and urea via the solvothermal method at 100 degrees C. The CuO-Cu2O redox induced a valence change in nickel, and therefore catalyzed the self-assembly of NiOOH@CuO-Cu2O, which formed a tightly packed and strongly interacting hierarchical composite, contributing to the charge transfer. Besides, NiOOH@CuO-Cu2O was dispersed on the amorphous Co(OH)(2) framework, which was grown in the network sheet of NF. The resulting hierarchical nanocomposite structure greatly increased the number of electron transfer channels. The improved conductivity of the electrode and active sites were conductive to the adsorption and diffusion of OH- from the electrolyte. As a working electrode, the obtained NCC-30 sample had a high catalytic performance for the OER with a low overpotential of 262 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2). It also showed long-term catalytic stability, where after 48 h i-t testing at 20 mA cm(-2), its activity still retained 96% of the initial value and sustained the reaction for 15 h at 50 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. This work suggests that the CuO-Cu2O redox-induced in situ self-assembly of hierarchical NiOOH@CuO-Cu2O/Co(OH)(2) nanocomposites grown in network sheets on NF is a new strategy for preparing efficient OER catalysts.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000528920000035

Transition metal oxides are an excellent system for developing scalable, non-noble-metal-based catalysts, especially for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Central to the rational design of novel catalysts is the development of quantitative structureactivity relationships, which correlate the desired catalytic behavior to structural and/or elemental descriptors of materials. The ultimate goal is to use these relationships to guide materials design. In this study, 101 intrinsic OER activities of 51 perovskites were compiled from five studies in literature and additional measurements made for this work. We explored the behavior and performance of 14 descriptors of the metaloxygen bond strength using a number of statistical approaches, including factor analysis and linear regression models. We found that these descriptors can be classified into five descriptor families and identify electron occupancy and metal-oxygen covalency as the dominant influences on the OER activity. However, multiple descriptors still need to be considered in order to develop strong predictive relationships, largely outperforming the use of only one or two descriptors (as conventionally done in the field). We confirmed that the number of d electrons, charge-transfer energy (covalency), and optimality of eg occupancy play the important roles, but found that structural factors such as M-O-M bond angle and tolerance factor are relevant as well. With these tools, we demonstrate how statistical learning can be used to draw novel physical insights and combined with data mining to rapidly screen OER electrocatalysts across a wide chemical space.									148	7	0	0	9	0	153			1932-7447			WOS:000368562200011

Prior work has demonstrated the feasibility of edge-coordination of a variety of oxo-manganese clusters to graphene sheets under a range of graphene-consistent ligand constraints (GCLCs) (Terrett, et al. 2021). Here, a broken-symmetry Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) approach is employed to investigate the ability of one such cluster to support reactive intermediates of potential relevance to water oxidation. These calculations demonstrate that the cluster is capable of supporting a range of coordination geometries, radical states, and reactions of relevance to water oxidation. Particularly, coordination of Ca2+ and Sr2+ is shown to reduce the activation energy of dioxygen release from the cluster within a scenario of superoxide radical oxidation, suggesting a potential mechanism for catalytic enhancement. The cluster supports a highly labile first coordination sphere of aqua and hydroxo ligands, the facile proton exchange energetics of which are characterised in detail using a Climbing Image Nudged Elastic Band (CI-NEB) approach. Group II metal adducts of the cluster bear striking structural and functional similarities to the oxygen-evolving centre (OEC) of Photosystem II (PSII).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000778326500001

Here we report a facile strategy for designing Ni2W4C-W3C Janus structures with abundant Ni-W metallic bonds on surfaces through interfacial engineering. Inserting Ni atoms into the W3C crystals in reaction progress generates a new Ni2W4C phase, making the inert W atoms in W3C be active sites in Ni2W4C for overall water splitting. TheNi(2)W(4)C-W3C/carbon nanofibers (Ni2W4C-W3C/CNFs) require overpotentials of 63 mV to reach 10 mA cm 2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 270 mV to reach 30 mA cm(2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolyte, respectively. When utilized as both cathode and anode in alkaline solution for overall water splitting, cell voltages of 1.55 and 1.87 V are needed to reach 10 and 100 mA cm(2), respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) results indicate that the strong interactions between Ni and W increase the local electronic states of W atoms. The Ni2W4C provides active sites for cleaving H-OH bonds, and the W3C facilitates the combination of H-ads intermediates into H-2 molecules. The in situ electrochemical-Raman results demonstrate that the strong absorption ability for hydroxyl and water molecules and further demonstrate that W atoms are the real active sites.

Herein, hollow cobalt phosphate microspheres (CoPi/HSNPC) derived from corresponding cobalt phosphonates are employed as an efficient electrocatalyst toward both nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions. Benefiting from the sufficient active sites and the enhanced proton-conducting pathways, the CoPi/HSNPC exhibits a high NH3 yield rate of 16.48 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1) with a faradaic efficiency of 4.46% at -0.2 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, associated with excellent stability for cycling operation. The Co2+ sites of cobalt phosphate microspheres are revealed as the active component for the NRR through the associative pathway, and the phosphate groups are also beneficial for the enhanced NRR activity. The CoPi/HSNPC also exhibits extraordinary OER activity with an overpotential of 341 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) of anodic current density and a negligible current decay during 30 h. When employed as the cathode catalyst of a rechargeable Zn-N-2 battery, a large NH3 yield rate of 11.62 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1) and faradaic efficiency of 24.42% with decreased charge-discharge potential gaps as well as an impressive power output including a peak power density of 0.31 mW cm(-2) and an energy density of 138.6 mW h g(zn)(-1) are achieved, providing an attractive perspective for practical applications. Moreover, the assembled Zn-N-2 battery can maintain robust cycling operation with a stable NH3 yield rate driven by the sustainable electricity input from solar energy.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000645119700001

The electrodeposition mechanism, morphology, composition and structure of the composite electrodes were characterized by cyclic voltammogram (CV), SEM, EDAX and XRD. Results show that the doping solid particles can not change reaction mechanism of alpha-PbO2 electrode in alkaline or acid plating bath, but can improve deposition rate and reduce oxygen evolution potential. The doping solid particles can inhibit the growth of alpha-PbO2 unit cell and improve specific surface area. The diffraction peak intensity of alpha-PbO2-CeO2-TiO2 composite electrode is lower than that of pure alpha-PbO2 electrode. The electrocatalytic activity of alpha-PbO2-2.12%CeO2-3.71%TiO2 composite electrode is the best.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) represent fascinating quasi-1-dimensional materials due to their electronic and mechanical properties which enable the formation of (unlike graphene) robust, flexible and well defined three dimensional structures. Because CNTs are created from "rolled up" graphene sheets, exposing mostly inactive walls, they generally exhibit poor electrochemical properties. In contrast, graphene sheets can exhibit fast electron transfer rates but are often prone to "restacking" which hinders their true electrochemical potential. Here we obviate this problem by partial unzipping of CNTs, where their inner core creates nanocables with high electrical conductivity while the outer unzipped graphene layers full of edges and defects act as highly electroactive materials. Metallic nanoparticles are introduced into graphene oxide/CNT hybrid structures (GOCNT), so they do catalyze reactions which are not catalyzed by carbon. We show that in combination with trace metal doping, these nanocables act as efficient electrocatalysts towards oxidation of biomarkers and energy related applications, such as hydrogen evolution reaction. Such hybrid graphene/CNT/metallic nanoparticles present universal well-structured catalysts which should find wide applications in electrochemical devices. GOCNTs rich in oxygenated groups show much promise in pollution management, thus their adsorption behaviour was investigated to establish their ability to remove harmful heavy-metal pollutants. The results show an increasing trend in the concentration of oxygen functional groups, directly correlated with the GOCNT adsorption capacity.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000372851500056	26948579

The diamond oxidation rate was determined from weight and size changes of the diamonds and shows a similar fO(2)-dependence at three temperatures (7): Ln V = 0.57 log fO(2) + T-term, where V is diamond oxidation rate and T-term is the term dependent on temperature. The derived relationship can be used to evaluate the significance of the earlier established variations in the redox state in several EKATI mine property kimberlites, N.W.T., Canada. The surfaces of etched diamonds from the experiments were studied using high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy. At 100 kPa the shape, orientation and size of the etch pits have no consistent correlation with temperature, fO(2) and the reaction rates. Increase in the CO2-content of the reacting gas results in an evolution from irregular cavities to pits formed by the development of (100) faces and further to more regular forms with (111) faces. These results agree with high pressure data and suggest that the features developed on oxidized diamonds are determined by variations in the reaction rates in different directions of the diamond lattice, which are dictated by the molecular composition of the reacting fluid (or gas). A high CO2 content favours fast oxidation rates in the [111] direction.									25	2	0	0	0	1	26			0935-1221	1617-4011		WOS:000267740300010		
J	Meng, Suci; Sun, Shichao; Liu, Yu; Lu, Yikai; Chen, Min								Synergistic modulation of inverse spinel Fe3O4 by doping with chromium and nitrogen for efficient electrocatalytic water splitting								JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE				624				433	442		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.04.141				OCT 15 2022	2022	Earth-abundant Fe-based oxides have drawn less attention in electrocatalytic water splitting owing to the inferior intrinsic activity and poor conductivity. Therefore, developing an effective method to increase the catalytic performance of Fe-based oxides is of great importance for the practical application. Herein, a novel Cr/N co-doped Fe3O4 electrocatalyst (denoted as Cr-Fe3O4-N/NF) is designed and prepared by a simple immersion treatment followed by a calcination method for efficient water splitting. The resultant CrFe3O4-N/NF shows significant catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with overpotentials of 218 and 95 mV at 10 mA cm-2. Furthermore, the water splitting system using Cr-Fe3O4-N/NF could afford a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at 1.53 V, which is superior to two-electrode system composed of Pt/C and RuO2. The high activities are attributed to the synergistic effect between Cr and N element doping. Specifically, the introduction of electron-deficient Cr is conductive to accelerate the dissociation process of water, adsorption process of intermediates, adjust the electronic structure. Simultaneously, N doping can increase the adsorption of H intermediates, provide more Journal of Interface (2022) active sites for hydrogen absorption, and improve the electrical conductivity. This study provides a new strategy for Cr and N co-doped metal oxides electrocatalysts for high-performance water splitting.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0021-9797	1095-7103		WOS:000810408500011	35667205

A thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with a flourier transform infrared spectrometer (TG-FTIR) was employed to examine the evolution of main gaseous compounds during pyrolysis with a heating rate of 15 K/min from room temperature to 900 degrees C. The results showed that the carbonyl groups were the source of CO2 emission at low temperatures, rather than the ether bonds derived from beta-O-4. Decarbonylation of the carbonyl group leads to CO2 emission, and CH4 was generated by the dealkylation effect of the alkyl side chains connected to the benzene rings. Analytical pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) was introduced to reveal the distribution of reaction products at 500, 650, and 800 degrees C. In contrast to the hydroxyl group on C alpha, which promoted polymer pyrolysis predominantly through beta-O-4 bond breakage, the carbonyl on Ca enhanced the activity of the polymer, significantly increased the proportion of C alpha-C beta disruption mode during pyrolysis, and substantially reduced the breakage temperature of the beta-O-4 bond from 366 to 328 degrees C. Finally, the pyrolysis mechanism and reaction pathway of both the linear lignin model polymers composed of only beta-O-4 linkages were elucidated in this study.									12	2	0	0	2	0	13			0165-2370	1873-250X		WOS:000453301400020

In particular, the use of inexpensive mixed TMO's such as Fe and Ni has gained much attention. While some techniques, such as electrodeposition, are widely investigated, reports into the fabrication of Fe, Ni/Fe and Ni oxides for the OER by alternative methods are sparse. To our knowledge, a study involving hydrothermal synthesis to produce all three of the aforementioned catalysts for the OER has yet to be undertaken. Additionally, the use of high surface area electrode supports to enhance the properties of the OER materials is very popular at present. Currently, industrial alkaline electrolysis uses Ni foam as an electrode due to its high porosity, three dimensional structure and low cost. Herein, the hydrothermal synthesis of nanoscale Fe, Ni/Fe and Ni oxide particles is reported. The resulting powders were subsequently used to modify Ni foam, an industrially compatible OER catalyst. The modified Ni foams exhibit improved OER capabilities when compared to the bare foam. Interestingly, the hydrothermal Ni oxide has the greatest enhancement in its OER activity compared to the mixed Ni/Fe and pure Fe oxides. Usually, electrodeposited NiFe oxides are superior OER catalysts compared to pure Ni and Fe oxides. Finally, the hydrothermal Ni oxide/Ni foam system offers a cheap and more active OER catalysts then the currently utilised anodic material for water electrolysis. This system could generate an increased amount of H-2 gas for an economy searching for alternatives energy sources.									31	1	0	0	1	0	31			2398-4902			WOS:000422769100020

However, insufficient attention on the balance of N-doping engineering and carbon chemistry significantly suppressed the revelation of the real active configurations as well as the ORR mechanism for NCMs. Herein, 1,4-plienylenediurea (BDU) with multifunctional blocks was designed for the synthesis of NCMs, realizing synchronous manipulation of N-doping engineering and carbon chemistry. The good balance between N-doping engineering (especially graphitic edge N configurations) and carbon chemistry (including the specific surface area, porosity distribution, and graphitization degree) at a pyrolysis temperature of 1000 degrees C resulted in the best ORR performance for obtaining N-doped carbon nanorod (NCR) materials. A general descriptor chi was then proposed for evaluating the balance states between N-doping engineering and carbon chemistry. The prediction of the ORR performance of NCMs from their physical properties as well as searching for the optimal active configuration from the relationships between ORR performance and different configurations can be realized from such a practical descriptor, which can also be extended to other nanocarbon-based metal-free electrocatalytic reactions for deeply understanding their electrocatalytic mechanisms.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000733831800001	34908397

In cases where the plasma contained oxygen, O atoms deposition on the tube surface could be confirmed via the time-dependent conversion of NO to NO2 in a post-plasma experiment. Inside the discharge tube, the evolution of the concentrations of NO and of NO2 was measured using quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy in the mid-infrared spectral range. The surface density of atomic oxygen was estimated to be about 2 x 10(14) cm(-2) based on NO oxidation in the closed reactor. The production rate of NO2 is in the range of 2 x 10(11) molecules cm(-3) s(-1).									33	1	0	0	3	0	33			0963-0252	1361-6595		WOS:000280407300027

A new long-term aging protocol was utilized, which applies direct aging on the exposed surface of the binders. The aging protocol considers the effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation (with alternation of UV and dark cycles), presence of oxygen, and temperature. After varying aging durations, different surface morphologies were detected using both optical photos and atomic force microscopy (AFM). New microstructures in the shape of rods, squares, spheres, ellipsoids, and beans and flower or leaf structures were observed on the aged surfaces. The observed microstructures are probably composed of the product of the oxidation and polymerization reactions occurring on the binder surface due to direct aging. The evolution of the microstructure due to direct aging in Advera modified binders was similar to that of the original binders, displaying flower or leaf structures after the longest aging durations. The microstructural evolution observed on the Sasobit modified binders differed from that of the original and Advera modified binders. The discrepancy is attributed to the dissimilar microstructure and chemical composition of the unaged surface, which reacts and forms compounds having different compositions and metastable configurations.

PCC 7120 Reveals New Targets for This Regulator Involved in Photosynthesis, Iron Uptake and Cellular Morphology								PLANT AND CELL PHYSIOLOGY				51	11			1900	1914		10.1093/pcp/pcq148				NOV 2010	2010	Previous genomic analyses of the filamentous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 have identified three ferric uptake regulator (Fur) homologs with low sequence identities and probably different functions in the cell. FurA is a constitutive protein that shares the highest homology with Fur from heterotrophic bacteria and appears to be essential for in vitro growth. In this study, we have analysed the effects of FurA overexpression on the Anabaena sp. phenotype and investigated which of the observed alterations were directly operated by FurA. Overexpression of the regulator led to changes in cellular morphology, resulting in shorter filaments with rounded cells of different sizes. The furA-overexpressing strain showed a slower photoautotrophic growth and a marked decrease in the oxygen evolution rate. Overexpression of the regulator also decreased both catalase and superoxide dismutase activities, but did not lead to an increase in the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species. By combining phenotypic studies, reverse transcription-PCR analyses and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we identified three novel direct targets of FurA, including genes encoding a siderophore outer membrane transporter (schT), bacterial actins (mreBCD) and the PSII reaction center protein D1 (psbA). The affinity of FurA for these novel targets was markedly affected by the absence of divalent metal ions, confirming previous evidence of a critical role for the metal co-repressor in the function of the regulator in vivo. The results unravel new cellular processes modulated by FurA, supporting its role as a global transcriptional regulator in Anabaena sp.

Substrate degradation, total organic carbon and evolution profiles of intermediates were monitored. Relevant mineralization of the substrates was observed, in particular for melamine, its extent depending on the concentration of dissolved O-2 and on the number of amino substituents at the s-triazine moiety of the substrate. In all experiments, cyanuric acid was found to be the only persistent final product. Experimental results indicate that the route of reactions leading to mineralization is independent of that leading to amino group substitution. Mechanistic hypotheses are proposed and compared with findings coming from TiO2-based photocatalysis.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000491876500034

Conventional methods of coating usually employ sol-gel methods and calcination to obtain a good binding of the coating to the substrate. In cold gas spraying, particles are accelerated to high velocities by a pressurized gas. Nitrogen is used as process gas, preheated and then expanded in a De Laval type nozzle. On impact with the substrate the particles deform, break up and build an efficient interface to the back contact (as revealed, for example, by scanning electron microscopy). Cold gas spraying is a method for the direct bonding of particles to a substrate and does not require additives that have to be removed e. g. by a calcination step. Thereby it allows the direct fabrication of a working electrode ensemble.In our initial experiments, the state-of-the-art photocatalyst titanium dioxide (TiO2) was explored. The cold-gas-sprayed coatings revealed significantly higher activities for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as compared to films derived from wet-chemical processes. Due to the demand for photocatalysts with band gap suitable for visible light absorption, this approach was extended to the promising catalyst material hematite. In correlation with photoelectrochemical measurements, the operating parameters of the cold gas spray process are discussed in terms of their influence on the photocatalytic properties of the semiconductor.

The control fish group was maintained at oxygen pressure of 158-162 gPa, the experimental group at 54-55 gPa. The exposure was 15 days, the water temperature-15 degrees C. Under conditions of oxygen deficit in the mullet body there is noted development of a complex of compensatory reactions directed to maintenance of the oxygen blood capacity. Initially (the 1st-2nd day), the release of erythrocytes from spleen is noted, which increases the number of red blood cells and the hemoglobin concentration in blood (the emergency adaptation). Subsequently (the 10-15th day), there occur quantitative readjustments at the level of the hemoglobin system, which lead to an increase in the blood affinity to oxygen and to a decrease in its sensitivity to pH (the long-term adaptation). The revealed changes take place on the background of a decrease in volume of circulating erythrocytes, which reflects the character of change of erythrocytic parameters (MCV, MCHC) and seems to be a consequence of partial dehydration of blood plasma.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0930	1608-3202		WOS:000334160300011

Herein, FeCo nanoalloys embedded into Ndoped carbon nanofibers was prepared as a superior trifunctional catalyst for ORR, OER and HER by a universal and facile method. Under the synergistic effect of FeCo nanoalloys and N-doped carbon nanofibers, the Fe, Co/N-C catalyst exhibits half-wave potential of 0.86 V for ORR, and overpotentials of 388 mV and 249 mV at 10 mA & BULL;cm-2 for OER and HER, respectively. What's more, the Zn-air battery based on Fe, Co/ N-C catalyst displayed a considerable open-circuit voltage of 1.5 V and a continuous cycle life span of 210 h.

Our hypothesis is validated by introducing lattice defects due to the strain originating from a slightly higher doped grain boundary (GB) than at the interconnected grains of perovskite oxide. When Pd is doped at the B-site of ABO(3)-type La0.7Sr0.3CoO3-delta, a marginally higher ionic radius of Pd4+ than Co3+ enables partial deportation of Pd4+ to the GB. Consequently, the GB unit cell is relatively expanded with a higher interplanar spacing, as observed by microscopic analysis. When the Pd concentration is increased, oxygen vacancy sites are reduced and both metallic Pd and PdOx are exsolved at the perovskite oxide surface. With the Pd/Co ratio of 0.05, the defects originating from the Pd-modulated GB can be maximized to 1.29 +/- 0.21% which enhances the bifunctional O-2 activation ability by lowering the combined overpotential of oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER/ORR) to 0.91 V, duly corroborated by computational studies. The fabricated rechargeable Zn-air battery has a specific capacity of 740 mA.h/g(Zn) (851 mW.h/g(Zn)) when discharge is performed at 10 mA/cm(2). Galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling with a 1 h cycle time shows 60 h stable performance. The OER/ORR bifunctional activity is found to be strongly correlated to the repositioned lattice symmetry at the perovskite GB.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000571433500040	32805815

Hypoxia in the deep-seated infection microenvironment (IME) considerably precludes photonic disinfection efficacy, especially antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). Herein we develop IMEunlocked oxygen-evolving bio-catalytic fabrics composed of electrospun poly(epsilon-caprolactone) scaffolds, MXene/SnS2 bio-heterojunctions (MX/SnS bio-HJs), and lactate oxidase (LOx) for deep-seated bacteria-infected cutaneous regeneration. LOx can deplete lactic acid produced by bacteria at infected site and yield hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The MX/SnS bio-HJs not only catalyze H2O2 to produce hydroxyl radicals (middotOH) through Fenton-like reaction, but also generate oxygen (O2) to fortify aPDT under Near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation, consequently, expeditious disinfection is achieved. Moreover, in vivo results reveal that the biocatalytic fabrics exert benign cutaneous regeneration ability by slaughtering bacteria, promoting hemostasis and collagen deposition. This work provides a tactic to instill fabrics with an IME-unlocked catalytic sterilization capability through endogenous O2 evolution for remedying infected wounds.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The modification of a 1-mm-thick sheet of the foam was carried out through its surface and included physical deposition of pulsed laser plasma for the formation of catalytic MoSx and MoSxSey films, followed by their annealing. The effect of foam pretreatment by sulfurization in H2S under varying conditions and formation of catalytic layers with different structures and compositions was studied. The best improvement in the electrocatalytic performance of the foam was exerted by thin-film coatings of molybdenum sulfide and sulfide/selenide with a nanocrystalline structure formed on the surface of a foam with a Ni3S2 underlayer. The possibility of a synergetic effect of the formed phases was analyzed by DFT calculations. For the optimum composition of the modified layers, the overvoltage of H2 evolution (for a current density of 10 mA/cm2) decreased to 155 mV, and the overvoltage of O2 evolution did not exceed 160 mV. The electrocatalytic characteristics obtained by this treatment are not inferior to those for the best modern electrocatalysts created on nickel foam by widely used methods of hydrothermal synthesis or electrodeposition.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2075-1133			INSPEC:20856909

In this work, hierarchical MoO42- intercalating alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanosheet assemblies were synthesized from the readily available metal source and 2-methylimidazole as the alkaline reagent by green and fast coprecipitation. The ultrathin alpha-Co(OH)(2)-MoO4(25) nanosheets possess a lateral size of about 40-100 nm and a thickness from 2.5 to 4.6 nm (3 to 6 layers). Triggered by OER oxidation treatment, the alpha-Co(OH)(2)-MoO4(25) material undergoes ultrafast and thorough structure reconstruction to CoOOH(25) by only one linear sweep voltammetry scan and chronopotentiometry within 35 s. The in situ transformation leads to the formation of the CoOOH active phase with rich oxygen vacancies and distorted structure, extracting MoO42- ions at the same time. Compared with other designed counterparts, CoOOH(25) offers a lower overpotential (309 mV) for the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a smaller Tafel slope of only 57.78 mV dec(-1), representing an excellent unary CoOOH-based or Co(OH)(2)-based catalyst. The improved catalytic activity of CoOOH(25) can be attributed to its specific structures, e.g., ultrathin disordered nanosheets that could facilitate electrolyte transportation and expose more active sites, oxygen vacancies that enhance the intrinsic per-site activity, and their synergistic effect. This established structure self-renewal technology might also be expanded to other advanced nanomaterials toward other electrochemical energy conversion processes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000627568300078

Gas evolution from HE-NCM and SFG6 electrodes was studied during two charge/discharge cycles in half-cell and full-cell configuration using electrolytes composed of 1 M LiPF6 in either 3:7 (w/w) EC:DEC or 3: 7 (w/w) FEC: DEC. The results suggest that some CO2 formation is caused by reactive oxygen species originating from Li2MnO3 domain activation. The electrolyte composition has no effect on O-2 evolution during Li2MnO3 domain activation and oxidative CO2 evolution in HE-NCM/Li half-cells. In contrast, decomposition of PF6- is significantly enhanced in electrolyte containing FEC and found to be strongly facilitated by the SuperC65 conductive carbon additive employed in the HE-NCM electrodes. EC and FEC clearly follow different reductive decomposition pathways. This leads to major differences in solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and affects follow-up reactions involving CO2 and possibly other processes relevant for the stability and endurance of high voltage lithium-ion batteries.

The detailed analysis of Fe and Co-doped TiO2 before and after Methylene blue (MB) treatment was examined under the irradiation of 35 W xenon arc lamp for 3 h. The materials treated with MB were studied by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, EPR and FT-IR which revealed that the oxidation state of Co2+ was photo-oxidized to Co3+ and Fe3+ was photo-reduced to Fe2+ or less. Thermodynamic, kinetic properties were studied at different reaction temperature and the activation energy (E-a), enthalpy (Delta H), entropy (Delta S) and free energy (Delta G) of activation were calculated for the reaction. The activation energy has been found for TiO2, Fe-TiO2 and Co-TiO2 as 24.771, 11.413 and 15.801 kJ mol(-1) respectively. The structure, morphology and optical properties were studied by XRD, UV-diffuse reflectance spectra, FESEM, TEM and PL. Moreover, electrochemical studies were carried out to demonstrate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity on TiO2, Fe-TiO2 and Co-TiO2 in 1 M of H2SO4 electrolyte, with a scan rate of 50 mV s(-1) and the as-prepared photocatalysts could act as the promising electrode materials for water splitting.

The authors measure the inclusive positive and negative meson cross sections dsigma/dPT2 and study their evolution with the projectile mass assuming Aprojalpha(PT) dependence. Unlike negative mesons, the alpha(PT) parameter shows no PT dependence for positive mesons in the range 0.4 to 3.0 GeV/c. Cross sections fitted to an exponential give an inverse slope PT0 of the order of 210 MeV/c. As a function of the neutral transverse energy, PT0 values show a slight rise followed by a plateau.

The in situ grown Ni2P thin layer on NF not only provides a large number of anchoring sites for the growth of high-density CdS microspheres for enhancing the visible light capture ability, but also offers active sites for catalyzing the H-2 evolution reaction (HER). Meanwhile, the multiple heterojunction interfaces formed among NF, Ni2P, and CdS can greatly promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. As a consequence, the CdS/NF-P photocatalyst foam exhibits good photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity under visible light irradiation. The H-2 evolution rate reaches 4.82 mmol h(-1) g(CdS)(-1) over the best CdS/NF-P photocatalyst foam, which is about five times that of CdS particles suspended in the reaction solution. More attractively, the photocatalyst foam can be easily recovered and recycled in the reaction solution by simple magnetic separation. In addition, the structural integrity makes the photocatalyst foam highly stable in the photocatalytic HER for 35 h. This work provides a new strategy for the design of efficient and practical photocatalyst foams that are easy to prepare on a large scale and compatible with device manufacturing for large-scale photochemical energy conversion.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000695415300001

Herein, a Co-based heterostructure consisting of cobalt (Co) and molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) nanoparticles in a 2D morphology is purposely designed as an OER precatalyst. At the initial stage of the OER in alkaline solution, the fast phase transition of Co metal into gamma-phase cobalt oxyhydroxide (gamma-CoOOH) in the presence of Mo2C gives rise to a Mo-enriched surface of the defective gamma-CoOOH. This significantly raises the OER kinetics and gives an almost 90% enhancement in catalytic activity per metal site. Interestingly, the phase transition to gamma-CoOOH and Mo-enriched surface reconstruction are potential-dependent and are accelerated at 1.4 V, as revealed by in situ Raman spectroscopy as well as ex situ scanning transmission electron microscopy studies. Potential-dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses and methanol oxidation experiments further confirm that the Mo enrichment into the defective CoOOH surface promotes electron flow from Mo to Co sites via the bridging oxygen, greatly benefiting the electrostatic adsorption of OH- ions and smoothing the subsequent OER steps.									92	8	0	0	6	0	95			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000044

The sintered Ag joint is separated into two groups and, respectively, kept in air and vacuum (10(-4) Pa) atmospheres. The microstructure of sintered Ag paste become clearly coarsened after aging at 250 degrees C in air for 100 h, while it remains almost the same as in the initial state in vacuum, even after aging for 1000 h. The different microstructural evolutions are investigated in detail by transmission electron microscopy, which reveals that coarsening are involved in the Ag-O reaction and form a large number of Ag nanoparticles around sintered Ag particles, as well as enhance coalescence. Furthermore, the macro/micromechanical properties of sintered Ag paste, after aging in air and vacuum atmospheres, are evaluated by a die shear test and a nano-indenter system with a spherical diamond tip. Shear strength and fracture mode were systematically analyzed. The micromechanical properties of sintered Ag paste, including Young's modulus and hardness, depend on its microstructure and are largely influenced by its porosity, which decreases from initiation to 250 h and recovers after aging for 500 h in air. However, there is almost no change during the aging process in the vacuum atmosphere. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of the microstructural evolution and the mechanical properties of sintered Ag joints, including the change in bonding quality and Young's modulus during aging for actual power modules, which are packaged by a resin.

Here, we report hematite, an earth-abundant material, to be highly effective and thermally stable to catalyze methane combustion at low temperatures (<500 degrees C) with a low light-off temperature of 230 degrees C and 100% selectivity to CO2. The reported performance is impressive and comparable to those of precious-metal-based catalysts, with a low apparent activation energy of 17.60 kcal. mol(-1). Our theoretical analysis shows that the excellent performance stems from a tetra-iron center with an antiferromagnetically coupled iron dimer on the hematite (110) surface, analogous to that of the methanotroph enzyme methane monooxygenase that activates methane at ambient conditions in nature. Isotopic oxygen tracer experiments support a Mars van Krevelen redox mechanism where CH4 is activated by reaction with a hematite surface oxygen first, followed by a catalytic cycle through a molecular-dioxygen-assisted pathway. Surface studies with in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the evolution of reaction intermediates from a methoxy CH3-O-Fe, to a bridging bidentate formate b-HCOO-Fe, to a monodentate formate m-HCOO-Fe, before CO2 is eventually formed via a combination of thermal hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) and proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes. The elucidation of the reaction mechanism and the intermediate evolutionary profile may allow future development of catalytic syntheses of oxygenated products from CH4 in gas-phase heterogeneous catalysis.									21	1	0	0	1	0	21			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000579087600025	32935987

Optimized properties with stable epsilon(r) (similar to 1829 to 1838), small Delta epsilon/epsilon(25 degrees C) values (+/- 15%) over a broad temperature range from -60 degrees C to 140 degrees C, and low tan delta (<= 0.02) from 4 degrees C to 194 degrees C were obtained at x = 0.1. The relaxation and conduction process in the high-temperature region are attributed to thermal activation, and oxygen vacancies may be the ionic charge carriers in perovskite ferroelectrics.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0361-5235	1543-186X		WOS:000428819300007

However, the efficiency of photo/electrocatalysis is still low because of the less visible light absorption and fast recombination of electron-hole pairs. Herein taking the benefits of layered and electronic structural design of Ni-Mn-layered double hydroxide and layered graphitic carbon nitride. A novel Ni-Mn-LDH/g-C3N4 heterostructured photo/electrocatalyst with suited bands was in situ constructed by temperature controlled hydrothermal treatment. A turn in band gap energy within the range of Ni-Mn-LDH to g-C3N4 was noted through a series of physicochemical techniques. Consequently the optimized nanohybrid Ni-Mn-LDH/g-C3N4 (10%) used as best electrocatalyst with J(OER) = 10 mAcm(-2) @ 316 mV and J(HER) = -60 mAcm(-2) @ 147 mV). Furthermore under visible light illumination it function as outperformed photo/electrocatalyst with J(OER) = 10 mAcm(-2) @ 296 mV and J(HER) = -60 mAcm(-2) @ -126 mV in 1 M KOH with a super stability. Similarly it was used for the degradation of RhB with outperformance (>= 99%) and rate constant k = 0.313 mn(-1). Rivaling the performance of expensive catalysts such as RuO2 and Pt/C and other counterparts. The enhanced photo/electrocatalytic activity ascribed to the formation of band-matched layered by layered heterojunction-accelerated charge separation. It is predicted that our temperature controlled strategy based on earth-profuse elements with structural reliability providing an innovative and inexpensive photo/electrocatalytic system for realistic energy conversion applications.									95	2	0	0	11	0	95			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000450135000050

J	Xie, D; Belton, GR								Kinetics of reduction of ferric iron in Fe2O3-CaO-SiO2-Al2O3 slags under argon, CO-CO2, or H-2-H2O								METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS B-PROCESS METALLURGY AND MATERIALS PROCESSING SCIENCE				34	2			225	234		10.1007/s11663-003-0009-x				APR 2003	2003	The rates of reduction of ferric iron in Fe2O3-CaO-SiO2-Al2O3 slags containing 3 to 21 wt pct Fe2O3 under impinging argon, CO-CO2, or H-2-H2O have been studied at 1370 degreesC under conditions of enhanced mass transfer in the slag using a rotating alumina disc just in contact with the slag surface. For a 6 wt pct Fe slag at a stirring speed of 900 rpm the observed reduction rates by 50 pct H-2-H2O were a factor of 2 to 3 times higher than those by 50 pct CO-CO2 and more than one order of magnitude higher than those under pure argon. The observed rates were analyzed to determine the rate-controlling mechanisms for the present conditions. Analysis of the rate data suggests that the rates under 50 pct H-2-H2O are predominantly controlled by the slag mass transfer. The derived values of the mass-transfer coefficient followed a square-root dependence on the stirring speed for a given slag and, at a given stirring speed, a linear function of the total iron content of the slags. The rates of oxygen evolution during reduction under pure argon were shown to be consistent with a rate-controlling mechanism involving a fast chemical reaction at the interface and relatively slow mass transfer in the gaseous and the slag phases. The rates of reduction by CO-CO2 (pCO = 0.02 to 0.82 atm) were found to be likely of a mixed control by the slag mass transfer and the interfacial reaction. A significant contribution of oxygen evolution to the overall rates was observed for more-oxidized slags and for experiments with relatively low values of pCO. Assuming a parallel reaction mechanism, the estimated net reduction rates due to CO were found to be of the first order in pCO, with the first-order rate constants being approximately a linear function of the ferric concentration.

Herein, the carbon/bismuth composite (PHB) was employed as negative electrocatalyst for vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB). The composite was prepared by hydrothermal and high temperature treatment with pomelo peel and NaBiO3 as raw materials for V3+/V2+ redox reaction. Biomass carbon material exhibits large specific surface area, various oxygen-containing functional groups, and multiple reactive places. Metal bismuth can significantly inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction, which can also provide abundant active sites. The composite catalyst not only inhibits the side reaction but also accelerates the kinetics in charge transfer and electron transport. Therefore, the composite catalyst can promote the comprehensive performance of negative electrode. At 150 mA cm(-2), the discharge capacity of the cell using PHB (88.5 mA h) is 36.8 mA h higher than the blank cell. Energy efficiency is increased by 9.1% after using PHB. This work provides a carbon/bismuth composite, which is a promising catalyst in VRFB.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000820576800001

In contrast to haemocyanin and PPO, hexamerins do not bind oxygen, but mainly play a role as storage proteins that supply amino acids for insect metamorphosis. We identified seven genes encoding hexamerins, three encoding PPOs, and one hexamerin pseudogene in the genome of the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis. A phylogenetic analysis of hexamerins and PPOs from this wasp and related proteins from other insect orders suggests an essentially order-specific radiation of hexamerins. Temporal and spatial transcriptional profiles of N. vitripennis hexamerins suggest that they have physiological functions other than metamorphosis, which are arguably coupled with its lifestyle.									17	6	0	0	19	0	23			0962-1075	1365-2583		WOS:000273947400014	20167024

Here, abundant defects were created on 2.4-nm Ru nanoparticles to achieve unprecedently high mass-specific reactivity in harsh acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The obtained defect-enriched Ru (DR-Ru) exhibits an ultrahigh HER turnover frequency of 16.4 s(-1) with a 100-mV overpotential in alkaline media, and it also retains an excellent value of 20.6 s(-1) in acidic media; these results are superior to those reported for other Ru catalysts. Accordingly, a record-low loading of 2.5 mu g cm(-2) for the DR-Ru catalysts and low overpotentials of 28.2 and 25.1 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) can be realized in alkaline and acidic media, respectively. Furthermore, the less coordinated Ru surface sites and partial lattice oxygen introduction weaken the bonding between H and DR-Ru catalysts, facilitate fast acidic HER kinetics and help dissociate the water molecule to overcome the major challenge of HER in alkaline electrolytes, leading to an activity comparable to that under acidic conditions. This result provides a guideline for defect engineering on noble metal nanocatalysts to effectively improve the utilization of the catalysts and optimize reactivities.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000648222500001

Thiosulfate also increased the rate of cathodic and anodic reactions, as measured in polarization curves obtained shortly after immersion of the electrode. Current from iron dissolution was balanced by hydrogen evolution and reduction of thiosulfate to produce hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide production represented a large fraction of the open-circuit corrosion current. Carbon steel specimens exposed to thiosulfate-containing solutions developed a film on their surface, composed of iron sulfide and cementite. The film was a good conductor of electrons and non-passivating. The rate of cathodic reactions measured for the film-covered electrode was faster than in the absence of the film, suggesting it is a good catalyst for reduction reactions. The ability of acidified, thiosulfate-containing brines to simulate hydrogen sulfide solutions was critically analyzed.									32	2	0	0	1	0	32			0010-9312	1938-159X		WOS:000309599100002

Here we sandwich a porous YSZ layer between the LSM electrode and YSZ electrolyte to release this oxygen pressure. Symmetric cells with and without the porous YSZ layers are prepared and tested in air at 800 degrees C under the current densities of 0.5 and 1 A cm(-2) for 100 h. Voltage change is continuously monitored, and impedance spectrum studies have been carried out before and after testing. No delamination has been observed for the samples with the porous YSZ layer even after 100 h. The improved performance for these samples is due to the shift of oxygen evolution reaction from the dense YSZ-LSM interface to a porous YSZ-LSM interface. This shift also helps the oxygen to be easily released instead of going into the pores or grain boundaries of the electrolyte. On the other hand, for the sample without the porous YSZ layer, the LSM is totally delaminated from the electrolyte just after 70 h. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we review different approaches to introduce heteroatoms into GDYs, including monodoping and co-doping, predesigned bottom-up synthesis of GDY, the anchoring of metal atoms into GDYs. Furthermore, we introduce the electronic properties' modification caused by these heteroatoms, including reduced diffusion barrier and adsorption energy, abundant active sites, high reversible capacity and cyclic stability, better rate performance and longer lifespan. Furthermore, the topological molecular structure of GDYs can be tuned through bottom-up synthesis methods with different monomers. GDY has great prospects for inclusion in energy storage devices such as sodium-ion batteries, lithium-ion batteries, lithium/magnesium sulfur batteries, and in electrocatalytic processes such as hydrogen evolution reactions, oxygen reduction reactions, and electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reactions in important industrial reactions. At the end of this review, challenges and prospects of heteroatoms' introduction into GDY are discussed.									7	2	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000680401400001

Electrocatalytic water splitting is an efficient method for the low-cost production of pure H-2, but the use of platinum (Pt)-like active electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains necessary. In attempts to replace high-value, scarce Pt catalysts, nickel-based materials are being developed, as earth-abundant HER electrocatalysts. Recently, a number of advanced nickel (Ni)-based catalysts have been developed by rational synthesis strategies, including morphology control, structure tailoring, and interface engineering, significantly improving the HER performance. This review summarizes recent achievements in the application of Ni-based HER electrocatalysts and demonstrates the advantages of each category in enhancing the HER performance.

However, current devices suffer from limited energy efficiency and durability because of the sluggish oxygen reduction and evolution reactions kinetics in the air cathode as well as degenerative stretchability of solid-state electrolytes under highly alkaline conditions. Herein, excellent bifunctional catalytic activity and cycling stability is achieved by using a newly developed Co-N-C nanomaterial with a uniform virus-like structure, prepared via a facile carbonization of a prussian blue analogue (PBA). Furthermore, a solid-state dual-network sodium polyacrylate and cellulose (PANa-cellulose) based hydrogel electrolyte is synthesized with good alkaline-tolerant stretchability. A solid-state fiber-shaped ZAB fabricated using this hydrogel electrolyte, the virus-like Co-N-Cs air cathode, and a zinc spring anode display excellent stretchability of up to 500% strain without damage, and outstanding electrochemical performance with 128 mW cm(-2) peak power density and good cycling stability for >600 cycles at 2 mA. The facile synthesis strategy demonstrated here opens up a new avenue for developing highly active PBA-derived catalyst and shows, for the first time, that virus-like structure can be favorable for electrochemical performance.									54	2	0	0	1	0	54			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000507973100001

However, a strong interaction usually existing between Pd and carbon probably hinders the expression of ORR activity. This work focuses on tuning the interaction between Pd and graphene for architecting high-performance ORR catalyst. The strong interaction between Pd and graphene was confirmed, rendering significant microstructural variation, e.g., the dramatic change of lattice disorder and vibration of surface C-H/C-O bond for the graphene support. Boron (B)-doping enables reversing such structural evolution and suppressing the Pd-C interaction. It literates the Pd from the interaction, increases its electrochemical specific surface area (ECSA) from 68 to 125 m(2) g(-1) and thereof contributes to the highly efficient ORR performance in alkaline solution with more feasible 4e(-) pathway on a 2.8 wt% Pd/C catalyst. Moreover, theoretical simulations further proved that B-doping enhances the electron transfer between Pd and the graphene support and probably benefits a 4e(-) pathway for ORR.

Herein, a porous sponge-like structure of CrP-Re2P composite was successfully constructed on nickel foam (NF) via a facile hydrothermal, drop casting, and subsequent phosphating treatment. Remarkably, the CrP-Re2P/NF exhibits extraordinary performance with an ultralow overpoten-tial of 148 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for HER and 255 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) for OER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. In addition, the bifunctional catalyst also manifests high-efficiency overall water splitting performance that drives a two-electrode system with 50 0/10 0 0 mA cm(-2) at a voltage as low as 1.89/2.02 V in 30% KOH. Moreover, the overall water-splitting device can achieve superior durability for 100 h at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2 )without obvious degradation. More significantly, the CrP-Re2P/NF is used as the cathode of alkaline Zn-H2O cell with a power density of 8.8 mW cm (-2) and robust stability for 180 h, indicating that the catalyst has an encouraging industrial perspective. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of CrP-Re2P/NF is mainly attributed to the porous structure exposing more active sites, high conductivity resulted better charge transfer, as well as the strong synergy between CrP and (ReP)-P-2 species to regulate the binding energy with reactant intermediates. The strategy provides a novel and feasible approach for the development of highly efficient and stable bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting and Zn-H2O cell.(C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Atomistic modeling of our experiments teaches us that the NPs grow mostly via NP diffusion and coalescence rather than through single-atom processes such as precursor chemisorption, atom attachment, and Ostwald ripening. In particular, our analysis shows that the NP aggregation takes place during the oxygen half-reaction and that the NP mobility exhibits a size and temperature dependent scaling. Finally, we show that contrary to what has been widely reported, in general, one cannot simply control the NP size by the number of cycles alone. Instead, while the amount of Pt deposited can be precisely controlled over a wide range of temperatures, ALD-like precision over the NP size requires low deposition temperatures (e.g., T<100 degrees C) when growth is dominated by atom attachment.									69	1	0	0	2	0	71			1948-7185			WOS:000395619100014	28178779

Here, we report a composition-programmable synthesis of multimetallic phosphide CoMPx nanorods (NRs) wherein M can be controlled to be Fe, Ni, Mn, Cu, and their binary combinations. Forming Co2P/MPx core/shell NRs and subsequently converting them into CoMPx solid-solution NRs through thermal post-treatment are essential to overcome the obstacle of morphology/structure inconsistency faced in conventional synthesis of CoMP(x)with the different M compositions. The resultant CoMPx with uniform one-dimensional (1-D) structure provides us a platform to unambiguously screen the M synergistic effects in improving the electrocatalytic activity, as exemplified by the oxygen evolution reaction. This new approach mediated by core/shell nanostructure formation and conversion can be extended to other multicomponent nanocrystal systems (metal alloy, mixed oxide, and chalcogenide, etc.) for diverse applications.									41	1	0	0	4	0	41			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000535173500050	32279498

For the dissemination of the PEMFCs in the automotive industry, the stable automobile operation under transient conditions is important. Under fuel starvation, carbon oxidation can take place at the anode, reversing the cell voltage. By covering the carbon support with finely dispersed IrOx, the contact of carbon with water can be avoided minimizing carbon oxidation, instead, water is electrolyzed on the IrOx. Here, we deposited IrOx nanoparticles on the Pt/C with highly defective carbon. Contrary to the common belief that defective carbon is vulnerable to corrosion, the catalyst could endure better in the absence of H-2, with the longest time of 44 h until reaching the cell voltage of -2.5 V. When the IrOx was immobilized on more defective carbon, the electrochemical surface area was higher, and the surface IrOx was more oxidic, resulting in higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and better CO tolerance. The carbon defects remaining after IrOx deposition were further removed by oxidizing the catalyst. The effect of the oxidation temperature was also examined. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we report a nanocasting route to synthesize mesoporous delta-MnO2 with a high surface area (198 m(2)/g), high pore volume, and narrow pore size distributions to address this issue. By taking structural advantages of mesoporous oxides, this mesoporous delta-MnO2 is employed as a highly efficient, selective, and robust anode for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) electrochemical oxidation to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) with a high yield (98%) and faradic efficiency (98%) under alkaline conditions. The electrocatalyst is also effective for the more difficult HMF electro-oxidation under acidic conditions, forming both FDCA and maleic acid as value-added products in a potential-dependent manner. Experimental results combined with theoretical calculations provide insights into the reaction kinetics and the reaction pathways of electrochemical HMF oxidation over this advanced electrocatalyst. This work thus showcases the rational design of non-noble metal electrodes for multiple applications, such as oxygen evolution, water electrolysis, and biomass upgrading with high energy efficiency.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000813332100001

For large-scale production of hydrogen, electrolysis of seawater is considered to the replacement for fresh water due to its natural abundance. However, the alternation requires the development of a robust and cheap electrocatalyst that can perform seawater splitting without undergoing any chloride corrosion at the anode surface. Herein we fabricated a bi-layered anode with dysprosium doped copper oxide (Cu0.98Dy0.02O) electrocatalyst layer coated copper sulfide (CuS) nanodendritic over stainless steel (SS) substrate for Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER). This optimized bi-layered anode exhibited a superior OER activity posting a potential of 1.57 V vs RHE to achieve the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in real seawater + 1 M KOH electrolyte without chloride corrosion. On the other hand, a lanthanum doped copper oxide (Cu0.98La0.02O) electrocatalyst layer on a stainless-steel substrate act as a cathode for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and exhibited a superior HER activity with a potential of -0.176 V vs RHE to achieve the standard current density in real seawater + 1 M KOH electrolyte. Significantly, the combination of these two electrodes achieved overall alkaline seawater splitting with a cell voltage of 1.53 V to attain the benchmark current density. In addition, long term stability of 12 h was achieved at a low cell voltage of 2.23 V for a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) with 100% retention capability. This result demonstrates the advancement in the development of cheaper electrocatalysts for seawater splitting in large-scale hydrogen production. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

During treatment in propene, the loss of crystal water in the temperature range from 373 to 573 K was followed by a partial decomposition, reduction of the average Mo valence, and formation of a characteristic cubic HPOM at 573 K. This behavior is similar to the structural evolution of H-3[PMo12O40] x 13H(2)O during treatment in propene. The formation of cubic Mo-x[PVMo11-xO40] with Mo centers on extra Keggin framework positions and V centers remaining in the lacunary Keggin ion coincides with the onset of catalytic activity at similar to 573 K. Detailed investigations of the local structure around the vanadium centers in MOx[PVMo11-xO40] have made it possible to propose a model for the geometric structure of the active site in Mo- and V-containing metal oxide catalysts. The cubic Mo-x[PVMo11-xO40] phase prepared from H-4[PVMo11O40] x 13H(2)O is stable in propene and oxygen up to similar to 620 K and exhibits all onset of activity at similar to 573 K. This onset of activity is correlated to characteristic changes in the average local Mo structure, indicating a reversible transition from the reduced state of the active site in MOx[PVMo11-xO40] to an oxidized state under propene oxidation reaction conditions.

Astrochemical reaction network calculations predict that a robust feature of these photoactive horizons of the disk was conversion of CO gas to O-16-poor (high Delta O-17) H2O ice on a timescale of 10(5) yr. Within several AU of the central star ultraviolet fluxes were too great for the oxygen isotopic effects of CO photodissociation to be sequestered in H2O, meaning that the CO self shielding oxygen isotopic effect was an outer disk phenomenon. Calculations depicting transport in the circumstellar disk suggest that CO photodissociation at disk surfaces triggered a wave of high-Delta O-17 H2O that passed from surface regions through the outer disk and into the rocky planet-forming region on a timescale of 10(5) to 10(6) yr.

However, the application of cathodic potentials required for typical electrochemical catalyst deposition limits the library of compatible photoanode materials. Sputter deposition of catalysts circumvents this limitation by enabling facile catalyst layering without cathodic potentials. In this work, we compare the structure and OER activity of sputter-deposited and electrodeposited Ni1-xFexOOH thin films. Electrochemical cycling converts sputtered Ni1-xFex metallic films to the desired mddes/(oxy)hydroxides. Both film preparation methods give catalysts with similar electrochemical behavior across all compositions. Additionally, OER activity is comparable between the deposition methods, with maximum activity for films with similar to 20% Fe content (320 mV overpotential at j = 10 mA cm(-2) geometric). Electrochemical cycling to convert sputtered metallic Ni1-xFex films to metal oxides/(oxy)hydroxides is found to lower the Fe/Ni ratio, while the electrodeposited films exhibit comparable Fe/Ni ratios before and after electrochemical cycling and characterization. Structurally, Fe is found to incorporate within the Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH lattice for films formed through both sputter-deposition and electrodeposition. Layered films were also compared to codeposited 1:1 Fe/Ni films. It is found that, for layered films, an Fe top layer inhibits the electrochemical conversion of metallic Ni to Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH, thus reducing the amount of Ni1-xFexOOH OER-active phase formed. In contrast, migration of metals within Ni-on-top films occurs readily during electrochemical cycling, resulting in films that are structurally and electrochemically indistinguishable from codeposited Ni1-xFexOOH. These findings enable direct application of Ni1-xFexOOH sputtered films to a wider library of photoanodes for light-driven water-splitting applications.									102	1	0	0	5	0	103			1932-7447			WOS:000359683800034

Maintaining the co-ordination structure of active sites in the process of acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to resist local active sites dissolution is theoretically viable, but rarely reported. Here, a new type of iridium-based oxide Cr-SrIrO(3 )with body-centered cubic structure (BCC-Cr-SrIrO3) is designed for boosting acidic-OER. Thanks to this unique atomic structure, an amorphous layer of CrIrOx with edge-shared CrOx and IrOx octahedrons was in situ formed by quick leaching of only Sr over BCC-Cr-SrIrO3 during the OER process. The edge-shared metal-oxygen octa-hedrons act as a tunable catalytic platform to optimize the acidic-OER, where the electron synergistic coupling effect between bimetallic octahedrons improves the OER activity by tens of times per iridium site with a mass activity of 417.6 A g(Ir)(-1) at 0.3 V overpotential; while the strong coordination persistence of iridium sites in the edge-shared octahedrons under working potentials dictates superior durability with a large stability number of 7 x 10(5) in 0.1 M HClO4. This study promises a new route for the design of superior iridium-based acidic-OER catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000860736100001

Silicon photoanodes could also play an important role in the cost-effective generation of solar fuels, but the most successful methods of photoelectrode passivation and performance enhancement rely on a combination of precious metals and sophisticated processing methods that offset the economic arguments for silicon. Here we show that metal-free carbon-based nanomaterial coatings deposited from solution can protect silicon photoanodes carrying out the oxygen evolution reaction in a range of working environments. Purified semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) act as a hole extraction layer, and a graphene (Gr) capping layer both protects the CNT film and acts as a hole exchange layer with the electrolyte. The performance of semiconducting CNTs is found to be superior to that of metallic or unsorted CNTs in this context. Furthermore, the insertion of graphene oxide (GO) between the n-Si and CNTs reduces the overpotential relative to photoanodes with CNTs deposited on hydrogen-passivated silicon. The composite photoanode structure of n-Si/GO/CNT/Gr shows promising performance for oxygen evolution and excellent potential for improvement by optimizing the catalytic properties and stability of the graphene protective layer.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000389963200009	27960516

Here we describe new findings of a detailed investigation of such nanoscale phase structures and their structure catalytic activity correlation for gold platinum nanoparticles prepared with controllable sizes and compositions. The nanoscale alloying and phase-segregation were probed as a function of composition, size, and thermal treatment conditions using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, electrochemical characterization, and density functional theory modeling. The results have provided the experimental evidence in support of the theoretically simulated dependence of alloying and phase segregation on particle size and temperature. More importantly, new insights have been gained into the control of the nanoscale phase properties of this bimetallic system among alloyed, partially alloyed, or partially phase segregated structures. In contrast to the largely alloyed character for the catalysts treated at 300-400 degrees C, the higher-temperature treated catalysts (e.g., 800 degrees C) are shown to consist of a Pt-rich alloy core and a Au shell or a phase-segregated Au domains enriched on the surface. This conclusion is further supported by the electrochemical and electrocatalytic data revealing that the catalytic activity is highly dependent on the nanoscale evolution of alloying and phase segregation. The thermal control of the nanoscale alloying, phase-segregation, and core shell evolution of the nanoscale bimetallic catalysts provided the first example for establishing the correlation between the nanoscale phase structures and the electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction correlation, which has profound implications to the design and nanoengineering of a wide variety of bimetallic or multimetallic nanostructures for advanced catalysts.									179	7	0	0	7	1	184			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000280005300025		
J	I. Cekerevac, Milan; Nikolic-Bujanovic, Ljiljana N.; Jokic, Anja B.; Simicic, Milos V.								INVESTIGATION OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SYNTHESIS OF FERRATE								HEMIJSKA INDUSTRIJA				64	2			111	119		10.2298/HEMIND1000006C				MAR-APR 2010	2010	In part one of the two-part series, electrochemical generation of ferrate in strongly alkaline solution (10-15 M) of NaOH and KOH in wide range of electrode potentials, between hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction, was investigated and discussed. (Hem. ind. 63 (2009) 385-395). In this part, optimization of electrolysis parameters of ferate(VI) synthesis is elaborated. The most important process parameters which affect the efficiency of ferrate generation are: anode material, alkaline electrolyte concentration, regime of electrical potential control, current density and electrolyte temperature. An optimum current efficiency and yield of ferrate(VI) synthesis are obtained when electrical steel with 3 wt.% of silicon is applied as anode material. The lowest current efficiency is observed for anodes made of structural steel with high concentration of manganese, chromium and nickel. The influence of alloying elements on the process of electrochemical synthesis of ferrate(VI) is discussed in terms of their influence on formation and stability of anodic passive layer and oxygen evolution reaction. The current efficiency increases with the increase of the bulk electrolyte concentration from 10 M NaOH and KOH and shows its maximum value for the 14 M NaOH. The increase in temperature causes the increase in yield of ferrate(VI), which has a maximal value at about 50 degrees C, and after that, at higher temperatures, ferrate (VI) instability causes the yield to decrease. Considering the influence of electrical regime control it is observed that the maximum yield of ferrate(VI) can be achieved with constant anodic potential of about 0.65 V versus Hg vertical bar HgO and with pulsating potential, E-max,, = 0.8 V and E-min = 0.5 V versus Hg vertical bar HgO, and pulse duration ration of t(max):t(min) = 2:1. Circulation of electrolyte shows relatively small, but positive, effect on the synthesis efficiency, particularly in cases when potassium hydroxide is present in the electrolyte.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0367-598X	2217-7426		WOS:000279560000007

However, the present system still suffers from high charge recombination and sluggish surface reactions. Herein, effective charge separation is achieved at the same time as boosting the surface catalytic reaction for PEC water splitting through decoration of plasmon metal (Ag) in a semiconductor/TMH coupling system. The kinetic behavior at the semiconductor/TMH and TMH/electrolyte interfaces is systematically evaluated by employing intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy, scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy, and oxygen evolution reaction model. It is found that both charge transfer and surface catalysis dynamics are enhanced through local surface plasmon resonance of Ag nanoparticles. The as-prepared BiVO4/Co(OH)(x)-Ag exhibits remarkable activity (approximate to 4.64 times) in PEC water splitting in comparison with pure BiVO4. Notably, this smart approach can be also applied to other TMH (Ni(OH)(2)), reflecting its universality. This work provides a guiding design method for solar energy conversion with the semiconductor-TMH system.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000628859300001		
J	Ding, Xinran; Yang, Tao; Wei, Wenxian; Wang, Yihui; Xu, Kai; Zhu, Zizheng; Zhao, Hong; Yu, Tingting; Zhang, Dongen								An in situ grown lanthanum sulfide/molybdenum sulfide hybrid catalyst for electrochemical hydrogen evolution								CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				10	10			3247	3254		10.1039/d0cy00425a				MAY 21 2020	2020	Hydrogen has great promise as an energy carrier superior to traditional fossil fuels. Electrochemical water splitting is expected to be an effective and sustainable method for producing high-purity hydrogen fuel cleanly. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is the cathodic reaction in the electrochemical water-splitting process and requires efficient catalysts. However, the state-of-the-art Pt suffers from high cost and rare reserves, which significantly limit its extensive applications in the hydrogen evolution reaction for water splitting. Although its catalytic activity still falls far short of expectations, molybdenum sulfide has emerged as one of the most promising catalysts for HER due to its abundant reserves and high tunability. Here, we have reported the synthesis and HER catalytic performance of a hybrid lanthanum sulfide/molybdenum sulfide (La2S3-MoS2) catalyst. The formation of molybdenum sulfide nanosheets in situ with lanthanum sulfide deposition was achieved through a facile one-pot solvothermal strategy. The present catalyst displayed much superior activity for HER to pristine and commercial molybdenum sulfide; low overpotentials of 205 mV, 277 mV, 336 mV and 455 mV for the current densities of 10 mA cm(-2), 50 mA cm(-2), 100 mA cm(-2) and 200 mA cm(-2) were obtained, respectively, together with a low Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the present catalyst exhibited excellent stability in long-term hydrogen evolution. The remarkable HER performance might be mainly due to the expanded interlayer distance and the nano-interfaces between the molybdenum sulfide and lanthanum sulfide segments, which induced an increased exposure of active sites and a modified surface electronic structure.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000538156300008

Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)								e2201384	e2201384		10.1002/adma.202201384				2022-Sep-05	2022	The realization of practical nonaqueous lithium-air batteries (LABs) calls for novel strategies to address their numerous theoretical and technical challenges. LiOH formation/decomposition has recently been proposed as a promising alternative route to cycling LABs via Li2 O2 . Herein, the progress in developing LiOH-based nonaqueous lithium-air batteries is reviewed. Various catalytic systems, either soluble or solid-state, that can activate a LiOH-based electrochemistry are compared in detail, with emphasis in providing an updated understanding of the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in nonaqueous media. We identify the key factors that can switch the cell chemistry between Li2 O2 and LiOH and highlight the debate around these routes, as well as rationalizing potential causes for these opposing opinions. The identities of the reaction intermediates, activity of redox mediators and additives, location of reaction interfaces, causes of parasitic reactions, as well as the effect of CO2 on the LiOH electrochemistry, all play a critical role in altering the relative rates of a series of interconnected reactions and all warrant further investigation.

Herein, we report a novel and effective electrocatalyst consisting of carbon cloth supported nitrogen vacancies-enriched Ce-doped Ni3N hierarchical nanosheets (Ce-Ni3N@CC) to optimize the flat-footed UOR kinetics, especially the stiff rate-determine CO2 desorption step of UOR. Upon the introduction of valance state variable Ce, the resultant nitrogen vacancies enriched Ce-Ni3N@CC exhibits an enhanced UOR performance where the operation voltage requires only 1.31 V to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to that of Ni3N@CC catalyst (1.36 V) and other counterparts. Density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that the incorporation of Ce in Ni3N lowers the formation energy of nitrogen vacancies, resulting in rich nitrogen vacancies in Ce-Ni3N@CC. Moreover, the nitrogen vacancies together with Ce doping optimize the local charge distribution around Ni sites, and balance the adsorption energy of CO2 in the rate-determining step (RDS), as well as affect the initial adsorption structure of urea, leading to the superior UOR catalytic performance of Ce-Ni3N@CC. When integrating the Ce-Ni3N catalyst in UOR//HER and UOR//CO2R flow electrolyzer, both of them perform well with low operation voltage and robust long-term stability, proofing that the thermodynamically favorable UOR can act as a suitable substitute anodic reaction compared with that of OER. Our findings here not only provide a novel UOR catalyst but also offer a promising design strategy for the future development of energy-related devices.

A detailed characterization of the chemical and physical properties of the aqueous interface is provided in terms of structure, dynamics, electric field, work function, and spectroscopy, as a preliminary step into the modelling of the (110)-Co3O4 aqueous surface in more relevant electrochemical conditions. The water at the aqueous B-termination is, in particular, shown more dynamical than that at the A-termination and more "undisciplined": the water is indeed mostly an HB-acceptor with the solid, with an orientation of their dipole moments found opposite the field generated by the negative surface charge. At both aqueous interfaces, the work function is twice lower than that at the bare (non-hydroxylated) surfaces. The SFG (Sum Frequency Generation) spectroscopy is shown dominated by the water in the diffuse layer, while the SFG signal from the binding interfacial layer reflects the single orientation of water at the aqueous A-termination and the two orientations of water at the aqueous B-termination.

As a catalyst of the water oxidation reaction within photosystem II, the trace metal is responsible for the evolution of virtually all oxygen in the earth's atmosphere. Mn acts furthermore as an activator or cofactor of numerous enzymes involved in reactive oxygen species scavenging or central and secondary metabolism. While the sufficient supply of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms with Mn is obvious for maintaining photosynthetic activity, the avoidance of cellular Mn overload is also critical. In this review, current knowledge about the Mn homeostasis network in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.

The first step toward understanding this dramatic pH-dependent HOR/HER performance is to explain the pH-dependent hydrogen binding to the electrode, a perplexing behavior observed experimentally. In this work, we carried out Quantum Mechanics Molecular Dynamics (QMMD) with explicit considerations of solvent and applied voltage (U) to in situ simulate water/Pt(100) interface in the condition of under-potential adsorption of hydrogen (H-UPD). We found that as U is made more negative, the electrode tends to repel water, which in turn increases the hydrogen binding. We predicted a 0.13 eV increase in hydrogen binding from pH = 0.2 to pH = 12.8 with a slope of 10 meV/pH, which is close to the experimental observation of 8 to 12 meV/pH. Thus, we conclude that the changes in water adsorption are the major causes of pH-dependent hydrogen binding on a noble metal. The new insight of critical role of surface water in modifying electrochemical reactions provides a guideline in designing HER/HOR catalyst targeting for the alkaline electrolyte.									147	6	0	0	9	0	148			0002-7863			WOS:000436910300008	29792321

One key strategy for efficient large-scale production of hydrogen by water splitting is to design an electrode structure with low OER overpotential. Herein, a coaxial three-layer structure for the OER electrode is constructed by electroplating Ni on Cu mesh and then loading (Ni,Fe)OxHy catalyst via a modified solvothermal method. The obtained coaxial three-layer (Ni,Fe)OxHy/Ni/Cu mesh electrode exhibits an excellent OER performance with the overpotentials of 199 and 250 mV at 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) and stability for over 72 h in 1 M KOH. The plated Ni layer is critical for the coaxial three-layer (Ni,Fe)OxHy/Ni/Cu mesh structure since it improves its stability by preventing Cu from corroding and meanwhile enhances the adhesive strength of (Ni,Fe)OxHy to the substrate because of its poor crystallinity, which facilitates charge transfer and leads to the extremely low overpotentials. Compared with Ni foam and Ni mesh, Cu mesh is more suitable for high production rate and large-area water splitting at large overpotentials because of its excellent conductivity and lower series electric resistance (R-s). Together with the extremely low cost of Cu mesh, the present coaxial three-layer (Ni,Fe)OxHy/Ni/Cu mesh electrode is promising for future industrial application.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000526708900022

The as-deposited and lithiated ZnO thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy techniques. The discharge and charge measurement indicates that the reversible capacities of the as-deposited ZnO thin-film electrodes are more than one Li per Zn atom with an initial capacity of less than 2.75 Li per Zn atom, and more than 0.75 Li per Zn atom could not be explained by the alloying process of ZnO reaction with Li. The evolution of the in situ absorbance spectra exhibits a marked boundary of lithiating 2Li per Zn atom and provides a hint about two different lithiation reactions occurring during charging of the ZnO/Li cell. A new reaction mechanism of lithium with ZnO involving both the classical alloying process and the oxidation/reduction of nanosized metal is proposed.

Because of its high chemical corrosion resistance and stability in acid, TiO2 is a promising support material, yet with poor electrical conductivity. We herein theoretically examined the stability and the electronic properties of substituted rutile-phase titania, in which Ti is partly replaced by elements of the fourth, fifth and sixth period. For negative values of the calculated segregation energy, we conclude that the heteroelement M forms a solid solution for 25% or 50% substitution. For these heteroelements, we calculate the electrical conductivity. Since it is known that the electronic structure of transition metal oxides strongly depends on the applied theoretical method, we performed self-consistent optimizations of the Hartree-Fock contribution to the exchange functional in a hybrid functional for every compound. Experimentally, two favorable and two unfavorable elements were synthesized with 25% foreign metal concentration. The most promising candidates to improve the electronic properties of titania are Ta and Nb.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0361-5235	1543-186X		WOS:000721685300002

Diphenylphosphine-borane and methyldiphenylphosphine-borane reacted with various electrophiles to give phosphine-borane derivatives having a functional group. Diastereomerically pure secondary phorphine-boranes, (S(P))-and (R(P))-menthyloxyphenylphosphine-boranes, were prepared from dichlorophenylphosphine. These secondary phosphine-boranes underwent stereospecific alkylation and arylation reactions. The phosphorus-oxygen bond of the resulting phosphine-boranes was reductively cleaved by lithium naphthalenide in an almost quantitative yield with virtually net retention of configuration. A new and efficient route to bidentate phosphine ligands with homochiral phosphine center has been established on the basis of these stereochemical studies on the substitution reactions at chiral phosphorus. Functionalizations of the boranato group of phosphine-boranes have been investigated. Trialkylphosphine-boranes reacted with methanesulfonic acid or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid with evolution of hydrogen. The resulting sulfonates were subjected to nucleophilic substitution reactions with various nucleophiles including carbon nucleophiles. A new phosphine-borane having a P-B-P-B-P-B-P-B bond linkage was synthesized.									7	0	0	0	0	0	8			0037-9980			WOS:A1993KU65800004

Illumination of the PS II membranes with continuous or flashing light in the presence of 0.1 mM Mn2+ reactivated O-2 evolution and increased the level of the HP form of Cyt b-559 with a concomitant decrease in the level of the LP form. When illumination was achieved with flashing light, the restoration of the HP form occurred after two flashes, while reactivation of O-2 evolution required more than six flashes. It was also found that the HP form could be restored when the PS II membranes were illuminated in the presence of artificial electron donors instead of Mn2+. NH2OH (10-100 mu M), 1,5-diphenylcarbazide (50-100 mu M) and semicarbazide (0.5-1 mM) were effective in restoring the HP form. These observations suggest that, under photoactivation conditions, not the reconstitution of the Mn cluster but electron donation by Mn2+ to PS II is responsible for the restoration of the HP form. The restoration of the HP form by illumination in the presence of Mn2+ was not affected by 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) but it was completely suppressed by artificial electron accepters which bind to the Q(B) site and reoxidize Q(A)(-) namely, 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DBMIB) and 2,6-dichlero-1,4-benzoquinone. These results suggest that some redox reaction(s) at the acceptor side of PS II, which probably involves Q(A)(-) occurs during the course of the restoration of the KP form.									26	0	1	0	16	0	27			0005-2728			WOS:A1997WF46100012

However, their cycle stability deteriorates significantly with increasing mass loading due to the sluggish electrolyte ion diffusion kinetics and limited accessible surface area. Herein, commercial-level mass-loading MnO2 up to 9.14 mg cm(-2) with rational ion diffusion channels was fabricated by a gassing-assisted electrodeposition route, in which MnO2 was deposited at an over-potential with an obvious oxygen evolution reaction. The robust channels in MnO2 not only facilitate the electrolyte ion diffusion process but also increase the accessible area for the insertion/extraction of electrolyte ions during electrochemical reactions. The resultant MnO2-based electrode exhibits the highest areal capacitance of 1.57 F cm(-2) (in a Na+-based aqueous electrolyte), with a rate retention percentage of 76% when the current density increases by 20-fold. More impressively, the configured hybrid ion supercapacitor device with the fabricated MnO2 as a cathode delivers excellent cycle stability (in ion electrolytes Na+, Zn2+, and Mg2+), superior to most reported state-of-the-art energy storage devices. The proposed strategy here will provide a new opportunity for promoting the further development and practical application of aqueous energy storage devices by enhancing the true performance under a commercial-level mass-loading.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000684628500001

However, precisely how this could be achieved in a cheap and sustainable way remains a puzzle for scientists since the electrochemical kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the major limitation. Increasing interest surrounds the development of low energy consumption electrolyzers capable of oxidizing selectively biomass-based organics instead of water for a dual production of chemicals (paired electrosynthesis). Also, the state-of-the-art electrocatalyst is in the form of nanoparticles either dispersed on carbon supports or in liquids in the presence of stabilizers to prevent the nanoparticles' aggregation, detachment and performance loss. In this report, free-standing surfactant- and binder-free silver-gold nanoporous and nanoalloyed catalysts are successfully synthesized via a simple and effective approach directly on a gas diffusion electrode (GDE@AgAu). Physicochemical and electrocatalytic analyses show that the obtained activity and selectivity of metallic nanocatalysts towards the glycerol electrooxidation reaction in alkaline media depend on their morphology and composition. Specifically, an onset potential of E-onset = 0.3 V vs. RHE and a record peak current density of j(peak) = 18 A mg(Au)(-1) (290 mA cm(-2)) at GDE@AgAu in comparison with those of the tested commercial Au/C catalyst (E-onset = 0.7 V vs. RHE and j(peak) = 2.8 A mg(Au)(-1) or 44 mA cm(-2)) were obtained. Also, an unprecedented selectivity in glycerol electrooxidation towards two products of high interest, formate (66%) and glycolate (32%), has been obtained. GDE@AgAu is thus a potential substitute as an anode material for commercial Au and Pt-based catalysts for efficient alcohol electroreforming with low energy consumption and cogeneration of H-2, CO2 or N-2 electrolyzers. The present method that combines direct growth, galvanic replacement and nanostructuration provides a smart route for creating new designs for catalyst nanofabrication in order to target high electrocatalytic performance.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000536095500060

The current investigation focuses on the theoretical understanding of the electronic characteristics, surface activity, and stability of different low-index surfaces of BiVO4 toward water splitting-using first-principle calculations. The results indicate that BiVO4 has four types of low-index surfaces, namely, (0I0)T1, (010)T2, (110)1'1, and ((1) over bar 11)T1. The different band edge potentials of the surfaces, resulting from the variation of the electrostatic potential, lead to a higher oxidation ability for (010)T1 and (010)1'2 than for (110)T1 and ((1) over bar 11)T1 surfaces. The electrons prefer to accumulate on (010)T1 and (010)T2 surfaces, whereas holes like to accumulate on (110)T1 and ((1) over bar 11)T1 surfaces during, a photocatalytic process. Moreover, investigation on the adsorbed intermediates during the water-splitting, process indicates that the oxygen evolution reaction on BiVO4 surfaces is mainly dominated by the reaction OH* <->* 0* + H+ + e(-), and (110)T1 and (1-14)T1 surfaces are energetically more favorable as photoanodes for water splitting than (010)11 arid (010)T2. Furthermore, the BiVO4 surface as photoanodes tend to be=,unstable and can easily be corroded with or without the presence "of an oxidative environment, however, there is an exception for the BiVO4 (010)T1 and (010)T2 surfaces, which are thermodynamically stable in the solution when there are no strong oxidative species. These results provide important insights into the anisotropy behaviors among low-index surfaces of BiVO4 for photocatalytic reactions.									70	1	0	0	9	0	70			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000425572700035	29350028	
J	GLEITER, HM; HAAG, E; INOUE, Y; RENGER, G								FUNCTIONAL-CHARACTERIZATION OF A PURIFIED HOMOGENEOUS PHOTOSYSTEM-II CORE COMPLEX WITH HIGH OXYGEN EVOLUTION CAPACITY FROM SPINACH								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				35	1			41	53		10.1007/BF02185410				JAN 1993	1993	The functional properties of a purified homogeneous spinach PS II-core complex with high oxygen evolution capacity (Haag et al. 1990a) were investigated in detail by measuring thermoluminescence and oscillation patterns of flash induced oxygen evolution and fluorescence quantum yield changes. The following results were obtained: a) Depending on the illumination conditions the PS II-core complexes exhibit several thermoluminescence bands corresponding to the A band, Q band and Z(v) band in PS II membrane fragments. The lifetime of the Q band (T(max) = 10-degrees-C) was determined to be 8 s at T = 10-degrees-C. No B band corresponding to S2Q(B)- or S3Q(B)- recombination could be detected. b) The flash induced transient fluorescence quantum yield changes exhibit a multiphasic relaxation kinetics which reflect the reoxidation of Q(A)-. In control samples without exogenous acceptors this process is markedly slower than in PS II membrane fragments. The reaction becomes significantly retarded by addition of 10 muM DCMU. After dark incubation in the presence of K3[Fe(CN)6], the electron transfer from Q(A)- to the oxidized endogenous iron center Fe3+ takes place with a half time of less than 10 mus. In the presence of phenyl-p-benzoquinone (Ph-p-BQ) a period two oscillation is observed, corresponding to photoreductant induced oxidation of Fe2+ by Ph-p-BQ. This finding supports the existence of a partially functioning binding site for Ph-p-BQ. c) Excitation of dark-adapted samples with a train of short saturating flashes gives rise to a typical pattern dominated by a high O2 yield due to the third flash and a highly damped period four oscillation. The decay of redox states S2 and S3 are dominated by short life times of 4.3 s and 1.5 s, respectively, at 20-degrees-C.The results of the present study reveal that in purified homogeneous PS II-core complexes with high oxygen evolution isolated from higher plants by beta-dodecylmaltoside solubilization the thermodynamic properties and the kinetic parameters of the redox groups leading to electron transfer from water to Q(A) are well preserved. The most obvious phenomenon is a severe modification of the Q(B) binding site. The implications of this findings are discussed.									32	0	0	0	26	0	32			0166-8595			WOS:A1993KJ28800005	24318619

Their study is focused on the analysis of the effect of the oxygen addition to C4F8 plasma during the deposition pulse. This is the complementary study that the authors have recently published which was dedicated to the Bosch process under pure SF6 plasma used in etching pulse and pure C4F8 plasma used in polymer deposition pulse. Parametric study about the effect of the oxygen percentage on the reactive species flux evolution and their impact on the deposition kinetic during the deposition pulse has been performed. The simulation results reveal that for a low %O-2 in a C4F8/O-2 plasma mixture, the atomic fluorine density increases because of the volume reactions, especially recombinations between CFx and O which favor the production of fluorine. This leads to the decrease of CFx to F flux ratio. Ion energy distribution functions (IEDF) plotting reveals the impact of both %O-2 and mass of the positive ions on the IEDF shape. Finally, both the experimental and simulation results show that in their pressure range, the addition of O-2 to C4F8 plasma has a weak impact on the silicon etch profile and the etching rate, except for a high %O-2 which the etch anisotropy begins to be degraded.

Characterization results showed that imidazole modification can improve the visible light harvesting, interfacial charge transfer and separation of g-C3N4, without destroying its pristine framework structure. The as-obtained imidazole modified g-C3N4 showed remarkably enhanced and rather stable photocatalytic performance in H-2 evolution, photo-degradation of water contaminants and selective photo-oxidation of benzyl alcohol, demonstrating its all-round applications as a versatile photocatalyst. The weight ratio between imidazole and urea was well tuned and the optimal photocatalytic activity was obtained, which shows CNU-I50 sample (50 mg imidazole in 15 g urea) possesses the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 2150 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), superior to most of the previous reported g-C3N4 materials. These results suggest that those imidazole modified g-C3N4 materials are potential photocatalyst when applied to solar energy conversion, water purification and selective photosynthesis reactions.

Unfortunately, a clear picture of how Li/TM/O ions are transported and electrons are transferred during the synthesis of these compounds is still missing, especially when cubic closepacked (ccp) anion sublattices are involved, as it is the case for spinel, layered, or rock-salt systems. In the present study, a series of layered Li(Ni,Co,Mn)O-2 oxides were chosen as target materials to elucidate the underlying formation mechanism of these compounds during the high-temperature lithiation reaction. The consistent experimental results demonstrate that, as lithium ions are inserted from the surface to the bulk, some TM cations located within the bulk of crystallites are able to diffuse to the near-surface region. They create cation vacancies for the inserted lithium ions, and the mass transport behavior of these elements is driven by the chemical potential gradient. Concurrently, oxygen anions from lithium oxides and/or ambient oxygen are adsorbed and incorporated into the ccp oxygen lattice on the surface structure, connecting the relocated TM cations and the incorporated lithium ions by forming ionic bonds. This process is concomitant with crystal growth, surface reorganization caused by phase transformation, and occurrence and disappearance of pores.									28	1	0	0	0	0	27			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000543738500010

A HT-PEWE unit cell with a 4-cm(2) electrode consisting of Nafion117-based catalyst-coated membrane with IrO2 and Pt/C as the oxygen and hydrogen evolution catalysts is fabricated, and its electrolysis voltage and high-frequency resistance are assessed. The cell temperature and pressure are controlled at 80-130 degrees C and 0.1-0.5 MPa, respectively. It is observed that increasing the temperature at a constant pressure of 0.1 MPa does not increase the ohmic overvoltage of the cell; however, it does increase the concentration overvoltage. It is also found that the increase in the overvoltage resulting from the rise in the temperature can be suppressed by elevating the pressure. When operating the cell at a temperature of 100 degrees C, pressure greater than 0.1 MPa suppresses the overvoltage, and so does pressures greater than 0.3 MPa at 130 degrees C. This behavior suggests that keeping the water in a liquid water phase by increasing the pressure is critical for operating PEWEs at high temperatures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we have precisely synthesized an efficient, stable, earth-abundant metal-based NiFe2O4/rGO hybrid OER electrocatalysts by a simple solvothermal method. The measurements including XRD, FTIR, XPS, EDS, SEM, and TEM revealed the prominent structural integrity of catalyst with crystal-layered structure. The rich oxidation chemistry of transition metals and substantially active carbon substrate allows tuning of their electronic properties concerning their concentration, composition, and morphology. The effect of different Ni wt.% (0%, 2%, 4%, and 6%) on the morphology of hybrid as well as on electrochemical performance investigated. The protocols like overpotential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), Tafel slope, ECSA, RF, EIS, stability was utilized to examine the overall abilities of electrocatalyst in alkaline 1 M KOH solution. The optimized NiFe2O4/rGO hybrid with 2 wt % Ni exhibited the excellent OER performance, which delivers a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of only 302 mV with a small Tafel slope of 63 mV/dec. The high activity of the catalyst is attributed to the synergistic effect of the crystal-layered structure as well as rapid mass-charge transfer. Such, rational design concept of anchoring non-precious metal on carbon in a controlled manner, offering splendid flexibility to tailor electrochemical OER performance. The optimized variations in metal concentration and morphologies, providing a promising route to develop a cost-effective catalyst for advanced energy conversion applications.

The role of iridium oxide in the improvement of the electrocatalytic, capacitive and stability properties of titanium anodes activated by a RuO(2)-TiO(2) coating is discussed. The oxide sols were prepared by forced hydrolysis of the metal chlorides. The characterization by dynamic light scattering and X-ray diffraction showed that polydisperse oxide sols were obtained with the particles tending to form agglomerates. The presence of IrO(2) causes a suppression of the X-ray diffraction peaks of TiO(2) and RuO(2) in the sol-gel prepared Ti(0.6)Ir(0.4)O(2) and Ti(0.6)Ru(0.3)Ir(0.1)O(2) coatings. The IrO(2)-containing coatings had an enhanced charge storage ability and activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in comparison to Ti(0.6)Ru(0.4)O(2) coating. The voltammogram of the Ti(0.6)Ir(0.4)O(2)/Ti electrode showed well-resolved peaks related to Ir redox transitions, which are responsible for the enhanced charge storage ability of IrO(2)-containing coatings. Redox transitions of Ir were also registered in the high-frequency domain of the ac impedance spectra of the coatings as a semicircle with characteristics insensitive to the electrolyte composition and to the electrode potential prior to OER. However, the semicircle characteristics were different for the two IrO(2)-containing coatings, as well as at potentials outside the OER in comparison to those at which the OER occurs.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			1463-9076			WOS:000279514500024	20544088

Through substitution on the cyclometalating ligands of these complexes, it is shown that a broad range of oxidation potentials can be achieved within this class of catalyst. Parallel, dynamic monitoring of oxygen evolution, made possible by equipping reaction vessels with pressure-voltage transducers, facilitates correlation of these complexes' ionization potentials with their respective activity toward water oxidation. The importance of these catalysts lies in (A) their ability to oxidize water in a purely aqueous medium, (B) their simplicity of design, (C) their durability, and (D) the ease with which they can be tuned to accommodate the electrochemical needs of photosensitizers in hypothetical photochemical water oxidation and full artificial photosynthetic schemes.									519	11	0	0	63	1	527			0002-7863			WOS:000252127500041	18062690

Photo-acclimatization was evident from changes of cellular chlorophyll a content, growth rates, and light response curves. Each of the applied methods evaluates different parts and reactions in the photosynthetic apparatus, which makes a direct quantitative comparison of rates difficult, although a different degree of correlation were found between all three methods. However, when used in combination, they provide information about the internal relationship of photosynthetic pathways as well as the variation in photosynthetic capacity between individual cells within a single algal culture.									6	0	0	0	4	0	6			1226-2617	2093-0860		WOS:000356951900003		
J	Groppo, Chiara; Castelli, Daniele								Prograde P-T Evolution of a Lawsonite Eclogite from the Monviso Meta-ophiolite (Western Alps): Dehydration and Redox Reactions during Subduction of Oceanic FeTi-oxide Gabbro								JOURNAL OF PETROLOGY				51	12			2489	2514		10.1093/petrology/egq065				DEC 2010	2010	Lawsonite eclogites represent fossil records of processes occurring during subduction of cold- and fast-subducting slabs, and provide an opportunity to investigate the thermal and metamorphic evolution of palaeosubduction zones. Occurrences of lawsonite eclogites are rare because lawsonite is often replaced during exhumation. We report here, for the first time, the occurrence of a lawsonite eclogite from the Monviso meta-ophiolite (Western Alps), representing the product of the Alpine metamorphism of a FeTi-oxide gabbro. The prograde metamorphic evolution of this lawsonite eclogite has been investigated using the petrological approach of pseudosections. The reconstruction of its prograde P-T evolution allowed us to monitor changes in chemical and physical properties (mineral assemblages and compositions, density, H2O content, oxygen fugacity) during subduction. The pseudosection modelling suggests peak metamorphic conditions of T epsilon 550 degrees C, P = 25-26 kbar, and a decrease in the thermal gradient during subduction from about 9 degrees C km(-1) to less than 7 degrees C km(-1), which may be interpreted as related to an increase in the subduction rate. During its prograde evolution, at a depth of about 65-70 km, the eclogite-facies metagabbro experienced a significant dehydration passing from the Grt(1) + Omp(1) + Lws + Chl + Qtz + Rt assemblage (stage I) to the Grt(2) + Omp(2) + Tlc + Qtz + Rt assemblage (stage II). The breakdown of lawsonite and chlorite caused the release of up to 3 wt % of H2O and also of oxygen, as modelled by the redox equilibrium Lws + Qtz + Chl + Omp(1) = Grt + Omp(2) + H2O + O-2. This redox-equilibrium represents the boundary between an earlier, more oxidized assemblage (stage I), stable at lower T, and a later, more reduced assemblage (stage II), stable at higher T. These results have possible implications for the understanding of the complex interactions between crust and mantle in subduction zones, especially in clarifying the processes locally involved in the oxidation of the mantle wedge overlying the subducting slab.									120	11	1	0	1	0	125			0022-3530	1460-2415		WOS:000284947300005

Attaching chemical groups, like COOH and OH, to the edges has been successfully attained with negligible deformation and moderate binding energy. They are semiconductors with energy gap similar to 2.3 eV that slightly affected by attaching groups such as C2H5 or significantly decreases to 1.8 eV by attaching NO. The optical gaps, from 1.5 eV to 2 eV, are lower than the electronic ones which indicate the existence of excitonic transitions that appear due to the quantum confinement in the finite nanoribbons. Oxygen evolution on the edges shows better catalytic activity than on the surface due to the moderate adsorption of reaction intermediates in the former. Thus, the nanoribbons are preferable for water oxidation than the bulk antimonene. Attaching chemical groups slightly worsen the process due to the stronger adsorption of reaction intermediates. A minimum overpotential of 0.38 V has been achieved in unmodified zigzag-nanoribbons. This value in addition to the appropriate energy gap make antimonene nanoribbons excellent photocatalysts for water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0031-8949	1402-4896		WOS:000752042900001

Meanwhile, quantitative understanding of the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters to maneuver the shape evolution of nanocrystals in a one-pot system still deserves investigation. Herein, a systematic study of the density functional theory (DFT)-calculated adsorption energy, thermodynamic factors, and reduction kinetics on Pd growth patterns is reported by combining theory and experiments, with a focus on the dispersed state of additives. As pure models, monodispersed Pd tetrahedrons enclosed by (111) facets with a narrow size distribution of 4.9 +/- 1 nm and a high purity approaching 98% can be obtained when using 1,1 '-binaphthalene (C20H14) +2NH(3) as additives. Specifically, laciniate Pd nanourchins (Pd LUs) can evolve via anisotropic growth when replacing additive with dose-consistent 1,1 '-binaphthyl-2,2 '-diamine (C20H16N2, two -NH2 binding in C20H14). Catalytic investigations show that the sub-5 nm Pd tetrahedrons exhibit higher activity in both the oxygen reduction (E-onset = 1.025 V, E-1/2 = 0.864 V) and formic acid oxidation reaction with respect to the Pd LUs and Pd black, which represents a great step for the development of well-defined Pd nanocrystals with size in the sub-5 nm regime as non-Pt electrocatalysts.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000505316300001	31899600

First-principles density functional theory calculations (DFT) and electrochemical measurements were performed to elucidate the electronic structure and the energy band locations. It was found that the as-synthesized Sr2CuInO3S photocatalyst has appreciate conduction and valence band positions for hydrogen and oxygen evolution, respectively.

In this work, we developed two novel layered bismuth-based borate photocatalysts CaBi2B2O7 (CBBO) and SrBi2B2O7 (SBBO) via solid-phase reaction. The crystal structure, microstructure and optical properties were investigated. The photocatalytic activities were studied by decomposition of tetracycline hydrochloride (TH) and evolution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under UV light irradiation. The results revealed that CBBO and SBBO exhibit benign TH degradation activity with certain mineralization abilities. Within 4 min illumination, almost 70% and 58% of tetracycline hydrochloride was degraded by CBBO and SBBO, respectively. The quantitative capture experiment of radicals showed that the production rate of (OH)-O-center dot and O-center dot(2)- was determined to be 1.27x10(-7) and 10.98x10(-7) mol.L-1 min(-1) for CBBO and 1.01x10(-7) and 11.75x10(-7) mol.L-1 min(-1) for SBBO, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results demonstrated that CBBO has smaller effective masses of electrons and holes than SBBO, which results in higher charge separation efficiency and photocatalytic activity. This work provides two new layered bismuth-based borate photocatalysts for photocatalytic environmental applications.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000499647200028

An electron probe microanalyzer was used to clarify in detail relevant aspects of the reaction with consequences for the conception of interpretative kinetic models. Spherical particles of iron with controlled grain sizes were used after being subjected to a previous washing with diluted acid in order to remove oxidation products. These spheres were immersed in solutions of Cr(VI) in nonagitated flasks using different operating procedures. The iron particles were photographed so that the time evolution of the grain size distribution could be established. A sample of the iron balls after the reaction and samples of the raw material and the precipitates of the reaction products were analyzed by backscattering electron images and elemental mapping produced by wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy. The analysis of the spatial distribution of the concentrations in iron, oxygen, and chromium indicates that there are three distinct mechanisms for the reaction with different limiting steps.									7	0	0	0	4	0	7			0743-7463			WOS:000279756700054	20578753

In this work, a novel electrode of three-dimensional network-like Ni2P-MoS2 heterogeneous nanosheet arrays on carbon cloth (HNSAs/CC) was designed and fabricated by a two-step strategy. Benefiting from the unique 3D hierarchical architecture, large specific surface area, synergistic effects between Ni2P and MoS2, and the support of highly conductive carbon cloth, the obtained electrode exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER) in 1 mol L-1 KOH aqueous solution with extremely low overpotentials of 78 and 258 mV respectively to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The electrocatalytic system assembled with the obtained Ni2P-MoS2 HNSAs/CC sample as both anode and cathode for overall water splitting requires an impressively low onset potential of only 1.574 V to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and displays an excellent long-term stability. According to density functional theory calculation, the enhanced water splitting activity could be mainly attributed to the modified interfacial electronic structures and the enhanced thermoneutral adsorption of absorbates on the surface of Ni2P (110) - MoS2 (100) heterostructure. The calculated theoretical overpotentials for HER and OER based on Ni2P (110) - MoS2 (100) heterostructure are 0.019 and 0.279 V, respectively. The facile synthesis method and insights into the HER and OER active interfaces reported here will advance the development of high-performance bifunctional overall water splitting electrocatalysts.

Phase evolution of LiAl5-xZnxO8-0.5x was determined by XRD analysis. The XRD results indicated that the phase compositions had a P4332 space group when 0 les x les 0.2 and a spinel structure when 0.3 les x les 0.5. The dielectric constant (epsilonr) of this series' solid solutions decreased with the increase in Zn doping content, which was in good agreement with the Clausius-Mossotti relation. Oxygen vacancy and the decreased degree of order degraded the quality factor (Qtimesf) of the two structures. The deterioration in quality factor was further verified by impedance spectroscopy. The temperature coefficient of the resonant frequency (tauf) decreased with the increase in x and was correlated with the unit cell volume. Finally, CaTiO3 was used as a compensation material to obtain a near-zero tauf of the LiAl5O8 ceramic.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-7820			INSPEC:20522415

The infrared (IR) spectra of deposited matrices revealed the presence of isolated monomers, dimers, and intermolecular H2O....CO2 complexes. Irradiation resulted in effective decomposition of matrix-isolated carbon dioxide and water yielding CO molecules and OH radicals, respectively. Annealing of the irradiated samples led to formation of O-3, HO2, and a number of xenon hydrides of HXeY type (in the case of xenon matrices). The formation of these species was used for monitoring of the postirradiation thermally induced chemical reactions involving O and H atoms generated by radiolysis. It was shown that the radiolysis of CO2 in noble-gas matrices produced high yields of stabilized oxygen atoms. In all cases, the temperatures at which O atoms become mobile and react are lower than those of H atoms. Dynamics and reactivity of oxygen atoms was found to be independent of the precursor nature. In addition, the formation of HOCO radicals was observed in all the noble-gas matrices at remarkably low temperatures. The IR spectra of HOCO and DOCO were first characterized in krypton and xenon matrices. It was concluded that the formation of HOCO was mainly due to the radiation-induced evolution of the weakly bound H2O.....CO2 complexes. This result indicates the significance of weak intermolecular interactions in the radiation-induced chemical processes in inert low-temperature media.									39	0	0	0	3	0	39			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000351557300043	25469518

MAGNETRON SPUTTERED IRIDIUM OXIDE AS ANODE CATALYST FOR PEM HYDROGEN GENERATION								MACEDONIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY AND CHEMICAL ENGINEERING				30	1			45	54						2011	2011	Thin films of iridium oxide are deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering. The influence of oxygen partial pressure in the sputtering plasma on the composition, surface structure and morphology of the films has been studied by XRD, SEM, AFM and XPS analysis. An optimal combination of sputtering parameters yields stable microporous amorphous films with highly extended fractal surface. The electrochemical properties of these films are investigated in view of their application as catalysts for PEM water splitting, using the electrochemical techniques of cyclovoltammetry and steady state polarization. A morphology factor assessing the catalyst active surface for a series of sputtered samples with varying thickness/loading is determined and correlated to the catalytic efficiency. It has been proven that iridium oxide is a very efficient catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The best performance with anodic current density of 0.3 A cm(-2) at potential of 1.55 V (vs. RHE) shows the 500 nm thick film containing 0.2 mg cm(-2) catalyst. These results combined with the established long-term mechanical stability of the sputtered iridium oxide films (SIROFs) prove the advantages of the reactive magnetron sputtering as simple and reliable method for preparation of catalysts with precisely controlled composition, loading, and surface characteristics.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1857-5552	1857-5625		WOS:000292479200004

Tuning material structure can be achieved by controlling an external force imposed on materials and inducing stress-strain responses (i.e., applying dynamic strain). Electroactive thin films are typically deposited on shape or volume tunable elastic substrates, where mechanical loading (i.e., compression or tension) can affect film structure and function through imposed strain. Here, we summarize methods for straining n-type doped titanium dioxide (TiO2) films prepared by a thermal treatment of a pseudoelastic nickel-titanium alloy (Nitinol). The main purpose of the described methods is to study how strain affects electrocatalytic activities of metal oxide, specifically hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions. The same system can be adapted to study the effect of strain more broadly. Strain engineering can be applied for optimization of a material function, as well as for design of adjustable, multifunctional (photo)electrocatalytic materials under external stress control.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1940-087X			WOS:000585806100044	32804166

The reaction is catalyzed by single-site, oxygen coordinated metal cations on various supports. Using two different metals, namely Au and Pt, we have found that the two metals form similarly-structured active sites, comprising isolated metal cations, coordinated with several -O bonds to a metal oxide that serves as the support of the active gold or platinum species. The support can be a reducible oxide, e.g. CeO2, FeOx, TiO2, a non-reducible oxide, e.g. silica, zeolites, alumina, or even a non-oxide support, like carbon nanotubes. In the latter cases, alkali (Na, K)-Ox-linkages are used as a first shell around the metal ion center, stabilizing it, and supplying the -OH species necessary for the reaction. The turnover rates per catalytic site are similar on any support, specific only to the nature of the metal cation of the active site: Au(I) or Pt(II). Accordingly, the apparent activation energy, E-app, is different for each metal; 45 +/- 5 kJ/mol for gold, and 70 +/- 10 kJ/mol for the platinum catalysts. The evolution of preparation methods from those involving mixed metal structures (nanoparticles, clusters, and atoms) to novel ones that give exclusively single-atom metal catalytic centers on a support is discussed. The latter materials may be used as a platform to check whether a reaction occurs via single-atom catalytic centers. The findings are general and can be easily extended to other oxygen-coordinated metal ions on supports for the WGS reaction.

Here, using Au-nanoparticle-decorated Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets [Ni(OH)(2)-Au] as catalysts, we demonstrate that the photon-induced surface plasmon resonance (SPR) excitation on Au nanoparticles could significantly activate the OER catalysis, specifically achieving a more than 4 fold enhanced activity and meanwhile affording a markedly decreased over potential of 270 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 35 mV dec(-1) (no iR-correction), which is much better than those of the benchmark IrO2 and RuO2, as well as most Ni-based OER catalysts reported to date. The synergy of the enhanced generation of Ni-III/IV active species and the improved charge transfer, both induced by hot-electron excitation on Au nanoparticles, is proposed to account for such a markedly increased activity. The SPR-enhanced OER catalysis could also be observed over cobalt oxide (CoO) Au and iron oxy-hydroxide (FeOOH) Au catalysts, suggesting the generality of this strategy. These findings highlight the possibility of activating OER catalysis by plasmonic excitation and could open new avenues toward the design of more-energy-efficient catalytic water oxidation systems with the assistance of light energy.									267	8	0	0	8	0	268			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000380730000032	27380539

The electrocatalytic properties of these materials were systematically investigated for catalyzing both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. Extensive characterization was correlated with the activity study by investigating the crystal structures (XRD, HRTEM), morphologies (SEM), porosities (BET), surfaces (XPS, O-2-TPD/MS), and electrochemical properties (Tafel analysis, Koutechy-Levich plots, and constant-current electrolysis). These combined results show that the electrocatalytic activities are strongly dependent on the crystallographic structures, and follow an order of alpha-MnO2 > AMO > beta-MnO2 > delta-MnO2. Both OER studies and ORR studies reveal similar structure-determined activity trends in alkaline media. In the OER studies, alpha-MnO2 displays an overpotential of 490 mV compared to 380 mV shown by an Ir/C catalyst in reaching 10 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, alpha-MnO2 also exhibits stability for 3 h when supplying a constant current density of 5 mA cm(-2). This was further improved by adding Ni2+ dopants (ca. 8 h). The superior OER activity was attributed to several factors, including abundant di-mu-oxo bridges existing in alpha-MnO2 as the protonation sites, analogous to the OEC in PS-II of the natural water oxidation system; the mixed valencies (AOS = 3.7); and the lowest charge transfer resistances (91.8 Omega, eta = 430 mV) as revealed from in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In the ORR studies, when reaching 3 mA cm(-2), alpha-MnO2 shows 760 mV close to 860 mV for the best ORR catalyst (20% Pt/C). The outstanding ORR activity was due to the strongest O-2 adsorption capability of alpha-MnO2 suggested by temperature-programmed desorption. As a result, this discovery of the structure-related electrocatalytic activities could provide guidance in the further development of easily prepared, scalable, and low-cost catalysts based on metal oxides and their derivatives.									764	33	0	0	61	0	772			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000340442700043	25058174

However, the mechanism of catalytic decomposition of AP in the presence of CuO is still uncertain. Amount of gaseous products at various decomposition temperatures of AP in the presence and absence of CuO is lacking. Herein, a systematic study using thermogravimetry-mass spectroscopy (TG-MS) was carried out to evaluate the effect of CuO on AP decomposition mechanism. A novel hydrothermal method was reported for the preparation of nanosized copper oxide. The conversion of precursor Cu(NO3)(2).3H(2)O to intermediate Cu-2(NO3)(OH)(3) was accomplished by in situ carbonization of small quantity of cotton fiber in the hydrothermal reaction chamber. pH of the reaction medium was controlled by utilizing the nitric acid in the reaction medium by in situ carbonization of cotton. This synthetic method aimed to minimize the shape-controlling agents and strong alkali for controlling the pH of the reaction medium for the preparation of catalyst grade CuO. Evolved gas analysis of AP decomposition products by TG-MS showed increased oxygen, chlorine and nitrogen evolution and decreased ammonia evolution in the presence of CuO, compared with that of AP without catalyst. This confirmed the enhanced interaction of ammonia and perchloric acid; the initial decomposition products of AP; and their further reaction in the presence of CuO. The change in composition of volatile products indicates change in mechanism of AP decomposition from proton transfer to electron transfer in the presence of CuO.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000491352500001

Here, we report a comprehensive method to improve the PEC water oxidation performance of a hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) photoanode, that is, fluorine doping and an ultrathin amorphous cobalt silicate (Co-Sil) oxygen evolution reaction (OER) cocatalyst by photo-assisted electrophoretic deposition (PEPD). Detailed investigations reveal that fluorine doping can reduce the interfacial transfer resistance of charge and increase the carrier density to improve the conductivity of hematite. Also, simultaneously, the Co-Sil is used as an excellent OER cocatalyst to accelerate OER kinetics. Specifically, surface reconstruction of cobalt species occurred, and its average oxidation state increased significantly, which was more conducive to water oxidation. In addition, the presence of silicate groups could reduce the OOH* adsorption free energy. The synergistic effect of these efforts significantly reduced the onset potential and overpotential and enhanced the charge separation of the alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode, resulting in an excellent photocurrent density around 2.61 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs RHE (4.75 times higher than the primitive alpha-Fe2O3). This work provides a feasible strategy for the construction and development of a potential hematite photoanode.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000709458200023	34607433

Rational design of the electrocatalytic interface, including selection of electrode and electrolyte compositions and their optimal structure, requires establishing composition-structure-function relationships. Electronic structure calculations, most typically performed within the framework of density functional theory (DFT), help to develop these relationships by determining how elementary reaction energetics are impacted by electrocatalysis composition and structure. Though DFT methods can explain and predict catalytic behavior at the most fundamental level, they are challenged by difficulties in representing the length and time scales associated with processes at the dynamic electrode-electrolyte interface. In this chapter, we review the approaches used to approximate this interface with DFT for modeling electrocatalytic processes. We first review the challenges associated with modeling this interface, motivating an overview of the various approaches to model solvent and interface electrification. A more detailed emphasis is given to approaches to model the elementary kinetics of the inner sphere electron/ion transfer reactions that dictate activity and selectivity for processes occurring at solid electrode-liquid electrolyte interfaces.									17	1	0	0	2	0	17			0360-0564		978-0-12-815087-0	WOS:000453678900003		
J	Modak, Brindaban; Ghosh, Swapan K.								Origin of enhanced visible light driven water splitting by (Rh, Sb)-SrTiO3								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				17	23			15274	15283		10.1039/c5cp01374g				2015	2015	A systematic calculation, using hybrid density functional theory, has been carried out to investigate the origin of the enhancement of photo-conversion efficiency of Rh-doped SrTiO3 with codoping of Sb. In the case of Rh-doped SrTiO3, partially unoccupied states are introduced above the valence band, thus lowering the hole oxidation at the valence band (VB) drastically, which explains the poor oxygen evolution activity of Rh-doped SrTiO3. We show that the partially occupied t(2g) subset of the Rh 4d orbital is completely filled in the presence of Sb due to the transfer of the extra electron to the Rh center. As a result, acceptor states are completely passivated in the case of (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 and a continuous band structure with reduced band gap is formed, which is responsible for the observed enhanced photocatalytic activity of (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3. We have shown that the relative positions of the band edges of (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 with respect to the water redox levels are in favor of the spontaneous release of both hydrogen and oxygen during water splitting, which is consistent with the experimental observation. We have also studied the effect of codoping in different proportions (1 : 2 and 2 : 1) of Rh and Sb. Although 1 : 2 (Rh, Sb)-codoping leads to the formation of a clean band structure with the reduction of the band gap by a larger extent, it shows lower photo-conversion efficiency due to its charge non-compensated nature. In addition, the presence of acceptor states above the VB limits the oxygen evolution efficiency of 2 : 1 (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3. Thus, the present approach successfully reproduces the experimental features of the Rh-monodoped as well as (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 and also explains their origin.									32	0	0	0	1	0	32			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000355632900024	25992916

The band gap of the InGaN nanowires has been tuned to absorb a wide range of visible parts of electromagnetic spectrum by optimizing the composition of In:Ga. The photoelectrochemical analysis has been carried out for InGaN nanowires and that evidences the significant solar oxygen evolution reaction with a small onset potential of 0.234 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. From the analysis, it has been witnessed the maximum applied bias to photo-conversion efficiency of similar to 1% at the applied bias of 0.63 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. Moreover, the ultra-long stability of InGaN nanowires has been evidenced by 3000 s with a flat current density of 0.43 mA/cm(2) in chronoamperometry analysis.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000513057700002

In addition to ADN, some byproducts including propionitrile (PN) and 1,3,5-tricyanohexane (trimer) are also formed at the surface of the cathode. Since the open literature on the study of the parameters influencing the course of this reaction is scarce, the current study was launched to identify the effects of various process parameters on the selectivity of adiponitrile and its by-products. The electrosynthesis was conducted in an electromembrane reactor employing an oxygen-evolution dimensionally stable anode (DSA-O(2)(R)), a lead cathode, and a Nafion (R) 115 membrane. The concentration of all products was determined through NMR analysis. Process parameters under investigation were: temperature (25-55 degrees C), acrylonitrile concentration (15-30 wt%), current density (1-4 kA/m(2)), catholyte flow rate (100-400 mL/min) and catholyte pH (3-9). The results demonstrate that the selectivity of ADN is enhanced by increasing all studied process parameters, except the current density. In the case of by-products, the selectivity of PN decreases by raising AN concentration, flow rate, and pH. On the other hand, the selectivity of trimer was reduced by temperature, current density, and flow rate. (C) 2011 The Electrochemical Society.

Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Fe and Ni K-edges was used to study the changes in the overlayer with potential in the dark and under illumination conditions. Potential or illumination only had a minor effect on the Fe oxidation state, suggesting that Fe atoms do not accumulate significant amount of charge over the whole potential range. In contrast, the Ni K-edge spectra showed pronounced dependence on potential in the dark and under illumination. The effect of illumination is to shift the onset for the Ni oxidation because of the generated photovoltage and suggests that holes that are photogenerated in hematite are transferred mainly to the Ni atoms in the overlayer. The increase in the oxidation state of Ni proceeds at potentials corresponding to the redox wave of Ni, which occurs immediately prior to the onset of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Linear combination fitting analysis of the obtained spectra suggests that the overlayer does not have to be fully oxidized to promote oxygen evolution. Cathodic discharge measurements show that the photogenerated charge is stored almost exclusively in the Ni atoms within the volume of the overlayer.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			0743-7463			WOS:000580427900017	32900201

In this study, we have designed a simple strategy to fabricate carbon nanotubes-supported binary-nitrogen-carbon catalyst via wet-chemical method. Palladium and transitional metals (M, i.e. manganese cobalt and copper) nanoparticles are anchored through four-nitrogen system onto carbon nanotubes (denoted as PdM-N-4/CNTs). This material has been used as bifunctional electrocatalyst for electrochemical ethanol oxidation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction for the first time. The N-4-linked nanoparticles onto carbon nanotubes plays a crucial role in intrinsic catalytic activity for both reactions in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Among three PdM-N-4/CNTs catalysts, the PdMn-N-4/CNTs catalyst exhibits higher catalytic activity in terms of current density, mass activity and stability compared to the benchmark Pt/C. The robust electrocatalysis are inherited from the better attachment of PdMn through N-4-system onto carbon nanotubes, comparatively smaller particles formation with better dispersion and higher electrical conductivity.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			2045-2322			WOS:000477858900027	31363157

The studied additives in this work were all found to be capable of decreasing H-2 evolution, and could mitigate aluminium self-corrosion, with the corrosion inhibition towards the cathodic protection process. The less pitting corrosion and holes were observed for inorganic additives in comparison to the organic counterparts. The Al-air batteries demonstrated an improvement in the discharge capacities: 2604, 2393, 2348 and 2048 mAh g(-1) for Na2SO4, Na2SO3, C2H6SO, and C6H5SO2OH, respectively, in comparison to that associated with the 4M KOH (2021 mAh g(-1)). K2S2O8, an inorganic additive, exhibited a hydrogen evolution efficiency of 21%, but the lowest discharge performance (1973 mAh g(-1)). This may be due to the instability of the anions in redox reactions. The low inhibition efficiency of the hybrid additives in Al self-corrosion, when compared to single additives, may be ascribed to the involvement of Al3+ in complex formation of the inorganic-organic hybrid additives. A stable discharge-charge cycling test over 6 h with a voltage gap of around 0.7 V is observed for Na2SO4, demonstrating the efficient performance compared to the additive-free KOH electrolyte. It could be concluded that efficient additives containing SO group, successfully mitigated the self-corrosion and hydrogen evolution associated with the Al anode that was confirmed with DFT results.

Herein, cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in hierarchical N-doped carbon nanotube frameworks (CoP-HNCs) have been synthesized by controlled phosphidation of cobalt NPs embedded in hierarchical N-doped carbon nanotube frameworks (Co-HNCs). The Co-HNCs were prepared by direct carbonization of Co-based zeolitic imidazolate networks (ZIF-67). Benefitting from multiple structural and compositional features, such as a multitude of catalytically active sites, a high degree of graphitization, and a thin carbon layer enclosing the NPs, CoP-HNCs serve as a superior electrocatalyst towards the hydrogen evolution reaction. The synthesized CoP-HNCs delivered a low overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)) of 79 mV and 96 mV with small Tafel slope value of 45.6 m Vdec(-1) and 49.5 m Vdec(-1) in acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. In addition, the catalyst showed long-time durability under both acidic and alkaline electrolyte conditions, further demonstrating their potential to replace Pt-based precious catalysts.									35	1	0	0	4	0	35			2196-0216			WOS:000436934000004

Herein, we synthesized a flower-like V4P6.98/VO(PO3)(2) catalyst on a nickel foam substrate as an efficient non-noble metal catalyst for electrochemical hydrogen evolution in alkaline electrolyte. The catalyst showed high catalytic performance for HER, requiring an overpotential of 159mV to achieve 10 mA/cm(2), and displayed long-term stability in alkaline medium. We report a low-cost and high-efficiency non-noble metal HER catalyst beyond the commonly used transition metals (Ni, Co, Mo, Cu, and Fe), which expands the scope of non-noble-metal phosphide catalysts for water splitting.									5	2	0	0	0	0	6			2196-0216			WOS:000462598900006

However, poor morpho-logical characteristics and a small specific surface area limit itsfurther application. Here, hexagonal single-crystal two-dimensional(2D) CoS nanosheets with different thicknesses are successfullyprepared by an atmospheric-pressure chemical vapor depositionmethod. Because of the advantages of the 2D structure, moreexposed catalytic active sites, better reactant adsorption ability,accelerated electron transfer, and enhanced electrical conductivitiescan be achieved from the thinnest 5 nm CoS nanosheets (CoS-5),significantly improving OER performance. The electrochemical tests manifest that CoS-5 show an overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mAcm-2and a Tafel slope of 65.6 mV dec-1in the OER in an alkaline solution, superior to those for other thicknesses of CoS, bulkCoS, and RuO2. For the mechanistic investigation, the lowest charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the highest double-layercapacitance (Cdl) were obtained for CoS-5, demonstrating the faster OER kinetics and the larger active area. Density functionaltheory calculations further reveal the enhanced density of states around the Fermi level and higher H2O molecule adsorption energyfor thinner CoS nanosheets, promoting its intrinsic catalytic activity. Moreover, the two-electrode system with CoS-5 as the anodeand Pt/C as the cathode requires only 1.56 V to attain 10 mA cm-2in the overall water-splitting reaction. We believe that this studywill provide a fresh view for thickness-dependent catalytic performance and offers a new material for the study of electronic andenergy devices.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000804099400041	35512266

Herein, nitrogen and iron co-doped Ni3S2 and NiP2 heterostructures with high efficiency oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) performances were firstly successfully prepared on nickel foam by hydrothermal and high-temperature calcination methods. Benefiting from the hierarchical structure, the exposure of more active sites and the doping effect of N and Fe, the N-Fe-Ni3S2@NiP2/NF material showed excellent electrocatalytic activity for the OER and UOR. The N-Fe-Ni3S2@NiP2/NF material displays excellent catalytic OER performance; the overpotential is only 251 mV to drive 100 mA cm(-2) current density, while for the UOR, the potential is only 1.353 V to drive 100 mA cm(-2) current density, which is one of the best catalytic activities reported so far. It is worth noting that scanning electron microscopy showed that the surface of N-Fe-Ni3S2@NiP2/NF is rough and has some mesopores, which may have resulted in an increase of active sites during the electrocatalytic process. The N-Fe-Ni3S2@NiP2/NF electrode couple also has relatively long-term durability in alkaline solutions, maintaining a stable current density for 15 h at 1.35 V. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the in situ generated Fe doped nanooxides exhibit strong water adsorption energy, which may be one of the reasons for the good catalytic activity. Our work is conducive to the rational design of electrocatalysts for efficient hydrogen production from water splitting and wastewater treatment.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000745836800001	35048936

The thermochemical cycle is herein referred to as KIER 4. KIER 4 consists of two reaction steps: the first is the decomposition of GeO2 to GeO at approximately 1400-1800 degrees C, the second is hydrogen production by hydrolysis of GeO below 700 degrees C. A 2nd-law analysis was performed on the KIER 4 cycle and a maximum exergy conversion efficiency was estimated at 34.6%. Thermodynamic analysis of GeO2 decomposition and hydrolysis of GeO confirmed the possibility of this cycle. To demonstrate the cycle, the thermal reduction of GeO2 was performed in a TGA with mass-spectroscopy. Results suggest GeO2 decomposition and oxygen gas evolution. To confirm the thermal decomposition of GeO2, the effluent from GeO2 decomposition was quenched, filtered and analyzed. SEM analysis revealed the formation of nano-sized particles. XRD analysis for the condensed-filtered particles showed the presence of Ge and GeO2 phases. The result can be explained by thermodynamic instability of GeO. It is believed that GeO gas disproportionates to 1/2 Ge and 1/2 GeO2 during quenching. 224 ml hydrogen gas per gram of reduced GeO2 was produced from the hydrolysis reaction.

Herein, we report a three-dimensional NiFe LDH with high conductivity and dense active sites, where amorphous NiFe LDH nanosheets are directly electrodeposited on the surface of a hierarchical porous NiCoP@NC derived from the calcination and phosphorization of metal-organic frameworks (ZIF-67) in situ grown on nickel foam. Based on the 3D porous structure, abundant exposed active sites, fast electron and mass transfer rates and strong synergetic effects between NiCoP@NC and NiFe LDH, the resultant NiFe LDH/NiCoP@NC/NF catalysts exhibited significantly enhanced OER catalytic performances compared with NiFe LDH on nickel foam and most of the reported NiFe LDH-based catalysts: a low overpotential of 210 mV for yielding a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), an extremely small Tafel slope (35 mV dec(-1)) and excellent durability. For overall water splitting, with NiFe LDH/NiCoP@NC/NF as the anode and NiCoP@NC/NF as the cathode, the assembled two-electrode system only required 1.54 V to obtain a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH for at least 40 h. This research provided a simple and facile way to develop non-noble-metal oxygen evolution catalysts for replacing high-cost noble metal catalysts.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000527540400028	32226989

In this study, we prepared CoFe2O4 nanoparticles with mainly inverse spinel structure and FeCo2O4 nanoparticles with mainly spinel structure as bifunctional catalysts by hydrothermal method. After annealing at 350 degrees C, pure CoFe2O4 and FeCo2O4 nanoparticles with uniform size distribution have been obtained. The CoFe2O4 nanoparticles showed high current density of 5.5 mA/cm(2) at -0.8 V in the ORR test. It's low Tafel slope of 83.0 mV/dec further confirmed the excellent ORR catalytic properties of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles. Furthermore, the CoFe2O4 nanoparticles also showed good OER properties with satisfied current density of 35.7 mV/cm(2) at l.0 V and low OER Tafel slope of 71.0 mV/dec. Both the ORR and OER properties of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles showed good time stability which were compared with FeCo2O4 nanoparticles. These results indicated that CoFe2O4 nanoparticles with mainly inverse spinel structure had better electrocatalytic performance than FeCo2O4 nanoparticles with mainly spinel structure. The CoFe2O4 nanoparticles with mainly inverse spinel structure show a significant potential application in rechargeable battery. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The NiCoDH/NiCoS features with an interconnected 3D architecture composed of ultrathin amorphous NiCoS nanosheets (similar to 1.5 nm), decorated by ultra-small NiCoDH nanodots (2-3 nm). The optimal NiCoDH/NiCoS exhibits a low overpotential of 303 mV at current density of 20 mA cm(-2), together with a small Tafel slope of 77.6 mV dec(-1), the high Faraday efficiency of about 95% as well as good stability. The excellent OER performance and enhanced stability should be ascribed to the strong interface-coupling of NiCoDH nanodots/NiCoS nanosheets, highly synergistic effect of bimetal Co and Ni, amorphous-like structure to expose more active sites, and interconnected 3D architecture for effective mass transport and structural stability. This work provides a significant insight regarding the strong interface-coupling effect on OER electrocatalysis, and offers a new strategy to design highly efficient OER catalysts.

Evaluation of the electrochemical activity for the oxygen evolution reaction proves a clear solvent-dependence with highest activity upon deposition from acetonitrile and lowest activity upon deposition from ethanol. Analysis of the resulting layer thickness and density attributes the improved electrochemical activity of acetonitrile-prepared samples to larger film thicknesses with lower film densities, i.e. to films with higher porosity. The findings suggest that the ZnO: Co films represent an initially nanocrystalline system where the catalytic activity is predominantly confined to a thin surface region rather than to comprise the entire volume. Closer inspection of this surface region proves successive in operando transformation of the nanocrystalline to an amorphous phase during evolution of oxygen. Furthermore, less active but highly transparent ZnO: Co phases, prepared from ethanol-containing suspensions, can be successfully employed in a stacking configuration with a low-cost triple-junction solar cell. Thereby, a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 5.0% in splitting of water at pH 14 could be realized. In contrast, highly light-absorbing acetonitrile/acetone-prepared samples limit the efficiency to about 1%, demonstrating thus the decisive influence of the used organic solvent upon electrophoretic deposition. Stability investigations over several days finally prove that the modular architecture, applied here, represents an attractive approach for coupling of highly active electrocatalysts with efficient photovoltaic devices.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000371077300036

The ALD CoOx thin film: (i) formed a heterojunction with the n-Si(100) that provided a photovoltage of 575 mV under 1 Sun of simulated solar illumination; (ii) stabilized Si photoanodes that are otherwise unstable when operated in aqueous alkaline electrolytes; and, (iii) catalyzed the oxidation of water, thereby reducing the kinetic overpotential required for the reaction and increasing the overall efficiency relative to electrodes that do not have an inherently electrocatalytic coating. The process provides a simple, effective method for enabling the use of planar n-Si(100) substrates as efficient and durable photoanodes in fully integrated, photovoltaic-biased solar fuels generators.									111	4	0	0	9	0	111			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000372243600016

VGs were synthesized in a mixture of argon and methane (Ar/CH4) by HWP-CVD and then the Ag nanoparticles on the prepared VGs were modified using the RF-PMS system for different sputtering times and RF power levels. The morphology and structure of the Ag nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and the results revealed that Ag nanoparticles were evenly dispersed on the mesoporous wall of the VGs. X-ray diffraction results showed that the diameter of the Ag particles increased with the increase in Ag loading, and the average size was between 10.49 nm and 25.9 nm, consistent with the transmission electron microscopy results. Ag/VGs were investigated as effective electrocatalysts for use in an alkaline aqueous system. Due to the uniquely ordered and interconnected wall structure of VGs, the area of active sites increased with the Ag loading, giving the Ag/VGs a good performance in the oxygen evolution reaction. The double-layer capacitance (C (dl)) of the Ag/VGs under different Ag loadings were studied, and the results showed that the highest Ag content gave the best C (dl) (1.04 mF cm(-2)). Our results show that Ag/VGs are likely to be credible electrocatalytic materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1009-0630	2058-6272		WOS:000788284200001

Here, we report a method using F-doping and dual-layer ultrathin amorphous FeOOH/CoOOH cocatalysts coupling to enable the inactive alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode to become highly vibrant for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Fluorine doping is revealed to increase the charge density and improve the conductivity of alpha-Fe2O3 for rapid charge transfer. Furthermore, ultrathin FeOOH was deposited on F-Fe2O3 to extract photogenerated holes and passivate the surface states for accelerated charge carrier transfer. Moreover, CoOOH as an excellent cocatalyst was coated onto FeOOH/F-Fe2O3 with the photoassisted electrodeposition method remarkably expediting OER kinetics through an optional pathway of holes utilized by Co species. Ultimately, the CoOOH/FeOOH/F-Fe2O3 photoanode exhibits a satisfactory photocurrent density (3.3-fold higher than pristine alpha-Fe2O3) and a negatively shifted onset potential of 80 mV. This work showcases an appealing maneuver to activate the water oxidation performance of the alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode by an integration strategy of heteroatom doping and cocatalyst coupling.									40	0	0	0	4	0	40			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000589384100038	33104336

Great efforts have been devoted to improving the catalytic properties of graphitic C3N4 (g-C3N4) by element doping, composites construction, and morphology modification. Exploring carbon nitrides derived from different combinations of heptazine or triazine building blocks and linkages can be another effective way to complement or improve the catalytic properties of g-C3N4. By exploring the structures, stabilities, electronic characters, optical properties and catalytic activities, the heptazine-based (h-C6N7 and h-C9N7), the triazine-based (t-C3N3 and t-C2N), and the mixed based (ht-C9N10 and ht-C3N2) carbon nitride derivatives with different linkages are investigated and compared with the conventional g-C3N4. Dynamical and thermodynamical calculations show that planar configurations of the six carbon nitride derivatives are stable, in contrast to the stable corrugated configuration of g-C3N4. The higher delocalization of electrons in heptazine-based derivatives leads to smaller band gaps compared with triazine-based derivatives. The electron delocalization, band edge positions, and optical properties are regulated by the combination of building blocks or the introduction of the acetylenic linkages. Compared with g-C3N4, the electron mobility of h-C6N7 is improved by two orders of magnitude and that of t-C3N3 is improved by one order of magnitude. The driving forces of all the six carbon nitride derivatives are larger than overpotentials for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and h-C6N7, ht-C9N10 with lower overpotentials can be good candidates for OER. Insight into the structures and properties of carbon nitride derivatives obtained in this work is expected to provide a guideline for further applications of carbon nitride materials.

The excellent performance is also manifested in full water splitting. Theoretical calculations suggest that the high activity arise from the RuNx sites at the zigzag edges and nanowrinkles.

However, the CNF derived from petroleum-based polymers with poor specific surface area hinder the exposure of the catalytic active sites. Herein, we develop an efficient catalyst derived from sugarcane bagasse based porous carbon nanofiber-supported the CoP/Co2P heterostructure (CoP/Co2P@ACNF-800) for overall water splitting. The CoP/Co2P@ACNF-800 possessed abundant accessible specific surface area due to its porous carbon structure. Owing to the fast mass and charge transport pathway and exposure of abundant catalytic active sites, the CoP/Co2P@ACNF-800 exhibited high activity with the low overpotential of 155 and 291 mV for the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions in 1 M KOH at 10 mA cm(-2), as well as excellent catalytic stability. When the CoP/Co2P@ACNF-800 worked as both the anode and cathode, the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) could be achieved with a potential of 1.67 V for water splitting. This study provides a strategy to design a novel CoP/Co2P heterostructure supported on renewable biomass-based porous CNFs for efficient electrocatalysis water splitting and sustainable chemistry application.

Thus, optimizing simultaneously the hierarchical nanostructure and active site density could substantially improve its HER activity but it is not an effortless strategy to do so. Herein, we report for the first time a facile and controllable synthesis for engineering hierarchically nanostructured MoS2 nanosheets with rich in-plane edges (IE-MoS2 NSs). The IE-MoS2 NSs feature HER-oriented nanostructures with a tiny size, few-layer, expanded interlayer spacing and an unconventional in-plane-edge structure where separated MoS2 nanoflakes stand on the basal plane of nanosheets. Defects (Mo species with multiple chemical states and oxygen heteroatoms) were identified and they were proposed to be responsible for stabilizing the highly active MoS2 nanoflakes, forming the unique in-plane edges. IE-MoS2 NSs exhibit surprisingly high HER activity with a low onset potential of -87 mV and a Tafel slope of 41 mV per decade, exceeding other nanostructured MoS2 materials in this work and surpass almost all documented MoS2-based electrocatalysts. The surging activity has been discussed in detail, showing that the in-plane-edge nanostructure boosts the number of catalytic sites and promotes the intrinsic activity of each site at the same time, facilitating the catalytic process for H-2 evolution.									50	2	0	0	2	0	51			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000385360300010

This is true for many economically interesting reactions, like e.g. the water splitting reaction leading to oxygen and hydrogen, where hydrogen acts as a storable, high grade chemical energy carrier. Most of these gas evolution reactions showing a rather complicated two or even more electron charge transfer kinetics occur with much lower overvoltages at appropriate metal electrodes. Therefore many scientists tried to catalyze electrochemical reactions by depositing catalytic metals onto the surface of the semiconductor electrodes. But here, classical methods for metallization e.g. evaporation or electrochemical deposition lead to the formation of a so called Schottky contact for the metal/semiconductor interface which in contrast to the electrolyte/semiconductor junction causes very high loss currents. In consequence, these high loss currents drastically decrease the efficiency of such photoelectrochemical solar cells.In contrast, the currentless deposition of colloidal metal particles forming multiple nano contacts (MNCs) allows to diminish the overvoltage for the hydrogen evolution reaction without increasing the loss currents at the metal/semiconductor interface. Our own investigations were performed with colloidal gold and platinized colloidal gold particles (between 6 and 100 nm in diameter) deposited onto single crystalline p-type gallium arsenide (pGaAs) electrodes. This method of metallization allows to vary the density and size of metal islands independently. The colloidal metal particles and the electrode surfaces modified with MNCs were characterized by SEM, TEM and STM investigations. Theoretical and experimental investigations prove that due to the three dimensional diffusion towards the MNCs, a surface coverage of less than 1 % is necessary to obtain current densities as high as those obtained for the full surface area.The high catalytic activity of MNCs for the light induced hydrogen evolution reaction has been demonstrated by recording photocurrent/potential curves under illumination in slightly acidic solutions. Moreover, impedance spectroscopy investigations of p-GaAs electrodes covered with gold MNCs (performed in the dark) prove that the loss currents at the MNC/semiconductor interfaces can be decreased by about five orders of magnitude compared to metal/semiconductor interfaces prepared by electrochemical metal deposition.The negligible small loss currents at the MNC/semiconductor interfaces enable to use colloidal metal particles as real catalysts for electrochemical reactions at semiconductor electrodes.

The effect of CO2 concentration, CO2 flow rate, and CO2 pressure on current density and faradaic efficiency of a solid polymer electrolyte membrane CO2 electrolyzer was quantified. An approach for estimating voltage breakdown into activation overpotential for CO2 reduction reaction as well as oxygen evolution reaction, ohmic losses, and concentration overpotential is introduced. No enhancement in current density (similar to 160 mA cm(-2)) was observed above stoichiometry ratio of 4 whereas reducing the stoichiometric ratio to 2.7 still yielded a current density of similar to 100 mA cm(-2). Dilution of CO2 in the feed from 100 mol% to 30 mol%, at similar to 90kPa of cell pressure, resulted in a monotonically decreasing current density. A square root dependency on CO2 partial pressure was observed under these conditions. Operation with pure CO2 at different total pressure yielded only a minor increase in current density indicating some form of saturation-limited behavior. Long-term potentiostatic operation over 85 h revealed continuous drop in current density and a corresponding increase in electrode resistance, observed in electrochemical impedance response.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000812408500001

Thin films of this composite were synthesized on transparent and conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) supports using electrophoretic (EP) or drop-casting (DC) methods, thus providing easy-to-use devices. Their electro- and photocatalytic activities for OER were investigated. Remarkably, both types of films exhibit higher turnover numbers (TONs) than the original bulk material previously studied as a suspension for the photocatalytic OER, with TONs after 2 h equal to 1600 and 403 for DC and EP films, respectively, compared to 70 for the suspension. This difference of catalytic activities is related to the proportion of efficiently illuminated crystallites, whereby a DC thin film offers the largest proportion of POM@ MOF crystallites exposed to light due to its lower thickness when compared to an EP film or crystals in suspension. Such devices can be easily recycled by simply removing them from the reaction medium and washing them before reuse. The films were fully characterized with extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near edge structure ()CANES) spectroscopies, Raman, scanning electron microscopy, and electrochemistry before and after catalysis. The combination of all of these techniques shows the stability of both the POM and the MOF within the composite upon water-oxidation reaction.									32	1	0	0	2	0	32			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000505626900017	31773948

The partial oxidation state is based on reaction rates of exhaust gas species throughout a catalyst longitudinal axis, a set of axially-averaged mass balance and energy balance equations for a fluid phase and washcoat of the catalyst. The inlet species concentration is determined based on air mass, temperature, exhaust air/fuel ratio, and engine speed.

This surface modification alters the electrode activity, increasing the overpotential for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Ex situ and in situ investigations indicate film morphology is mainly composed of "chain of hills", presenting relatively high differential capacitance values and morphology factor, which is attributed to the effect of surface states and high surface roughness of the BDD film. The voltammetric behaviour depends on the applied potential; the heavily doped BDD electrode behaving as a metallic electrode at more anodic potentials. Polarisation curves (potentiostatic (1 mV s(-1)) or galvanostatic (point-by-point)), recorded at different temperatures and H2SO4 Concentrations, lead to the same conclusions. The high Tafel coefficients and low apparent electronic transfer coefficient (alpha(A)) are independent of overpotential and temperature but show a dependence on H2SO4 concentration. The linear relationship observed between the apparent electrochemical enthalpy of activation (DeltaH(eta)(#)) and overpotential supports CIA is constant. An OER mechanism was proposed taking into account the absence of adsorption sites at the BDD surface. The OER is inhibited, explaining the high overpotentials and elevated DeltaH(eta)(#) values.

In addition to the conventional system control technologies to protect the cell from carbon corrosion, water electrolysis catalyst (e.g., IrO2) can be employed to protect the anode by promoting proton and electron production at anode by oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over carbon oxidation reaction. Here, we investigate the voltage reversal behavior of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) with reversal-tolerant-anodes (RTAs) with OER catalyst to understand the degradation mechanism using electrochemical diagnostics and X-ray computed tomography. We found that the sustainable reversal time of the RTA MEAs scales with the IrO2 loading. However, all MEAs irrespective of the presence of IrO2 eventually fail. They exhibit a self-similar behavior of undergoing water electrolysis followed by the carbon corrosion under the reversal conditions. The cell performance decay is dominated by Ohmic resistance increase from anode structural collapse. From the post-mortem imaging, we do not detect any significant change in the distribution and morphology of IrO2 particles in the RTAs, suggesting that the RTA failure results from catalytic deactivation of the OER catalyst during cell reversal.									53	2	0	0	2	0	53			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000445317900046

The anodized oxide layer consisted of predominantly alpha-Fe2O3 alloyed with Nd and B ions. The photoelectrochemical behavior of the anodic oxide was compared with thermally oxidized counterpart and the iron oxides obtained by anodization and thermal oxidation of pure iron foil. The oxide of FeNdB showed higher electron density of states, charge carrier density, and lower bandgap than the un-alloyed iron oxide. The catalytic activity of FeNdB oxide for the oxygen evolution reaction was slightly higher than that of the un-alloyed iron oxide. However, the photocatalytic behavior of the FeNdB oxide was inferior to the iron oxide, which could be attributed to the increased charge recombination and hole accumulation occurring at the FeNdB oxide surface.

In hyperstoichiometric Urania (UO2+x), these oxygen interstitials form different types of defect clusters, which have different migration behavior. In this study we have used kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) to evaluate diffusivities of oxygen interstitials accounting for mono-and diinterstitial clusters. Our results indicate that the predicted diffusivities increase significantly at higher non-stoichiometry (x > 0.01) for di-interstitial clusters compared to a mono-interstitial only model. The diffusivities calculated at higher temperatures compare better with experimental values than at lower temperatures (< 973 K). We have discussed the resulting activation energies achieved for diffusion with all the mono-and di-interstitial models. We have carefully performed sensitivity analysis to estimate the effect of input di-interstitial binding energies on the predicted diffusivities and activation energies. While this article only discusses mono-and di-interstitials in evaluating oxygen diffusion response in UO2+x, future improvements to the model will primarily focus on including energetic definitions of larger stable interstitial clusters reported in the literature. The addition of larger clusters to the kMC model is expected to improve the comparison of oxygen transport in UO2+x with experiment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Facile metal doping especially high valence metal is an effective strategy but a big challenge for improving HER performances of TMPs. Herein, a simple and mild molten salt decomposition followed by phosphorization method is adopted to obtain W-NiCoP microneedles uniformly distributed on nickel foam (W-NiCoP/NF) with multisite for alkaline HER. The prepared NiCo/NF as precursor assisted by molten salt method can provide the homogenous dispersion and uniform needles arrays, which are also helpful for the interaction with W elements. Notably, W doping could effectively regulate the electronic structure of NiCoP, contributing to enriched electrocatalytic active sites and accelerated Volmer step. As a result, the optimized W-NiCoP/NF only requires 113.7 mV and 295.1 mV to reach 100 mA cm(-2) for alkaline HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), even outperforming Pt/C and RuO2. The electrocatalyst remains stable after 5000 cycling stability. Therefore, this work based on molten salt decomposition may provide insights for the simple synthesis of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for alkaline HER and OER. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Compared with ordinary metals, there is no long-range translational order and crystalline defects in MGs. Benefitting from this unique structural characteristic, MGs show many superior mechanical, physical and chemical properties and thus have been attracting intensive attentions in applications as structural materials. The investigations on the functional properties of MGs are still at the early stage, but immense potential in electrochemically functional applications has been demonstrated in recent years. In this Minireview, we aim to present an overview of the functional properties of this class of novel metallic glassy catalysts and some achievements obtained so far. We mainly focus on the applications of MGs in various electrochemical applications, like hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction as well as fuel cells. The strategies for optimizing the performance of these amorphous catalysts are discussed as well, including high-throughput screening and nano-engineering. In the absence of crystalline ordering, the atomic-scale structural mechanism of MGs in electrocatalysis may be unique and will be explored. Finally, we also give perspectives on how to design novel and superior electrocatalysts for future electrocatalysis applications.									38	4	0	0	0	0	38			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000472232800003

Hydrogen energy is gradually attracting the attention of the public and electrolysis of water is considered to be one of the important means of hydrogen production because of its simplicity and convenience. In this paper, a hydrothermal method for the synthesis of a Co and Mn co-doped bimetallic sulfide Fe9S11@Ni9S8 electrocatalyst is proposed for the first time. The prepared Co-Mn-Fe9S11@Ni9S8/NF electrocatalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). It can provide a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with only 193 mV overpotential for the OER and a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with only 1.33 V potential for the UOR, which are far superior to those of most reported electrocatalysts. What is noteworthy is that the unique nanoflower structure of Co-Mn-Fe9S11@Ni9S8/NF increases the specific surface area of the material and the introduction of Co and Mn ions promotes the formation of high valence state Ni and Fe and enhances the charge transfer rate. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the in situ generated Co-Mn-Fe-NiOOH material derived from Co-Mn-Fe9S11@Ni9S8 exhibits the best water adsorption energy and the best electrical conductivity, thus improving the catalytic performance of the material. This work provided a new idea for the development of bimetallic cation doped electrocatalysts with high efficiency and low cost.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000815207100001	35748564

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the iridium-based catalysts typically used in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers. The challenge essentially relies on three aspects: a) high anodic overpotentials which fatally destroy any electrode substrate; b) low loading RDE-inks for catalyst screenings may show strong sedimentation c) iridium does not show defined peaks during cyclic voltammetry. With this work, a newly developed method is presented which allows the characterization of the electrocatalytic properties of iridium based electrocatalysts in a true RDE configuration. Here we aimed to access the electrochemistry of various commercial iridium-based catalysts with different structures. We show that the stability of glassy carbon RDE and of carbon black, added to the ink in order to stabilize the dispersion is sufficient during the electrochemical testing protocol used. Reproducibility of activity results obtained on various samples is increased by stabilizing the dispersions with carbon black, resulting in reproducible and homogeneous catalyst thin films.

It is shown that the electrode process is under an electrochemical and diffusion mixed control. When a PbO2 deposit is formed, a nucleation loop occurs. The nucleation overpotential of a Pb cathode is rather small. The difference between charge and discharge potentials of the Pb cathode is much lower than that of the PbO2 anode. This indicates that the polarization in an all lead flow battery is attributed mainly to the PbO2 anode. An increase in H+ concentration is beneficial for a reduction in the polarization; however, side reactions producing oxygen and hydrogen, and corrosion also increase. An increase of Pb(II) concentration favors the suppression of oxygen evolution, however, the potential of the PbO2 electrode is increased. This results in an increase in the difference between potentials of the charged and discharged states. When the Pb(II) concentration is relatively low, PbO2 deposits shed from the substrate during charge and discharge. As a result, the charge potential is further reduced. Appropriate concentrations of HBF4 and Pb(II) were determined to be 2 mol.L-1 and greater than 0.9 mol.L-1, respectively.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1000-6818			WOS:000327290800009

However, there are still lots of issues that need to be addressed toward the practical application. Here, free-standing Co-doped NiO three-dimensional nanosheets were prepared by a hydrothermal synthesis method and directly employed as the air-breathing cathode of the Li-O-2 battery. The morphological phenomenon and electrochemical performance of the as-prepared cathode material were characterized by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge tests, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. The Co-doped NiO electrode delivered a maximum discharge capacity of around 12 857 mA h g(-1) with a low overpotential (0.82 V) at 200 mA g(-1). Under upper-limit specific capacities of 500 mA h g(-1) at 400 mA g(-1), the Li-O-2 batteries exhibited a long cycle life of 165 cycles. Compared with the undoped NiO electrode, the Li-O-2 battery based on the Co-doped NiO cathode showed significantly higher oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction activities. This superior electrochemical performance is because of the partial substitution of Ni2+ in the NiO matrix by Co2+ to improve the p-type electronic conductivity of NiO. In addition, the morphology and specific surface area of NiO are affected by Co doping, which can expand the electrode-electrolyte contact area and lead to sufficient space for Li2O2 deposition.

The prepared sample, followed by hydrothermal treatment with Nd(NO3)(3) and/or Gd(NO3)(3) and/or PtCl4 solution at 180 degrees C for 2 h, produced Nd-Pt-TNTAs, Gd-Pt-TNTAs, Nd-Gd-Pt-TNTAs and Pt-TNTAs. The morphological and structural properties were studied by SEM, XRD and Raman spectra techniques. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance on Lanthanides-Pt-TNTAs was investigated using the Tafel linear polarization technique. The calculated values of the activation energy are in good agreement with the trend in catalytic activity. The excellent performance of doped TNTAs with low activation energy (E (a)) is due to the formation of an excitation energy level below the conduction band of TiO2 from the binding of electrons with oxygen vacancies decreasing the excitation energy resulting in robust electrocatalytic activity. The very low value of E (a) for Nd-Gd-Pt-TNTAs (2.02 kJ/mol) compared to other electrochemical catalysts used for hydrogen evolution reactions containing titanium nanotubes was achieved for the first time. This makes the Lanthanides -Pt-TNTAs prepared in the present work optimal catalysts for electrodes and promising for applications in fuel cells or as water splitting materials.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1745-8080	1745-8099		WOS:000634049400001

The YBCO thick films were prepared by solid state diffusion reaction technique. In contrast to the general perception that the energetic ion induces defects and disorders, which lead to decrease of T-c and increase of normal state resistivity in a superconductor, 200 MeV Ag ions in the present case led to an increase in T-c and decrease in normal state resistivity at low ion fluence (10(11) ions cm(-2)) in YBCO. At this fluence, the electronic energy loss, S-e induced amorphous ion tracks are well separated from each other and hence are not expected to influence the T-c. The observed changes in transport properties is explained as being caused by irradiation-induced chain oxygen ordering of the oxygen defects in the CuO chains. Subsequent increase of irradiation fluence leads to decrease of T-c and increase of normal state resistivity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

Pt was found to catalyze the (COOH)(2) oxidation reaction more strongly than An, while Ru did not display any activity towards the (COOH)(2) oxidation reaction. Furthermore, under rapid stirring conditions, the (COOH)(2) oxidation reaction using Pt electrodes was shown to be purely activation controlled. Therefore, the (COOH)(2) oxidation currents can be related to the electroactive Pt area, as shown for a range of polycrystalline, bulk metal Pt and Pt powder electrodes. The Pt surface area for multi-component catalyst systems can also be estimated by combining (COOH)(2) oxidation data with the charge needed to oxidize adsorbed CO to CO2 (COads charge), as shown for a range of Pt and Ru containing powder electrodes. In fact, the combination of the two methods ((COOH)(2) oxidation current and COads charge) can be used as an in-situ probe to estimate the fraction of Ru in the metallic state in the potential region where CO is adsorbed provided that the surface ratio of Pt vs. Ru is known.					3rd Symposium on Proton Conducting Membrane Fuel Cells3rd Symposium on Proton Conducting Membrane Fuel Cells	OCT, 2002OCT, 2002	Electrochem Soc, Ind Electrolysis & Electrochem Engn Div; Electrochem Soc, Energy Technol Div; Electrochem Soc, Phys Electrochem DivElectrochem Soc, Ind Electrolysis & Electrochem Engn Div; Electrochem Soc, Energy Technol Div; Electrochem Soc, Phys Electrochem Div	Salt Lake City, UTSalt Lake City, UT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					1-56677-455-1	WOS:000229108600036

Herein, we found a "chimney effect" formed on the interface between the metal oxide and Nickel metal for the hydrogen evolution reaction, using density functional theory calculations and experimental methods. This special chemical environment around the interface leads the neighboring sites to be immune to the H2O* and OH* adsorption and to only selectively adsorb H* properly. Meanwhile, it is also beneficial for the smooth adsorption of the reactant (H*) on the interface and the easy desorption of the product (H2) from the catalyst surface (AGH. close to zero). This phenomenon appears similar to a chimney of hydrogen evolution around the metal oxide/metal interface. Such "chimney effect" is a result of the interfacial charge transfer between the metal and metal oxide, and should be the nature of the interface induced synergistic effect in metal oxide/metal composite catalysts for HER. Experiments further confirm that the catalytic activity of metal oxide/metal composites for HER can be enhanced by increasing the amount of the chimney- the interfacial metal atoms.									88	10	0	0	7	0	89			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000467661700012

The coordination configuration of the metal atoms has been widely recognized as the determining factor to the electronic structure and the catalytic activity. However, the synergistic effect between the adjacent layers of the multilayered AMCs is always neglected. We reported an atomic Co and Pt co-trapped carbon catalyst, which exhibits a ultrahigh activity for HER in the wide range of pH (eta(10)=27 and 50mV in acidic and alkaline media, respectively) with ultralow metal loadings (1.72 and 0.16wt% for Co and Pt, respectively), which is much superior to the commercial Pt/C. Theoretical analysis reveals that the atomic metals on the inner graphitic layers significantly alter the electronic structure of the outmost layer, thus tailoring the HER activity. This finding arouses a re-thinking of the intrinsic activity origins of AMCs and suggests a new avenue in the structure design of AMCs.									58	8	0	0	4	0	59			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000476610900013	31106512

Yet, its underlying mechanism is still not fully understood, and suitable low-cost electrocatalysts with good product selectivity and activity are still sought after. Here, an active NiFeOx-based catalyst is reported on as a general platform for the electro-oxidative upgrading of organic molecules through oxygenation and dehydrogenation, with hydrogen coproduction. Detailed mechanistic studies unveil that C-H bond oxidation (with a bond dissociation energy BDEC-H of approximate to 88-96 kcal mol(-1)) is involved in the rate-limiting step, which differs significantly from the oxygen evolution reaction mechanism. These findings show that the oxidation efficacy is linearly correlated with the BDEC-H of the molecule. Thus, the catalyst can be used as a general platform for large-scale electro-oxidation of various substrates through oxygenation and dehydrogenation at high current density (25 mA cm(-2)), with a good Faradaic yield. The platform's generality is further demonstrated by the selective oxidation of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural into 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid with good efficiency.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000688044000001

Herein, a series of hybrids comprising of NiCo alloy, metal oxides and carbon black were readily prepared by a one-pot pyrolysis approach and employed as efficient ORR electrocatalysts in the alkaline media. Different amounts of Ketjen Black EC 300J (EC) with a large mesoporous area and exceptional electrical conductivity were directly added to synthesize the hybrids. Among the hybrids tested, the NC-MMO-EC-3 (where NC stands for NiCo alloy and MMO for mixed metal oxides) with an appropriate amount of EC displayed the best ORR electrochemical activity. The enhanced activity of the NC-MMO-EC-3 could be attributed to the conductivity improved by EC, the high dispersion of MMO and NC on EC support, and the beneficial interaction among those three components.

In this paper, using MIL-88A(Fe) metal-organic complex, polyoxometalate (POM) and H(2)PtCl(6)as starting materials, hierarchic and low Pt-0-loading micro-rods (denoted as Pt-POMFe,i.e.Pt-PW12Fe or Pt-PMo12Fe) have been synthesized, in which the Pt(0)nanoparticles can be stabilized by POM. The Pt-PW12Fe micro-rod containing [PW12O40](3-)polyoxoanion component (0.30% Pt-0-loading) which retains the spindle structure of its parent MIL-88A(Fe) exhibits a low overpotential of 28 mV at current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2)for HER that is close to the electrocatalytic effect of commercial Pt/C (ca. 20% Pt-0-loading). Such high electrocatalytic reactivity is mainly caused by the synergistic effect of the three components of POM, Pt-0, and Fe3O4@C. The structure effectively increases the active sites of the catalyst and improves its conductivity and stability. The Pt-POMFe catalyst extends a new family of MOF-POM functional materials and provides a new concept to the design and synthesis of highly-efficient and low-cost electrocatalyst for hydrogen production.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0095-8972	1029-0389		WOS:000562816000001

We here report the implantation of Co-SAs into hollow carbon spheres (Co-SAs-HCS) via a facile wetchemistry strategy followed by controlled pyrolysis. Electron-rich histidine acted as a Lewis base effectively immobilizing Co2+ (Lewis acid) via the electrostatic effect and hydrogen bonds, thus achieving the scalable synthesis of Co-SAs-HCS. We constructed a series of histidine-Co2+ structure models to elucidate the formation of histidine-Co2+ complexes by analyzing their binding energy. X-ray absorption fine-structure results verify that central Co atoms with four N coordination atoms possess a non-planar Co-N-4 structure. Electrochemical results indicate that the as-prepared Co-SAs-HCS catalyst shows a low potential difference (0.809 V) between the oxygen evolution reaction potential at 10 mA cm(-2) and the oxygen reduction reaction half-wave potential, outperforming the commercial Pt/C catalysts (0.996 V). Moreover, an assembled Znair battery based on Co-SAs-HCS exhibits an unexpected long-term durability. We have demonstrated that non-planar Co-N-4-1-O-2 sites are the source for highly efficient adsorption and dissociation of O-2 molecules and then reduction of the free energy of desorption of the intermediates by density functional theory. Our findings provide a new design insight into the exploration of advanced electrocatalysts, which will be applied in the design of green energy devices in the future.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000653539100072	33957043

Ti2RuFe is almost single phase with the B2 structure. In contrast, Ti2RuFeO2 is made of a mixture of Ti2RuFe and TiOx phases. Tests in chlorate electrolysis conditions did not show any sign of degradation of Ti2RuFeO2 over a 300 h period, while Ti2RuFe breaks down after less than 100 h. The degradation of Ti2RuFe occurs because of hydrogen absorption and desorption during alternating hydrogen discharge and open-circuit conditions.

Further, it has been carefully tuned for the first time by thoroughly optimizing the ED parameters to exhibit Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER). At high current regimes, the performance surpassed that of the Ru/C and Pt/C (>= 500 mA and >= 600 mA) respectively. The full cell electrolyzer configuring NOPO||NOPH further establishes the supremacy of the present electrocatalysts over the benchmark Ru/C||Pt/C. Moreover, the present electrocatalyst displayed 60 and 70 hours of HER and OER performances at -100 mA and 100 mA currents respectively.

The objective of this study is to increase the number of electrocatalytic active sites by creating multi-vacancies (W vacancy, S vacancy, or the coexistence of W and S vacancies), simultaneously combing with doping strategy to improve the intrinsic conductivity and activate the HER catalytic performance of S sites in the basal plane of pristine WS2 nanospheres. Herein, high-energy Fe13+-ion irradiation technology was used to irradiate the WS2 surface, which not only regulates multi-vacancies, but also introduces Fe dopants with Fe2+ and Fe3+ into WS2. Density functional theory firstly demonstrates that the creation of multi-vacancies coupling with Fe doping could significantly narrow the band gap of pristine WS2, which is beneficial to the acceleration of electron transfer during the HER process. Experimentally, moderate doses of the Fe13+-ion irradiated WS2 electrocatalyst (8*1013) achieved the optimum HER activity with a higher current density, lower onset overpotential and excellent stability in acidic electrolyte. This strategy is a promising perspective for the design of highly efficient electrocatalysts via the Fe13+-ion irradiation pathway.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2452-2627			WOS:000661182700003

Pt/C electrocatalyst was synthesized using the polyol method in ethylene glycol with 1 M ascorbic acid as a mild reducing agent. The investigated parameter was the temperature, which will vary from room temperature to 120 degrees C. From the cyclic voltammetry (CV), the results showed that the Pt/C electrocatalyst synthesized by the polyol method at room temperature and 60 degrees C cannot promote hydrogen desorption peak compared to other catalysts. The Pt/C catalyst synthesized at 100 degrees C gave the highest electrochemical surface area (ESA) at around 32.59 m(2)/g(Pt). From the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tested in an acid solution, the Pt/C catalyst synthesized at 100 degrees C exhibited the highest HER activity. The exchange current density, Tafel slope and overpotential at 10 mA/cm(2) were around 5.208 mA/cm(2), -59.3 mV/dec and -0.277 V-SCE, respectively. From the value of Tafel slope: -59.3 mV/dec, it indicated that the mechanism of the 20%Pt/C electrocatalyst synthesized at 100 degrees C catalyst occurs through Heyrovsky mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0125-8281			WOS:000646413300010

Defect engineering is an efficient way to regulate the electronic structure and improve the performance of materials. Here, we develop a defect engineering route that is implemented by controlling the topochemical reactions between cobalt perovskite and urea to optimize the electronic structure of La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (LSCO). Urea pyrolysis is able to increase the oxygen defect concentration and cause octahedral distortions. Furthermore, we can distinctly observe that the introduction of oxygen vacancies narrows the hybridization orbital between O2p and Co 3d and optimizes the O p-band center near the Fermi level by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, which greatly improves the catalytic activity of CO oxidation and photocatalytic water splitting. These results highlight the relationship between oxygen defects, electronic structure, and catalytic activity of perovskite LSCO, and demonstrate a rational approach to defect design and reveal the importance of anion redox chemistry for the structures and properties of perovskite oxides.									30	4	0	0	2	0	32			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000395753000020	27805294

Herein, a unique amorphous Co2P/crystalline CoP quantum dots (Co2P/CoP QDs) Type-II surface heterojunction was derived from amorphous Co3O4 QDs via phosphorization. The intimate contact between Co2P QDs and CoP QDs was conducive to charge transfer, thereby promoting surface reaction kinetics. The unique structure and properties were beneficial to providing more active sites and controlling the electronic structures thus making amorphous/crystalline composites show superior photocatalytic hydrogen (H-2) production performance. Additionally, the amorphous Co2P QDs had a plethora of unsaturated bonds and abundant defects; the disordered structure led to increased active sites that promoted surface reaction kinetics. Due to the synergistic effect of the quantum confinement of QDs and the surface heterojunction, the charge transfer efficiency of Co2P/CoP QDs was extremely high, and high H-2 evolution activity and photostability were achieved. The maximum H-2 generation rate over the Co2P/CoP QDs composite reached 11.88 mmol h(-1) g(-1)with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 3.88 % at 420 nm, which is roughly 20-times that of the pure Co3O4 QDs. In addition, high photostability was realized; even the photocatalyst that stood for a week reached initial photoactivity.

Platinum (Pt)-based catalysts have been widely regarded as excellent cocatalysts for photocatalytic water splitting, but the relationship between their valence state and reaction activity for photocatalytic water splitting had never been summarized. This review presents positively charged Pt nanoparticles, clusters and even single atoms that can boost the reaction activity dramatically, and summarises several strategies and techniques to tailor the positive valence states of Pt-based cocatalysts such as by using oxygen atoms. By tailoring the valence states of Pt-based cocatalysts, the capacities of these cocatalysts for water splitting can be significantly enhanced. Moreover, the operando analyses that can determine the real structures of this type of cocatalyst under working conditions are also discussed. These developments suggest that positively charged Pt-based cocatalysts could determine the direction and efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting, which may provide an ideal orientation to design state-of-the-art catalysts for achieving efficient photocatalytic water splitting.									38	0	0	0	5	0	38			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000503772400001

Probe exposures were made in order to measure the evolution of Si fluxes and the influence of silicon on the behaviour of other impurity fluxes like boron, oxygen and metals. Studies were performed under different conditions: heating mode, plasma density and gas filling. Comparative exposures were made before introduction of Si into the machine as well as immediately and long time after the siliconization. The exposed graphite samples were examined by surface analysis techniques, including Anger electron and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopies. nuclear reaction analysis and ultra-high resolution microscopies.The most important findings are concerned with: (i) the relation between silicon to carbon and silicon to oxygen in the deposits; (ii) the change in radial profiles of Si, B and D fluxes during consecutive stages of the silicon-assisted operation, and the retention of deuterium in the Si containing codeposited layers. The influence of plasma density on the fluxes is considered and gettering of oxygen by silicon is also addressed. Comparison is also made to the results of VUV spectroscopy signals of silicon and oxygen impurities in the plasma.					11th International Conference on Plasma Surface Interactions in Controlled Fusion Devices (PSI-1l)11th International Conference on Plasma Surface Interactions in Controlled Fusion Devices (PSI-1l)	MAY 23-27, 1994MAY 23-27, 1994		MITO, JAPANMITO, JAPAN	18	0	0	0	0	0	18			0022-3115			WOS:A1995QY75400090

The polycationic chains are composed of [Co4L4(dicarboxylate)](2+) monomeric units, while one molecular dicarboxylate counterion is balancing the charge of each monomer. The linear compound series has five members, and the crystal structures were solved for [Co4L4(tph)](tph) and [Co4L4(ndc)](ndc), where tph = terephthalate and ndc = 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate. Partly crystalline compounds were produced by slow assembly at elevated temperature (over days), while the amorphous compounds were formed by fast precipitation (within minutes). Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis based on X-ray total scattering data reveals the presence of the cubane-like entity in both the amorphous and semicrystalline samples. While the powders are non-porous, precipitation is a fast and versatile method to produce compounds with cubane-like centres with moderate surface areas of 17-49 m(2) g(-1) allowing for surface chemical reactions. The powders have a high concentration of Lewis base sites as verified by their selective adsorption of CO2 over N-2. The use of an amorphous cubane-like polymer for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction was demonstrated.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000540759000020	32432631

Among the many challenges found to date is the search for a stable semiconductor photocatalyst responding to visible and preferably visible and IR light. Ag2S is a narrow bandgap semiconductor with a bulk electronic gap smaller than that needed to split water. In this work, using a solvent thermal strategy, we have increased its bandgap energy by shifting up the conduction band edge to make it suitable for the electron transfer reaction to hydrogen ions. The Ag2S quantum dots (QDs) were tested as both electrocatalysts and photocatalysts. As electrocatalysts, Ag2S QDs with an absorption peak at 800 nm (QD800) showed the highest H-2 evolution activity with a Tafel slope of 89 mV/dec with an overpotential of 0.32 V. As photocatalysts, H-2 was produced at a rate of 858 mu mol h(-1 )g(catal)(-1) under a white light flux of 100 mW cm(-2) . Moreover, QD800 was also found to be active under only near-infrared excitation (800 +/- 20 nm). This is the longest wavelength reported so far to excite a semiconductor and generate H-2.									30	2	0	0	3	0	31			2574-0962			WOS:000465644600050

In this system, P450 monooxygenase (P450-BM3) and P450 peroxygenase (OleT(JE)) not only function as catalysts for the crucial initial reactions, they also ensure an internal in situ H2O2 recycle mechanism that avoids its accumulation and thus prevents possible toxic effects. By directed evolution of P450-BM3 as the catalyst in the enantioselective epoxidation of the styrene-intermediate, formed from 3-phenyl propionic acid, and the epoxide hydrolase ANEH for final hydrolytic ring opening, (R)-phenyl glycol and 9 derivatives thereof were synthesized from the respective carboxylic acids in one-pot processes with high enantioselectivity.									18	3	0	0	9	0	20			0002-7863			WOS:000464769000015	30920820

In this study, 1-Ethyl 3-Methyl Imidazolium Chloride ([EmIm]Cl) and aluminum chloride (AlCl3) are applied to resolve the aforementioned issues. Ex situ component-level and in situ cell-level open circuit voltage (OCV) tests combined with the physics-based model analyses were conducted to investigate the electrochemical reaction behaviors of the Al-air cell. Especially, the effect of aluminum oxide formation on the anode- and cathode-side reactions were analyzed in detail. The oxide film formed at the Al surface strongly was found to significantly impede the electrochemical reaction at the surface, and the film growth was controlled by decreasing the surface tension by aggressive anions. In the cathode side, the aluminum oxide precipitated in the porous cathode electrode was found to decrease the porous reaction area and block reactant access into the reaction sites. The effects of O-2 solubility in the electrolyte, initial porosity and thickness of the porous electrode are compared in detailed, and optimal thickness is suggested.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				1996-1073		WOS:000538041800157

However, the slow kinetics and high overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the primary deterrents for improving the efficiency of water splitting devices. Iridium- and ruthenium-based noble metal catalysts are extremely expensive, which limits the industrial-scale development of this technology. Therefore, the development of oxygen evolution catalysts with high activity, excellent stability, and low costs is significantly important for water splitting technologies. Nickel-based materials meet the requirements of high abundance, cost-effectiveness, and high activity. In recent years, nickel-based metal organic frameworks (Ni-based MOFs) have attracted increasing research attention owing to their diverse and tunable topological structures and large specific surface areas. Furthermore, the mesoporous three-dimensional structure of MOFs can promote the diffusion of reactants, rendering them excellent candidates for catalytic applications. In order to utilize the advantages of Ni-MOFs more efficiently, the following methods are usually used to improve their catalytic performance. Owing to their unique properties, metal nodes can be replaced without affecting the MOF skeleton. As iron series metals, Co and Fe doping show unique catalytic activity and structural stability due to the synergistic effect between metal centers. Further, Ni-MOFs can simultaneously be used as precursors for oxidation, phosphating, or vulcanization to obtain Ni-MOF derivatives with different components. Among them, high-temperature carbonization treatment can make use of abundant organic ligands of Ni-MOFs to form a partially graphitized carbon-based framework, thereby augmenting conductivity, preventing the aggregation and corrosion of transition metals, and improving the overall support strength. The catalytic performance of oxygen production can be further improved by directly growing the Ni-MOFs on the substrate and introducing other active substances or conductive materials. Herein, the latest developments of Ni-based MOFs and their derivatives have been reviewed with regard to their utilization in OER catalysis, including nickel oxides, nickel hydroxides, nickel phosphides, nickel sulfides, and carbon composite materials. First, the mechanism and measurement criteria of the OER are briefly introduced. Second, the structures of several typical Ni-based MOFs (MOF-74, MILs, PBAs, and ZIFs) and their preparation methods are described. Subsequently, recent advances in the application of Ni-based MOFs and their derivatives in the OER are discussed, with an emphasis on materials design strategies and catalytic mechanisms. Finally, the main challenges and opportunities in this field are proposed.									16	2	0	0	0	0	16			1000-6818			WOS:000616616500016		
J	Li, Xi-Bo; Cao, Tengfei; Zheng, Feipeng; Chen, Xiaobo				Li, Xi-Bo/AAF-9087-2021				Computational Screening of Electrocatalytic Materials for Hydrogen Evolution: Platinum Monolayer on Transitional Metals								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				123	1			495	503		10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b09301				JAN 10 2019	2019	Searching for none or less Pt-containing electrocatalytic materials for hydrogen evolution is a promising way to reduce the cost of hydrogen production. Thus, a computational screening of electrocatalytic materials for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Pt monolayer on transitional metals (Pt/TM), are carried out by DFT in this work. According to several prerequisites, including difficulty of synthesis, stability in electrochemical environment, HER activity, and economical cost, several stable, high activity, and low cost surfaces for HER are chosen. In detail, the Pt/TM(001)[TM = Fe, Mo, V, W or Nb], Pt/TM(111)[TM = Ag, Pd or Au], and Pt/Re(0001) moieties are found to have a predicted high activity comparable to pure Pt. In particular, the five Pt/TM(001) surfaces are economical and seldom reported. Even more, Pt/TM(001)[W, Nb, V, Fe] may be even much better than pure Pt, for both the suitable hydrogen adsorption ability and larger exchange current. Further DFT analysis indicates the HER activity on Pt/TM is related with the d-band center of the Pt layer, which could be tuned by the transition metal in substrate. Our results are expected to contribute to the understanding of the HER on Pt/TM and give theoretical evidence for corresponding experiments.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000455561100051

The synthetic protocol is applied to afford good yields of benzimidazole/benzothiazole via the cascade reaction between benzylamine and o-aminothiophenol/o-phenylenediamine. These photocatalytic reactions are performed under very mild conditions using the household light-emitting diode bulb as a light source and O-2 (1 atm). The CD-embedded, 2.4 wt % CD/Bi2MoO6 exhibits the best photocatalytic activity. Impressive visible-light absorbance coefficient, quantum confinement, photoluminescence up-conversion, and stable photoelectrochemical properties of CD are contemplating the excellent photocatalytic activity of CD/Bi2MoO6 than the pristine Bi2MoO6. Generation and influence of various reactive species in these catalytic reactions are investigated by radical scavenging, fluorescence spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetric (CV) analysis. Both qualitative and quantitative estimation of the in situ generated H2O2 in the photocatalytic oxidative coupling of amines was ascertained using CV and redox titration, respectively. Further, the influence of substitution in the benzylamine and involvement of the carbocations are confirmed using Hammett plot. The developed catalysts are also used as photoanode for O-2 evolution from water oxidation in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell. Several PEC techniques evaluate the PEC activity of the photoanodes. The reactivity order for various substituted benzylamine and the involvement of reactive oxygen species (O-2 center dot(-)) in the oxidation reaction was obtained and confirmed from the band edge potentials of the best photocatalyst using Mott-Schottky analysis. Efficient catalytic recyclability and photostability are additional important features of the present investigation. This study provides a feasible alternative to the development of non-noble metal (CD)-based nanocomposite photocatalysts that can manifest important photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic applications in chemical synthesis and solar fuel production.									37	3	0	0	6	0	38			2574-0970			WOS:000461400200047

Herein, we exhibit that the HER activity of the Pd nanocubes could be improved by selecting the appropriately shaped titania nanocrystals as support. In particular, we used Pd nanoparticles with (100)-facet exposed to show that the HER performance of Pd cubes can be improved in both acidic and alkaline electrolyte media when combined on the anatase TiO2 nanocrystals. Furthermore, we have also investigated the facet effect of TiO2 on the performance in detail, which indicated stronger catalytic activity when (001)-TiO2 was used rather than (mix 101/001)-TiO2 and (101)-TiO2. The electron-transfer-induced improvement of HER activity of Pd/TiO2 was assessed by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Thereafter, the combined support materials with suitable facet exposed can give an additional adjusting path to regulate the HER activities of Pd nanocatalysts, which henceforth can further contribute to a novel way for tuning other catalysts with good electrocatalytic properties.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000542925300025	32428399

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted wide attentions owing to their maximum atom utilization and excellent catalytic activity. In this work, the HER activities of transition metal (TM) (TM = Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) SACs on two-dimensional SnO monolayer are studied using density functional theory. We found that the low-cost TM SACs can exhibit high HER activity in wide pH-range. Especially, Co SACs show promising catalytic activity with the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H*)) as low as similar to 0.015 eV, which are also high active in either acidic or alkaline environments. With the experimentally inevitable oxygen vacancies in SnO, the Delta G(H*) of Co, Ni and Cu SACs are almost zero, which are competitive with the precious catalyst Pt(111) (-0.09 eV). The exceptional HER activity is correlated to the enhanced electron states close to the Fermi level as well as the d-band center positions of the TM. Our work opens new avenues for engineering low-cost TM SACs with pH-universal HER performance, which is of great importance in practical applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000730305200005

The application of topological analysis of electron localisation function (ELF) and Thom's catastrophe theory enabled a detailed description of the evolution of chemical bonds and non-bonding electron density. The BET analysis was performed at the DFT(MN15)/def2-TZVPPD computational level. The Hausdorff distance was used as a qualitative view on the evolution of the ELF field. The molecular mechanism of the chlorination reaction consisted of 11 structural stability domains (SSDs) and 10 ELF catastrophes. Four SSDs were observed before the transition state (TS). The TS was found in SSD V, and six SSDs were distinguished after the TS. The energy barriers were analysed with six different DFT functionals (B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, LC-omega PBE, M11, MN15, omega B97XD) and def2-TZVPPD basis set. The energy barrier between transition state and reagents was smaller than transition state and products, thus the chlorination of ammonia is thermodynamically favourable. Alongside BET analysis, NPA (natural population analysis), AIM (atoms in molecules) and APT (atomic polar tensor) charge analysis was also applied to the transferred chlorine atom.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0026-8976	1362-3028		WOS:000679594400001

Exsolved particles are well anchored and can be re-shaped without changing their initial location and structural arrangement. However, this usually involves lengthy treatments and use of toxic gases. Here, the galvanic replacement/deposition method is used, which is simpler, safer, and leads to a wealth of new hybrid nanostructures with a higher degree of tailorability. The produced NiAu bimetallic nanostructures supported on SrTiO3 display exceptional activity in plasmon-assisted photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation reactions. In situ scanning transmission electron microscopy is used to visualize the structural evolution of the plasmonic bimetallic structures, while theoretical simulations provide mechanistic insight and correlate the surface plasmon resonance effects with structural features and enhanced PEC performance. The versatility of this concept in shifting catalytic modes to the hydrogen evolution reaction is demonstrated by preparing hybrid NiPt bimetallic NPs of low Pt loadings on highly reduced SrTiO3 supports. This powerful methodology enables the design of supported bimetallic nanomaterials with tunable morphology and catalytic functionalities through minimal engineering.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0143-6228	1873-7730		WOS:000829870200008	35695331

However, in its bulk form, MoS2 possesses only poor activity towards HER. Therefore, appropriate treatment has to be employed to tune its catalytic properties. In this study, we report the influence of ion bombardment (S, Se and Te ions) with medium ion energy (400 keV) and various ion fluences (1 x 10(14)-1 x 10(16) ions/cm(2)) on the electrocatalytic properties of bulk MoS2 crystals. Our results showed that upon irradiation, sulfur vacancies were created. Upon exposure to ambient atmosphere, sulfur vacancies were partially replaced by oxygen, which led to surface oxidation. Nevertheless, samples irradiated using the higher range of ion fluences have generally showed enhanced catalytic HER performance in comparison with untreated MoS2 crystals. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that ion irradiation/implantation can serve as a tool for doping of MoS2 crystals with Se and Te which can also influence the HER performance. The reported results demonstrate that ion beam irradiation can be used for doping as well as creation of sulfur vacancies in bulk MoS2 crystals which is fundamental for the HER performance.

The simulations under different temperatures (2400, 2600, 2800, 3000 K) were performed to investigate the influence of temperature on the distribution and characterization of product. The effect of water on product distribution and sulfur evolution during vulcanized NR pyrolysis were investigated by adding different amount of water molecules (50 and 200) into reaction sys-tems. The mechanism of water molecules promoting the decomposition of vulcanized NR was discussed and proposed. The results show that vulcanized cross-linked structure promotes the decomposition of carbon chains resulting more gas product at low temperature. Water can promote the further decomposition of heavy and light tars into gas product and inhibit the secondary formation of heavy tar. Moreover, water also facilitate the transfer of sulfur atoms to H2S and reduce the content of thiophene compounds at high temperature. Results indicate that water condition can provide a stronger cracking environment by generating OH radicals and reacting with in-termediate products of vulcanized NR pyrolysis forming R-C-OH radicals, which are the main precursors of CO and other oxygen-containing products.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0141-3910	1873-2321		WOS:000829729700001

This Cu2O@Fe2O3@CC-500 hierarchical assembly needs ultralow overpotential of 296 mV (for oxygen evolution reaction, OER) and 188 mV (for hydrogen evolution reaction, HER) to afford the 10 mA cm-2 current density, and with the Tafel slope of 66 mV dec- 1 (for OER) and 59 mV dec-1 (for HER) in alkaline medium (1.0 M KOH), respectively. The assembled water electrolyzer using bifunctional Cu2O@Fe2O3@CC-500 as both anode and cathode exhibited high stability with a cell voltage of only 1.675 V at 10 mA cm-2. More interestingly, this composite also exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance in CO2 reduction. For the Cu2O@Fe2O3@CC-500, the CO yield attained 172.2 mu mol.gcatalyst - 1 .h- 1 under visible light irradiation. Based on the measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, an enhanced OER kinetics and a plausible mechanism for CO2 photo-reduction have been proposed. Our study will open a special door to provide multifunctional phtoelectrocatalyst to be widely used in the clean energy field.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000724609800004

In this study, a novel Eu-doped ZnCo2O4 composite was successfully prepared via a simple hydrothermal calcination method, and firstly used for PMS activation to degrade 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethene (FOX-7). Among all samples, Eu-0.4-ZnCo2O4 exhibited remarkable PMS activation performance, which was about 5.67 times higher than that of undoped ZnCo2O4. The enhanced catalytic performance could be attributed to the generation of abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs), which greatly promoted the separation of carriers and accelerated the cycling of the Co3+/Co2+ redox pairs. The corresponding Co3+/Co2+ and oxygen defects/lattice oxygen (O-Def/O-Lat) ratios regulated catalytic-activity relationship were successfully established by regression analysis. Radical quenching tests and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) revealed that non-radical pathway dominated the degradation process, and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) was the main active species. Importantly, theoretical calculations demonstrated that the synergy of doping and OVs could effectively improve adsorption energy and enhance electron transfer for promoting the activation of PMS. This study offers a deep insight into the catalytic reaction mechanism and provides a new strategy for developing heterogeneous photocatalysts in activating PMS for environmental remediation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000864663400001		
J	Zhang, Shuang; Yang, Chengfei; Yang, Yubo; Feng, Ningning; Yang, Gang								Electrochemical Behaviors of LixMO (x=0.79, 0.30, 0.08; M=Ni/Co/Mn) Recycled from Spent Li-ion Batteries as Cathodic Catalyst for Lithium-Oxygen Battery								ACTA CHIMICA SINICA				80	9			1269	1276		10.6023/A22050206				SEP 15 2022	2022	Lithium-oxygen battery has been studied as a hot spot because of its high theoretical specific capacity. But its severe discharge/charge polarization and poor cycle stability greatly hinder its large-scale applications at current stage. The rational design of cathodic catalysts for the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) is thus essential to reduce overpotential and extend cycling stability. Three kinds of multi-metal oxides LixMO (x=0.79, 0.30, 0.08; M=Ni/Co/Mn) with different lithium contents, which were recycled from the cathodes of spent lithium-ion batteries in different charging states, were explored as cathodic catalysts for lithium-oxygen batteries, respectively. The lithium content and phase structure of these multi-metal oxides LixMO were determined by inductive coupled plasma emission spectrometer (ICP) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Phase transformation from layer to NiO-like rock-salt was observed upon continuous deintercalation of Li+ in LixMO materials (0.79 -> 0.30 -> 0.08). The dependence of the electrochemical behaviors on the lithium content and lattice structure of the LixMO catalysts was also investigated systematically. Compared to that of Li0.79MO and Li0.08MO, lithium-oxygen batteries with Li0.30MO catalyst have delivered a higher specific capacity of 14655.9 mAh.g(-1), a lower charge potential of 3.83 V, and a higher round-trip efficiency of 72.2% under the limited capacity of 800 mAh.g(-1) and current density of 100 mA.g(-1). Moreover, the charge terminal voltage of Li0.30MO catalyst is stable lower than 4.3 V even after 140 cycles. Furthermore, the ex-situ scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques were used to elucidate the reaction mechanisms with different LixMO catalysts. The superior catalytic activity of Li0.30MO cathode can be mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between its layered/NiO-like rock-salt complex structure and oxygen vacancy formed, which can promote the reversible formation and decomposition of discharge product and improve the cycling stability of lithium-oxygen battery. Hence, the result corroborates that recycling of spent cathodes from lithium-ion batteries can serve as novel strategy to design large-scale and effective catalysts for lithium-oxygen battery.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7351			WOS:000865589300008

To make catalysts economically competitive for large-scale applications, even-increasing interests have been shifted to designing nonprecious materials for HER and HOR with active and robust performance. Herein, with the guidance of interface engineering, the monolithic catalyst of Ni-MoO2 heterojunctions on nickel foam (Ni-MoO2/NF) was deliberately fabricated by the in-situ corrosion-growth under hydrothermal condition and following thermal-reduction procedure, which exhibits extraordinary HER and HOR performance, for instance, nearly Pt-like catalytic activities, robust long-term durability even under large current density, and superior Faradaic efficiency in alkaline electrolyte. Coupling with the active urea oxidation catalyst of NiMoO4/NF as anode (treating the hydrothermal product in Ar atmosphere), the assembled overall urea splitting electrolyzer with Ni-MoO2/NF as cathode affords the lower voltage of 1.53 V at 20 mA cm(-2), and keeps this performance overall 120 h without decay. The systematic physicochemical characterization and electrochemical investigations reveal that the heterointerface-induced charge redistribution, individual electrocatalytic functions, superaerophobic/superhydrophilic electrode surface, and monolithic electrode structure together collaborate to the efficient catalytic activity and stability under larger current density.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000860641100001

In this communication, we review the interpretation of these observations and elaborate on the hypothesis that an essential factor in determining the end-product of photosynthetic water oxidation is one of substrate accessibility. It is argued that normally the access of water to the catalytic site is controlled by a hypdrophobic domain in the surrounding protein matrix and that the production of O-2 is optimized by an ordered binding of the two substrate water molecules. It is proposed that upon perturbation of the hydrophobic domain (for example, through the removal of various extrinsic proteins) the catalytic site becomes exposed to excess water from the external solvent phase. As a consequence, additional water binds at the catalytic site during intermediate oxidation steps and undergoes a partial oxidation reaction to form hydrogen peroxide. The importance of water accessibility to the structure/function relationships of photosystem II is discussed, particularly with respect to photoinhibitory damage through the formation of hydrogen peroxide.									78	0	1	0	59	0	79			0031-9317			WOS:A1996UC40700027

However, the electrochemical reactions between CO2 (0.04% in ambient air) with Li anode may lead to the irreversible formation of insulating Li2CO3, making the battery less rechargeable. To make the Li-CO2 batteries usable under ambient conditions, it is critical to develop highly efficient catalysts for the CO2 reduction and evolution reactions and investigate the electrochemical behavior of Li-CO2 batteries. Here, we demonstrate a rechargeable Li-CO2 battery with a high reversibility by using B, N-codoped holey graphene as a highly efficient catalyst for CO2 reduction and evolution reactions. Benefiting from the unique porous holey nano-structure and high catalytic activity of the cathode, the as-prepared Li-CO2 batteries exhibit high reversibility, low polarization, excellent rate performance, and superior long-term cycling stability over 200 cycles at a high current density of 1.0 Ag-1. Our results open up new possibilities for the development of long-term Li-air batteries reusable under ambient conditions, and the utilization and storage of CO2.									198	13	0	0	6	0	200			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000402523900051	28510337

In our protocol, etching at high concentration KOH solution does result in lots of the disordered structures on the N-doped graphene materials (NGMs). Furthermore, the N-doped defects can be remained to a great extent after etching rather than completely remove them from carbon layers, which for the first time paves a feasible approach to disorder engineering toward NGMs to realize DDGMs. More importantly, such DDGMs exhibit significantly enhanced HER activity over the single defective graphene-based materials, including the N-doped or the etched N-undoped samples. Our data further reveal that the excellent HER activity comes from rich active sites of DDGMs. That is, the N-doped defects and disordered structures on DDGMs, might supply more active sites so as to synergistically enhance HER activity of the graphene-based electrocatalysts. This work opens up a novel approach to improving electrocatalytic activity of such metal-free catalysts, and promises the important applications in fields of electrocatalysis or energy conversion.									5	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000692110900006

Under stress, Haematococcus cells synthesize and accumulate large amounts of the secondary carotenoid astaxanthin stored in cytosolic lipid bodies. In this study, the transcriptional. expression of five astaxanthin biosynthesis genes and two plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) genes either in high PFD or in the presence of excessive sodium acetate and/or iron was determined by real-time reverse transcription PCR, and astaxanthin accumulation was measured by HPLC. Photosynthetic oxygen evolution, lipid peroxidation, and cell mortality were also investigated under these stress conditions. Our results indicate that the astaxanthin biosynthesis pathway may consume as much as 9.94% of the molecular oxygen evolved from photosynthesis under stress via at least two distinct routes: (1) extensive oxygen-dependent processes leading to astaxanthin formation, and (2) conversion of molecular oxygen into water using electrons derived from carotenogenic desaturation steps to PTOX via the photosynthetic plastoquinone (PQ) pool. Reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by reducing subcellular molecular oxygen substrates through the astaxanthin biosynthesis pathway may represent a novel protective mechanism to cope with oxidative stress. Reoxidation of the PQ pool by PTOX may further reduce photosynthetic electron transport chain-induced ROS formation. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Here, a heterojunction (CoP-CoOOH) is prepared via a modulating electron density between interfaces for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation to 2,5-furanedioic acid (FDCA) in high concentration. Density Functional Theory (DFT) shows that heterojunction increased efficient charged active centers, enhanced the adsorption of the reactant on the surface of electrocatalyst, and improved the HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR) activity. The electrolyzer using CoP-CoOOH as cathodic evolution H-2 and anodic HMFOR requires only voltage of 1.42 V. Additionally, the diffusion limitation of the reaction is overcome via coupling with the flow reactor, which further improved the HMFOR efficiency. Although the HMF concentration is 150 mM, the Faraday efficiency of HMF and the selectivity of FDCA in the flow reactor are 98.2 % and 99.4 %, respectively.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000833225300004

Herein, we report on heterostructured MoC-MoP nanoparticles supported by bacterial cellulose-derived N-doped carbon nanofibers (denoted as MoC-MoP/BCNC NFs) as cost-efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As evidenced, the presence of MoC can prevent MoP from coarsening due to the strong interfacial interactions, resulting in ultrafine nanoparticles evenly integrated with conducting N-doped carbon matrix. More importantly, such heterostructured MoC-MoP delivers tailored electronic configurations toward the optimal binding with intermediate H, accomplishing the promoted HER kinetics. Thereby, the MoC-MoP/BCNC NFs exhibit higher HER activity and faster kinetic metrics in comparison with the single-component counterparts (e.g., MoC/BCNC and MoP/BCNC). They afford low overpotentials of 158 and 137 mV to achieve a current density of similar to 10 mV cm(-2) and small Tafel slopes of 58 and 65 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Elucidating efficient electrocatalysis on the MoC-MoP interfaces, this work will open up new opportunities for exploring cost-efficient electrocatalysts in sustainable energy conversion.

The development of catalysts that can compete with, or exceed, the performance of the exorbitant platinum (Pt)-based benchmark is highly desirable. Here, we demonstrate the development of a highly active HER catalyst electrode, exhibiting Pt-like performances in both neutral electrolytes and natural seawater. The catalyst was obtained by pyrolysing a manganese-based metal organic framework (Mn-MOF) on nickel foam (Ni-F). We discovered for the first time that nickel foam not only acts as the substrate for catalyst growth but also provides nickel species that interact with the Mn-MOF, resulting in the formation of Mn doped nickel oxide/nickel hetero-structures on Ni-F (Mn-NiO-Ni/Ni-F). The potential utilization of this catalyst electrode for commercial applications was demonstrated in a self-customized water electrolyzer pack powered by photovoltaic cells.									114	6	0	0	2	0	115			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000438392400025

This three-dimensional (3D) core shell architecture benefits mass diffusion and electron transfer at the heterojunction interface, and features more active sites and open structure available to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The WS2@Co3S4 NW/CC shows a superior HER and OER activity in an alkaline solution with only an overpotential of 82 mV for HER and 280 mV for OER to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The corresponding Tafel slope of HER and OER is 45 and 52 mV dec(-1), respectively. Moreover, the WS2@Co3S4 NW/CC can maintain HER/OER activity without significant loss for 24 h at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The superior bifunctional catalytic performance of WS2@Co3S4 NW/CC can substantially expedite its application in overall water splitting, which can deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) with only cell voltage of 1.56 V in a two-electrode electrolytic cell.

Herein, we report the synthesis of ruthenium doped nickel hydroxide on commercial nickel foam (Ru-Ni(OH)(2)/NF) by using simple hydrothermal method. Due to integrated assembly and porous structure, as prepared Ru-Ni(OH)(2)/NF is explored as an electrocatalyst for HER in 0.5 M H(2)SO(4)solution at room temperature. The Ru-Ni(OH)(2)/NF showed excellent electrocatalytic HER activity with Tafel slope of 94 mV/dec. The overpotential of Ru-Ni(OH)(2)/NF required to deliver 10 mAcm(-2)current density was calculated to be 27 mV, which is smaller than that of commercial Pt/C/NF catalyst (33 mV). Furthermore, the Ru-Ni(OH)(2)/NF has shown decent stability and notable durability. The enhanced HER activity of Ru-Ni(OH)(2)/NF is attributed to Ru doping Ni(OH)(2)/NF and effective contacts between the Ru-Ni(OH)(2)and NF substrate. Finally, these results may provide guidance to the design of Pt-free catalysts for effective energy related electrocatalytic applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2365-6549			WOS:000563990600010

The composition, nanostructure and morphology of the films were thoroughly characterized and their electrocatalytic activities towards hydrogen and oxygen evolution in alkaline solutions were assessed. The electrochemical performances were correlated with material characteristics. The cobalt-based film morphology and structure changed significantly with increasing growth temperature, from nanocrystalline dense film, through uniform monocrystalline nanopillar structure, up to coarser irregular grains. Also, the film composition has clearly changed in the series of electrodes. The films prepared at lower temperatures were predominantly composed of CoCO3, while at higher temperatures their primary component was Co3O4. For prepared electrodes, the influence of material morphology on hydrogen evolution activity is shown to be pivotal, while no effect of material composition on performance is confirmed. Careful control over deposition parameters enabled formation of the film with optimal electrocatalytic performance towards both HER and OER, characterized with nanopillar morphology topped with pyramid-shape caps, providing high electrochemically active surface area for electrochemical reactions. The optimized electrode requires the overpotentials of 270 and 400 mV to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER respectively.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000514827600066

Unfortunately, the catalytic activity of MoS2 is limited to a few edge sites and by its low conductivity. Herein, MoS2/NiS heterostructures possessing a flower-like morphology were constructed via an accurate thermal treatment process to realize precise interface modification. As expected, through the adjunction of a certain amount of polyvinylpyrrolidone, NiS grew uniformly on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets, thereby forming a large number of visual lattice fringes with a specific interplanar spacing, which promoted a higher electron-transfer efficiency. The better electron-transfer efficiency resulted in a better hydrogen evolution reaction performance, providing an overpotential of 158 mV at 10 mA cm(-1), a Tafel slope of 128.1 mV dec(-1), and significantly long-term durability. Moreover, density functional theory calculation also showed that the precise interface modification of MoS2/NiS heterostructure exhibited more occupations at the Fermi level, which improved the electrical conductivity. Additionally, the MoS2/NiS catalysts achieved a moderately lower hydrogen adsorption energy (Delta G(H*)), indicating that it had better catalytic hydrogen evolution performance. This work can be extended to design other catalytic materials and for understanding reactions in the fields of energy conversion through theoretical calculations.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000754026800001

As a useful to improve photocatalytic efficiency, the development of alpha-Fe2O3 nanocrystals with different exposed facets and interfaces has attracted enormous attention. But literature survey shows that alpha-Fe2O3 nanomaterials were mainly used in photoelectrochemical cell for water splitting as anode materials. In this work, highly efficient Pt/PtOx cocatalyst decorated alpha-Fe2O3 shaped-photocatalysts were derived as photocatalyst for white light-induced O-2 generation from water without any electric potential. The maximum apparent quantum efficiency of photooxidation reaction was reached 55.33 % by Pt/PtOx decorated bitruncated-dodecahedron shaped alpha-Fe2O3 and around 30.5, 2.3, 1.28 times better than the Pt/PtOx decorated nanocuboid, nanorod and bitruncated-octahedron shape respectively. The Pt/PtOx decorated bitruncated-dodecahedron shaped alpha-Fe2O3 display an unusual photooxidation activity with a high TOF (1.96x10(-2) s(-1)) due to presence of destabilized and unsaturated Fe centre containing high energy {104} and {100} facets. The present findings clearly demonstrate that the selective O-2 evolution from water can possible without any sacrificial agent.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000528050700024

However, it is still not easy to realize excellent catalytic performance with high surface area, homogeneous distribution of heteroatoms, valid active sites and graphitized carbon, simultaneously. Herein, intensive research of ZnCo bimetallic MOFs by different mole ratios of Zn/Co were prepared by a new strategy through polycondensation of dopamine. When the mole ratio of Zn/Co was 5:1, bimetal MOF-based electrocatalysts exhibited higher intrinsic activities in O-2-0.1 M KOH for ORR with onset potential of 0.94 V and half-wave potential of 0.838 V, which was comparable than that of Pt-C from JM. It also exhibited higher stability than Pt-C in alkaline condition, which can be due to good synergistic effect of high-surface-area carbons with high nitrogen content provided by ZIF-8 as well as Co-Nx sites, good graphitized carbon provided by ZIF-67. Overall, above results indicate that bimetal MOF-based electrocatalyst (Zn:Co=5:1) is a promising alternative electrocatalyst for energy and environmental applications.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3				2053-1591		WOS:000516858200002

However, a precise understanding on the activities trends and origins of ACs is still under exploration. We investigate the electrocatalytic performance of a series of ACs in this work. Density functional theory(DFT) calculations reveal that the half reactions of OER and HER are site-dependent on ACs, which are preferentially proceeded on the metal site and the nearby bonded carbon site, respectively. Besides, the d-band center of metal atoms is the most important descriptor, which can perfectly correlate the high activities of ACs towards the two half reactions. Especially for HER, the deeper d-band position of metal atoms corresponds to much stronger d-p(x)(p(y)) orbital coupling in ACs, which activate more obvious charge transfer between the metal site and the nearby bonded carbon site, resulting in the HER activity enhancement of ACs. These results are of great significance in guiding the precise synthesis of highly efficient bifunctional metal atom catalysts supported by GDY in future.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1005-9040	2210-3171		WOS:000710611100003

Taking reduced graphene oxide supported tantalum-oxides (TaOx/RGO) for example, this work illustrated the controlled N-doping in both metal-oxides and carbon supports, and the contribution to the improved ORR activity. The active N-doped TaOx/RGO electrocatalysts were fabricated via SiO2-assisted pyrolysis, in which the amount and kind of N-doping were tailored toward efficient electrocatalysis. The optimal nanocomposites showed a quite positive half-wave potential (0.80 V vs. RHE), the excellent long-term stability, and the outstanding tolerance to methanol crossing. The improvement in ORR was reasonably attributed to the synergy between N-doped TaOx and N-doped RGO. Elucidating the importance of controlled N-doping for electrocatalysis, this work will open up new opportunities to explore noble-metal-free materials for renewable energy applications.

Herein, we report the oxygen vacancies and morphological modulation of vacancy-rich Co3O4 stabilized Ru nanoparticles (NPs) (Ru/VO-Co3O4) to boost the catalytic activity and durability for hydrogen production from the hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB). The well-defined and small-sized Ru NPs and VO-Co3O4 induced morphology transformation via in situ driving VO-Co3O4 to 2D nanosheets with abundant oxygen vacancies or Co2+ species considerably promote the catalytic activity and durability toward hydrogen evolution from AB hydrolysis. Specifically, the Ru/VO-Co3O4 pre-catalyst exhibits an excellent catalytic activity with a high turnover frequency of 2114 min-1 at 298 K. Meanwhile, the catalyst also shows a high durability toward AB hydrolysis with six successive cycles. This work establishes a facile but efficient strategy to construct high-performance catalysts for AB hydrolysis. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The grid covers the mass range from 0.52 to 1.0 M-circle dot, and is appropriate for the study of white dwarfs in metal-rich clusters. The evolutionary calculations are based on a detailed and self-consistent treatment of the energy released from these two processes, as well as on the employment of realistic carbon/oxygen profiles, of relevance for an accurate evaluation of the energy released by carbon/oxygen phase separation. We find that Ne-22 sedimentation strongly delays the cooling rate of white dwarfs stemming from progenitors with high metallicities at moderate luminosities, while carbon/oxygen phase separation adds considerable delays at low luminosities. Cooling times are sensitive to possible uncertainties in the actual value of the diffusion coefficient of Ne-22. Changing the diffusion coefficient by a factor of 2 leads to maximum age differences of approximate to 8%-20% depending on the stellar mass. We find that the magnitude of the delays resulting from chemical changes in the core is consistent with the slowdown in the white dwarf cooling rate that is required to solve the age discrepancy in NGC 6791.									43	1	0	0	1	0	43			0004-637X			WOS:000280653100054

Distinguished from ZPT particles prepared by usual precipitation reaction, the obtained ZPT nanoparticles exhibited very narrow size distribution. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at Zn K-edge was systematically examined to elucidate time-dependent local structural evolution during solid transchelation reaction. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis clearly revealed that local environment around zinc atoms transformed into pentahedron as reaction proceeded. Based on quantitative X-ray diffraction and XANES analysis, we made structural models. Theoretical XAS spectrum calculated with FEFF code could reproduce experimental one, suggesting that XAS analysis could be very powerful tool to probe phase transformation. Furthermore, according to extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results, Zn-O distance in reaction products gradually increased from 1.96 to 2.07 angstrom, suggesting that zinc atoms bounded with oxygen ones in ZBS were transchelated with pyrithione ligands. This study could be a strong evidence for the usefulness of XAS to study time-dependent structural transformation of nanocrystalline materials.

Herein, for the first time, we report that the defect in 1D noble metal nanostructures is a largely unrevealed yet essential factor in achieving highly active and stable electrocatalysts toward fuel cell reactions. The detailed electrocatalytic results show that the Pd-Sn nanowires (NWs) exhibit interesting defect-dependent performance, in which the defect-rich Pd4Sn wavy NWs display the highest activity and durability for both the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that a large number of surface vacancies/agglomerated voids are the driving forces for forming surface grain boundaries (GBs) within Pd4Sn WNWs. These electronic active GB regions are the key factors in preserving the number of Pd-0 sites, which are critical for minimizing the intrinsic site-to-site electron-transfer barriers. Through this defect engineering, the Pd4Sn WNWs ultimately yield highly efficient alkaline ORR and MOR. The present work highlights the importance of defect engineering in boosting the performance of electrocatalysts for potentially practical fuel cells and energy applications.									43	2	0	0	0	0	44			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000490353500023	31547661

Kinetic studies with cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate as primary oxidant show that oxygen evolution is rapid and continues over many hours. In addition, [Cp*Ir(H2O)(3)]SO4 and [(Cp*Ir)(2)(mu-OH)(3)PH can show even higher turnover frequencies (up to 20 min(-1) at pH 0.89). Aqueous electrochemical studies on the cationic complexes having chelate ligands show catalytic oxidation at pH > 7; conversely, at low pH, there are no oxidation waves up to 1.5 V vs NHE for the complexes. (H2O)-O-18 isotope incorporation studies demonstrate that water is the source of oxygen atoms during cerium(IV)-driven catalysis. DFT calculations and kinetic experiments, including kinetic-isotope-effect studies, suggest a mechanism for homogeneous iridium-catalyzed water oxidation and contribute to the determination of the rate-determining step. The kinetic experiments also help distinguish the active homogeneous catalyst from heterogeneous nanoparticulate iridium dioxide.									453	8	0	0	44	1	458			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000284202200044	20964386

Here, the LiCl/KCl eutectic melt was used as a high-temperature solvent; 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole-5-thiol simultaneously acts as a carbon nitride precursor, sulfur source, and reducing agent for Mo5+, while MoCl5 was added as a metal source for MoS2 nanoparticles being active centers for the water reduction reaction. Water oxidation centers could be created using the rich complexation chemistry of 1,2,4-triazoles. Namely, cobalt species were introduced into carbon nitride network using Co-3[3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole](6) complex as a dopant, prepared in a separate step. The developed method enables one to control the cocatalysts' loading and tune the dimensions of MoS2 NPs. The materials reported here show 10% of the efficiency of a reference Pt/mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride composite in hydrogen evolution, and half of the performance of the reference Co3O4/S-doped carbon nitride material, prepared by multistep synthesis, in oxygen evolution, however, in one and the same system.									41	3	0	0	1	0	45			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000370112200014

An l(p)=0 resonance has been newly identified at a center-of-mass energy in the Al-26(m)+p system of 146.3(3) keV and is expected to dominate the rate for low stellar temperatures.

However, the PEC performance of hematite is known to be inhibited by a short carrier diffusion length and slow kinetics for the oxygen evolution process. The rational control of morphology, crystallinity, and interfacial charge transfer plays an important role in tuning the PEC performance of alpha-Fe2O3 photoelectrodes. In this study, different iron oxide nano/microstructures are synthesized by the sintering of iron sheets in air at different temperatures. The synergetic effect of the surface morphology and crystallinity on the photocurrent and onset potential of the photoanode is investigated. The coral-like structure with high index (104) facets prepared at a high temperature shows a decreased onset potential, suggesting a strong correlation between the onset potential and crystalline orientation. To further improve the photocurrent density of this hematite photoanode, cupric oxide-hematite heterostructures are explored. An obvious improvement in the photocurrent density is observed from 1.1 to 1.6 V. The resulting alpha-Fe2O3/CuO photoanode exhibits a photocurrent density of 1.5 mA cm(-2) at 1.6 V, 25% higher than that of the pristine hematite. The Mott-Schottky plot and EIS measurement indicate that the alpha-Fe2O3/CuO heterojunction facilitates the extraction of the accumulated holes in the hematite through a type-II band alignment and the CuO can serve as a catalyst for promoting the oxygen evolution reaction.

The impacts of calcination conditions (e.g., temperature and time) on the electrocatalytic activity and stability of the anodes were explored. It was found that the calcination temperature and time significantly impact the electrocatalytic properties of the anode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This can result from the properties of the surface (e.g., defects, crystallinity and crystallite size) as well as the preferred orientation of the active components. The amount of the defects of the coatings decreases with the increase of the calcination temperature and time. Besides, the crystallinity and crystallite size increase with the increase of calcination temperature and time. The amorphous oxide coating can be observed from the sample calcined at 350 degrees C for 15 min, while this coating can be crystallized when the calcination time is 60 min. The coatings calcined in the temperature range between 350 and 450 degrees C show preferred (101) planes of IrO2 and RuO2 crystallites, whereas the coatings calcined at the temperatures higher than 450 degrees C show the (211) orientation. The increase of calcination time does not change the preferred orientation of IrO2 and RuO2. The calculated voltammetric charges suggest that the active surface area of the prepared coating is dominated by the "outer" active surface area over the entire calcination temperature and time ranges. Given the electrocatalytic activity and stability of all investigated anodes, the anode calcined at 450 degrees C for 15 min is considered the most suitable for applications.

During this process, the manganese-containing oxygen evolving complex (OEC) in photosystem II (PSII), cycles through five oxidation states, S-0-S-4. One of these, S-2, is known to be paramagnetic and gives rise to electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals used to probe the catalytic structure and function of the OEC. The S-0 state has long been thought to be paramagnetic. We report here a Mn EPR signal from the previously EPR invisible S-0 state. The new signal oscillates with a period of four, indicating that it originates from fully active PSII centers. Although similar to the S-2 State multiline signal, the new signal is wider (2200 gauss compared with 1850 gauss in samples produced by flashing), with different peak intensity and separation (82 gauss compared with 89 gauss). These characteristics are consistent with the So state EPR signal arising from a coupled Mn-II-Mn-III intermediate. The new signal is more stable than the S-2 State signal and its decay in tens of minutes is indicative of it originating from the S-0 state. The S-0 state signal will provide invaluable information toward the understanding of oxygen evolution in plants.									161	2	0	0	92	0	163			0006-2960			WOS:A1997YD64900002	9376375	
J	Zeng, Guihua; Wang, Xiaojun; Yu, Xiang; Guo, Jia; Zhu, Yi; Zhang, Yuanming								Ultrathin g-C3N4/Mo:BiVO4 photoanode for enhanced photoelectrochemical water oxidation								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				444						227300	10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227300				DEC 31 2019	2019	A g-C3N4/Mo:BiVO4 (CMB) heterojunction photoanode is constructed with enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation performance, in which ultrathin g-C3N4 is coated on Mo-doped BiVO4. CMB shows a remarkable water oxidation photocurrent of 3.11 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is 3.21 times higher than pristine BiVO4. The maximal incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) reaches 45.5% at 430 nm and the applied bias photo-to-current efficiency (ABPE) reaches 0.74% at 0.78 V vs. RHE, which are 2.62 and 5.76 times compared with pristine BiVO4, respectively. The amounts of hydrogen and oxygen generated by CMB are 18.58 and 9.32 mu mol within 1 h, which are 4.66 and 5.51 times higher than pristine BiVO4. The significant enhancements are attributed to the improvement of charge separation and acceleration of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. Mo-dopant enhances charge separation due to its excellent electron transfer capability. Ultrathin g-C3N4 also boosts charge separation via forming a heterojunction with Mo:BiVO4 and promotes OER kinetics by accelerating the transfer of holes to the photoelectrode surface. The work testifies the promise of combing metal-doping with constructing heterojunctions using ultrathin g-C3N4 to enhance water oxidation performance, and provides an excellent reference for designing and constructing efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.									22	0	0	0	2	0	22			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000501401900023

Long-term stability testing shows the successful operation of the catalyst over a period of 12 days at neutral pH with corresponding turnover numbers exceeding 6 x 10(4). Experimental parameters such as substrate type, electrolyte, pH and thickness of the film are explored and their subsequent effects on catalytic behaviour and performance discussed. Significant findings include the four-fold increase in performance by the reduction of thickness to better facilitate charge transfer and the successful photo-catalysis of the HER at pH 11, with an onset that is 0.14 V below E-0. Faradaic efficiency was also determined with a maximum recorded efficiency of 80% despite known losses such as crossover reactions and H-2 escape from within the system.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000354952500024

The present work involves the investigation of one such material, activated carbon (AC), that is derived from abundantly available biomass - Tendu leaves. The work also addresses hydrothermal synthesis of 2-D MoS2 layers and composites with AC, for supercapacitors and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). AC derived from Tendu leaves showed micro and mesopore structure with high specific surface area (SSA) of 1509 m(2) g (1). Layered MoS2 nanosheets sheets, showed a biphasic system namely, 1-T and 2-H. Different ratios of AC and MoS2 nanocomposites are prepared. And the best ratio composites tested for symmetric and hybrid supercapacitor electrodes and HER. Symmetric supercapacitor and hybrid supercapacitors exhibited good cycle stability and show higher specific capacitance of 261 F g (1) and 193 F g (1) respectively, at a scan rate of 2 mV s (1). Defective sites were created on AC for electrochemical HER. The defects were created through, hydrothermal N doping followed by high-temperature dedoping of the N-doped AC. The defective activated carbon (DAC) showed a reduction in SSA of 1300 m(2) g (1). The nanocomposites of DAC/MoS2 were then tested for HER. The nanocomposites exhibited enhanced catalytic activity owing to better hydrogen evolution with lesser Tafel slope of -84 mVdec (1). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

OV-BiOBr/Cu2_xS-0.2 showed the highest hydrogen evolution rate (509.75 mu mol.cm(-2).h(-1)), which was 12.45, 6.94 and 3.44 times that of pure BiOBr, OV-BiOBr and BiOBr/ Cu2_xS composite, respectively. Obvious free radicals (.OH and .O-2- ) were observed in the dark state for the first time. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the charge imbalance within OV-BiOBr/Cu2_xS in-tensifies after the introduction of the double defects, resulting in enhanced interfacial polarization phenomena. Boosted photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution activities were achieved with the synergistic effect of the internal electric field and polarization electric field. This study will lay a scientific and experimental foundation for the preparation of high-performance photoelectrochemical anode materials with double defect heterojunction.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000809962000001

The Pt58Cu42 after post treatment forms a dandelion flower 3-D structure. A combination of both the branched shape and Pt-Cu composition effects in the Pt58Cu42-nanoparticles shows superior electrocatalytic activity and durability to commercial Pt black for oxygen reduction reaction. The mechanism for the de-alloying and reconstructing of the Pt58Cu42-nanoparticles in electrochemical activity and durability tests has been proposed. It is found that after the durability process, the Pt58Cu42 precursor alloy changes into a substantially Pt enriched Pt-Cu alloy (Pt79Cu21) with a Pt skin. The Pt skin effectively prevents the further dissolution of the Cu below the near-surface to enhance its durability. What's more, the Pt skin exposed to (111) planes which have the lowest surface energy among the low-index planes further promotes the improvement of durability of the Pt-Cu catalyst.

In vivo, this reaction takes place in the large protein ensemble Photosystem II, where a mu-oxido-Mn4Ca-cluster, the oxygen-evolving-complex (OEC), has been identified as the catalytic site for the four-electron/ four-proton redox reaction of water oxidation. This Perspective presents recent progress for three strategies which have been followed to prepare functional synthetic analogues of the OEC: (1) the synthesis of dinuclear manganese complexes designed to act as water-oxidation catalysts in homogeneous solution, (2) heterogeneous catalysts in the form of clay hybrids of such Mn-2-complexes and (3) the preparation of manganese oxide particles of different compositions and morphologies. We discuss the key observations from the studies of such synthetic manganese systems in order to shed light upon the catalytic mechanism of natural water oxidation. Additionally, it is shown how research in this field has recently been motivated more and more by the prospect of finding efficient, robust and affordable catalysts for light-driven water oxidation, a key reaction of artificial photosynthesis. As manganese is an abundant and non-toxic element, manganese compounds are very promising candidates for the extraction of reduction equivalents from water. These electrons could consecutively be fed into the synthesis of "solar fuels" such as hydrogen or methanol.									158	2	2	0	24	0	162			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000297705200002	22068958

P doping in NC can not only tune the electron configuration but also promote formation of hollow nanospheres with larger voids compared with NC. The key to producing carbon spheres with larger voids can be ascribed to the rapid oxidation of P species at high temperature, which provides a strong driving force for the outward diffusion of P. Through optimizing the amount of Mo source, the as-prepared NPC@MoS2 with medium amount of Mo source have demonstrated outstanding hydrogen evolution performance with a small overpotential of 178 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and maintain stable in acidic solution. This superior performance is attributed to the unique nanostructures with N, P dual-doped conductive carbon spheres with highly hollow degree as core and well-dispersed MoS2 nanosheets as shell. Therefore, this work suggests that choosing carbon matrix with large surface area as support is the key to synthesizing MoS2-based electrocatalysts with enhanced HER activity.					18th Chinese National Congress on Catalysis-Energy Session (NCC_Energy)18th Chinese National Congress on Catalysis-Energy Session (NCC_Energy)	OCT 16-20, 2017OCT 16-20, 2017	Catalysis Soc China; Tianjin UnivCatalysis Soc China; Tianjin Univ	Tianjin, PEOPLES R CHINATianjin, PEOPLES R CHINA	28	3	0	0	2	0	29			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000463476300033

The anodes obtained were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The electrocatalytic property of the anodes as a function of the calcination temperature was evaluated by assessing the electrooxidation of phenol at a constant potential. The phenol degradation was followed by UV-Vis spectroscopy in relation to the time of electrolysis. The results show that the applied calcination temperatures induce variations in the morphology (the surface roughness), the Tafel slope for the oxygen evolution reaction and the electrocatalytic activity of the examined anodes. In particular, Ti/SnO2-Sb(5%)-Gd(2%) anodes that were calcined at temperatures below 700 degrees C are more effective for the degradation of phenol, whereas calcination temperature of 700 degrees C produce anodes with low performance for the removal of phenol.					27th National Meeting of the Mexican-Electrochemical-Society (MES) / 5th Meeting of the Mexican-Section of the Electrochemical-Society (ECS)27th National Meeting of the Mexican-Electrochemical-Society (MES) / 5th Meeting of the Mexican-Section of the Electrochemical-Society (ECS)	JUN 11-15, 2012JUN 11-15, 2012	Mexican Electrochem Soc; Electrochem Soc, Mexican Sect; Mexican State Univ; Res Ctr Sustainable ChemMexican Electrochem Soc; Electrochem Soc, Mexican Sect; Mexican State Univ; Res Ctr Sustainable Chem	Toluca, MEXICOToluca, MEXICO	2	1	0	0	0	0	2			1938-5862		978-1-60768-442-8	WOS:000337749400004

In this article, reduced graphene oxide supported Ni doped FeOOH (RGO/Ni:FeOOH) was prepared for electrochemical and photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. The RGO/Ni: FeOOH exhibited a lower over-potential (260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and smaller Tafel slope (32.3 mV dec(-1)) than that of the FeOOH and Ni: FeOOH. Such significant enhancement is attributed to Ni doping and RGO, which reduce the over-potential, improve the conductivity and enlarge surface areas. Besides, RGO/Ni: FeOOH decorated the TiO2 nanorods (NRs) was also fabricated for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation, which exhibited a higher photocurrent density and lower onset potential than that of TiO2 NRs the bare under illumination due to the synergistic effect of RGO and Ni: FeOOH.

In this work, amorphous nickel-phosphorus (Ni-P) nanoparticles anchoring on Ni foam (Ni-P/NF) were prepared through a facile electroless deposition approach. The morphology and composition were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. As an integrated anode, Ni-P/NF exhibits high performance towards glucose electrochemical sensing, with a high sensitivity of 13.89 mA mM(-1)cm(-2), a low detection limit of 1 mu M, a wide detection ranges from 2 mu M to 0.54 mM, and a quick response (<10 s), as well as good selectivity and reliability for real sample analysis in human serum. In addition to electrocatalytic glucose oxidation, Ni-P/NF shows remarkable catalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution and it only needs an overpotential of 360 mV to afford 50 mA cm(-2). Moreover, Ni-P/NF shows excellent durability under alkaline OER condition.

It is important to exploit relatively low toxicity, low cost and environmentally friendly water splitting electrocatalysts. A series of Cu-Ni-M (M = S, P and Se) materials were firstly in situ grown on Ni foam and these materials showed excellent water splitting activity. The Cu-Ni-S material shows excellent oxygen evolution reaction performance (200 mV@20 mA cm(-2)) and the Cu-Ni-P sample shows an effective hydrogen evolution reaction performance (52 mV@10 mA cm(-2)). When the Cu-Ni-S and Cu-Ni-P materials were assembled into a two-electrode system, the Cu-Ni-S/NF//Cu-Ni-P/NF electrode pairs display superior water splitting activity (1.50 V@20 mA cm(-2)), which is one of the best electrocatalytic activities reported so far. The experimental analysis demonstrates that the excellent performance of the Cu-Ni-S/NF and Cu-Ni-P/NF materials is attributed to the rapid electron transfer rate, increased electrocatalytically active area, more exposure to active sites and the superior synergistic catalytic factor of Ni2+ and Cu2+. It was found that amorphous oxides were in situ generated on the outside surface of the catalyst through the analysis of the catalyst after the reaction, and they were the real electrocatalytically active centers. Density functional theory demonstrates that the in situ generated Cu-doped NiOOH shows the optimal water adsorption energy compared with NiOOH. This work offers novel views for the design of relatively low toxicity, stable and inexpensive water splitting electrocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000624242900028	33564801

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays an indispensable role among various advanced new energy technologies,especially in the field of alkaline water electrolysis. However,OER is a four electron-proton coupled reaction. The sluggish kinetics are considered to be a hindrance to efficient water splitting. Therefore,highly efficient catalysts are required to lower the OER overpotential to enhance the energy conversion efficiency. Over the past decade,great progresses have been made in the mechanism of OER and efficient catalysts. Noble metal-based catalysts,such as IrO_2 and RuO_2,show high OER activity. Nevertheless,they suffer from high prices and limited reserves on the earth,limiting their widespread industrial applications. Therefore,it is highly attractive to develop alternative OER catalysts based on transition metals because of their relative abundance,low cost and considerable catalytic activity. Currently,most of the transition metal based OER catalysts are powders,which must be coated onto conductive substrates with the aid of binders. And the utilization of binders will adversely affect the exposure of active sites,conductivity, and stability of the catalysts. Therefore,it is important to develop a highly efficient,stable and economical transition metal-based selfsupporting OER catalyst. However,the common transition metal-based self-supporting OER catalysts have poor intrinsic catalytic activity,low specific surface area which provides few catalytic active sites,resulting in low overall catalytic activity. Besides,the poor chemical stability of them causes corrosion easily and further decreases catalytic activity under high concentration alkaline electrolyte and polarization potential. In order to solve these problems,researchers have proposed some strategies to improve the activity of transition metal-based self-supporting OER catalysts,including preparing porous or nano-scale catalysts,strengthening synergic effects and electronic effects,synthesizing heterostructures by coupling interface constructions and electronic engineering. Furthermore,the corresponding preparation methods,like hydrothermal method,electrodeposition method, chemical vapor deposition,and room temperature chemical bath also have been proposed. Meanwhile,researchers have offered some evaluation methods for transition metal-based self-supporting OER catalysts,such as overpotential and Tafel slope,and hoped to establish an objective and fair evaluation standard. Herein,we summarize the research progresses of transition metal-based self-supporting OER catalysts in recent years,specially introduced the mechanism of OER and the types of transition metal catalysts,and emphatically clarified the strategies for improving the activity of transition metalbased self-supporting OER catalysts and their preparation methods.

Herein, a novel nanocomposite Co-Co(OH)(2)/C electrocatalyst with nanoscale hetero-structured metastable hexagonal-phase Co (H-Co) crystallites and Co(OH)(2) crystallites encapsulated by amorphous carbon shells is developed. We employ a mild thermal decomposition route coupled with in-situ carbon deposition performed at 400 degrees C to prepare H-Co/C core/shell structured precursor. In a following controllable electrochemical transformation at room temperature the partial conversion of the metastable H-Co to Co(OH)(2) leads to the mutual embedding of nanoscale crystalline H-Co and Co(OH)(2) confined in the amorphous carbon shells. Taking advantage of the nanowire array morphology, carbon coated core/shell structure, nanoscale size, and the synergistic H-Co and Co(OH)(2) bi-components, an outstanding bi-functional electrocatalytic performance for overall water splitting is attained with proved small overpotentials (93 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction, 264 mV for oxygen evolution reaction at 10 mA cm(-2)).

Here, we report an in situ dynamic surface self-reconstruction that can dramatically improve the catalytic activity of electrocatalysts. A fluoride (F-)-incorporating NiFe hydroxide (NiFe-OH-F) nanosheet array was initially grown on Ni foam by a one-step hydrothermal method, which requires a 243 mV over-potential (eta) to achieve a 10 mA cm(-2) current density with a Tafel slope of 42.9 mV dec(-1) in alkaline media. After the surface self-reconstruction induced by fluoride leaching under OER conditions, the surface of NiFe-OH-F was converted into highly mesoporous and amorphous NiFe oxide hierarchical structure, and the OER activity at eta = 220 mV increases over 58-fold. The corresponding eta at 10 mA cm(-2) decreases to 176 mV with an extreme low Tafel slope of 22.6 mV dec(-1); this performance is superior to that of the state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts.									137	9	0	0	9	0	140			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000455561300069	30517786

In this contribution, ternary NiFeCo-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoplates were in situ hybridized with Ti3C2Tx (the MXene phase) via a simple solvothermal process during which Ti3C2Tx was partially oxidized to form anatase TiO2 nanoparticles. The obtained Ti3C2Tx/TiO2/NiFeCo-LDH composite (denoted as TTL) showed a superb OER performance as compared with pristine NiFeCo-LDH and comercial IrO2 catalyst, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a potential of 1.55 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH. Importantly, the composite was further deposited on a standard BiVO4 film to construct a TTL/BiVO4 photoanode which showed a significantly enhanced photocurrent density of 2.25 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE under 100 mW cm(-2) illumination. The excellent PEC-OER performance can be attributed to the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles which broadened the light adsorption to improve the generation of electron/hole pairs, while the ternary LDH nanoplates were efficient hole scavengers and the metallic Ti3C2Tx nanosheets were effective shuttles for transporting electrons/ions. Our in situ synthetic method provides a facile way to prepare multi-component catalysts for effective water oxidation and solar energy conversion.									49	2	0	0	4	0	50			2046-2069			WOS:000434694300013	35542379

However, clear observational evidence for O self-enrichment in low-metallicity Galactic PNe with C-rich dust has been recently reported. Here, we report asymptotic giant branch (AGB) nucleosynthesis predictions for the abundances of the CNO elements and helium in the metallicity range Z(circle dot)/4 < Z < 2Z(circle dot). Our AGB models, with diffusive overshooting from all the convective borders, predict that O is overproduced in low-Z low-mass (similar to 1-3M(circle dot)) AGB stars and nicely reproduce the recent O overabundances observed in C-rich dust PNe. This confirms that O is not always a good proxy of the original ISM metallicity and other chemical elements such as Cl or Ar should be used instead. The production of oxygen by low-mass stars should be thus considered in galactic-evolution models.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000374226300025

Water oxidation chemistry of photosystem II								PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				363	1494			1211	1218		10.1098/rstb.2007.2217				MAR 27 2008	2008	Photosystem II (PSII) uses light energy to split water into protons, electrons and O-2. In this reaction, nature has solved the difficult chemical problem of efficient four-electron oxidation of water to yield O-2 without significant amounts of reactive intermediate species such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. In order to use nature's solution for the design of artificial catalysts that split water, it is important to understand the mechanism of the reaction. The recently published X-ray crystal structures of cyanobacterial PSII complexes provide information on the structure of the Mn and Ca ions, the redox-active tyrosine called Y-Z and the surrounding amino acids that comprise the O-2-evolving complex (OEC). The emerging structure of the OEC provides constraints on the different hypothesized mechanisms for O-2 evolution. The water oxidation mechanism of PSII is discussed in the light of biophysical and computational studies, inorganic chemistry and X-ray crystallographic information.									158	3	1	0	56	0	161			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000253117000020	17954436

Here, a core-shell electrocatalyst consisting of CoMoO4 nanorods grown in situ on nickel foam substrate covered by nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) via electrodeposition was demonstrated (CoMoO4/NiFe-LDH@NF). Experimental investigations revealed that self-supporting and binder-free electrodes ensured that the catalysts exposed an abundance of active sites, faster electron transfer, and excellent long-cycle stability. The NiFe-LDH shell with a crystalline-amorphous dual structure served as an accurate active material, lowering the energy barrier and contributing more catalytic sites for water oxidation. Furthermore, the core CoMoO4 nanorods not only effectively avoided the accumulation of NiFe-LDH to increase the electrochemically active area but also acted as a highway for electrons from the active site to the substrate to promote the OER kinetics. Specifically, CoMoO4/NiFe-LDH@NF exhibited lower overpotential (180 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and smaller Tafel slope (34 mV dec(-1)) than pure CoMoO4@NF and NiFe-LDH@NF, revealing its excellent catalytic performance and fast intrinsic reaction kinetics. In addition, CoMoO4/NiFe-LDH@NF exhibited long-term stability of more than 20 h at 50 mA cm(-2), further demonstrating its potential for practical applications. These findings pointed to a potential option for building innovative OER catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000844797100001	36018311

The reactions were carried out in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave at 40 degrees C for 4 h, employing dodecahedral ZIF-67 and hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) as the reactants. The as-obtained hollow nano-dodecahedrons were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron energy, EDS mapping and N-2 sorption-desorption technologies. Electrochemical measurements showed that both alpha-Co(OH)(2) and Cl-doped alpha-Co(OH)(2) hollow nano-dodecahedrons displayed excellent catalytic activities for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and Cl-doped alpha-Co(OH)(2) hollow ones possessed stronger electrocatalytic performances. To deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), Cl-doped alpha-Co(OH)(2) hollow nano-dodecahedrons required a low overpotential of 298 mV, which is smaller than most reported alpha-Co(OH)(2) catalysts. Also, the as-obtained hollow catalyst still had excellent OER cycling stability and durability. After 1000 CV cycles, the overpotential merely slightly increased. Continuously catalyzing at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for 40 h, the voltage only increased similar to 2.5%.									24	0	0	0	3	0	24			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000480592500012	31328759

Part 4. Evolution of functionalities in chars								ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT				134				32	46		10.1016/j.enconman.2016.11.056				FEB 15 2017	2017	The properties of the coal-derived char play crucial roles in coal conversion reactions and the formation of air pollutants. The nascent char is highly reactive due to the existence of numerous free radicals, active sites, and organic functional groups on its surface. Here, we showed that a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques is an effective and precise way to characterize the occurrence, distribution, and evolution of organic functionalities in coal chars. Using these methods, we explored detailed information about chemical features of super-fine pulverized coal chars in different atmospheres, and we also discussed the influence of particle size on the evolutionary behavior of functionalities. Results indicate that, in both N-2 and CO2 atmospheres, the content of C-O species increases with the reduction in char particle sizes. This increment facilitates the heterogeneous reduction of NOx on char surfaces. The chemisorbed NO is susceptible to being incorporated into chars, and being transformed into pyridine-type nitrogen with the favor of adjacent oxygen containing groups. Moreover, the significant increment in oxygen-containing groups with the reduction of particle size is further confirmed through C-13 NMR analysis. It was shown that there is an excellent correlation between estimates derived from XPS and NMR for oxygen configuration. The findings from this work provide some new insights into NOx reduction mechanisms and shed light on the practical application of superfine pulverized coal in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The formation of the O-O bond involves the generation of paramagnetic oxygen molecules from the diamagnetic hydroxides. The spin configurations might play an important role in aqueous-phase molecular electrocatalysis. However, spintronic electrocatalysis is almost an uncultivated land for the exploration of the oxygen molecular catalysis process. Herein, we present a novel magnetic Fe-III site spin-splitting strategy, wherein the electronic structure and spin states of the Fe-III sites are effectively induced and optimized by the Jahn-Teller effect of Cu2+. The theoretical calculations and operando attenuated total reflectance-infrared Fourier transform infrared (ATR FT-IR) reveal the facilitation for the O-O bond formation, which accelerates the production of O-2 from OH- and improves the OER activity. The Cu-1-Ni6Fe2-LDH catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope (33.7 mV dec(-1)), better than those of the initial Cu-0-Ni6Fe2-LDHs (278 mV, 101.6 mV dec(-1)). With the Cu2+ regulation, we have realized the transformation of NiFe-LDHs from ferrimagnets to ferromagnets and showcase that the OER performance of Cu-NiFe-LDHs significantly increases compared with that of NiFe-LDHs under the effect of a magnetic field for the first time. The magnetic-field-assisted Cu-1-Ni6Fe2-LDHs provide an ultralow overpotential of 180 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is currently one of the best OER performances. The combination of the magnetic field and spin configuration provides new principles for the development of high-performance catalysts and understandings of the catalytic mechanism from the spintronic level.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000799180800029	35471968

This investigation study reports on an approach to enable a continuous long term operation of such sensors by in situ self-calibration. This involves a controlled anodic electrolysis of ambient water to generate an additional amount of dissolved oxygen spreading by diffusion. The response of the cathodic detecting electrode, i.e. the actual oxygen sensor, in relation to the additional oxygen spike is a measure of its sensitivity and the basis for calculating a correction factor. Generating and detecting electrodes are operated sequentially under non-steady-state conditions. In order to test the method, the quality of the corrected sensor signal output versus the uncorrected signal is tested by comparison with a benchmark optosensor signal. The approach is applicable as long as Faraday's relationship between electric charge flow and amount of oxygen generated is valid. The data indicate that an enhancement of a planar oxygen sensor's signal output by the self-calibration procedure can be achieved. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Catalase as a sulfide-sulfur oxido-reductase: An ancient (and modern?) regulator of reactive sulfur species (RSS)								REDOX BIOLOGY				12				325	339		10.1016/j.redox.2017.02.021				AUG 2017	2017	Catalase is well-known as an antioxidant dismutating H2O2 to O-2 and H2O. However, catalases evolved when metabolism was largely sulfur-based, long before O2 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) became abundant, suggesting catalase metabolizes reactive sulfide species (RSS). Here we examine catalase metabolism of H2Sn, the sulfur analog of H2O2, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and other sulfur-bearing molecules using H2S-specific amperometric electrodes and fluorophores to measure polysulfides (H2Sn; SSP4) and ROS (dichlorofluorescein, DCF). Catalase eliminated H2Sn, but did not anaerobically generate H2S, the expected product of dismutation. Instead, catalase concentration-and oxygen-dependently metabolized H2S and in so doing acted as a sulfide oxidase with a P50 of 20 mmHg. H2O2 had little effect on catalase-mediated H2S metabolism but in the presence of the catalase inhibitor, sodium azide (Az), H2O2 rapidly and efficiently expedited H2S metabolism in both normoxia and hypoxia suggesting H2O2 is an effective electron acceptor in this reaction. Unexpectedly, catalase concentration-dependently generated H2S from dithiothreitol (DTT) in both normoxia and hypoxia, concomitantly oxidizing H2S in the presence of O-2. H2S production from DTT was inhibited by carbon monoxide and augmented by NADPH suggesting that catalase heme-iron is the catalytic site and that NADPH provides reducing equivalents. Catalase also generated H2S from garlic oil, diallyltrisulfide, thioredoxin and sulfur dioxide, but not from sulfite, metabisulfite, carbonyl sulfide, cysteine, cystine, glutathione or oxidized glutathione. Oxidase activity was also present in catalase from Aspergillus niger. These results show that catalase can act as either a sulfide oxidase or sulfur reductase and they suggest that these activities likely played a prominent role in sulfur metabolism during evolution and may continue do so in modern cells as well. This also appears to be the first observation of catalase reductase activity independent of peroxide dismutation.									88	1	1	0	77	1	90			2213-2317			WOS:000403328700031	28285261	
J	Zhang, Ting; Du, Jing; Xi, Pinxian; Xu, Cailing								Hybrids of Cobalt/Iron Phosphides Derived from Bimetal-Organic Frameworks as Highly Efficient Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reaction								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				9	1			362	370		10.1021/acsami.6b12189				JAN 11 2017	2017	The electrochemical splitting of water, as an efficient and largescale method to produce H, is still hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. Considering the synergetic effect of the different metal sites with coordination on the surface of electrocatalysts, the hybrids of Co/Fe phosphides (denoted as Co-Fe-P) is prepared by one-step phosphorization of CoFe metal-organic frameworks for the first time as highly efficient electrocatalysts for OER. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of Co and Fe, the high valence of Co ions induced by strongly electronegative P and N and the large electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) originated from exposed nanowires on the surface ofCo/Fe phosphides, the resultant Co-Fe-P-1.7 exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic performances for OER in 1.0 M KOH, affording an overpotential as low as 244 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), a small Tafel slope of 58 mV/dec, and good stability, which is superior to that of the state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts. In addition, the two-electrode cell with Co-Fe-P-1.7 modified Ni foam as anode and cathode in an alkaline electrolyte, respectively, exhibits the decomposition potential of ca. 1.60 V at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and excellent stability.									181	6	0	0	4	0	181			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000392037400044	27996250

The ketone is apparently formed without the intermediacy of alcohol and accounts for an unusually large fraction of the product (similar to40%). Radical scavenging experiments indicate that the alkane oxidation mechanism involves both carbon-centered and oxygen-centered radicals. The carbon-radical trap CBrCl3 completely suppresses cyclohexanone formation and reduces cyclohexanol turnovers, while the oxygen-radical trap Ph2NH inhibits all oxidation until it is consumed. These observations are indicative of an autoxidation mechanism, a scenario further supported by TEMPO inhibition and O-18(2) incorporation into products. However, similar cyclohexane oxidation activity occurs when air is excluded. This is explained by mass spectrometric and volumetric measurements showing catalyst-dependent O-2 evolution from the reaction mixture. The catalytic disproportionation Of ClO2- into Cl- and O-2 provides sufficient O-2 to support an autoxidation mechanism. A two-path oxidation scheme is proposed to explain all of the experimental observations. The first pathway involves manganese-porphyrin catalyzed decomposition Of ClO2- into both O-2 and an unidentified radical initiator, leading to classical autoxidation chemistry providing equal amounts of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone. The second pathway is a "rebound" oxygenation involving a high-valent manganese-oxo intermediate, accounting for the excess of alcohol over ketone. This system highlights the importance of mechanistic studies in catalytic oxidations with highly reactive oxidants, and it is unusual in its ability to sustain autoxidation even under apparent exclusion Of O-2.									116	2	0	0	13	0	122			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000223397100009	15310195

The affinity of oxygen for sulfur and selenium, in [NiFeS]- and [NiFeSe]-H(2)ase, yields oxygenated chalcogens under aerobic conditions, and delays irreversible oxygen damage at the metals by maintaining the NiFe core structures. To identify the controlling features of S-site oxygen uptake, related Ni(mu-E-PhX )(mu-S'(N2))Fe (E = S or Se, Fe = (eta(5)-C5H5)Fe-II (CO)) complexes were electronically tuned by the parasubstituent on mu-EPhX (X = CF3, Cl, H, OMe, NMe2) and compared in aspects of communication between Ni and Fe. Both single and double O atom uptake at the chalcogens led to the conversion of the four-membered ring core, Ni(mu-E-phX)(mu-S'(N2))Fe, to a five-membered ring Ni-O-E-Fe-S', where an O atom inserts between E and Ni. In the E = S, X = NMe2 case, the two-oxygen uptake complex was isolated and characterized as the sulfinato species with the second O of the O2SPh-Nme2 unit pointing out of the five-membered Ni-O-S-Fe-S' ring. Qualitative rates of reaction and ratios of oxygen-uptake products correlate with Hammett parameters of the X substituent on Ephx. Density functional theory computational results support the observed remote effects on the NiFe core reactivity; the more electron-rich sulfurs are more O-2 responsive in the S ax series; the selenium analogues were even more reactive with O-2. Mass spectral analysis of the sulfinato products using a mixture of O-18(2)/O-16(2) suggests a concerted mechanism in O-2 addition. Deoxygenation, by reduction or O atom abstraction reagents, occurs for the 1-O addition complexes, while the 2-O, sulfinato, analogues are inert. The abstraction of oxygen from the 1-O, sulfenato species, is related to oxygen repair in soluble, NAD(+)-treducing [NiFe]-H(2)ase (Horch, M.; Lauterbach, L.; et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2015, 137, 2555-2564).									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000488322500046	31465212

In 3D MnO2 electrochemical cycle, the reactions take place at the solid/liquid and solid/gas two phase boundaries. Also, this electrochemical cycle should be able to generate hydrogen and oxygen gas separately at different periods of time. Here, we applied an interrupted pulsed current to reduce the overpotential caused by diffusion layers in conventional direct current electrolysis. The pulsed current, which disturbs the formation of the ion diffusion layer in the vicinity of the electrodes, is observed to be effective above 50 Hz. The best electrolysis performance was recorded at a current density of 0.2 A cm(-2), and the observed cell voltage was 1.69 V at 25 degrees C for a pulse frequency of 500 Hz, which is less than the corresponding conventional alkaline electrolysis.

The principal results are T(eff) = 18 000 K, log g = 2.00, n(H)/n(He) < 0.0001, n(C)/n(He) = 0.01; hydrogen is extremely deficient. The effective temperature is consistent with broadband visual and ultraviolet spectrophotometry and an extinction E(B-V) approximately 0.25, subject to peculiar extinction in the UV (lambda < 2000 angstrom). Assuming a He-shell burning model, a mass approximately 0.8 M. may be estimated for LSE 78.Its previous evolution is reflected in the chemistry of the atmosphere, which contains enriched nitrogen from CNO-cycle hydrogen burning, carbon from 3alpha helium burning, and oxygen from alpha-capture reactions. The latter makes LSE 78 the most oxygen-rich extreme helium star analysed so far, with n(C)/n(O) approximately 3. This low ratio indicates that the atmospheric carbon and oxygen are the products of near complete helium burning. The iron abundance is sim0.2 times solar.Weak and variable emission lines due to He I and C II are detected. but are never as strong as those detected in BD-9-degrees-4395 or DY Cen. By analogy, they provide evidence for a recombination shell, or extended atmosphere, with a temperature slightly below T(eff), around LSE 78.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0004-6361			WOS:A1993MG68000026

Herein, we demonstrated a novel Z-scheme heterojunction, composed of a phosphatized p-type gallium indium zinc oxynitride (GIZON-P) and a n-type g-C3N4 (CN). Results show that phosphorization could reduce hole concentration within p-type GIZON, resulting in the transition of Z-scheme band structure into type-II style. This transformation leads to a completely changed reaction mechanism, i.e., from a two-electron H-2/H2O2 production to a four-electron H-2/O-2 generation. Although this four-electron pathway is dynamically unfavorable, the rapid charge separation by the type-II band arrangement together with thin InP layer at the surface of GIZON-P could remarkably accelerate the rate-limited O-2-evolution process. The phosphatized composite presents an excellent photocatalytic performance, with a H-2/O-2 rate of 1340/643 mu mol h g. The gained quantum yield of 12.6% at 430 nm is among the best results in photocatalytic pure water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000782996900001

A DRX cathode can deliver an exceptionally high capacity of >250 mA h g(-1), implying the participation of cationic transition metal and anionic oxygen redox in the electrochemistry. Understanding the roles of these distinct redox processes in the newly developed cathode is of critical importance for the further development of these materials. Herein, we synthesize a representative Mn redox-based fluorinated DRX material, Li1.2Mn0.625Nb0.175O1.95F0.05 (LMNOF). Using a comprehensive suite of electroanalytical methods, we probe the cationic and anionic redox processes and their evolution upon cycling exclusively from an electrochemical point of view. This work sheds light on understanding the cationic and anionic redox reactions and their roles in the capacity loss for this high-capacity fluorinated DRX cathode, meanwhile showcases a thorough approach to studying the electrochemical properties of novel electrode materials using nondisruptive electroanalytical methods.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000541499600009

The problem is particularly acute during recharge, where the reactions typically follow two-electron mechanisms that are inherently slow. Here we present a strategy that can significantly reduce recharge overpotentials. Our approach seeks to promote Li2O2 decomposition by one-electron processes, and the key is to stabilize the important intermediate of superoxide species. With the introduction of a highly polarizing electrolyte, we observe that recharge processes are successfully switched from a two-electron pathway to a single-electron one. While a similar one-electron route has been reported for the discharge processes, it has rarely been described for recharge except for the initial stage due to the poor mobilities of surface bound superoxide ions (O-2(-)), a necessary intermediate for the mechanism. Key to our observation is the solvation of O-2(-) by an ionic liquid electrolyte (PYR14TESI). Recharge overpotentials as low as 0.19 V at 100 mA/g(carbon) are measured.									48	2	0	0	4	0	48			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000366339600090	26583874	
B	Ge Yu								Small molecules as tracers in atmospheric secondary organic aerosol								Small molecules as tracers in atmospheric secondary organic aerosol								165 pp	165 pp						2015	2015	Secondary organic aerosol (SOA), formed from in-air oxidation of volatile organic compounds, greatly affects human health and climate. Although substantial research has been devoted to SOA formation and evolution, the modeled and lab-generated SOA are still low in mass and degree of oxidation compared to ambient measurements. In order to compensate for these discrepancies, the aqueous processing pathway has been brought to attention. The atmospheric waters serve as aqueous reaction media for dissolved organics to undergo further oxidation, oligomerization, or other functionalization reactions, which decreases the vapor pressure while increasing the oxidation state of carbon atoms. Field evidence for aqueous processing requires the identification of tracer products such as organosulfates. We synthesized the standards for two organosulfates, glycolic acid sulfate and lactic acid sulfate, in order to measure their aerosol-state concentration from five distinct locations via filter samples. The water-extracted filter samples were analyzed by LC-MS. Lactic acid sulfate and glycolic acid sulfate were detected in urban locations in the United States, Mexico City, and Pakistan with varied concentrations, indicating their potential as tracers. We studied the aqueous processing reaction between glyoxal and nitrogen-containing species such as ammonium and amines exclusively by NMR spectrometry. The reaction products formic acid and several imidazoles along with the quantified kinetics were reported. The brown carbon generated from these reactions were quantified optically by UV-Vis spectroscopy. The organic-phase reaction between oxygen molecule and alkenes photosensitized by alpha-dicarbonyls were studied in the same manner. We observed the fast kinetics transferring alkenes to epoxides under simulated sunlight. Statistical estimations indicate a very effective conversion of aerosol-phase alkenes to epoxides, potentially forming organosulfates in a deliquescence event and increasing aerosol mass. Finally, we built a containerless apparatus to study aqueous processing reactions using an acoustic levitator paired with a mass spectrometer. The levitator is capable of trapping droplets with the size of 80-500 mum in diameter for over eight hours. The apparatus is also capable of drying and wetting the droplet in a controllable manner. We performed am example reaction between glyoxal and ammonium sulfate using this instrument, and showed that it could qualitatively monitor aqueous processing reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-13-217-4752-2	INSPEC:15450363

Here, combining density functional theory, ab initio atomistic thermodynamics, and Wulff construction, we have investigated the interaction between oxygen and nine chi-Fe5C2 surfaces, as well as the morphology change of the theoretically established Fe5C2 model at varied oxygen chemical potential under FTS-related reaction conditions. The calculations suggest that the surface oxygen preferentially bonds to Fe sites than to C (Cs) sites. A linear relationship was discovered between the C/Fe ratio of the surface and its O coverage under typical FTS conditions. The weaker bonding strength and lower O coverage at the same oxygen chemical potential on surfaces with a higher C/Fe ratio such as (110)(0.573), (111)(0.602), and (100)(0.402) mean that C-rich surfaces are resistant to oxidation. Elevating temperature and reducing partial pressure ratio of H2O/H-2 will destabilize the O adsorption and at the same time lead to morphological change of the particle with the antioxidant facets contributing more to the total area, which is beneficial to keep the catalyst stable. Our atomistic insights shed light on the process of deactivation caused by oxidation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000619760700025

Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy in the interface sensitive electron yield mode (EY-XAS), first-principles electronic structure calculations, and multiscale simulations, we determined the chemical composition of the interfacial region of a polycrystalline platinum electrode in contact with aqueous sulfuric acid solution at potentials between the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. We found that between 0.7 and 1.3 V vs Ag/AgCl the electrical double layer (EDL) region comprises adsorbed sulfate ions with hydrated hydronium ions in the next layer. No evidence was found for bisulfate or Pt-O/Pt-OH species, which have very distinctive spectral signatures. In addition to resolving the long-standing issue of the EDL structure, our work establishes interface- and element-sensitive EY-XAS as a powerful spectroscopic tool for studying condensed phase, buried solid-liquid interfaces relevant to various electrochemical processes and devices.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			0002-7863			WOS:000451933100035	30369234

Often, improved functionality is expected for heterostructures and surfaces with orientations that do not have the lowest surface free energy. For example, crystal faces with a high surface free energy, such as rutile (001) planes, frequently exhibit higher catalytic activities but are correspondingly harder to synthesize due to faceting transitions. Here we propose a broadly applicable rapid-anneal solid phase epitaxial synthesis approach for the creation of nanometer thin, high surface free energy oxide heterostructures that are atomically flat. We demonstrate its efficacy by synthesizing atomically flat epitaxial RuO2(001) and TiO2(001) model systems. The former have a superior oxygen evolution activity, quantified by their lower onset potential and higher current density, relative to that of more common RuO2(110) films.

In this work, for the first time, we have studied the synchronous involvement of all these driving factors to achieve the highest bifunctional performance of MoS(2)for water-splitting following doping and intercalation of nickel (Ni) and phosphorus (P) in a single-step reaction. Two nanostructures, nanoflowers (1T-Ni(0.2)Mo(0.8)S(1.8)P(0.2)NFs, powder) for large scale synthesis and freestanding nanosheets on carbon-cloth (1T-Ni0.2Mo0.8S1.8P0.2NS/CC) as binder-free electrodes, are fabricated. Co-doping of Ni and P enriches the 1T-phase, expands the interlayer spacing by 24%, activates basal planes significantly and increases the edge density of MoS(2)in the 2D-nanostructures. The 1T-Ni0.2Mo0.8S1.8P0.2NS/CC and 1T-Ni(0.2)Mo(0.8)S(1.8)P(0.2)NFs exhibit significantly low overpotentials of 55 and 99 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2)for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 286 and 305 mV at 40 mA cm(-2)for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Further, 1T-Ni0.2Mo0.8S1.8P0.2-NS/CC (+/-) and 1T-Ni0.2Mo0.8S1.8P0.2-NF (+/-) alkaline electrolyzers require only 1.52 and 1.53 V, respectively, to generate a current density of 20 mA cm(-2)with robust stability, and are much superior to recently reported electrocatalysts, indicating the immense potential of the employed strategy for developing highly efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for water-splitting.									24	1	0	0	1	0	24			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000573889000044

For all polymers the major gas evolved was H-2 and the minor products were C-1, C-2, C-3 hydrocarbons and the oxidation compounds CO2 and CO. The total gas yield increased with an increase in the irradiation temperature, but the ratio of the yields among the gas components was not greatly changed. The H-2 would originate from H-bond scission and the concomitant formation of crosslinks and double bonds in the polymer chains. The minor products of C-1, C-2, C-3 hydrocarbons were products of chain scission at the chain ends, including branched chains, and the oxidation compounds of CO and CO2 were the products formed by reactions of oxygen remaining trapped in the polymer matrix. The yield of H-2 increased with increasing irradiation temperature, which is closely related to the molecular motions of the polymer chains during irradiation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the application of CNs is still limited due to two reasons: (i) the bandgap of CNs is wider than its counterpart due to the quantum size effect, which reduces its effective utilization of the entire solar spectrum, and (ii) the visible-light photocatalytic activity of CNs is still low due to its faster recombination of photogenerated carriers than photocatalytic reaction. Here, we achieve a strong visible-light absorption band in CNs through fluorination followed by thermal defluorination in Se vapor (Se-CNs). Experimental results and theoretical calculations confirm that the formation of cyano groups accompanied with in-situ Se doping expands the absorption edge of CNs from 416 to 584 nm. More importantly, a downward electron spin polarization in the CNs structure improves dramatically the efficiency of charge separation and surface catalysis reaction. The hydrogen generation rate of Se-CNs with 3 wt% Pt under visible-light irradiation (> 420 nm) reaches up to 5411.2 ?mol h-1 g-1 that is 176.5 times of the hydrogen generation of CNs. Additionally, the visible-light photocatalytic oxygen evolution of Se-CNs acquires tremendous improvements. This work provides a new approach for improving electron structure of atomically thin 2D non-metal semiconductor materials.									25	1	0	0	4	0	25			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000639796600004

Co9S8 is considered a promising non-precious metal bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst. However, the electrocatalytic performance of cobalt sulfide-based nanocatalysts is still far from satisfactory because of their poor conductivity, insufficient exposed active sites, and aggregation-prone during continuous work. Herein, based on the inspiration from honeycombs in nature, we synthesized Co9S8/N, Scodoped honeycomb-structured porous carbon (Co9S8/NSC) in situ composites via a simple method. Benefiting from the unique honeycomb composite structure composed of monodisperse Co9S8 nanoparticles in situ embedded within the three-dimensional interconnected network carbon matrix with high conductivity, which facilitates not only the electron transport and charge transfer across the interface but also the exposure of active sites and rapid transport of ORR/OER-related species, the obtained Co9S8/NSC in situ composites exhibit high stability and activity in both the ORR in terms of more a positive half-wave potential (0.88V vs. RHE) than that (0.86V vs. RHE) of commercial 20% Pt/C and the OER in terms of a small overpotential (0.41 V vs. RHE) approaching that of commercial IrO2 (0.39V vs. RHE) in alkaline electrolytes at 10 mA cm(-2). Thus, as expected, the assembled rechargeable Zn-air batteries based on the bifunctional electrocatalysts exhibit a small discharge/charge overpotential (0.96V) with a high voltaic efficiency of 55.1% at 10 mA cm(-2) and a long-term cycling stability of over 4000 min.									69	3	0	0	2	0	70			1884-4049	1884-4057		WOS:000448593000001

By controlling the deposition time, the amount of deposited Ni(OH)(2) was varied over 7 orders of magnitude. The turnover number for O-2 generation, defined as the number of O-2 molecules generated per catalytic site (Ni atom) and per second, increases drastically as the electrocatalyst amount decreases. The electrocatalytic activity of the studied samples (measured as the current density at a certain potential) increases with the amount of deposited Ni(OH)(2) until a saturation value is already obtained for a thin film of around 1 nm in thickness, composed of Ni(OH)(2) nanoplatelets lying flat on the conductive support. The deposition of additional amounts of catalyst generates a porous honeycomb structure that does not improve (only maintains) the electrocatalytic activity. The optimized ultrathin electrodes show a remarkable stability, which indicates that the preparation of highly transparent electrodes, efficient for oxygen evolution, with a minimum amount of nickel is possible.

Competing pillared 4,4 '-bipyridine ligand induced linker defects and thereby guided different oxidization effects in ZIF-67 anchored on graphene during pyrolysis. As a result, engineered Co@CoO heterojunctions with different structural features were obtained. Experimental and DFT results elucidated that the prominent spontaneous electron transfer from Co to CoO induced an up-shifted d-band center of core-shell Co@CoO catalyst towards a Volmer-Heyrovsky pathway for HER. Coupling glucose oxidation reaction with HER led to excellent performance in H-2 production and value-added chemicals compared with an overall water-splitting electrolyzer. This work may regulate Mott-Schottky heterojunctions through defective MOF precursors, which could serve as electrocatalysts for H-2 production with lowering voltage input and bolstering biomass conversion.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000753029900001

Air cathodes avoid the need of aeration, but face the challenges of declined performance during scale-up due to non-uniform water infiltration or even water leakage, which is resulted from changing water pressures and immature cathode fabrication at a large scale. To address these challenges, a three-dimensional (3-D) floating air cathode (FAC) was built around the commercial sponge, by coating with carbon black/poly(tetrafluoroethylene) using a simple dipping-drying method. The FAC floated on the water-air interface without extensive water-proof measures, and could utilize oxygen both from passive diffusion and anodic oxygen evolution to produce H2O2. The FAC with six times of dipping treatment produced a maximum H2O2 concentration of 177.9 +/- 26.1 mg L-1 at 90 min, with low energy consumption of 7.1 +/- 0.003 Wh g(-1) and stable performance during 10 cycles of operation. Our results showed that this 3-D FAC is a promising approach for in situ H2O2 production for both environmental remediation and industrial applications.									18	0	0	0	6	1	19			2045-2322			WOS:000458401500020	30755632

However, there are still significant open questions regarding the role of electrocatalyst synthesis route, and the resulting electrocatalyst morphology and nanoscale structure, in determining the operando atomic-scale structure when subjected to the faradic OER voltage environment. Herein, we report on two nanopartide FeNiO(H)(x) electrocatalysts and their different chemical structures using operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies at relevant OER conditions. The two bimetallic nanopartide electrocatalysts were synthesized using aqueous (NP-aq) vs oil-based (NP-oil) synthesis routes but resulted in compositionally similar surface chemistry as-synthesized. Operando XAS results suggest that Ni oxidizes from the initial +2 oxidation state to +3/+4 state reminiscent of the transformation of alpha-Ni(OH)(2) to gamma-NiOOH; the oxidation state change is voltage-dependent and occurs in both NP-aq and NP-oil nanoparticles. There does not appear to be an oxidation state change for Fe, but the Fe coordination environment does change with voltage. The NP-aq nanopartides resulted in Fe coordination transitions between Fe3+ T-d, observed in as-synthesized and 0.8-0.9 V vs Ag/AgCl conditions, and Fe3+ O-h, observed at 0 V vs Ag/AgCl, while the NP-oil nanopartides resulted in a largely stable Fe3+ O-h coordination with more subtle changes in the coordination environment. The voltage dependence of this Fe coordination transition is nanoparticle-dependent, with NP-aq nanopartides transitioning dramatically at 0.7 V vs Ag/AgCl but NP-oil nanoparticles transitioning slowly starting at 0.1 V vs Ag/AgCl. Additionally, a shortening of both the Fe-O and Ni-O bond distances occurs for both nanopartide materials, but the magnitude of change is different for NP-aq vs NP-oil, suggesting that the nanoparticle structures result in unique changes under applied potential. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis showed distinct chemical environments for the Fe species of NP-aq vs NP-oil, metallic Fe and Ni character in NP-aq, and Ni largely in a hydroxide phase for both nanoparticles. NP-aq results in improved activity and stability during OER, as compared to NP-oil, suggesting that theFe(3+) O-h -> T-d transition, metallic core, and a predominant Fe-incorporated Ni(OH)(2) phase in the shell are important for OER performance. This study highlights that both the electrochemical environment and the as-synthesized morphology of nanoparticle electrocatalysts are important in determining the operational chemical structures and structure-performance relationships.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000746965900001

Herein, a porous nitrogen-doped carbon wrapped Co-Mo2C dual Mott-Schottky heterostructure has been successfully fabricated by carbonization of Co-Zn bimetal metal-organic framework (MOF) for water electrolysis. The heterostructure is found to feature with Co and Mo2C nanoparticles uniformly encapsulated in the highly porous leaf-like N-doped carbon nanosheet matrix. Such a thin porous dual-Mott-Schottky configuration can afford abundant surface active sites and the boosted electron transfer to promote the water splitting. As for hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER), it has demonstrated fast kinetics and low overpotentials of 92 mV (HER) and 338 mV (OER) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. Furthermore, the overall water splitting is stably delivered with a low cell voltage of 1.68 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. Density function theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the interface correlation is favorable to water transfer by electron and speeds up adsorption and water dissociation. The work here opens up interesting possibilities for the rational design and innovation of MOF derived Mott-Schottky electrocatalysts for highly efficient water electrolysis.									60	1	0	0	2	0	61			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000664801300004

Given that catalytic efficiencies are often maximized using metal single-atoms (SAs), two immiscible metals can improve the catalytic activity when they can be present as non-agglomerated dual SAs. Here, we report yet-unexplored synthesis of high-performance electro-catalysts utilizing immiscibility of Cu/Ru bimetal atoms. In the synthesized electrocatalyst (Cu/Ru@G(N)), both Cu-SAs and Ru-SAs are dispersed on N-doped graphitic-matrix (GN), while other Cu-SAs are bridged to Ru nanoparticles (NPs) surface via nitrogen. It shows superior mass-activity with outstanding catalytic performance and durability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), outperforming commercial Pt-20wt%/C. Cu-SAs along with Ru-NPs enhance electric conduction or charge-transfer rate of GN-templates for fast kinetics. Owing to Cu-Ru immiscibility, the coordination of Cu-SAs by N atoms which bridge to Ru-NPs surface, introduces new active sites and brings about long-term stability (over 600 h in acidic media) by preventing aggregation of Ru-NPs.									54	0	0	0	2	0	53			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000526110500050

The LCCP was synthesized by hydrosilylation and condensation reaction. The presence of carboxyl groups has been demonstrated to be crucial to provide high flame retardant effectiveness. The flame retardancy of LCCP-PC composites is investigated by limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertical burning tests (UL-94). At the mole ratio of diethoxymethyl (1-propionyloxy) silane/diethoxydimethylsilane=8/100 in LCCP(3), the best flame retardant performance of LCCP-PC composites was obtained. The LOI value of the composites is 38.5 and the UL-94 rating reaches V-0 when the content of LCCP(3) is as low as 0.5 wt %. Evolution of the thermal behaviors of the composites tested by thermogravimetric analysis shows that addition of LCCP(3) in PC can reduce the degradation speed of PC and induce a reduction of the initiated decomposition temperature of PC.

There is few report about the same catalyst used in two systems and therefore it is of great significant to compare its role of the same catalyst in two systems and explore its different reaction mechanisms. In this work, first 4 kinds of metallic Co microparticles were obtained by different reduction methods through hydrothermal processes, and Co@Co3O4 coreshell microparticles (1-4) were obtained from these metallic Co microparticles oxidized in air or in the reacting solution in situ. The core-shell structure of 1 was characterized by a series of analytical techniques. 1-4 exhibited excellent activities and stabilities in the [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+)/S2O82-/light system when they were used as catalysts for the photocatalytic water oxidation. The maximum O-2 evolution of 1 after 20 min's illumination was 98.2 mu mol, the O-2 yield was 65.5%, the initial turnover frequency was 6.6 x 10(-3), the initial quantum efficiency (Phi(QY initial)) was 15.0% higher than Co (8.3%), CoO (11.7%), Co2O3 (1.2%), Co3O4 (2.8%) and 5 (2.2%). Even after the sixth run, the catalytic activity of recovered 1 still remained 85.1% of initial activity. In addition, the photocatalytic performances of 1 in the [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+)/ S2O82-/light system and S2O82-/light system were compared for the first time. In the nonphotosensitizer system, 1 shows bifunctional roles and acts as optical absorption center and active catalytic site, and oxygen evolution rate is lower and it takes longer time. In the photosensitizer system, 1 only acts as a catalyst, the photosensitizer enhances the light absorption and promotes water oxidation reaction with higher O-2 yield and QE, meanwhile the photosensitizer brings the defect of high cost and instability into the system. Based on the results the two different reaction mechanisms were deeply discussed.

Herein, Mo-doped Co(OH)(2) hierarchical nanotubes (Mo-Co(OH)(2) HNTs) assembled by cross-linked porous nanosheets are designed and synthesized through a sacrificial template strategy. Benefiting from the hierarchical structures based on porous nanosheets with void interior as well as modified electronic structure of higher intensity of Co3+ species by Mo6+ doping, the Mo-Co(OH)(2) HNTs demonstrate superior electrocatalytic performance, achieving an current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the low overpotentials of 218 mV and 125 mV for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively. Furthermore, an overall water splitting cell was assembled with the Mo-Co(OH)(2) electrocatalyst as both the anode and cathode materials, which exhibits a driving voltage of as low as 1.62 V.

J	Zhu, Xun; Xu, ZhiXiang; Liu, Qing; Wang, Qian								The effect of the activation of carboxyl group and hydrogen migration on reaction pathway during the pyrolysis of triglycerides								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREEN ENERGY				17	11			676	686		10.1080/15435075.2020.1791873		JUL 2020		SEP 1 2020	2020	This study investigated the activation of carboxyl group and hydrogen migration on the pyrolysis products of triglycerides. It was found that the activation of carboxylic group determined the efficiency of the decarboxylation reactions. The activation of carboxyl group influenced the pyrolysis products. The glycerol mono-stearate and glycerol mono-oleate were used as the model compounds to analyze the cracking of the ester bond. It was found that the first intermediate formed was RCOO center dot, but not RCO center dot. Large amount of ketone was found in the pyrolysis of stearate, while not in that of oleate. In comparison, alcohol was found in pyrolysis products of oleate, while not in stearate. The results indicated that during the pyrolysis process, the carbon-carbon double bond influenced both the cracking of the C-C bond and the transformation of the oxygen-containing functionalities. The activation of carboxyl group and hydrogen migration played essential roles in the determination of the formation of the pyrolysis products. In addition, the mechanism for the evolution of the acid, ester, ketone, aldehyde, alcohol, and other heavy compounds during the pyrolysis was also proposed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1543-5075	1543-5083		WOS:000548969200001

However, ADN is easy to absorb moisture, which affects its storage and safety performances. It is of great significance to study the effect of water on its thermal decomposition mechanism. In this paper, the thermal decomposition processes of the ADN with water contents of 0 %, 1 %, 2 %, 5 %, and 10 % are simulated by large-scale reactive molecular dynamics simulations. The reaction pathway and the evolution of the main products are analyzed in detail. The results show that the ADN is not stable and decompose easily, namely ADN -> NH3(NH4)+HN3O4(N3O4). The H2O has a significant effect on the thermal decomposition of the ADN. The water contents of 2 % and 5 % can better promote the decomposition of the ADN and the degree of decomposition is also more thorough.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0721-3115	1521-4087		WOS:000554032800001

The as-made Co-N-C possessed hierarchical pore structure and high specific surface area, achieving excellent electrocatalytic performances for ORR and HER. Its ORR catalytic performances were comparable to those of Pt/C catalyst and its HER catalytic performances were superior to those of most doped carbon catalysts in KOH electrolyte. Moreover, its bifunctional electrocatalytic performances for ORR and HER were better than those of most bifunctional doped carbon catalysts in alkaline electrolyte.

The evolution of the valence state of iron with both Bi/Sr ratio and oxygen content has been more particularly discussed. The samples are single phase and homogeneous for x <= 0.5 (Bi-rich) and x > 0.8 (Sr-rich). For intermediate Sr contents, the samples are less homogeneous and tend to contain both Bi-rich and Sr-rich phases. The appearance of Sr-rich phases for x > 0.5 corresponds to the appearance of Fe4+, to compensate for the lack of positive charges due to the replacement of Bi3+ by Sr2+.

Herein, a novel nanofibrous bifunctional electrocatalyst film, consisting of metallic manganese sulfide and cobalt encapsulated by nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (CMS/NCNF), is prepared through a continuous electrospinning method followed by carbonization treatment. The CMS/NCNF bifunctional catalyst shows both comparable ORR and OER performances to those of commercial precious metal-based catalysts. Furthermore, the free-standing CMS/NCNF fibrous thin film is directly used as the air electrode in a solid-state zinc-air battery, which exhibits superior flexibility while retaining stable battery performance at different bending angles. This study provides a versatile design route for the rational design of free-standing bifunctional catalysts for direct use as the air electrode in rechargeable zinc-air batteries.									44	4	0	0	1	0	45			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000413870900015	28994845

Carbon-coated stainless steel as a bipolar plate material in PEM water electrolyzers								E3S Web of Conferences				334				01002 (3 pp.)	01002 (3 pp.)		10.1051/e3sconf/202233401002				2022	2022	The kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) leads to high potentials of >1.5 V vs RHE at the anode electrode during operation. In contrast, an investigation with an in situ reference electrode indicates a much lower potential at the anode side of the bipolar plate which would allow the use of stainless steel and carbon as the bipolar plate materials. This decoupling is induced by the low conductivity of the circulating deionized water. In single cell electrolyzer tests, we show that carbon-coated 316L (C-316L) stainless steel is suitable as a bipolar plate material in contact with the anode and cathode sides of the PEMWE. The coating remains stable throughout the experiments, i.e., 720 h at the anode and 1000 h at the cathode side. Based on these results we regard carbon-coated stainless steel as a sustainable solution for the large-scale application of PEM water electrolysis since it might replace (Pt-coated) titanium in the bipolar plate.

Ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded to the rhenium electrode, after controlled cathodic potential electrolysis, which decrease the amount of oxide present on the surface. This electrolysis implies the lowest quantity of surface oxide reported, to the best of our knowledge, in literature. The electrochemical behavior of Re(0) in 0.5 M H2SO4 displays a separation of the overall potential interval into hydrogen region (potential inferior than -0.11 V vs RHE), double layer region (-0.11 V to 0.43 V vs RHE) and oxygen region (potential superior than 0.43 V vs RHE). The hydrogen region displayed an exchange current density in the order of magnitude of 10(-6) Acm(-2), and the Tafel slope was approximately at 0.06 Vdec(-1), which suggest that the Volmer-Heyrovsky reaction is the mechanism of hydrogen evolution reaction. The capacitance (approximate to 500 mu Fcm(-2)) in the double layer region is controlled by adsorption of sulfate and hydroxide anions. The formation of the surface complex (Re-2(1+) SO42-), was suggested by ex-situ XPS analysis, which is to the best of our knowledge reported for the first time. In the oxygen region, the Tafel slope of the anodic branch is 130 mVdec(-1) and the current corrosion is in the order of magnitude of 10(-7) Acm(-2). Ex-situ XPS provides further evidence indicating that the f levels of Re (0) are Re4f(7/2) at 40.0 eV and Re4f(5/2) at 42.4 eV. The oxidation state of Re(I) displayed the Re4f(7/2) level at 41.3 eV and the Re4f(5/2) level at 43.6 eV.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000659191700007

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are one of the most promising precursors for developing efficient and inexpensive catalysts with the large surface area and the abundant porosity. Herein, a new type of hierarchical CoP hollow nanoboxes (Cop NB) is fabricated for overall water splitting. Benefiting from the unique structural features including large specific surface area which can provides numerous active sites, abundant mass diffusion pathways, and the hierarchical and hollow structures, the as-synthesized CoP NB exhibit high activity and superior stability in alkaline media toward hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions with low overpotentials of 101 mV and 240 mV, respectively, when the current density reaches 10 mA cm(-2). Remarkably, when a two-electrode water electrolyzer used CoP NB as both the anode and cathode, a low cell voltage of 1.58 V is sufficiently to afford 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, this electrolyzer can be powered by a single AA battery, making the CoP NB an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. Such good performance is attributed to the high intrinsic activity and superior structural stability. This work offers new prospects for the rational design and synthesis of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for application in electrochemical energy devices. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The astringency was evaluated by sensory analysis and by a method based on the SDS-PAGE of salivary proteins after reaction of saliva with wine (SPI, saliva precipitation index). Micro-oxygenation caused a stabilization of color, but this effect disappeared after long aging. For the wine with the lower pH a decrease of wine astringency and SPI was observed 42 months after micro-oxygenation. Oxygen ingress through the closure postbottling was positively correlated with the decrease of SPI. Therefore, the astringency and reactivity of wines toward salivary proteins of a bottled red wine can be modulated by controlled oxygen exposure during aging. For both experiments the effect of oxygen exposure depended on wine composition.									69	4	0	0	48	3	73			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000315619000004	23110349

Herein, BiOCl with oxygen vacancies is proposed as an excellent model to study the relationship between oxygen vacancies and photooxidation properties. BiOCl nanosheets with abundant oxygen vacancies are synthesized via a facile solvothermal route. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that after the introduction of oxygen vacancies, a new electron donor level appears in the band gap of BiOCl, extending the absorption from the ultraviolet to the visible regime. As expected, BiOCl nanosheets with oxygen vacancies exhibit visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution. In addition, BiOCl with abundant oxygen vacancies exhibits a higher visible-light photocurrent and more efficient photoinduced charge separation and transportation than BiOCl with a small number of oxygen vacancies. The introduction of oxygen vacancies on the surfaces of semiconductors provides a promising way to improve the visible-light photooxidation activity of photocatalysts.									174	11	0	0	15	0	178			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000423981200032

Here, we shed light on the impacts of nZVI shell structure on its reactivity and air stability by systematically comparing two nZVI materials with distinct iron oxide shells. The nZVI with highly crystalline and weakly hydrophilic shell exhibited ninefold higher intrinsic activity for nitrate reduction and significantly improved air stability than that with amorphous, hydrophilic iron hydroxide oxide shell. The compact-structured crystalline shell of nZVI facilitated more efficient interfacial electronic transfer for nitrate reduction and suppressed side reaction of hydrogen evolution. The protective hematite shell endowed the nZVI with significantly improved anti-aging ability, and the reducing force remained 92.6% after exposed to air for 10 days due to decreased oxygen diffusion. This work provides a better understanding of the pollutant degradation behavior of nZVI and may guide an improved synthesis and environmental application of nZVI.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0944-1344	1614-7499		WOS:000813720600004	35725882

Charging involves oxidation of C3H6(OCO2Li)(2), Li2CO3, HCO2Li, CH3CO2Li accompanied by CO2 and H2O evolution. Mechanisms are proposed for the reactions on discharge and charge. The different pathways for discharge and charge are consistent with the widely observed voltage gap in Li-O-2 cells. Oxidation of C3H6(OCO2Li)(2) involves terminal carbonate groups leaving behind the OC3H6O moiety that reacts to form a thick gel on the Li anode. Li2CO3, HCO2Li, CH3CO2Li, and C3H6(OCO2Li)(2) accumulate in the cathode on cycling correlating with capacity fading and cell failure. The latter is compounded by continuous consumption of the electrolyte on each discharge.									1026	50	0	0	51	1	1059			0002-7863			WOS:000291580400060	21524112

One important stellar reaction is C-12+C-12, but it is difficult to measure in the Gamow window because of very low cross sections and several resonances occurring [2]. Hints can be obtained from the study of C-13+C-12 reaction. We studied C-13+C-12 fusion trough an activation method for energies from E-c.m.=2.2 MeV, which is the lowest energy ever reached for this reaction (down into Gamow window), up to 5.3 MeV, using C-13 beams from the Bucharest 3 MV Tandetron on thick graphite targets. Thick target yield for the C-12(C-13,p)Na-24 reaction was determined through the measurement of the gamma ray yield following the beta decay of Na-24 (T1/2=15 h) in our low and ultralow background laboratories, the latter located in a salt mine about 100 km north of Bucharest.

MMT is a phyllosilicate layered clay with 2:1 type sheet structure with high cation exchange capacity, high surface area and low cost. Three different catalyst with iridium loadings of 10, 20, and 30 wt% Ir supported on MMT are synthesized. Their phase identification, crystallite size, elemental analysis, and thermal stability are studied by means of XRD, HRTEM, EDX, and TGA, respectively. The catalytic performance is examined in 0.5 M H2SO4 and in electrolysis cell with proton conductive polymer membrane (PEMEC). The results obtained prove that montmorillonite is a promising alternative of the conventional carbon supports with the advantage of being both easily available and cost favourable. Ir/MMT loaded with 30 wt% Ir is the best performed catalyst.

J	Gao, Zhi; Yu, Zhi Wu; Liu, Feng Qing; Yu, Yi; Su, Xue Min; Wang, Li; Xu, Zhen Zhen; Yang, Yu Ling; Wu, Guo Rong; Feng, Xue Feng; Luo, Feng								Ultralow-Content Iron-Decorated Ni-MOF-74 Fabricated by a Metal-Organic Framework Surface Reaction for Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				58	17			11500	11507		10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b01301				SEP 2 2019	2019	Transition-metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been regarded as one of the most intriguing electrocatalysts because of its low cost and diversity in functional organic groups and metal centers. Different from the common strategies of tuning the ratio of metal centers in multivariate MOFs, here, ultralow-content Fe2O3 is decorated on the surface of monometallic Ni-MOF-74 based on the fast "phenol-iron (Fe)" surface reaction between Fe2+ and the surface hydroxyl group in Ni-MOF-74. Benefiting from this flexible method, the Fe loading can be finely modulated and thus a series of Fe-decorated Ni-MOF-74 with different Fe contents are prepared. The optimized 0.6 wt % Fe2O3 @Ni-MOF-74 with the Fe loading of 0.6 wt % only needs the overpotential of 264 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2), which obviously outperforms Fe-free Ni-MOF-74 (323 mV) and other Fe2O3 @Ni-MOF-74 and is even superior to the commercial IrO2 benchmark (300 mV). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results disclose that Fe decoration can obviously modulate the electronic structure of Ni center in Ni-MOF-74, thereby resulting in enhanced oxygen evolution reaction activity. This work opens up a new avenue to fabricate excellent MOF-based electrocatalysts for direct utilization in an electrocatalytic process.									41	4	0	0	0	0	41			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000484066500025	31415153

Herein, by means of large-scale density functional theory (DFT) computations, we systematically explored the electrochemical methane conversion promoted by active oxygen (O*) on 66 two-dimensional carbides (MXenes). Most MXenes are stabilized with O-terminated surface under external potential. Through the established OER activity volcano map, we showed that the materials on the right side of the volcano (corresponding to Delta E-OH*-Delta(EO)* > - 1.80 eV) satisfy the stability condition of O*. Taking into account the C-H activation, we presented that there is a trade-off between the stability of O* and the reactivity toward C-H activation, where TaHf2C2O2 and CrHf2C2O2 can be the promising materials for electrochemical methane conversion with a low energy barrier (<1 eV) for C-H activation while inhibiting oxygen evolution. Furthermore, we found that the p-band center of O* is an effective descriptor for catalyst design in terms of stability and reactivity. And we showed that the selectivity on the screened MXenes varies under different potentials, mainly oxygenated derivatives, which stems from more metal-O* bonding orbital filling at the active site. These results demonstrate the application potential of MXenes for electrochemical conversion of methane and provide a feasible srategy for rational design and rapid screening of efficient catalysts.

However, it is still a challenge to develop non-noble metal bifunctional catalysts with high oxygen reduction as well as oxygen evolution reaction (ORR and OER) activity and superior durability, which limit the large-scale application of rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Herein, we synthesized an ultrastable FeCo bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst on Se-doped CNTs (FeCo/Se-CNT) via a gravity guided chemical vapor deposition (CVD) strategy. The catalyst exhibits excellent ORR (E-1/2 = 0.9 V) and OER (overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) = 340 mV) properties simultaneously, surpassing commercial Pt/C and RuO2/C catalysts. More importantly, the catalyst shows an unordinary stability, that is, is no obvious decrease after 30K cycles accelerated durability test for ORR and OER processes. The small potential gap (0.75 V) represents superior bifunctional ORR and OER activities of the FeCo/Se-CNT catalyst. The FeCo/Se-CNT catalyst possesses outstanding electrochemical performance for the rechargeable liquid and flexible all-solid-state Zn-air batteries, for example, a high open circuit voltage (OCV) and peak power density of 1.543 and 1.405 V and 173.4 and 37.5 mW cm(-2), respectively.									40	3	0	0	2	0	40			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000629091100047	33599511

In this research, in order to explore the limiting factor inherent for coal conversion in the CLC system, from the perspective of chemical structure of coal, reaction of a selected Chinese typical coal (designated as LZ) with Fe2O3 was systematically investigated. Thermogravimetric investigation of LZ coal reaction with Fe2O3 at the oxygen excess number I broken vertical bar = 1.0 indicated that after dehydration, there existed three discernible reaction stages as observed, which were attributed to the combined reactions of Fe2O3 with the primary and secondary gaseous products evolved from LZ coal. Meanwhile, the Fe2O3 provided should be controlled around I broken vertical bar = 1.0 aiming at effective conversion of LZ coal and simultaneous proper utilization of Fe2O3. And then, both gaseous Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis of the gaseous and solid products formed from reaction of LZ coal with Fe2O3 at I broken vertical bar = 1.0 indicated that full conversion of LZ coal was not reached with a little unconverted CO occurring, though partial Fe2O3 was over reduced to lower valence of oxides than Fe3O4. Furthermore, in order to explore the insufficient conversion of LZ coal at the molecular scale, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed the distribution and evolution of the carbon functional groups involved in LZ coal after its reaction with Fe2O3 and further found that effective conversion of the aromatic/aliphatic C=C/C-H groups in LZ coal was the rate-limited step at the molecular scale with the relative content of these groups still dominated around 59% after LZ coal reaction with Fe2O3. Finally, solid IR (infrared) analysis and quantitative evaluation of the solid products of LZ coal reaction with Fe2O3 indicated that the length of aliphatic C-H groups decreased due to its partial disintegration, while the aromatization of the residual char was aggravated with the higher relative IR intensity ratio of the aromatic C=C groups, which reduced the reactivity of LZ residual char and hindered the full conversion of LZ coal.									11	3	0	0	1	0	12			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000426795200003

Here, we report eco-friendly synthesis of highly photocatalytic metal oxides (ZnO, CeO2, and Fe2O3) using sporopollenin exine capsules (SECs), the hard structure of pollen, as a template. We generate carboxylate groups on the SECs to induce electrostatic interactions between the metal ions in the precursor solution and the surface of the SECs. The pollen-templated metal oxide structure is synthesized by aggregating metal oxide nanoparticles with the size of 10-20 nm on the micro-sized SECs framework, which have maintained unique morphology of the pollen. These metal oxides display excellent performance of organic pollutants degradation under visible light, owing to high surface area and oxygen vacancies which allow higher reaction rates and promote separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000838176800001

The Mn4CaO5 cluster cycles among five oxidation states, called S-n states. As a result, protons are released at the metal cluster and transferred through a 35 A hydrogen-bonding network to the lumen. At 283 K, an infrared band at 2830 cm(-1) is assigned to an internal solvated hydronium ion via (H2O)-O-18 solvent exchange. This result is similar to a previous report at 263 K Computations on an oxygen evolving complex model predict that chloride can stabilize a hydronium ion on a network of nine water molecules. In this model, a H3O+ stretching mode at 2738 CM-1 is predicted to shift to higher frequency with bromide and to lower frequency with nitrate substitution. The calculated frequencies were compared to S-2-minus-S-1 reaction-induced Fourier transform infrared spectra acquired from chloride-, bromide-, or nitrate-containing PSII samples, which were active in oxygen evolution. As predicted, the frequency of the 2830 cm(-1) band shifted to higher energy with bromide and to lower energy with nitrate substitution. These results support the conclusion that an internal hydronium ion and chloride play a direct role in an internal proton transfer event during the 51-to-S2 transition.									11	0	0	0	3	0	11			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000416203100004	29095617

We fabricated high-entropy ceramic (HEC) nanomaterials using simple pulsed laser irradiation scanning on mixed salt solutions (PLMS method) under low-vacuum conditions. This method, allowing simple operation, rapid manufacturing, and low cost, is capable of using various metal salts as precursors and is also suitable for both flat and complicated 3D substrates. In this work, we engineered this PLMS method to fabricate high-entropy ceramic oxides containing four to seven elements. To address the catalytic performance of these HEC nanomaterials, we focused on CoCrFeNiAl high-entropy oxides applied to the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER), which is considered a sluggish process in water. We performed systematic material characterization to solve the complicated structure of the CoCrFeNiAl HEC as a spinel structure, AB(2)O(4) (A, B = Co, Cr, Fe, Ni, or Al). Atoms in A and B sites in the spinel structure can be replaced with other elements; either divalent or trivalent metals can occupy the spinel lattice using this PLMS process. We applied this PLMS method to manufacture electrocatalytic CoCrFeNiAl HEC electrodes for the OER reaction, which displayed state-of-the-art activity and stability.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000679406500119	34269062

We present in-operando x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of a NaxCoO2 cathode at different charging states. During battery operation, the change in sodium content, the change in cobalt oxidation state, and the evolution of the O1s and VB emissions could be monitored. Comparison with a conventional post-mortem analysis technique showed that the new measurement technique produces comparable results regarding the oxidation state of the transition metal, but sodium and oxygen results show differences due to cathode/electrolyte interfacial reactions for conventional analysis. By using surface layer-free samples in the presented techniques, we could circumvent such reactions and obtain reliable spectra for the pure bulk-like active cathode material.

Here we firstly combine a bottom up colloidal synthesis method with a top down atomic layer deposition (ALD) process to achieve a raspberry-like Pt-decorated Fe3O4 (Fe3O4-Pt) nanoparticle superlattices. This nanocomposite ensures the precision of the catalyst/support interface, improving the catalytic efficiency of the Fe3O4-Pt nanocomposite system. The morphology of the hybrid nanocomposites resulting from different cycles of ALD was monitored by scanning transmission electron microscopy, giving insight into the nucleation and growth mechanism of the ALD process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies confirm the anticipated electron transfer from Fe3O4 to Pt through the nanocomposite interface. Photocurrent measurement further suggests that Fe3O4 superlattices with controlled decoration of Pt have substantial promise for energy-efficient photoelectrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. This work opens a new avenue for designing supported catalyst architectures via precisely controlled decoration of single component superlattices with noble metals.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000428788200009	29557477

Common to both is the need to replace platinum by earth abundant metal ions and the desire to positively shift the redox potentials of the catalysts. The main aim of this study was to prepare cobalt corroles whose macrocyclic skeleton contains trifluoromethyl groups, since they are purely electron withdrawing with no pi-back donation capability. New synthetic methodologies were developed for gaining access to a series of cobalt(III) corroles with two, three, and four CF3 groups and all of them were fully characterized for determining the effect of the CF3 groups on the structural parameters, electronic structures and redox processes. Our most novel findings are the ability to control the number and positioning of the CF3 groups, the macrocycle deformation and the quite dramatic changes in the electronic spectra induced thereby, the isolation of 4-coordinate cobalt(III) corroles and the paramagnetic NMR spectra of these intermediate-spin complexes, and the 180 mV/CF3 shift of redox potentials in the direction desired for the utility of the complexes as electrocatalysts.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000468001400034	30912558

In this work, taking molecular electrocatalysts of fullerene C-60 with a doped transition metal (TM-C-60, where TM = Fe, Co, or Ni) as an example, we conducted first-principles calculations to study the effect of the charge state on the cathodic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our calculated results suggest that the maximal free energy barrier of the NRR with a dissociative mechanism is a nearly linear function of the number of negatively charged electrons (0-3). Nevertheless, the NRR activity with an associative mechanism is insensitive to the charge state effect. The OER activity of TM-C-60 with a 0-3 e(+) charge state exhibits a volcano-shaped trend, which indicates that it is important to tailor a particular charge state toward effective catalytic activity. This study provides new insight into the effect of the charge state on catalytic activity, which could help us improve our understanding of the catalytic mechanism and tailor a new efficient catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1948-7185			WOS:000837850100001	35925867

Herein, hierarchical nanosheets-based ternary CoNiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) thin films are prepared via an inexpensive and facile electrodeposition method. The structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties of films are systematically studied and compared with their binary counterparts. As prepared CoNiFe LDH shows a maximum specific capacity of 360 C g-1 at the current density of 0.4 A g-1 with a capacity retention of 51% even at the higher current density of 10 A g-1. Moreover, it shows excellent cyclic stability of 84% after 2000 cycles. As an electrocatalyst, CoNiFe LDH demonstrates an excellent performance in OER, affording an overpotential of 196 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 with a Tafel slope value of 49 mV dec-1. Also, it depicts excellent catalytic stability with stable operation for over 10 h. Thus, ternary CoNiFe LDH thin film can be used as a promising electrode material for both electrochemical energy storage and catalysis.

In this work, alpha -Fe2O3 nanorods, successively coated with TiO2 and CoOx thin layers, were reported as the photoanode for solar-driven water oxidation. The obtained alpha -Fe2O3/TiO2/CoOx photoanode exhibits superior PEC performance as compared to bare alpha -Fe2O3, with a 3.3-time improvement in photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode. This significant enhancement results from the formed heterojunction between alpha -Fe2O3 and TiO2 for the accelerated photogenerated charge separation and transfer as well as the passivated surface defects by the TiO2 overlayer for reduced charge recombination. Additionally, the existence of CoOx as the oxygen evolution catalyst significantly facilitates the surface reaction kinetics and thus reduces the overpotential for water oxidation. This study demonstrates a collaborative strategy of interface and surface engineering to design novel structures of alpha -Fe2O3 based photoanodes for highly efficient solar water oxidation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000545651700001	32610948

NCO/N, S-rGO has outstanding stability and anti-interference performance and has been successfully implemented in the actual water environment. Furthermore, NCO/N, S-rGO also exhibits HER activity with overpotential and Tafel slope of 107 mV and 71.35 mV dec(-1), respectively. The electrochemical detection and HER activity mechanism of NCO/N, S-rGO are further investigated and demonstrated that the synergetic effect of NCO/N, S-rGO can improve its electronic microstructure and promote electrocatalytic performance. This work not only provides a simple method for the preparation of multifunctional electro-catalysts, but also enhances the comprehension of HMIs detection and HER mechanism.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773483900003

Herein, for the first time, we rationally design a porous hierarchical nanoarchitecture, constructed by ultrathin CoSe2 embedded Fe-CoO nanosheets (CoSe2@Fe-CoO), which is synthesized via self-assembly hydrolysis driven in-situ synergetic selenization of Fe/Co/O/Se precursor followed by Ostwald ripening. As an OER catalyst, the porous CoSe2@Fe-CoO hybrid with abundant CoOOH electroactive sites delivers a small Tafel of 56.2 mV/dec with very low onset overpotential of 280 mV@10 mA/cm(2) and excellent long-term physicochemical stability till 62 h without obvious decay, which outperforms well-established benchmark electrocatalysts (RuO2). The boosted OER performance of CoSe2@Fe-CoO nanosheets is mainly attributed to its iron-doping effect, porous nanoarchitecture, and multicomponent synergetic/interfacial effect between ultrathin cobalt (II) oxide and conductive cobalt selenide (CoSe2) nanoframework. This work presents a facile construction strategy to find a nonprecious hybrid OER electrocatalyst with excellent performance and long-term stability.

Subject to potential cycling treatment in 0.5 M H2SO4, the Cu@GD NA/CF exhibits highly catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction with an onset overpotential of 52 mV and a Tafel slope of 69 mV dec(-1). Our findings suggest that synergetic interaction between GD and Cu is crucial for the catalytic performance of the electrode. This electrode needs only overpotentials of 79 and 162 mV to achieve catalytic current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, and maintains its catalytic activity for almost 20 h. The attractive performances of such array make it promising candidate as a future high-performance catalyst for applications.Summary: The first GD based 3D carbon nanoarchitectures with well-defined porous network structures working as a highly active hydrogen evolution cathode is developed. Its excellent electrocatalytic activities, combined with low-cost, convenient and scale-up preparation process, make it promising candidate for practical and efficient energy applications.

The threshold wavelength for the formation of O-3 was determined to be 200 +/- 4 nm, corresponding to energy 6.20 +/- 0.12 eV, which is hence the threshold for dissociation of O-2. The thresholds of emission from excited O (D-1(2)), O-2 (A (3)(u)) and OH (A (2)sigma(+)) were all observed to be 200 +/- 4 nm, the same as for the formation of O-3 in this photochemical system. The results indicate that, once O-3 was generated, it was readily photolyzed to produce the long-lived atom O (D-1(2)). Further reactions of O (D-1(2)) with O-3 produced excited O-2 (A (3)(u)); reaction with water yielded radical OH (A (2)sigma(+)). These results enhance our understanding of the evolution of the transformation of oxygen and open a window for the understanding of complicated processes in the solid phase.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000432601300001	29717733

This set of experimental results was then used as a database to develop a new kinetic model, using a local numerical simulation code for LPCVD reactors, named CVD2. This new kinetic model certainly summarizes numerous poorly known gas phase and surface reactions involved in SIPOS deposition. Its validation has been successfully performed by comparison with specific experimental data, both along the load and on-wafer. An efficient mathematical tool is then available to better control and optimize the performances of SIPOS low-pressure deposition processes. (C) 2001 The Electrochemical Society.

The accumulation of ROS and oxidative damage has been linked to multiple pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, cancer, and premature aging. Accumulating evidence in recent years suggests that ROS are critical for health. In physiological conditions, ROS are considered as a signaling molecule produced at low level and in a transient manner. On the other hand, over-production of ROS, associated with the dysfunction of ROS buffering systems, can lead to the development of chronic diseases. Thus, chronic ROS release participates in the occurrence of over 100 kinds of diseases, including major diseases that threaten human health, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinsons and Alzheimers diseases), acquired immune deficiency syndrome, stroke and aging. This paper reviewes the latest progress in the presence of oxygen on earth and the evolution of aerobic eukaryotic organisms, ROS types, physiological and pathological pleiotropy of ROS, the major ROS in the body, the generation and reactions of ROS, the association of ROS with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, apoptosis, immune defense, inflammation and cancers. Given the importance of ATP and ROS to life, we propose that the balance between the generation of ATP and ROS by regulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation will be the key to human health.			从历史上看,活性氧(reactive oxygen species,ROS)被认为只引起细胞损伤及生理功能障碍,ROS及其氧化损伤与多种疾病,包括神经退行性疾病、糖尿病、癌症和过早衰老相关。然而,近年来,越来越多的证据显示,ROS对健康至关重要。在生理条件下,低水平ROS的生成被认为是信号分子。另一方面,ROS的过度生成,与ROS缓冲系统的功能障碍相关,会导致慢性疾病的发展。因此,ROS的慢性释放参与许多疾病的发病。而且,ROS生成过量诱导生物分子的氧化损伤,进而导致衰老、癌症和许多其他疾病。ROS已经参与100多种疾病的发生,包括威胁人类健康的重大疾病癌症、心血管疾病、糖尿病、神经退行性疾病(如帕金森病和阿尔茨海默病)、获得性免疫缺陷综合征、中风和衰老的发生。本文综述了氧的出现与需氧真核生物的进化、ROS的种类、ROS的生理病理多效性、机体内主要的ROS、ROS的生成与反应、ROS与线粒体氧化磷酸化、细胞凋亡、免疫防御和炎症、肿瘤等方面的最新进展,鉴于 ATP和ROS对生命的重要性,提出,调控线粒体氧化磷酸化实现ATP与ROS生成的平衡将是健康的关键。						0	7	0	0	0	0	7			1002-6630			CSCD:5749877

The reaction products detected were HCOOH, CO2 and CO32-. The CO32- species is formed from the oxidation of HCOOH and subsequently decomposes in solution to CO2. Conversely CO2 is also formed electrochemically from the electrooxidation of formaldehyde and methanol. A mechanism, which considers the 'active' and 'non-active' nature of the electrode, is suggested. First-order kinetics, with respect to the variation of formaldehyde and methanol, are displayed and two linear regions observed. This is interpreted as being due to the presence of the reaction products of oxidation inhibiting the oxidation of formaldehyde at the electrode surface. Further, a mechanism is proposed considering the species present in solution.									42	1	0	0	16	7	42			0021-891X			WOS:000173467900011

Application to a Cobalt-Based O-2-Evolution Catalyst								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				135	28			10492	10502		10.1021/ja403656w				JUL 17 2013	2013	Solar-driven electrochemical transformations of small molecules, such as water splitting and CO2 reduction, pertinent to modem energy challenges, require the assistance of catalysts preferably deposited on conducting or semi-conducting surfaces. Understanding mechanisms and identifying the factors that control the functioning of such systems are required for rational catalyst optimization and improved performance. A methodology is proposed, in the framework of rotating disk electrode voltammetry, to analyze the current responses expected in the case of a semigeneral reaction scheme involving a proton-coupled catalytic reaction associated with proton-coupled electron hopping through the film as rate controlling factors in the case where there is no limitation by substrate diffusion. The predictions concern the current density vs overpotential (Tafel) plots and their dependence on buffer concentration (including absence of buffer), film thickness and rotation rate. The Tafel plots may have a variety of slopes (e.g., F/RTln 10, F/2RTln 10, 0) that may even coexist within the overpotential range of a single plot. We show that an optimal film thickness exists beyond which the activity of the film plateaus. Application to water oxidation by films of a cobalt-based oxidic catalyst provides a successful test of the applicability of the proposed methodology, which also provides further insight into the mechanism by which these cobalt-based films catalyze the oxidation of water. The exact nature of the kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics that have been derived from the analysis is discussed as well as their use in catalyst benchmarking.									139	2	0	0	23	0	140			0002-7863			WOS:000322103000060	23822172

Reported here are the first estimates of the standard reduction potential of the O-2 + 4e(-) + 4H(+) reversible arrow 2H(2)O couple in organic solvents. The values are +1.21 V in acetonitrile (MeCN) and +0.60 V in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), each versus the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple (Fc(+/0)) in the respective solvent (as are all of the potentials reported here). The potentials have been determined using a thermochemical cycle that combines the free energy for transferring water from aqueous solution to organic solvent, -0.43 kcal mol(-1) for MeCN and -1.47 kcal mol(-1) for DMF, and the potential of the H+/H-2 couple, - 0.028 V in MeCN and -0.662 V in DMF. The H+/H-2 couple in DMF has been directly measured electrochemically using the previously reported procedure for the MeCN value. The thermochemical approach used for the O-2/H2O couple has been extended to the CO2/CO and CO2/CH4 couples to give values of -0.12 and +0.15 V in MeCN and -0.73 and -0.48 V in DMF, respectively. Extensions to other reduction potentials are discussed. Additionally, the free energy for transfer of protons from water to organic solvent is estimated as +14 kcal mol(-1) for acetonitrile and +0.6 kcal mol(-1) for DMF.									142	0	0	0	19	0	143			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000367118100034	26640971

This sunlight-driven reaction is vital to the planet because it directly produces dioxygen and couples with photosystem I to generate the reducing equivalents for the reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates (also known as CO2 fixation). Inspired by this natural process, people are intensely interested in water splitting using sunlight to convert and store solar energy into chemical energy, which is believed to be able to ultimately solve the energy problem that we are facing. Water splitting can be separated into two half reactions, namely water oxidation and water reduction, and they can be studied individually. Catalysts are very helpful in both reactions. Recent progress in finding new highly efficient water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) has shed light on this complicated four-electron/four-proton reaction and made it possible to catalyze water oxidation using mononuclear metal complexes. This article focuses on molecular catalysts that are able to perform catalytic water oxidation at single metal sites. Different series of catalysts (or precatalysts) made of ruthenium, iridium and earth abundant elements (iron, cobalt, and manganese) that can be applied in chemical, electrochemical and photochemical (light-driven) water oxidation are summarized, and their catalytic mechanisms are discussed in detail. Finally, the future outlook and perspective to design and develop catalysts that are efficient, cheap and stable are presented.									207	6	0	0	11	0	208			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000306571800005

The structure of detonation waves and nucleosynthesis during thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen stellar cores and white dwarfs								Pis'ma v Astronomicheskie Zhurnal				10	8			631	40						1984	1984	The structure of a steady detonation wave in highly degenerate carbon 12C is studied in the density range 106-108 g/cm3. A nuclear reaction network for 84 nuclides including protons, neutrons and alpha-particles and about 600 nuclear reactions is used. Conditions are investigated for the existence of all the possible regimes of detonation known in the hydrodynamic theory of combustion. The hydrodynamic (Xh) and kinetic (Xe) widths of detonation waves are calculated as a function of the initial density rho0. The value of the critical density (rhodetsime107 g/cm3) is found below which the detonation of carbon-oxygen stellar cores and white dwarfs does not produce Fe-peak elements. At rho0lsimrhodet the detonation yields a large amount of elements lighter than Fe, such as O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar and Ca. This is in qualitative agreement with recent observations of spectra of SN I and their remnants.									7	0	0		0	0	7			0320-0108			INSPEC:2380493

The effects on all product attributes of the initial translational energy, the initial surface, and the deep H2O minimum were examined in detail. The reaction was found to have insertion dynamics, but the H2O intermediate formed was found to decompose almost immediately - usually within one or two vibrational periods - forming products with nonstatistical energy distributions.									36	0	0	0	0	0	36			0301-0104			WOS:A1991FA71500008

Constructing 2D/2D heterojunctions with large interface area has been considered as an effective approach to enhance the transfer rate and the separation efficiency of the charge carriers, leading to dramatic increase in the photocatalytic performance of the photocatalysts. Here, the state-of-the-art progress on heterojunctions based on 2D materials is reviewed, including the photocatalysis principles using 2D heterojunctions, the categories of 2D heterojunctions and their application in different photocatalytic reactions, and the theoretical studies of the 2D heterojunctions. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of the 2D heterojunctions are also discussed.

The zeolites were activated in He at 1323 K for dehydroxylation and formation of active Fe(II) sites. At temperatures lower than 673 K the adsorbed water affects three main reaction steps involved in N2O decomposition, namely, N2O reversible adsorption, atomic oxygen (O)(Fe) loading from N2O, and oxygen desorption. The amounts of reversibly adsorbed N2O and (O)(Fe) loaded from N2O considerably decreased when water was preadsorbed on the zeolite. The oxygen recombination/desorption is the rate-determining step of N2O decomposition. During the TPD runs, oxygen desorption from the water-saturated catalyst as compared to the dry one took place at similar to 300 K higher temperature. For the first time it was shown that water adsorption on the catalyst loaded with (O)(Fe) at 523 K induces the concomitant desorption of molecular oxygen. Moreover, the (O)(Fe) loaded on wet zeolite was shown to be inactive in CO oxidation, indicating transformation of active Fe(II) sites in the presence of N2O and H2O into an inactive Fe(III) hydroxylated form.									26	0	0	0	2	0	26			0888-5885			WOS:000246803800033

Despite advances in 2D nanomaterials and their heterostructures for application in catalysis, investigation on finite-size supports is scarce. Recently, flat boron has emerged as a fascinating concept in cluster science. Accordingly, in the present study, the ability of the finite-size quasiplanar cluster of boron, namely B-36, as a potential support for transition metals from 3d series (Sc-Zn) is theoretically investigated. We found that B-36 is firm to support the single metal atom steadily. Then, the electrocatalytic activity of doped B-36 was systematically investigated toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Activity analysis indicates that Ni-doped B-36 and Ti-doped B-36 are promising electrocatalysts for OER and HER, respectively, outperforming pristine B-36 . However, despite the superior performance of single-atom doping over the pristine B-36, none of the examined systems can act as a bifunctional catalyst for both OER and HER. In the second part, we focus on the B-38 cluster, because the double-hole structure provides additional opportunities to tune its electronic structure via dual doping and achieve improved catalytic performance. Four pairs of 3d transition metals, FeCr, FeCo, FeNi, and FeCu, are considered to investigate the intermetallic cooperativity effect on the OER and HER activities. Based on the results, a greater degree of synergistic effect is observed in FeNi-codoped B-38. The computed Gibbs free energy for OER and HER confirms the feasibility of OER on an Fe center and HER on a Ni center. Therefore, it is expected that the strategy of bimetal codoping on a single-material platform can provide a new route for designing a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000505632900023

J	Xu, Si-Min; Yan, Hong; Wei, Min				Wei, Min/GSI-8510-2022				Band Structure Engineering of Transition-Metal-Based Layered Double Hydroxides toward Photocatalytic Oxygen Evolution from Water: A Theoretical-Experimental Combination Study								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				121	5			2683	2695		10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b10159				FEB 9 2017	2017	Considerable attention has been focused on layered double hydroxides (LDHs) for their applications in solar energy storage and conversion recently, but the in-depth investigation on the semiconducting properties of LDHs is limited. Herein, the electronic properties (band structure, density of states (DOS), surface energy, and band edge placement) of 14 kinds of (MnMIII/IV)-M-II-A-LDHs (M-II = Mg, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn; M-III = Cr, Fe; M-IV = Ti; n = 2, 3, 4; A = Cl-, NO3-, CO32-) which contain transition-metal cations as well as their thermodynamic reaction mechanism toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were studied using a density functional theory plus U (DFT + U) method. The calculation results indicate that the (003) plane is the most preferably exposed surface, and all these calculated LDHs are visible light responsive. The OER driving force and overpotential for these LDHs were obtained via their band edge placement and thermodynamic mechanism, and the results show that 10 of the calculated 12 LDHs (Ni2Ti-Cl-, Cu2Ti-Cl-, Zn2Ti-Cl-, Ni2Cr-Cl-, Zn2Cr-Cl-, Co2Fe-Cl-, Ni2Cr-NO3-, Ni2Cr-CO3-, Ni3Cr-Cl-, and Ni4Cr-Cl-LDHs) can overcome the reaction barriers by virtue of their driving force of photogenerated hole. Experimental observations further prove that NinCr-A-LDHs (n = 2, 3, 4; A = Cl-, NO3-, CO32-) are efficient OER photocatalysts, among which Ni2Cr-Cl-LDH shows the most active photocatalytic OER performance (O-2 generation rate 1037 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)). In the meantime, Mg2Cr-Cl-LDH has no OER activity, agreeing well with the theoretical prediction. This work provides theoretical insight into the photocatalytic OER performance of LDHs materials which contain transition-metal cations with semiconducting property, which would show potential application in optical/optoelectronic field.									88	5	0	0	5	0	89			1932-7447			WOS:000394080900023

In this work, interlaced rosette-like MoS2/Ni3S2/NiFe-layered double hydroxide/nickel foam (LDH/NF) is successfully synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal reaction. Due to its unique interlaced heterostructure, MoS2/Ni3S2/NiFe-LDH/NF exhibits excellent bifunctional catalytic activity towards the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea. In a concurrent two-electrode electrolyser (MoS2/Ni3S2/NiFe-LDH/NF(+,-)), only voltage of 1.343 V is required to reach 50 mA cm(-2), which is 216 mV lower than for pure water splitting. Furthermore, after 16 h of urea electrolysis in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea, the current density remains at 98% of the original value. Thus, the catalyst is not only favorable for H-2 production, but also has great significance for the problem of urea-rich wastewater treatment. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Py-GC/MS (micro pyrolyzer coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry) was employed to identify the distribution of pyrolytic products under temperatures of 150-850 degC. It was found that the yields of methoxylated monoaromatics underwent tendencies of first increase and then decrease at high temperature. Polyaromatics and benzofuran were only detected at high temperature. Based on experimental analysis, a detailed pyrolysis kinetic model was developed by combining the density functional theory (DFT) and the transition state theory (TST). The homolysis of Css-O was the most favorable route for the initial depolymerization of dimer rather than the concerted retro-ene fragmentation. For the evolution of intermediate products, the breakage of ether bond and the keto-enol tautomerization of enols were the most favorable routes, while intramolecular cyclization and group dissociation exhibited high energy barriers and low reaction rates. The methoxyl in guaiacol preferred to undergo demethylation leading to the formation of catechol. [All rights reserved Elsevier].									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1540-7489			INSPEC:16833683

Stellar evolution theory predicts the existence of a gap in the black hole mass distribution at high mass due to the effects of pair instability. Previously, we showed that the location of the gap is robust against model uncertainties, but it does depend sensitively on the uncertain C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 rate. This rate is of great astrophysical significance and governs the production of oxygen at the expense of carbon. We use the open-source MESA stellar evolution code to evolve massive helium stars to probe the location of the mass gap. We find that the maximum black hole mass below the gap varies between 40 M-circle dot and 90 M-circle dot, depending on the strength of the uncertain 12C(alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction rate. With the first 10 gravitational-wave detections of black holes, we constrain the astrophysical S-factor for 12C(alpha, gamma)O-16, at 300 keV, to S-300 > 175 keV b at 68% confidence. With O(50) detected binary black hole mergers, we expect to constrain the S-factor to within +/- 10-30 keV b. We also highlight a role for independent constraints from electromagnetic transient surveys. The unambiguous detection of pulsational pair-instability supernovae would imply that S-300 > 79 keV b. Degeneracies with other model uncertainties need to be investigated further, but probing nuclear stellar astrophysics poses a promising science case for the future gravitational-wave detectors.									69	0	0	0	0	0	69			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000579654500001

In this study, a general and facile one-pot strategy was developed for the synthesis of nitrogen doped holey carbon with MoS2-MoP nanosheets (MoS2-MoP-CNS) for HER in alkaline media. The obtained electrocatalyst exhibited lower overpotential (93 mV vs. RHE) relative to MoP-CNS (163 mV) and MoS2-CNS (335 mV) is required to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the basic electrolyte. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of MoS2-MoP-CNS can be attributed to its specific layered structure with abundant holes, which exposes more active sites. Moreover, the peculiar nitrogen doped carbon layers improved conductivity and avoided aggregation of catalysts. Thus, the presented approach for the synthesis of effective catalyst for HER in alkaline medium can easily be extended and used as a general approach for the development of large-scale and low-cost electrocatalysts.

The principle of the deposition of the thin films was based on the slow oxidation of Co2+ ion with BrO3- ion to Co3+ ion and subsequent spontaneous hydrolysis to form a Co3O4 colloid. When the rate of oxidation was slow enough to allow heterogeneous nucleation to predominate, smooth and adherent thin films were obtained. The thin films consisted of particles less than 100 nm in diameter with low crystallinity and showed electrochromism upon applying anodic/cathodic voltage in a basic aqueous electrolyte and electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution.

The synthesized Pd-RA coordination polymer, as a new precursor material, is the combination of Pd, S, N, and C in its structural backbone. The in situ formation of PdSNC was achieved by controlled carbonization of the Pd-RA precursor. The doping of S and N into carbon networks modulates the electronic structure and strengthens the affinity of the Pd NPs with the carbon surface, which reveals the improved electrical and electrochemical performance of the PdSNC catalyst. The electrochemical investigation of the oxygen reduction reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction (ORR and HER, respectively) reveals that the combination of S and N in Pd carbon is more active than mere Pd carbons. The combined benefits from the binary heteroatoms (S and N) in the carbon texture are offered to modulate the electronic structure and stabilize Pd NPs, thus augmenting the stable electrocatalytic activity as an alternative to expensive commercial PtC. The half-wave potential of the ORR for PdSNC was 0.869 V with 4.0 electron transfer, which is better than those of PdC (0.791 V), PtC (0.830 V), and its counterpart SNC (0.786 V) catalysts. Besides, the overpotential of PdSNC showing a great promise as the HER catalyst to achieve a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) is only 0.030 V, which is much better than that of PdC and comparable to that of PtC. This all-in-one-step strategy (doping and PdC formation) is a promising approach to design heteroatoms-stabilized carbon-metal composites with a high electrocatalytic performance for sustainable energy applications.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2574-0962			WOS:000613720100064

EPMA and TEM analyses of the scapolite and its exsolution lamellae from a mafic granulite in Dinggye area show that: (1) the scapolite is rich in S02,-; (2) the lamellae are troilite with (001) parallel to the host crystal (100); and (3) its unit cell of the lamellae is: a = b =0. 5968nm, c =1. 174nm, a = p =90, -y =120. The scapolite before exsolution formed in eclogite facies conditions and its upper limit of pressure is strongly controlled by Fe content. During later granulite facies metamorphism, S042- with these scapolites experienced a self-redox reaction to produce the lamellae plus 02 in a H20 -free condition, the reaction equation is described as follows: Fee{+SO4- =FeS +202. Similar reactions could lead to an elevated oxygen fugacity in the lower crust than in the middle and upper crust. The formation and breakdown of scapolite provide a valuable record on the deep processes during the tectonic evolution of the Himalayan orogen. In addition, these processes might play an important role controlling the geochemical behaviors of volatile components during the subduction and exhumation of continental orogenic belts. This exploits a new tool for the investigation of deep -Earth oxygen fugacity adjustment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-0569	2095-8927		WOS:000747486100011

Based on the theory of colloid systems, the thickness of the TLF was determined and its dependence on pore radius and surface tension at the gas/electrolyte interface was estimated. The initial and boundary conditions were defined and Fick's equation was solved for this case. The diffusion kinetics results obtained explain the dependence of the recombination current on the metal surface on which the electrochemical reaction takes place, the thickness of the TLF, the concentration of oxygen at both film surfaces, and the time of polarization. Using the film thickness equation derived by the colloid chemistry theory, a general equation was developed which determines the oxygen recombination rate dependence on the thin liquid film parameters, NAM structure and polarization time. The validity of this equation was experimentally proved for low and high electrolyte saturation levels of the plates, as well as for negative plates produced employing various technologies. This equation makes it possible to draw conclusions about the possible ways of improvement of the efficiency of the oxygen cycle and about the technologies for negative plate production for VRLAB applications.

In this study, we consider turbulence-flame interactions in the trailing oxygen flames. The two aims of the paper are to examine the response of the inductive oxygen flame to intense levels of turbulence, and to explore the possibility of transition to detonation in the oxygen flame. Scaling arguments analogous to the carbon flames are presented and then compared against three-dimensional simulations for a range of Damkohler numbers (Da(16)) at a fixed Karlovitz number. The simulations suggest that turbulence does not significantly affect the oxygen flame when Da(16) < 1, and the flame burns inductively some distance behind the carbon flame. However, for Da(16) > 1, turbulence enhances heat transfer and drives the propagation of a flame that is narrower than the corresponding inductive flame would be. Furthermore, burning under these conditions appears to occur as part of a combined carbon-oxygen turbulent flame with complex compound structure. The simulations do not appear to support the possibility of a transition to detonation in the oxygen flame, but do not preclude it either.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000288441900084

Conventionally, intermetallic particles are obtained through the annealing of nanoparticles of a random alloy distribution. However, this method inevitably leads to sintering of the nanoparticles and generates polydisperse samples. Here, monodisperse PdCu nanoparticles with the ordered B2 phase were synthesized by seed-mediated co-reduction using PdCu nanoparticle seeds with a random alloy distribution (A1 phase). A time-evolution study suggests that the particles must overcome a size-dependent activation barrier for the ordering process to occur. Characterization of the as-prepared PdCu B2 nanoparticles by electron microscopy techniques revealed surface segregation of Pd as a thin shell over the PdCu core. The ordered nanoparticles exhibit superior activity and durability for the oxygen reduction reaction in comparison with PdCu A1 nanoparticles. This seed-mediated co-reduction strategy produced monodisperse nanoparticles ideally suited for structure-activity studies. Moreover, the study of their growth mechanism provides insights into the size dependence of disorder-order transformations of bimetallic alloys at the nanoscale, which should enable the design of synthetic strategies toward other intermetallic systems.									138	13	0	0	6	0	142			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000378973700085	27214313

In this work, a series of CoxNi-LDH nanosheets were synthesized by a chemical co-precipitation method. The impact of Co roles on OER catalytic activities, oxidation conversion of nickel metal ions and resistance of charge-transfer reactions (R-ct) was investigated. The electrochemical dynamic behavior of bivalent Co-II was characterized by CV and EIS in combination with XPS. The surface morphologies and microstructure were studied by SEM and TEM, respectively. The results show that Co-II is irreversibly oxidized to Co-III OOH at interface in the first anodic polarization process prior to the occurrence of OER. The surface reconstruction with the formation of Co-III OOH species reduces the R-ct and favors the oxidation conversion of Ni-II hydroxide into Ni-III (oxy)hydroxide at a relatively lower applied potential. The co-existence of these high-valence-state metals (Co-III and Ni-III) on the LDH surface further boosts the catalytic activity and enhances the OER performance. The OER activity of the CoxNi-LDHs increases with increase of the Co: Ni ratio, and reaches the maximum as the Co:Ni ratio raises to about 1.8:1.0. The Co1.8Ni-LDH shows the most active OER catalyst with an overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm(Geo)(-2) and a Tafel slop of 66 mV dec(-1), as well as has a higher i(ECSA) and TOF. The carbon-free pasted Co1.8Ni-LDH electrode on Ni foam also exhibits excellent durability at 100 mA cm(-2) in 1M KOH at room temperature. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The length of redox half cycles varies, depending on the environment, and is often brief in upland tropical soils, the vadose zone and at the sediment/plant root interface. One reaction that impacts Fe (hydr)oxide mineralogy in these environments is the Fe(II) catalyzed transformation of ferrihydrite. This reaction leads to the production of more crystalline phases under strictly anaerobic conditions and in cycling studies with relatively long anaerobic and/or oxic periods (e.g., 7 to 90 days). Ferrihydrite transformation has been investigated under strictly anaerobic conditions, or during a few (1-3), longer redox cycles; however, there is limited information describing the transformation of ferrihydrite, over multiple, short, sequential exposures to chemical reductants (e.g., dissolved Fe(II)) and oxidants (e.g., 02). Here, we examine the mineralogical evolution of ferrihydrite over eight redox cycles during -which it reacts with dissolved Fe(II) in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic conditions) for 48 h and is subsequently exposed to air (oxic conditions) for 18 h. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy, the abundance of each mineral phase present after each anaerobic or oxic period, is quantified. Our results demonstrate that rapid redox cycling limits the extent of ferrihydrite transformation leading to disequilibrium between mineral phases. Additionally, magnetite stoichiometry increases throughout the study despite periodic exposure to oxygen. A deeper understanding of poorly crystalline Fe (hydr)oxide transformation during multiple, short redox cycles can provide insight into reactions controlling the speciation of redox active nutrients and contaminants in soils and sediments.

CoMo, NiMo, and ReNi alloys are obtained by electrodeposition, while NiReP catalysts are prepared by electroless deposition under open-circuit conditions using hypophosphite ions as a reducing agent.The prepared materials are characterized by a complex of modern physical methods; namely, SEM, XPS, XRD, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. No long-range order was found for all electrodeposited alloys whereas NiReP alloys prepared by electroless deposition contain nickel phosphides. A certain amount of molybdenum or rhenium in the CoMo and ReNi alloys is in the oxidized states. CoMo and ReNi coatings contain 15-20 at. % of oxygen in the form of O2-.Molybdenum containing alloys are unstable in the alkaline solutions under electrolysis conditions. In opposite, NiRe electrodeposits are promising candidates for hydrogen evolution catalysis in alkaline solutions due to their high catalytic activity and stability under electrolysis conditions.NiReP alloys can be used for HER catalysis in acidic solutions.

Effect of Electrolyte Cations on Organic Electrosynthesis: The Case of Adiponitrile Electrochemical Production								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				167	15					155526	10.1149/1945-7111/abc766				DEC 1 2020	2020	Electrolyte ions have a profound impact on the reaction environment of electrochemical systems and can be key drivers in determining the reaction rate and selectivity of electro-organic reactions. We combine experimental and computational approaches to understand the individual effect of the size and concentration of supporting alkali cations, as well as their synergies with other electrolyte ions on the electrosynthesis of adiponitrile (ADN). The size of supporting alkali cations influences the surface charge density, availability of water molecules, and stability of reaction intermediates. Larger alkali cations can help limit hydrogen evolution and the early protonation of intermediates by lowering the availability of water molecules in the near electrode region. A selectivity of 93% towards ADN was achieved at -20 mA cm(-2) in electrolytes containing cesium phosphate salts, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and tetraalkylammonium ions (TAA ions). Electrolytes containing only supporting phosphate salts promote the early hydrogenation of intermediate species leading to low ADN selectivities (i.e., <10%). However, the combined effect of alkali cations and selectivity-directing ions (i.e., TAA ions) is essential in the enhancement of ADN synthesis. The insights gained in this study provide guidelines for the design of aqueous electrolytes that improve selectivity and limit hydrogen evolution in organic electrosynthesis.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000594698800001

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that the typical cracked morphology of oxide coatings disappears gradually as the preparation temperature increases, leading to the decrease in the amount of electrochemically active sites as measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in organics-free aqueous solution. With the exception of samples prepared at high temperatures (e.g. 600 degrees C), same change tendency of electro-activity with temperature was also found in methanol aqueous solutions, in which activity was observed to decrease as compared with that in blank solution. Three possible explanations for this phenomenon (i.e. active dissolution of oxide coatings, organics adsorption and dimerization/polymerization on electrode surface, respectively) were discussed, where the former two were believed to be more reasonable considering the CH3OH small molecular chosen in this system. However, none of these three mechanisms could explain the abnormal activation behavior observed at electrodes prepared at 600 degrees C in CH3OH solution. XRD pattern showed the fact that when sintering temperature went up to 600 degrees C IrO2 would decompose into metallic iridium component. The existence of metallic iridium might facilitate the organics oxidation as stated in previous literatures, which leads to the exceptional activation of oxide surface by methanol component. A simple reaction mechanism for electrodes in methanol aqueous solutions was proposed and used to interpret the negative shift in startness potential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Organics oxidation seems to facilitate the OER and vice versa. The latter statement has been reported by other workers. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

For the aforesaid purpose, molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) has been considered as an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen production; however, N-Mo2C has been less focused upon. For this purpose, we report a facile method for the synthesis of N-Mo2C active species. The as-synthesized electrocatalyst exhibits a remarkable electrochemical performance for HER with a small onset potential of 30.6 mV vs. RHE and requires overpotential (eta) of only 99.3 mV vs. RHE to render -10 mAcm(-2) current density. The Tafel slope of 62.8 mVdec(-1) further demonstrates the favorable reaction kinetics of the electrocatalyst. Moreover, for practical applications, solar-driven hydrogen production has been efficiently implemented, which shows excellent faradaic efficiency (95.2%) as well as solar-to-hydrogen generation efficiency (1.14%). This facile approach for the synthesis of N-Mo2C active species can provide valuable enlightenment for the further development of photo-/electrocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2196-0216			WOS:000430102600009

Nevertheless, restricted by their soft and changeable nature, so far investigations of pure micelles or vesicles often rely on state-of-the-art characterization techniques (e.g., in situ ones). Herein, we reported that the self-assembly behaviors of the anionic surfactant SDBS are profoundly affected by the presence of transition metal cations M2+ (M = Co or Ni) (which work as the counterion of the anionic DBS-) in a slightly alkaline environment. With well-controlled reaction kinetics, concentric multishelled M(OH)(x)(DBS)(y) colloidosomes are formed easily with meta-stability. The electrostatic forces between the anionic DBS- and the unsaturated cationic [M(OH)(x)](y+) species, and the van der Waals forces from the hydrophobic interaction among the DBS-molecular tails are the major forces organizing the overall structure. The as-observed colloidosomes on one hand are sufficiently stable which could be separated from the solution and characterized conveniently using ex situ techniques such as FESEM, TEM, XPS, FTIR and XRD. On the other hand, they could either evolve flexibly into a series of layered or shelled metal hydroxide nanostructures via the classical Ostwald ripening process, or react with another reactant to generate other shelled derivatives (e.g., metal silicates). The multishelled colloidosomes and their derivatives from simple thermal treatment were also explored as efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. The facile formation, the convenient characterization and the flexible transformation of such onion-like colloidosomes emphasize the important role of counterions in regulating the self-assembly behavior of ionic surfactants so as to construct novel functional materials that are thermodynamically difficult to achieve; they also contribute to a mechanistic study on surfactant-assisted morphology control in material synthesis.									6	2	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000443116700009

HYDROGEN-ATOM TRANSFER								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				97	12			9046	9061		10.1063/1.463331				DEC 15 1992	1992	The real-time dynamics of hydrogen-atom-transfer processes under collisionless conditions are studied using femtosecond depletion techniques. The experiments focus on the methyl salicylate system, which exhibits ultrafast hydrogen motion between two oxygen atoms due to molecular tautomerization, loosely referred to as intramolecular ''proton'' transfer. To test for tunneling and mass effects on the excited potential surface, we also studied deuterium and methyl-group substitutions. We observe that the motion of the hydrogen, under collisionless conditions, takes place within 60 fs. At longer times, on the picosecond time scale, the hydrogen-transferred form decays with a threshold of 15.5 kJ/mol; this decay behavior was observed up to a total vibrational energy of approximately 7200 cm-1. The observed dynamics provide the global nature of the motion, which takes into account bonding before and after the motion, and the evolution of the wave packet from the initial nonequilibrium state to the transferred form along the O-H-O reaction coordinate. The vibrational periods (2pi/omega) of the relevant modes range from 13 fs (the OH stretch) to 190 fs (the low-frequency distortion) and the motion involves (in part) these coordinates. The intramolecular vibrational-energy redistribution dynamics at longer times are important to the hydrogen-bond dissociation and to the nonradiative decay of the hydrogen-transferred form.									235	1	0	0	14	0	235			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:A1992KE63700023

Herein, copper sulfide nanowire@NiCo-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheet core-shell nanoarrays are fabricated as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation and water reduction to simultaneously produce value-added 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and hydrogen fuel with less energy consumption. Benefiting from the fast charge transfer induced by the CuxS core, the Co/Ni interaction in the LDH nanosheet layer and the open nanostructure, the optimized catalysts exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity (record-high 87 mA cm(-2) @ 1.3 V vs. RHE for HMF oxidation; eta = 107 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2) for HER) and durability; the faradaic efficiency towards FDCA and H-2 is close to unity. The bifunctional two-electrode electrolyzer only requires a low voltage of 1.34 V to co-generate H-2 and FDCA at 10 mA cm(-2). This work highlights the significance of tuning the redox properties of transition metals and constructing nanoarray electrocatalysts towards more efficient energy utilization.									81	9	0	0	3	0	83			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000508855700020

Pt/transition metal alloys (Pt-Ms) or Pt/transition metal oxides (Pt-MOx) can be formed by doping transition metal atoms into the lattice of the Pt layer or depositing onto the surface of the Pt layer to intensify the catalytic activity of the electrodes. In this work, a stepwise solution chemical reduction method for high dispersion of cobalt oxyhydroxide (-OCoOH) deposited onto the facet of Pt as nano-islands and the mechanism of promoting the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode have been investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculation. As a result, the electrocatalytic activity of Pt with nano-island -OCoOH structure was 3.6 times that of the Pt/C catalyst, which indicated that promoting the desorption of the first O atom and weakening the adsorption capacity of the interfacial junction Pt for the second O atom from adsorbed oxygen attributed to the migration of d-band center in Pt and the existence of the Co hydroxyl group.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2046-2069		WOS:000601124900010	35516237

Here, the coupled electron and ion transfer processes is studied as well as reagent fluxes across the liquid|liquid interface for the chemical reduction of dioxygen by decamethylferrocene (DMFc) in a dichloroethane-based organic electrolyte forming an interface with an aqueous electrolyte containing alkali metal ions. This interface is stabilized at the orifice of a pipette, across which a Galvani potential difference is externally applied and precisely adjusted to enforce the transfer of different alkali metal ions from the aqueous to the organic electrolyte. The oxygen reduction is followed by H(2)O(2)detection in the aqueous phase close to the interface by a microelectrode of a scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM). The results prove a strong catalytic effect of hydrated alkali metal ions on the formation rate of H2O2, which varies systematically with the acidity of the transferred alkali metal ions in the organic phase.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000563938600001	32460434

Nb doping of titania significantly increased the surface area of the support from 145 (TNTs) to 260 m(2) g(-1) (Nb-TNTs), which was significantly higher than those of the Nb-doped titania supports previously reported in the literature. The surface analytical techniques showed good dispersion of the catalysts onto the supports. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses showed that Nb was mainly in the form of Nb(IV) species, the suitable form to behave as a donor introducing free electrons to the conduction band of titania. The redox transitions of the cyclic voltammograms, in agreement with the XPS results, were found to be reversible. Despite the supported materials presented bigger crystallite sizes than the unsupported ones, the total number of active sites of the former was also higher due to their better catalyst dispersion. Considering the outer and the total charges of the cyclic voltammograms in the range 0.1-1.4V, stability and electrode potentials at given current densities, the preferred catalyst was IrO2 supported on the Nb-TNTs. The electrode potentials corresponding to given current densities were between the smallest ones given in the literature despite the small oxide loading used in this work and its Nb doping, thus making the Nb-TNTs-supported IrO2 catalyst a promising candidate for the OER. The good dispersion of IrO2, high specific surface area of the Nb-doped supports, accessibility of the electroactive centers, increased stability due to Nb doping and electron donor properties of the Nb(IV) oxide species were considered the main reasons for its good performance.

Though significant progress to improve or augment its catalysis performance has been made, fundamental understanding of its relatively poor performance as a bare material is lacking. In this paper, we report the correlation of the surface structure and trap states with charge separation efficiency and OER performance of bare BiVO4 photoanodes via varying the sample thickness. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we observed a more compacted, symmetric Bi center in the surface state. Using transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, we show that the structural properties of the surface lead to shallow and deep hole trap states and electron trapping that occurs at the surface of the material. Despite more severe carrier trapping on the surface, our OER measurements demonstrate that a significant bulk structure is required for light absorption but is only beneficial until the carrier mobility becomes the limiting factor in photoelectrochemical cell studies.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000396031200051	28218314

For the electrochemical conversion of the greenhouse gas CO2 into products of higher value catalysts for two half-cell reactions need to be developed, i.e. catalysts for the reductive conversion of CO2 (CO2RR) as well as catalysts for the oxidative splitting of water (OER: Oxygen Evolution Reaction). In research, the catalysts are often investigated independently of each other as they can later easily be combined in a technical electrolysis cell. CO2RR catalysts consist of abundant materials such as copper and silver and thus mainly the product selectivity of the respective catalyst is in focus of the investigation. In contrast to that, OER catalysts (in acidic conditions) mainly consist of precious metals, e.g. Ir, and therefore the minimization of the catalytic current per gram Ir is of fundamental importance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0009-4293			WOS:000489684600005	31514770

Here we compare water and hydroxyl adsorption on Pt-Ni(111) films and a PtNi(111) alloy surface with the behaviour on the pure metals. Whereas water adsorbs and desorbs intact from close packed Pt and Ni, it dissociates on PtNi surfaces to form adsorbed hydroxyl and hydrogen. Reactivity to water increases in the order Pt(111) < monolayer Pt-Ni(111) < multilayer (2-6 ML) Pt-Ni(111) approximate to PtNi(111) surface alloy and does not scale directly with the Pt strain. Hydroxyl can also be formed by reaction with pre-adsorbed O and is less stable than on pure Pt, decomposing to water and O in a broad peak near 180 K, 20 K lower than on Pt(111). The reduced stability of OH on Pt-Ni(111) films is common to all the PtNi surfaces and consistent with bimetallic PtNi surfaces showing less blocking by OH during the oxygen reduction reaction.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000436032900046	29881849

The influence of oxygen and hydrazine on the erosion-corrosion behaviour and electrochemical potentials of carbon steel under boiler feedwater conditions								Water Chemistry of Nuclear Reactor Systems 4. Proceedings of the International Conference								337	46 vol.1						1986	1986	In the temperature range 100 to 250degC, carbon steel is highly susceptible to erosion-corrosion damage in deoxygenated boiler feedwater when mass transfer coefficients are sufficiently high. The erosion-corrosion process can be completely inhibited by addition of low levels of oxygen to the feedwater, but experiments have shown that the process continues essentially unaffected below a critical oxygen threshold. The oxygen level required to inhibit the process depends on the local oxygen mass transfer coefficient to the eroding surface, and the existing metal loss rate. An upper limit for the threshold concentration can be derived from the rate of oxygen mass transfer to the surface required to match the ongoing erosion-corrosion rate. Under these circumstances, the cathodic current normally supplied by the hydrogen evolution reaction can be substituted by an equivalent one due to oxygen reduction. When the critical rate of oxygen mass transfer to the surface required to inhibit erosion corrosion is achieved, the surface electrochemical potential shifts several hundred millivolts positive of that previously maintained. Oxygen has been shown to inhibit erosion-corrosion and control the electrochemical potential of carbon steel even in the presence of large excesses of reducing agents such as N2H4 and H2, at temperatures up to 250degC. However, removal of the oxygen by reaction with hydrazine allows the erosion-corrosion process to re-initiate rapidly. Hydrazine alone does not significantly influence the potential of actively eroding surfaces, but does appear to reduce the erosion-corrosion rate as a result of the increased high temperature pH.

Surfaces ranging from single crystals, nanoparticles and thin films to porous high surface area catalytic materials have been studied. Classes of surface structure sensitive and insensitive reactions have been identified by surface science studies, including ammonia synthesis, hydrodesulfurization, reforming, combustion and hydrogenation. Rates of reactions often vary by orders of magnitude between using the right and the wrong surface structures. The roles of many promoters that modify the catalyst surface structures and bonding of adsorbates have been verified. Surface reaction intermediates could be identified and the mobility of adsorbates and the adsorbate induced reconstruction of the catalysts attest to the dynamic nature of the catalytic systems during the reaction turnover. The important active sites for catalysis include the low coordination surface step, kink, oxygen and chloride ion vacancies sites and sites at oxide-metal interfaces. Uncovering the molecular ingredients of heterogeneous catalysts will have a major impact on the understanding of reaction selectivity to help the evolution of green chemistry and selective reaction of many types.									37	2	1	0	2	0	39			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000247316300001

However, a clear comparison of the different materials synthesis techniques, and how this affects the electrochemical applications, has been less explored. Herein, we report a direct comparison of fabricated cobalt sulfide (CoS) nanostructure-based electrodes prepared by two different methods for two applications: (a) electrochemical water splitting and (b) glucose sensing. CoS is grown in the form of nanoflowers and nanosheets via facile one-pot hydrothermal (HT) and electrodeposition (ED) methods, respectively. Characterization is performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It is observed that the as-fabricated CoS-ED electrode demonstrated enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, a lower overpotential (similar to 166 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), lower charge transfer resistance (similar to 372 Omega), a lower Tafel slope (86 mV dec(-1)), and better stability compared to the CoS-HT electrode. Moreover, the CoS-ED electrode-based sensor also exhibited better performance, higher sensitivity, better selectivity, and good stability for electrochemical glucose detection compared to the CoS-HT sensor.

The water-splitting and oxygen-evolving reaction is catalyzed by photosystem II (PSII), a huge, multisubunit membrane-protein complex located in the thylakoid membranes of organisms ranging from cyanobacteria to higher plants. The structure of PSII has been analyzed at 1.9-angstrom resolution by X-ray crystallography, revealing a clear picture of the Mn4CaO5 cluster, the catalytic center for water oxidation. This article provides an overview of the overall structure of PSII followed by detailed descriptions of the specific structure of the Mn4CaO5 cluster and its surrounding protein environment. Based on the geometric organization of the Mn4CaO5 cluster revealed by the crystallographic analysis, in combination with the results of a vast number of experimental studies involving spectroscopic and other techniques as well as various theoretical studies, the article also discusses possible mechanisms for water splitting that are currently under consideration.									397	19	0	0	227	0	407			1543-5008	1545-2123	978-0-8243-0666-3	WOS:000353711400002	25746448

In this review, we provide the importance of HCSNs and explain how the ORR performance can be enhanced by various heteroatom dopants, such as nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorous, boron, and combinations of two or more heteroatoms. Various types of nitrogen doping were performed with different forms of nitrogen-containing organic compounds in CSNs, such as metal-organic frameworks, zeolitic imidazolate frameworks, and transition metals containing nitrogen sources, which have been used widely for the ORR because they form a high surface area, a facet surface structure, and reactive active sites in the presence of elements that are useful for the ORR catalytic activity. Furthermore, we briefly discuss the synthesis and fabrication of highly efficient ORR electrodes using a combination of di-, tri-, or multi-heteroatom-doped CSNs. Finally, we discuss the superior ORR activities of the HCSNs reported in recent literature and compare the activity with various reactive descriptors and the broad scope of these HCSNs for practical applications, along with their drawbacks and future demands.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000738914500001

They exhibit inferior alkaline HER activity, however, due to the sluggish water dissociation process. Here, we design and synthesize new molybdenum dichalcogenide-based heterostructures with the basal planes decorated with SnS2 quantum dots towards enhanced alkaline HER activity. The electrochemical results reveal that the alkaline hydrogen evolution kinetics of molybdenum dichalcogenides is substantially accelerated after incorporation of SnS2 quantum dots. The optimal MoSe2/SnS2 heterostructure delivers a much lower overpotential of 285 mV than MoSe2 (367 mV) to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. The improved catalytic activity is predominantly owing to the enhanced water dissociation kinetics of the heterostructures with well-defined interfaces. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the presence of SnS2 significantly promotes the water adsorption capability of MoSe2 nanosheets, which consequently facilitates the subsequent water dissociation process. These results open up a new avenue for the rational design of well-defined heterostructures with enhanced water adsorption/dissociation capability for the development of high-performance alkaline HER electrocatalysts.									45	2	0	0	1	0	45			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000487931500018

The obtained samples were systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). XRD results indicate that K4Ti3O8 have been synthesized in different atmospheres. The oxidizing atmosphere could enhance the conversion rate of Ti from ilmenite to K4Ti3O8, and Fe(II) is easily oxidized to trivalent iron Fe(III) during the reaction. Furthermore, SEM images show that the different atmospheres have significant effect on K4Ti3O8 crystal morphology and particle size. Well shaped K4Ti3O8 crystals are obtained in nonoxidizing atmosphere.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000278120700010

Porous oxide films of spinel manganese ferrites (MnxFe3-xO4) were formed on electroplated Fe-Mn films. The MnxFe3-xO4 porous oxide formed on microcracks in the Fe-Mn films constituted a nanoporous/microcrack hierarchical structure (NP/MC), which provided a large electrode surface area for ORR/OER. The electrochemically active surface area of the NP/MC on Fe-36 at% Mn was 33.3 cm(2), which is nine times that of the nanoporous structure on Fe (3.67 cm(2)). The onset potential of the NP/MC on Fe-15 at% Mn and Fe-36 at% Mn was 0.88 V vs. RHE (overpotential, similar to 350 mV) for the ORR at -0.1 mA cm(-2). The OER onset potentials at 10 mA cm(-2) were 1.79 V on Fe-15 at% Mn (similar to 560 mV) and 1.74 V on Fe-36 at% Mn (similar to 510 mV). The OER and ORR activities of the MnxFe3-xO4 porous oxides are better than those of spinel iron oxide (similar to 510 and similar to 640 mV for the ORR and OER, respectively) because of the good intrinsic activity of MnxFe3-xO4 and greater surface area of the NP/MC. The ORR activities of the MnxFe3-xO4 porous oxides decreased to about 30% during ORR durability testing for 7.5 h, and the same level of activity was retained after 24 h of use. The MnxFe3-xO4 porous oxides retained a high level of activity during OER durability testing for 8 h.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000674907700001	34477624

Most studies have focused on regulating 3d transition-metal active ions through other d-block metals, while few have utilized f-block metals. Herein, we report a new class of catalyst, namely, UCoO4 with alternative CoO6 and 5f-related UO6 octahedra, as a unique example of a 5f-covalent compound that exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity because of the presence of the U 5f-O 2p-Co 3d network. UCoO4 exhibits a low overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA surpassing other unitary cobalt-based catalysts ever reported. X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that the Co2+ ion in pristine UCoO4 was converted to high-valence Co3+/4+, while U6+ remained unchanged during the OER, indicating that only Co was the active site. Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the OER activity of Co3+/4+ was synergistically enhanced by the covalent bonding of U6+-5f in the U 5f-O 2p-Co 3d network. This study opens new avenues for the realization of electronic structure manipulation via unique Sf involvement.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000730264000001	34878269

However, low current densities limit their practical applications. Herein, we report a facile and economic synthesis of an iron-copper based LDH integrated with a cobalt-based metal-organic framework (ZIF-12) to form LDH-ZIF-12 composite (1) through a co-precipitation method. The as-synthesized composite 1 requires a low overpotential of 337 mV to achieve a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 89 mV dec(-1). Tafel analysis further demonstrates that 1 exhibits a slope of 89 mV dec(-1) which is much lower than the slope of 284 mV dec(-1) for LDH and 172 mV dec(-1) for ZIF-12. The slope value of 1 is also lower than previously reported electrocatalysts, including Ni-Co LDH (113 mV dec(-1)) and Zn-Co LDH nanosheets (101 mV dec(-1)), under similar conditions. Controlled potential electrolysis and stability test experiments show the potential application of 1 as a heterogeneous electrocatalyst for water oxidation.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2296-2646			WOS:000670571400001	34249860

To address this knowledge gap, in this work, we used molecular dynamics (MDs) based on a reaction force field (ReaxFF) to clarify the atomic-level interaction mechanism between metal atoms and oxygen molecules during laser powder bed fusion. The ReaxFF potential energy model has variable charges that can dynamically handle charge changes between atoms and the breaking and formation of chemical bonds that occur during oxidation reactions. We investigated the effects of laser power, scanning speed, region position, and oxygen concentration on powder oxidation. The results show that the laser power and scanning speed affected the oxidation degree by changing the energy input density, and the oxidation degree increased with the energy input density. Different forms of oxidation occurred near the melt channel due to the existence of a temperature gradient, and the degree of oxidation increased with the temperature. Atoms in the metal powder model underwent selective oxidation, which was related to the potential energy of their atomic position. A larger potential energy made it easier for iron atoms to overcome the energy barrier during the initial stage of oxidation, making them easier to oxidize.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1996-1944		WOS:000860806400001	36143706

A reduction of these photocatalysts with hydrogen causes several changes, such as a significant increase in the specific surface area, a C/N atomic ratio, a number of defects in the crystalline structure of g-C3N4, and the contribution of nitrogen bound to the amino and imino groups. According to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results, a transition layer is formed at the g-C3N4/metal nanoparticle interphase, which contains metal at a positive degree of oxidation bonded to nitrogen. These structural changes significantly enhanced the photocatalytic activity in the production of hydrogen through the water-splitting reaction. The activity of the platinum photocatalyst was 24 times greater than that of pristine g-C3N4. Moreover, the enhanced activity was attributed to significantly better separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs on metal nanoparticles and structural distortions of g-C3N4.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1996-1944		WOS:000756229000001	35160664

Specifically, results and insights obtained from surface-science single-crystal-based model experiments are linked to experiments on well-defined shape-controlled nanoparticles. A classification of structure sensitive effects in electrocatalysis is suggested, based both on empirical grounds and on quantum-chemical viz. thermochemical considerations. The mutual relation between the two classification schemes is also discussed. The review underscores the relevance of single-crystal modeling of nanoscale effects in catalysis, and points to the special role of two kinds of active sites for electrocatalysis on nanoparticulate surfaces: (i) steps and defects in (111) terraces or facets, and (ii) long-range (100) terraces or facets.									334	6	0	0	22	0	342			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000290531500018	21399781

Surface states in bulk single crystal of topological semimetal Co3Sn2S2 towards water oxidation [arXiv]								arXiv								16 pp.	16 pp.						22 Aug. 2019	2019	The band inversion in topological phase matters bring exotic physical properties such as the emergence of a topologically protected surface states. They strongly influence the surface electronic structures of the investigated materials and could serve as a good platform to gain insight into the catalytic mechanism of surface reactions. Here we synthesized high-quality bulk single crystals of the topological semimetal Co3Sn2S2. We found that at room temperature, Co3Sn2S2 naturally hosts the band structure of a topological semimetal. This guarantees the existence of robust surface states from the Co atoms. Bulk single crystal of Co3Sn2S2 exposes their Kagome lattice that constructed by Co atoms and have high electrical conductivity. They serves as catalytic centers for oxygen evolution process (OER), making bonding and electron transfer more efficient due to the partially filled g orbital. The bulk single crystal exhibits outstanding OER catalytic performance, although the surface area is much smaller than that of Co-based nanostructured catalysts. Our findings emphasize the importance of tailoring topological non-trivial surface states for the rational design of high-activity electrocatalysts.

The phase segregation characteristics of Fe2O3/Al2O3 calcined at different temperature (900 degrees C, 1100 degrees C, 1300 degrees C) were investigated in this study. The obtained samples were recorded as 900-FeAl, 1100-FeAl and 1300-FeAl, respectively. XPS results showed that the surface oxygen vacancies of Fe2O3/Al2O3 increased with the increase of calcination temperature. In the redox cycles, the deactivation rate of the three samples were 5.57% (900-FeAl), 6.99% (1100-FeAl) and 31.69% (1300FeAl), respectively. After 20 cycles, the 1300-FeAl presented serious surface sintering and the largest enrichment degree of surface Fe (137.05%). It can be inferred that the severe enrichment of surface Fe leads to the serious sintering, which aggravates the deactivation of the 1300-FeAl in cyclic reactions. The low calcination temperature (900 degrees C, 1100 degrees C) makes the Fe2O3/Al2O3 exhibit rich pore structure, which generates space barrier for the outward migration of Fe cation and inhibits the phase segregation of Fe2O3/Al2O3. The results of this study are of great significance to understand the phase segregation of iron-based oxygen carriers, and provide guiding value for the synthesis of high-performance iron-based oxygen carriers.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000763117400003

Henriquez, Rodrigo/0000-0002-2612-5413			Sonoelectrochemical Synthesis of Nanostructured of p-Cu2O and n-Fe2O3 and Their Application for Photoelectrochemical Splitting of Water								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE				14	6			5646	5653		10.20964/2019.06.03				JUN 2019	2019	In the present work, a p-Cu2O nanostructured electrode and n-Fe2O3 nanotubes electrode, were used as photocathode and photoanode, respectively, for study the splitting of water. In this photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) the oxygen evolution reaction takes place in the photoanode and the hydrogen evolution reaction in the photocathode, both from the water decomposition reaction. In this case, the two electrodes were synthesized by ultrasound-assisted anodization (37 kHz, 60 W) in corresponding sheet metallic. The experimental conditions for the formation of p-Cu2O nanostructures were: 75 V, 75 degrees C and 900 s of polarization in a solution of ethylene glycol with 5% wt of water and 0.5% wt of NH4Cl [1]. On the other hand, the Fe2O3 nanotubes were synthesized at 50 V, 50 degrees C and 180 s of polarization in an ethylene glycol solution containing 3% wt of water and 0.5% wt of NH4F [2]. In both cases, after the anodization, the sheets were thermally treated at 190 degrees C for 90 min in an argon atmosphere for p-Cu2O and for n-Fe2O3 at 500 degrees C for 180 min in an oxygen atmosphere. Subsequently, the electrodes were characterized by DRS, EIE by Mott-Schottky plots obtaining the diagrams of respective bands. Finally, electrochemical measurements were performed with the system Felnanotubes n-Fe2O3 vertical bar 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH 10)vertical bar p-Cu2O nanostructured vertical bar Cu, where the two electrodes were illuminated. In this context, the system required a bias potential of 0.36 V. This value corresponds to 69.5 kJ/mol, for a current density of 0.3 mAcm(-2). On the other hand, in equal conditions of current density, but using platinum electrodes, a bias potential of 1.50 V (289.5 kJ/mol) was required. In this context, a decrease in the energy cost for the decomposition reaction of water, in an alkaline solution was evidenced.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1452-3981			WOS:000470877100059

An apparent TOF of 0.29mols(-1)m(-2) and oxygen yield of 51% were obtained with -Fe2O3@NiO. The -Fe2O3@NiO core-shell hierarchical nanostructures could be easily separated from the reaction solution whilst maintaining excellent water-oxidation activity in the fourth and fifth runs. The surface conditions of -Fe2O3@NiO also remained unchanged after the photocatalytic reaction, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000342679400006	25082099

It is shown that in a wide channel, from the beginning, the flame velocity increases exponentially for a short time and then flame acceleration decreases, ending up with the abrupt increase of the combustion wave velocity and the actual transition to detonation. In a thin channel with a width smaller than the critical value, the exponential increase of the flame velocity is not bounded and ends up with the transition to detonation. The transition to detonation occurs due to the pressure pulse, which is formed at the tip of the accelerating flame. The amplitude of the pressure pulse grows exponentially due to a positive feedback coupling between the pressure pulse and the heat released in the reaction. Finally, large amplitude pressure pulse steepens into a strong shock coupled with the reaction zone forming the overdriven detonation. The evolution from a temperature gradient to a detonation via the Zeldovich gradient mechanism and its applicability to the deflagration-to-detonation transition is investigated for combustible materials whose chemistry is governed by chain-branching kinetics. The results of the high resolution simulations are fully consistent with experimental observations of the flame acceleration and DDT.									61	5	3	0	0	0	68			1539-3755	1550-2376		WOS:000290721400001	21728653

Herein, novel fiber-in-tube hierarchical nanofibers composed of defect-rich NiCo2O4-delta@C bubbles (DBHF) are constructed as the HZB cathode. The nanoscale bimetal oxide bubbles with a defective structure are surrounded by a porous carbon network, which connect with each other and assemble a fiber-in-tube hierarchical configuration. The DBHF nanofiber not only provides a highly porous and conductive skeleton for fast electron/ion transport, but also possesses rich active sites to accelerate oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). Benefitting from both electrochemical and electrocatalytic properties, the fabricated HZB with the DBHF cathode exhibits a high operating voltage, fast kinetics and high energy density. In addition, the two-set charge/discharge curves during long-term cycles further demonstrate its good stability and high efficiency. More impressively, the wide environmental adaptation and excellent ldquoair-chargingrdquo capability make the prepared flexible hybrid Zn battery an uninterrupted power source for flexible electronics under different working conditions. Therefore, this work provides a novel high-performance cathode for HZBs and propels the development of flexible batteries towards multiple applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488			INSPEC:21031291		
J	Roose, Johnna L.; Yocum, Charles F.; Popelkova, Hana								Binding Stoichiometry and Affinity of the Manganese-Stabilizing Protein Affects Redox Reactions on the Oxidizing Side of Photosystem II								BIOCHEMISTRY				50	27			5988	5998		10.1021/bi2008068				JUL 12 2011	2011	It has been reported previously that the two subunits of PsbO, the photosystem II (PSII) manganese stabilizing protein, have unique functions in relation to the Mn, Ca2+, and Cl- cofactors in eukaryotic PSII [Popelkova; et al. (2008) Biochemistry 47, 123931 The experiments reported here utilize a set of N-terminal truncation mutants of PsbO, which exhibit altered subunit binding to PSII, to further characterize its role in establishing efficient O-2 evolution activity. The effects of PsbO binding stoichiometry, affinity, and specificity on Q(A)(-) reoxidation kinetics after a single turnover flash, S-state transitions, and O-2 release time have been examined. The data presented here show that weak rebinding of a single PsbO subunit to PsbO-depleted PSII repairs many of the defects in PSII resulting from the removal of the protein, but many of these are not sustainable, as indicated by low steady-state activities of the reconstituted samples [Popelkova; et al. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 6193]. High affinity binding of PsbO to PSII is required to produce more stable and efficient cycling of the water oxidation reaction. Reconstitution of the second PsbO subunit is needed to further optimize redox reactions on the PSII oxidizing side. Native PsbO and recombinant wild-type PsbO from spinach facilitate PSII redox reactions in a very similar manner, and nonspecific binding of PsbO to PSII has no significance in these reactions.									6	1	0	0	7	0	8			0006-2960			WOS:000292430600003	21661738

However, poor photocatalytic and instability of such promising material is still a great challenge. Here the core-shell Cu7S4-coated Cu2O nanocubes (Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs) were successfully synthesized by solution method coupled with anion exchange, and were firstly employed to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The resultant integrated structure of Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs exhibited apparent improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity compared with Cu2O photocatalyst. Particularly, Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs had a high hydrogen production rate of 1689.00 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) under full spectra irradiation with additive of Na2SO3, which was higher than that of Cu2O NCs with a factor of 1.71 times. Excellent synergistic effect of Cu2O and Cu7S4 can be responsible for the improved hydrogen evolution properties, namely, the presence of Cu7S4 with localized surface plasma resonance (LSPR) can promote the photogenerated electrons transfer from the Cu2O surface, prolong the photogenerated holes lifetime, accelerate the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, and ameliorate the photoelectric properties of semiconductors. The in situ formed multifunctional Cu7S4 layer offers a promising avenue to design photocathodes rationally for photocatalytic water reduction.									47	2	0	0	7	0	47			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000460495400021

The small model is the anthracene radical and the large one is also a monoradical built with ten benzene rings. The mechanistic routes found with both models lead to a satisfactory justification of the experimental data and showed the important role of the temperature and the oxygen and nitrogen surface complexes, generated in the carbonaceous material at intermediate steps of the mechanism, in the global process. The computational results presented in this work revealed that, at low temperatures, the high Gibbs energy barrier that appears after N-2 release from the (NO)(2) dimer, initially chemisorbed on the char surface, prevents the subsequent evolution of the system with the result that CO2 emission does not take place. On the other hand, at high temperatures, the mean energy available to the reactants may be sufficient to overcome this energy barrier giving rise to the formation of N-2 and CO2 as reduction products. The N-2 may come from two sources depending on the approach of the NO molecule at different points of the reaction coordinate. The best description of the carbonaceous surface through a larger model confirms the absence of N2O release in the reduction of nitric oxide on carbon surfaces.									20	3	0	0	1	0	22			1432-881X	1432-2234		WOS:000281766300009

Tremendous efforts have been devoted to the optimization of the electrocatalytic performance of the catalysts under industrial-relevant current densities via rational structure design, which induces a preferential electron distribution that favors the adsorption/desorption behavior of the key intermediates, thus accelerating the reaction kinetics. In this review, a brief introduction of the current energy status will be first presented to necessitate the importance of green hydrogen. Followed by the basic concepts and fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanisms, we present efficient strategies for the enhancement of the electrocatalytic performance of the catalysts to meet the rigorous requirement under industrial conditions and the in-depth understanding behind the reinforcement will be briefly discussed next. Then the recent advances regarding the rational design of electrocatalysts operating at an industrial scale will be summarized. Finally, the challenges and perspectives in this thriving field will be proposed from our point of view.(c) 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In this work, a coupled procedure of direct electrodeposition and in situ chemical transformation is presented to synthesize a nickel-iron-sulfur (Ni-Fe-S) composite catalyst. A polythiophene (PTh) coating with abundant micro/nano holes is directly deposited on graphite electrode at a constant potential. Two precursor solutions were injected onto and completely absorbed by the porous PTh coating, within which they spontaneously combine to form active species for catalysis. The PTh coating functions as a monolithic conductive matrix that well captures and disperses the catalyst species and thus decreases the contact resistance across the phase interfaces. The prepared catalyst shows a high catalytic performance for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. It requires a full cell voltage of about 2.0 V to afford a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, with no activity degradation at least for 24 h. The active species for the cathodic and anodic catalysis are different and discussed separately. This work indicates that in situ chemical synthesis within a porous conductive polymer coating is a promising approach for preparing high efficiency electrocatalysts.

The effect of oxygen bubbles on the electrolysis overpotential has been evaluated, and the results were used to predict the effects of catalyst and PTL structures on the electrolysis cell performance. The results show how surface oxygen bubbles block active catalyst sites and decrease the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). The effects of catalyst layer wettability, PTL wettability and pore size, and the operating conditions on the growth and detachment of bubbles from the catalyst surface were modeled. The model accounts for the growth and stability of three types of bubbles in a PEMWE cell: nucleation-driven, drag-driven, and buoyancy-driven bubbles. Nucleation-driven bubbles show the smallest overpotential: 28 mV at the reference operating conditions and PEMWE properties, compared to 35 mV for the drag-driven bubbles and 43 mV for the buoyancy driven bubbles. Catalyst wettability is found to be the most influential material property concerning bubble overpotential for all three types of bubbles. PTL wettability and the cell pressure are the next most important factors in this regard. The modeling results can be used for improved PTL, catalyst layer, and flow field design for PEMWE cells.

Herein, by using an unconventional high electrodeposition potential, novel petal-like clusters constructed by cross-linking ultrathin nickel hydroxide nanosheets were controllably synthesized on nickel foam (or copper foam or carbon cloth) and the effect of electrodeposition conditions on their OER performance was carefully explored. Due to the abundant catalytically active sites, promoting electron conduction/mass transmission from the specific micro-nano structure, as well as the ultrasmall thickness of similar to 3.0 nm, the optimized alpha-Ni(OH)(2)/NF self-supporting electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for OER, merely requiring low overpotentials of 192 and 240 mV to yield current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, respectively, which surpassed those of all of the reported nickel hydroxide/oxides and the benchmark RuO2. Moreover, alpha-Ni(OH)(2)/NF can drive the high-current density (500-1000 mA cm(-2)) OER at low overpotentials, meeting the requirements of potential industrial applications.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000625446000054	33570389

Transmission electron microscopy enabled to disclose microstructural features occurred during oxidation never observed before. In the pristine material, (Zr,W)B-2 solid solutions surround the original ZrB2 nuclei, whereas refractory W-compounds at triple junctions and clean grain boundaries are distinctive of this ceramic. After oxidation, the microstructure is typified by intragranular nanostructures, in which nanosized W inclusions remained trapped within ZrO2 grains, or decorate their surfaces. The understanding of the oxidation reactions occurring in the system as a function of the oxygen partial pressure was fundamental to conclude that W-based compounds do not notably suppress or retard the oxidation of ZrB2 ceramics.									33	0	0	0	0	0	33			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000399610800061

The experimental results showed that LaCl3 could significantly accelerate the transformation from light energy to electric energy, the electron transport, water photolysis and oxygen evolution of PSII of spinach, which was related to the spectral characterization of the D1/D2/Cytb559 complex. Soret band and Q band of Ch1-a of UV-vis spectrum of D1/D2/Cytb559 complex were blue shifted, and the fluorescence emission peak was blue shifted in LaCl3 treated spinach compared with that in the control. The EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy) revealed that La3+ was coordinated with 8 nitrogen or oxygen atoms in the first coordination shell with La-N or La-O bond length of 0.254 nm, and with 6 nitrogen or oxygen atoms in the second coordination shell with La-N or La-O bond length of 0.321 nm in the D1/D2/Cytb559 complex.

Through combining the co-reduction of Pd2+ and Cu2+ precursors with a digestive ripening process in oleylamine, we report the synthesis of copper-palladium (Cu-Pd) alloy multicubes with rough surfaces. Benefiting from their alloy and unique rough-surfaced structure, which provides ample edge/corner and step atoms as well as the electronic coupling between Cu and Pd leading to the lower of d-band center, the rough-surfaced Cu-Pd alloy multicubes show much better electrocatalytic performance not only for formic acid oxidation but also for oxygen reduction in comparison with those of spherical Cu-Pd alloy nanoparticles and commercial Pd/C catalyst. In contrast, we confirm that the rough-surfaced Cu-Pd alloy multicubes only exhibit very low Faradaic efficiency (34.3%) for electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO) due to the presence of strong competing hydrogen evolution reaction, which results in their very poor selectivity for the reduction of CO2 to CO.

The prepared catalyst was investigated by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, UVVis absorption spectroscopy, nitrogen sorption, X-ray spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy and transient photocurrent responses. The photocatalytic activity of the ternary catalyst was evaluated by hydrogen and oxygen evolution for visible-light-driven water splitting without the addition of sacrificial agents. Compared with MnO2/C3N4 and CNTs/C3N4 catalysts, the CNTs/MnO2-C3N4 ternary catalyst showed an enhanced visible light-induced water splitting activity with a H-2 evolution rate of 122 mu mol h(-1). In the CNTs/MnO2-C3N4 ternary catalyst, CNT can capture the electron from C3N4 and facilitate hydrogen evolution, and MnO2 catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide for O-2 evolution, leading to the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, thus an enhanced water splitting performance is achieved.

J	Song, Yuxiang; Yang, Ping								Second diffusion of Co particles during MoS2 incorporated in N-doped carbon nanotubes towards superior electrochemical activity								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				46	68			33801	33808		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.07.185		SEP 2021		OCT 1 2021	2021	Transition metal endowed carbon nanotubes are widely used in electrochemical catalytic reactions. The distribution of transition metal affected their performance. Herein, Co particles were firstly embedded in N-doped carbon nanotubes. During the deposition of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), the size of Co particles was drastically decreased. This phenomenon is ascribed to the reaction between Co and S-2-ions. Finally, MoS2/Co/N-doped carbon heterostructures formed. Such heterostructures exhibited excellent activity for electrocatalytic water splitting. It effectively improves the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution ability of the carbon nanotubes with an over potential of 468 mV at 50 mA/cm(2) current density. In addition, the formation mechanism of the Mo-N-C interface coupling structure has also been proposed. This unique structure facilitates further design research on carbon materials. It is worth mentioning that nitrogen-doped bamboo-like carbon nanotubes have good oxygen reduction reaction activity, and the half-wave potential can reach 792 mV, the onset potential is 931 mV, and the ultimate diffusion current density is 5.3 mV/cm(2), which is close to the expensive commercial Pt/C electrodes.

However, its key step, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to generate H2O2, suffers from added energy consumption due to a side reaction of H-2 evolution. This study attempted to make this process energy effective by using an innovative gas diffusion electrode (GDE) fabricated from a carbon material with highly-ordered pores and large surface area (CMK-3). It was found that the employment of this cathode enabled a low cathodic potential of 0.5 V (vs. SCE), at which H-2 evolution could be greatly eliminated. Meanwhile, the H2O2 built-up at CMK-3 GDE was 3.1 and 4.4 times higher than those at the other two carbon electrodes (graphite GDE and carbon paper). Moreover, dimethyl phthalate (DMP) degradation in the electro-Fenton process using CMK-3 GDE occurred much more rapidly with a reaction apparent rate constant about 8.8 and 11.5 times higher than those using the other two types of electrodes, respectively, whereas the corresponding energy consumption on CMK-3 GDE at the degradation half-life time was only 50% and 27%, respectively.

We find the band gap of the monolayer MoS2 is reduced significantly by the noble metal doping, which is unfavorable to improving its photocatalytic performance. The optical absorption coefficient shows that the doping does not increase the ability of the monolayer MoS2 to absorb visible light. The monolayer MoS2 doped with the noble metal is not a potential photocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction because the band edge position of the conduction band minimum is lower than -4.44 eV, the reduction potential of H+/H-2. Fortunately, the band gap reduction increases the electron transport performance of the monolayer MoS2, and the activation energy of water splitting is greatly reduced by the noble metal doping, especially the Pt doping. On the whole, noble metal doping can enhance the electrocatalytic performance of the monolayer MoS2.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			2096-6482	2589-9651		WOS:000854919800001

The Biological bulletin				235	3			134	151		10.1086/700181				2018-12	2018	Among animals, two major groups of oxygen-binding proteins are found: proteins that use iron to bind oxygen (hemoglobins and hemerythrins) and two non-homologous hemocyanins that use copper. Although arthropod and mollusc hemocyanins bind oxygen in the same manner, they are distinct in their molecular structures. In order to better understand the range of natural variation in hemocyanins, we searched for them in a diverse array of metazoan transcriptomes by using bioinformatics tools to examine hemocyanin evolutionary history and to consequently revive the discussion about whether all metazoan hemocyanins shared a common origin with frequent losses or whether they originated separately after the divergence of Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa. We confirm that the distribution of hemocyanin-like genes is more widespread than previously reported, including five putative novel mollusc hemocyanin genes in two annelid species from Chaetopteridae. For arthropod hemocyanins, 16 putative novel genes were retained, and the presence of arthropod hemocyanins in 11 annelid species represents a novel observation. Interestingly, Annelida is the lineage that presents the greatest repertoire of oxygen transport proteins reported to date, possessing all the main superfamily proteins, which could be explained partially by the immense variability of lifestyles and habitats. Work presented here contradicts the canonical view that hemocyanins are restricted to molluscs and arthropods, suggesting that the occurrence of copper-based blood pigments in metazoans has been underestimated. Our results also support the idea of the presence of oxygen carrier hemocyanins being widespread across metazoans with an evolutionary history characterized by frequent losses.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2				1939-8697		MEDLINE:30624121	30624121

Here, we report how the limitations on the stability of 3d-metal materials can be overcome by the spectroscopic identification of stable potential windows in which the OER can be catalyzed efficiently while simultaneously suppressing deactivation pathways. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach using gamma manganese oxide (gamma-MnO2), which shows no signs of deactivation even after 8000h of electrolysis at a pH of 2. This stability is vastly superior to existing acid-stable 3d-metal OER catalysts, but cannot be realized if there is a deviation as small as 50-mV from the stable potential window. A stable voltage efficiency of over 70% in a polymer-electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer further verifies the availability of this approach and showcases how materials previously perceived to be unstable may have potential application for water electrolysis in an acidic environment.									108	8	1	0	5	0	112			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000463739900046	30869187

CoSx nanoparticles work as catalysts to grow CNT branches onto the srGO, and the CoSx@srGO/CNT act as bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The bifunctional ORR and OER activities of the CoSx@srGO/CNT are substantially greater than those of CoS2, srGO, and CoSx@srGO as confirmed by onset potentials, Tafel and K-L plots, and mass activities. Zn-air batteries with CoSx@srGO/CNT catalyst achieved a specific capacity of 583 mAhGreek ano teleiagzn = 1 and maximum power density of 66.45 mWGreek ano teleiacm = 2, which are greater than Pt/C and IrO2 mixed catalyst, along with a long-term cyclability of over 100 cycles. The outstanding performance of CoSx@srGO/CNT is attributed to the abundant exposed active sites of CoSx on a unique 3D multidimensional graphene/CNT hybrid architecture and the rapid mass/charge transport for the enhanced bifunctional activities.

In this work, with a transition metal embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene (TMN3) as the example, it is found that the electron doping and band shift are the dominant factors for HER activity by using first-principles calculations, indicating the possibilities to design the optimal catalysts by the manipulations of electron transfer and band states near the Fermi level. Here, a novel approach to achieve hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) control via ferroelectric (FE) switching is proposed. Our theoretical results reveal that the electrocatalytic HER performance of TMN3 catalysts can be well controlled when they are placed on the surface of FE In2Se3, in which CoN3/P down arrow-In2Se3 exhibits the best HER performance with a Gibbs free energy change of -0.044 eV. The adsorption energies and electron transfer can be effectively modulated when the polarization is reversed, due to the polarization induced electron redistribution, magnetic moment changes, and band state shifts near the Fermi level. The FE-controlled HER activity is further supported by the catalyst-electronic-magnetic relationship under the electric field. This systematic study provides a fundamental understanding for new insights into the design and application of cost-effective 2D ferroelectric heterostructure catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000864798200001

This Review examines defect chemistry in metal oxides and discusses the role that charged defects and polarons have in enabling photoelectrochemical reactions.A deep understanding of defects is essential for the optimization of materials for solar energy conversion. This is particularly true for metal oxide photo(electro)catalysts, which typically feature high concentrations of charged point defects that are electronically active. In photovoltaic materials, except for selected dopants, defects are considered detrimental and should be eliminated to minimize charge recombination. However, photocatalysis is a more complex process in which defects can have an active role, such as in stabilizing charge separation and in mediating rate-limiting catalytic steps. In this Review, we examine the behaviour of electronic defects in metal oxides, paying special attention to the principles that underpin the formation and function of trapped charges in the form of polarons. We focus on how defects alter the electronic structure of metal oxides, statically or transiently upon illumination, and discuss the implications of such changes in light-driven catalytic reactions. Finally, we compare oxide defect chemistry with that of new photocatalysts based on carbon nitrides, polymers and metal halide perovskites.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2058-8437			WOS:000790634400001

Electrocatalysts, with the purpose of accelerating HER, however, are far from meeting the requirements of high activity, cost effectiveness, and long-term stability, especially in alkaline media. Herein, a series of ultrafine bi- or tri-metallic Mo-based carbides embedded in a graphitic carbon matrix are synthesized by a direct solid reaction between metal molybdate and dicyandiamide (DCA). The components of the proposed multi-metallic carbides can be controlled in a facile manner by precisely configuring the molybdates with different metal cations, enabling the design of electrocatalysts with optimized active sites for HER. With the carbon layer protecting against corrosion, the as-prepared series of (NixCo1-x)(6)Mo6C2 carbides presents effective HER performance, in which the optimized stoichiometric sample ((Ni0.2Co0.8)(6)Mo6C2) requires an overpotential of 100 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) current density for HER. With this electrocatalyst, a durable current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) can be achieved by applying an overpotential of 1.84 V towards HER, which is even lower than the required potential of the Pt/C commercial electrocatalyst (2.12 V) for the same current density.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2633-5409		WOS:000612088000017

Herein, we report a versatile strategy to rhodium (Rh) SAC by a facile cation exchange reaction. Remarkably, the Rh SAC modified CuO nanowire arrays on copper foam (Rh SAC-CuO NAs/CF) show unprecedented alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with a high current density of 84.5 mA cm(-2)@1.5 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), 9.7 times that of Ir/C/CF. More strikingly, when used as an anode and a cathode for overall water splitting, the Rh SAC-CuO NAs/CF can achieve 10 mA cm(-2) at only 1.51 V. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the high OER and HER intrinsic catalytic activities result from moderate adsorption energy of intermediates on Rh SAC. Finally, we demonstrate the general synthesis of different single-atom noble-metal catalysts on CuO NAs (M SAC-CuO NAs/CF, where M = Ru, Ir, Os, and Au).									52	2	0	0	1	0	52			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000548893200103	32515969

Here, we successfully demonstrate anodic biomass oxidation by synthesizing 5 nm nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiO NPs). NiO NPs show a unique electrocatalytic activity for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation under near-neutral conditions, exhibiting an anodic current onset (1 mA cm(-2)) at 1.524 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode and a total Faradaic efficiency of <= 70%. Electrokinetic and in situ ultraviolet-visible spectroscopic analyses suggest that a redox active nickel hydroxide species is formed on the surface of NiO electrocatalysts during HMF oxidation, and this oxidation of Ni(II) hydroxide to Ni(III) oxyhydroxide could be the rate-determining step. This mechanistic study of biomass oxidation in a CO2-saturated electrolyte provides insight into constructing a highly efficient system for the paired electrolysis of CO2 reduction and biomass oxidation.									37	0	0	0	3	0	37			1948-7185			WOS:000526353000023	32223169

An extraordinarily robust monophosphate tungsten bronze (MPTB)-modified graphite anode was successfully fabricated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a thermodynamic potential of 1.23 V in H2SO4 acidic solution. Several Al, Cr and Fe counter-cation-based MPTBs were synthesized by the solution combustion method. Novel Al-based MPTBs calcined at 700 degrees C in O-2 (AlO7) showed almost zero onset overpotential, high current density, high turnover frequency for OER and steady catalysis in repeated use even after 30 weeks. The orthorhombic AlO7 comprising crystallites of 9.89 nm and an indirect band gap (1.89 eV), is an unusually stable MPTB that contains 98% W5+ state stabilized with the Al3+ counter cation. The catalysis decreases as the ratio of W5+ : W6+ in MPTBs decreases and [410] and [601] facets play main roles in the first H2O association and nucleophilic attack of the second H2O molecule on the catalyst surface. Thus, MPTBs can be non-noble metal anode materials for robust acidic H2O electrolyzers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000629770100027	35423566

After annealing the prepared COF@CNT composites, CNT-twined nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheres (N-C@CNTs) were formed. N-C@CNTs-800 prepared at 800 degrees C demonstrated the efficient electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The ORR half-wave potential of N-C@CNTs-800 reached about 0.87 V in KOH and 0.73 V in HClO4, comparable with the best non-precious metal catalysts (NPMCs). Moreover, the specific electric double-layer capacitance of N-C@CNTs-800 was about 250 F g(-1), larger than many similar carbons reported previously. The special structure of COF precursors consisting of the flexible triangular pyramid-shaped tris(4-formylphenyl)amine and the rigid porphyrin units was favorable for the exposure of active N species on carbon surface, and also facilitated the fabrication of CNT-twined nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheres. The used CNTs clearly contributed to the enhanced graphitization degree and abundant porosities of the carbonized N-C@CNTs. Thermal conversion of COF@CNT composites provided a simple synthesis strategy for preparing robust carbon electrode materials for oxygen electroreduction and capacitance storage.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000492562000001

However, individual BiVO4 cannot effectively prevent the recombination of photogenerated electron and hole, which leads to poor photocatalytic activity and limits its further application. Matching BiVO4 with a suitable semiconductor is an effective means to improve its photocatalytic activity. In this work, a systematic theoretical research on the optical, charge carrier lifetimes and photocatalytic performance of a novel GeP/BiVO4 and GeP/Graphene/BiVO4 heterostructures have been carried out according to the density functional theory (DFT) and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD). Results show that GeP makes a staggered band alignment with BiVO4. The GeP/BiVO4 heterostructure introduces a built-in electric field, but this built-in electric field is not enough to form Z-scheme heterostructure. The graphene intercalation provides a new energy platform and modulates the built-in electric field as well as charge carrier lifetimes, which is highly beneficial to improve the photocatalytic performance for the water splitting. And the reaction free energy shows that GeP/Graphene/BiVO4 heterostructure has the best hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) performance in our calculated structures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000848183800004

Although a universal material to achieve the above missions is highly desirable, it remains challenging. Here, we report palladium/bismuth/copper hierarchical nanoarchitectures (Pd/Bi/Cu HNAs) for advanced dual applications toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrogen detection, via first electrodeposition of cylindrical nanowires and subsequent wet-chemical etching art. For HER, the Pd/Bi/Cu HNAs present the overpotential (79 mV at 10 mA(-2)) and tafel slope (61 mV dec(-1)) closing to those of Pt/C. For hydrogen detection, the Pd/Bi/Cu HNAs was able to work at a wide-temperature range (similar to 156-418 K), and remarkably, their critical temperature (similar to 156 K) of the "reversing sensing behavior" is much lower than that of pure Pd nanowires (278 K). These excellent performances are ascribed to the synergic effect of hierarchical morphology induced more exposure of Pd, and the Pd d-band modification via Cu and Bi dopants. It is feasible that Pd/Bi/Cu HNAs serve as universal materials for both efficient catalysts toward hydrogen evolution via water electrolysis and wide-temperature adapted hydrogen detection.									20	2	0	0	1	0	20			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000459221900074	30668909

However, their striking structural characteristics cause chemical instability and undergo oxidation easily. Establishing a transparent material model for unraveling oxidation-dependent electrocatalysis is of great importance for designing more efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, we fabricated an on-chip microcell that uses an individual nanosheet as the working electrode to evaluate the contribution of a single oxidation factor to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in the generation of oxidative molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) for the fabrication of the on-chip electrocatalytic device. Moreover, O-2 plasma technology was utilized to control the degree of oxidation accurately by the processing time. Using oxidized MoTe2 as a prototype demonstrated lower onset overpotential and activation energy of HER performance, which was optimized to some degree by oxidation. The incorporated oxygen during the oxidation process as an electron density modulator could manipulate the electron densities and contribute to the enriched surface charge and lower Gibbs reaction energy. Our present work provides atomic-level insights into the role of surface oxide in ultrathin TMDs HER catalysis by an on-chip electrocatalytic microdevice and the semiquantification of the model-structureperformance relationship, thus, opening the door for designing catalytic centers.									37	7	0	0	1	0	38				2096-5745		WOS:000794065500001

However, the large-scale application of electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen evolution currently requires expensive platinum-based catalysts. Therefore, it is important to develop efficient and stable catalysts based on the rich reserves of transition metals as alternatives. In this study, the authors prepare a carbon-nanotube material enriched with atomically dispersed Co-N sites having uniquely low coordination numbers via the simple mixing, pyrolysis, and leaching of inexpensive precursors. These atomically dispersed low-coordinate Co-N sites provide an overpotential of only 82 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under challenging acidic conditions and show excellent durability in accelerated stability tests. Theoretical simulations also confirm that these unique, low-coordinate Co-N-2 sites have lower energy barriers in catalyzing the HER than Fe/Ni-N-2 sites and commonly reported Co-N-3/N-4 sites. Therefore, the method provides a new concept for the design of single-atom catalytic sites with low coordination numbers. It also serves to reduce the cost of hydrogen production in the future owing to the high catalytic activity, low cost, and scalable production process.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000723116300001	34841663	
J	Antonio Morinigo, Jose; Hermida-Quesada, Jose								Evaluation of reduced-order kinetic models for HTPB-oxygen combustion using LES								AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				58				358	368		10.1016/j.ast.2016.08.027				NOV 2016	2016	This investigation analyses three finite-rate chemistry mechanisms of 2, 4 and 6 steps to simulate the combustion process in hybrid propellant rockets of HTPB-based (solid fuel) and gaseous oxygen. Computational Fluid Dynamics is used to compare the predictions with the available experimental data of a small channel-like burner intended for reactive flow characterisation, hence to assess the pros and cons of accepting extra complexity into the chemistry model in practical engineering computations. To better isolate the effect of modelling reacting flow with different chemistry models, the frame of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of FLUENT has been used to resolve the time-spatial evolution of the gas mixture of pyrolysed fuel (modelled as polybutadiene, which is the major species of the thermal decomposition) and a stream of oxygen injected at the head-end of the combustor. The flow exhibits a mixing layer which evolves over and downstream the solid fuel block as a result of the interaction with the vortical structures. The LES methodology is affordable because of the small Reynolds number of the conducted experiments, which corresponds to the range Re similar to 2000 to 8000. A set of simulations have been accomplished for each chemical mechanism with oxygen inflow velocities of 2 to 10 m/s. Being the focus to assess the behaviour of the finite-rate mechanisms, fuel regression rate has been prescribed accordingly to available empirical data. Radiation effects are not taken into account, justified by the small scale of the combustion region.The results show that dissociation reactions of the 6-reaction mechanism play a significant impact on the combustion temperature, which approaches the experimental evidence, hence it is in agreement with the theoretical flame temperature predicted by detailed chemistry solvers. On the contrary, flame temperature computed with the 2 and 4-step chemistry models is over-predicted upon unrealistic limits, above 3150 K, which is attributed to the lack of fundamental physics linked to the non-inclusion of endothermal reactions in these models. Although an improvement is clearly provided by the 6-reaction chemistry, a drawback is however observed: a less robust behaviour of the solver occurs. Therefore, a decision concerning to weight the inclusion of more accurate (more steps) finite-rate kinetics against the numerical complexities (operational and geometrical) of engineering simulations in hybrid propulsion systems, is of concern in the final approach.

The electronic/band structure of carbon nitride can be tuned by introducing vacancies. However, the hydrogen production rate of carbon nitride modified only by a single defect is not significant. Therefore, we have constructed nitrogen-oxygen double vacancy modified carbon nitride by a simple two-step method. Especially, the photocatalytic performance of DACN-2 was 11.7 times and 5.8 times better than that of carbon nitride and oxygen-doped carbon nitride, respectively. The increase of specific surface area along with more available active sites, the pull-up of conduction band position and more efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs accounted for the improvement of hydrogen evolution performance. Moreover, the double vacancy was the separation center of the photogenerated charges, which accelerated the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. This research provided a new concept for the design of defective carbon nitride and laid the foundation for the development of more effective photocatalysts in the future.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000656780700007

Anodic alumina templates are therefore coated with thin layers of SnO2, Fe2O3, and IrO2 by atomic layer deposition. In the first step, the Fe2O3 electrode is modified with a conductive SnO2 layer and submitted to different postdeposition thermal treatments in order to maximize its catalytic performance. The combination of steady-state electrolysis, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrates that catalytic turnover and e(-) extraction are most efficient if both layers are amorphous in nature. In the second step, small quantities of IrO2 with extremely low iridium loading of 7.5 mu g cm(-2) are coated on the electrode surface. These electrodes reveal favorable long-term stability over at least 15 h and achieve maximized steady-state current densities of 0.57 +/- 0.05 mA cm(-2) at eta = 0.38 V and pH 7 (1.36 +/- 0.10 mA cm(-2) at eta = 0.48 V) in dark conditions. This architecture enables charge carrier separation and reduces the photoelectrochemical water oxidation onset by 300 mV with respect to pure Fe2O3 electrodes of identical geometry.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			2196-7350			WOS:000458309700008

Depending on conditions for reaction with oxygen, the initially planar Re(1121) surface evolves sequentially to form zigzag chains consisting of (0110) and (1010) facets that coexist with stepped (1121) plateaus; three-sided pyramids exposing (0110), (1010) and (3364) facets; a faceted surface with five facets including (0110), (1010), (1122)-(2 times 1), (0111)-(2 times 1) and (1011)-(2 times 1); and four-sided pyramids exposing {0110} and {0111}-(2 times 1) facets. We have observed reversible morphological transitions between the faceted surfaces and discovered that each intermediate facet in the evolutionary chain contains microscopic structural elements of the preceding and following facets, which may provide a natural explanation for the microscopic mass transport pathways in the morphological evolution. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) data confirm the morphology of faceted surfaces and give complementary information to LEED results.

However, their problems such as low coulombic efficiency of first cycle and apparent voltage decay influence commercialization process. The high charging voltage will cause instability of structure and increase the hidden danger of the battery. Therefore, structural evolution of first cycle at higher voltage needs to be further studied. In this work, the precursor was synthesized by the co-precipitation method, and the lithium-rich manganese-based layered cathode materials were prepared by lithium-mixed and high-temperature sintering, and the effects of coulombic efficiency and cycle performance were studied at different charge cut-off voltages. Results have shown that high charging voltage would increase the capacity, but reduce the coulombic efficiency greatly in the first cycle, leading to the decayed specific capacity of long cycle. Cyclic voltammetric investigation proves that when the charge cut-off voltage was 5.0 V,part of the bulk lattice oxygen underwent a reversible oxidation reaction, which lead to the increase of capacity. TEM,XRD and SEM characterization results show that the electrode not only went deep into the bulk phase structural changes, including a large number of stacking faults and spinel phases MnO_x and NiO_x, and other irreversible phase changes, but also reacted with the electrolyte. Mapping and XPS results show that when the charging voltage became higher, more bulk lattice oxygen participated during redox reaction, which causes stronger oxidizing peroxygen and superoxide ions to undergo side reactions with the electrolyte and accelerates the structural collapse of the electrode, ultimately, becomes not conducive to long cycle performance of the battery accompanied by the dissolution of the transition metal.			富锂锰基层状正极材料由于具有较低的成本和超过250 mAh·g~(-1)的放电比容量,成为很有前景的正极材料之一,但是其本身存在的首周库仑效率低和电压衰减等问题限制了产业化进程。高充电电压会导致富锂材料结构不稳定从而增加电池的安全隐患,因此在较高的充电电压下,材料的首周充放电结构演化有待进一步研究。本文首先通过碳酸盐共沉淀法合成前驱体,经过混锂后煅烧制备富锂锰基层状正极材料(Li_(1.13)Ni_(0.18)Co_(0.09)Mn_(0.56)O_2),并研究不同充电截止电压对其首周库仑效率和循环性能的影响。研究表明,高充电电压会带来容量增加,但其首周库仑效率将大幅降低。循环伏安表征发现,充电截止电压为5.0 V时,部分体相的晶格氧会发生可逆的氧化反应,这将有利于容量的提升。TEM、XRD和SEM表征结果显示,在首周充电后电极材料不仅发生了深入到体相的结构变化,同时出现了大片的层错和尖晶石相MnO_x和NiO_x等不可逆相变,还会与电解液发生反应,材料结构无法保持稳定。结合Mapping和XPS表征结果显示,充电电压较高时会有更多的体相晶格氧参与氧化还原反应,这将使更多具有强氧化性的过氧和超氧离子与电解液发生副反应,并伴随过渡金属的溶出,加速材料的结构坍塌,最终不利于电池的长循环性能。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1006-3471			CSCD:7157176

In this paper, porphyrin-like Fe-N-4 sites have been identified in nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (N-CNFs) grown from iron nanoparticles by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Acid treatment of the N-CNFs removed the iron growth particles and about 50% of the nitrogen groups from the pristine N-CNFs, without affecting the oxygen reduction performance. Performing electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) on the acid treated and annealed N-CNFs confirmed that the CVD synthesis method leads to iron being atomically incorporated into the N-CNF structure. Furthermore, Xray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analysis of the Fe K-edge indicates that the iron atoms are stabilized by four nitrogen atoms, reminiscent of the Fe-N-4 structure found in porphyrins. An evolution of the XANES spectrum was observed when performing the measurements under mildly reducing conditions, which was explained by oxygen being adsorbed on the Fe-N-4 sites at room temperature. The Fe-N-4 moieties embedded in the N-CNFs were resistant to acid leaching and the results suggest that these Fe-N-4 sites are active sites for the oxygen reduction in N-CNFs.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000579549200027

Herein, to reveal the coercivity-related OER performance, single-domain ferromagnetic CoFe2O4 (CFO) nanocrystals with different coercivities are synthesized and subjected to OER under an in situ tunable magnetic field. As the more ordered spin polarization state of CFO with a higher coercivity can afford a facilitated electron transfer process, the magnetic field-assisted OER activity can be more improved with an increase in coercivity. Specifically, the decreased magnitudes of the overpotential, Tafel slope, and charge transfer resistance increase on the samples with higher coercivity. The CFO with the largest coercivity (7500 Oe) shows the best OER performance with an overpotential of 350 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under a magnetic field of 14000 G. In addition, a hysteresis effect that maintains enhanced OER current density after the magnetic field has been withdrawn is observed, where higher coercivity affords a longer hysteresis period. The exploration of coercivity-related OER enhancement may provide new insights into the design and synthesis of promising "magnetic effect " catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1948-7185			WOS:000839523300001	35939648

Three types of metastability are observed: (1) long term irreversible degradation due to oxidization processes on the film surface, (2) reversible degradation determined by uncontrolled water and/or oxygen adsorption, and (3) a fast field-switching effect in the film bulk. We propose that this effect is associated with the morphology changes during film growth and an electrical field induced by adsorbed atmospheric components on the film surface. It is found that metastable processes close to the film surface are stronger than in the bulk. (c) 2005 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1063-7826	1090-6479		WOS:000228012800015

Lattice-resolution images and surface-sensitive spectroscopies demonstrate the Ir-rich surface layer (evolved from one-dimensional connected edge-sharing [IrO6] octahedrons) with high relative content of Ir5+ sites, which is responsible for the high activity and long-term stability. Combining operando infrared spectroscopy with X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we report the first direct observation of key intermediates absorbing at 946 cm(-1) (Ir6+=O site) and absorbing at 870 cm(-1 )(Ir6+OO- site) on iridium-based oxides electrocatalysts, and further discover the Ir6+=O and Ir6+OO- intermediates are stable even just from 1.3 VRHE. Density functional theory calculations indicate the catalytic activity of Ca2IrO4 is enhanced remarkably after surface Ca leaching, and suggest IrOO- and Ir=O intermediates can be stabilized on positive charged active sites of Ir-rich surface layer.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000848752100001	36005477

The molybdenum and tungsten enzymes show common structural features, with the metal being bound by a pyranopterin-dithiolene cofactor called molybdopterin. They catalyze a variety of oxygen transferase reactions coupled with two-electron redox chemistry in which the metal cycles between the +6 and +4 oxidation states usually with water, either product or substrate, providing the oxygen. The functional roles filled by the molybdenum and tungsten enzymes are diverse; for example, they play essential roles in microbial respiration, in the uptake of nitrogen in green plants, and in human health. Together, the enzymes form a superfamily which is among the most prevalent known, being found in all kingdoms of life. This review discusses what is known of the active site structures and the mechanisms, together with some recent insights into the evolution of these important enzyme systems.									39	0	0	0	18	0	39			1756-5901	1756-591X		WOS:000328891100002	24068390

Piro & Bildsten showed that weak reactions during this simmering set a maximum electron abundance Ye at the time of the explosion. We investigate the nuclear reactions during this simmering with a series of self-heating, at constant pressure, reaction network calculations. Unlike in AGB stars, p captures onto Ne-22 and heavier trace nuclei do not play a significant role. The C-12 abundance is sufficiently high that the neutrons preferentially capture onto C-12, rather than iron group nuclei. As an aid to hydrodynamical simulations of the simmering phase, we present fits to the rates of heating, electron capture, change in mean atomic mass, and consumption of C-12 in terms of the screened thermally averaged cross section for C-12 + C-12. Our evaluation of the net heating rate includes contributions from electron captures into the 3.68 MeVexcited state of C-13. This results in a slightly larger energy release, per C-12 consumed, than that found by Piro & Bildsten, but less than that released for a burn to only 20 Ne and Na-23. We compare our one-zone results to more accurate integrations over the white dwarf structure to estimate the amount of C-12 that must be consumed to raise the white dwarf temperature, and hence to determine the net reduction of Ye during simmering.									53	2	0	0	0	0	53			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000254754300011

Here, we report novel Ni3N quantum dot (QD)/NiO heterostructure material, fabricated by immobilization of metallic Ni3N QDs onto the surface of NiO nanosheet, as a highly active and durable electrocatalyst for efficient oxygen reduction performance. The electrochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that a strong interface coupling effect in Ni3N QDs/NiO heterostructure is realized by the interfacial hetero Ni species, synergistically accelerating the dissociation of adsorbed water molecules and reductive kinetics of adsorbed oxygen molecules during the ORR process. Hence, the developed Ni3N QDs/NiO heterostructure yields prominent oxygen reduction performance with a small half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.76 V and high kinetic current density (J(k)) of 15.4 mA cm(-2) at 0.7 V, much superior to those of NiO nanosheet (0.65 V; 0.81 mA cm(-2)) and comparable to those of commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.80 V; 13 mA cm(-2)). In addition, the catalyst shows long-term catalytic stability with robust methanol tolerance, serving as a promising noble-metal-free ORR catalyst for fuel cells.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1932-7447			WOS:000464768600017

In this work, the vertically aligned SnS2 nanosheet arrays with open porous mass transfer pathways are synthesized, while the rational surface modification of highly electrocatalytic active heteroatoms (Ni/Fe or Ru) onto the SnS2 surface is achieved by a cation exchange strategy. The as-prepared Ni/Fe dual-metaldoped SnS2 on carbon cloth (NiFe-SnS2/CC) with abundant S vacancies and Ru nanodots-modified SnS2 (Ru-SnS2/CC) with SnS2/SnS heterostructures can effectively enhance the electron conductivity and the electrocatalytic activity. Benefiting from the plenty of metal heteroatoms and defects, the onset overpotential of the NiFe-SnS2/CC composite is only 251 mV for oxygen evolution reaction, while the value of Ru-SnS2/CC is 81 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction, along with robust long-term durability. Moreover, the assembled NiFe-SnS2/CC-3 parallel to Ru-SnS2/CC-10 electrolyzer device can attain a low cell voltage of 1.576 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This project provides the methodology for promoting the low electrocatalytic species for high-performance energy conversion as well as a rational surface modification strategy through a cation exchange reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0888-5885			WOS:000733802600001

To facilitate its commercialization, the challenges of long-term performance stability of electrochemical devices need to be first addressed and realized. This minireview summarised the common causes of performance decline during seawater electrolysis, from chemical reactions at the electrode surface to physical damage to the cell. The problems triggered by the impurities in seawater are specifically discussed. Following these issues, we further outlined the ongoing effort of counter-measurements: from electrocatalyst optimization to electrode engineering and cell design. The recent progress in selectivity tuning, surface protection, gas diffusion, and cell configuration is highlighted. In the final remark, we emphasized the need for a consensus on evaluating the stability of seawater electrolysis in the current literature.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000698131900001	34487129

Galvanic replacement reaction was carried out for palladium modification on template electrodeposited copper nanostructures on pencil graphite substrate. The nanostructures are shown to be very stable with excellent electrocatalytic activities. Under optimised conditions, they could be used for histamine sensing at a very low oxidation potential of +0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The low oxidation potential enabled sensitive and selective analysis of histamine using chronoamperometry without any interference from oxygen evolution reactions. We have demonstrated that the sensor shows excellent selectivity towards histamine even in the presence of many of the common interfering biogenic amines. The sensor exhibited a sensitivity of 0.082 mu A/mu M/cm (2) with a limit of detection as low as 3.2 +/- 0.1 nM. The oxidation potential and limit of detection obtained using this sensor are much superior to the results reported so far in the literature. Practical feasibility of the developed sensor was manifested by histamine analysis in canned tuna fish samples, where the chronoamperometric estimation was also validated by conventional HPLC analysis.									32	0	0	0	12	0	32			0956-5663	1873-4235		WOS:000424176600032	29153945

In the current study, a flexible electrode of nickel diphosphide nanosheet arrays on carbon cloth (NiP2/CC) is synthesized through phosphidation of Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet arrays as a precursor on the carbon cloth. The resultant three-dimensional (3D) porous nanosheet array architecture enhances the exposure of surface active sites and the release of gaseous products. When used as an OER catalyst, such an integrated 3D array electrode affords a current density of 4 mA cm(-2) at an OER overpotential of 570 mV with good stability in neutral solution. Moreover, the NiP2/CC electrode also exhibits good OER performance (j = 20 mA cm(-2) at eta = 310 mV) under alkaline conditions. Notably, this electrode also shows high activity and stability under both neutral and alkaline media toward the HER. More importantly, when assembled as a symmetric full water splitting device with NiP2/CC as both the cathode and anode, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.65 V is achieved in 1.0 M KOH solution. Owing to its low cost and high activity, NiP2/CC presents potential applications toward overall water splitting electrolysis and other electrochemical devices.									62	2	0	0	1	0	63			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000395885500036

In this work, a series of metal-organic framework (MOF)derived FeNi oxides from a barrel-shaped Ni-based BMM-10 precursor are conveniently obtained to show an excellent OER performance. Under mild Fe(III) etching, a type of core-shell Fe o.s -BMM-10 can be well preserved and the coordination bond of the middle frame structure is decomposed. Furthermore, the Fe-BMM-10-T series is successfully synthesized with a well-preserved morphology compared to precursors after direct oxidation. Finally, followed by initial electrochemical activation, the decomposition of FeNi oxides generates active Fe-doped nickel oxyhydroxides for efficient water oxidation. The improved OER performance stems from the high specific surface area and abundant exposed active centers, as well as the significant synergistic effect between iron and nickel, which is further verified by the theoretical calculation. This approach can be extended to precisely adjust the morphology of MOFs and their derivatives that can result in superior electrocatalytic properties in terms of energy conversion and storage applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000813699600001	35656800

The results indicated that Al2O3 inclusions were generated at first after Al addition. With the slag-steel and refractory-steel reactions, inclusions varied with the route as Al2O3 inclusions -> CaO-Al2O3 system inclusions -> CaO-MgO-Al2O3 system inclusions and Al2O3 inclusions -> MgO-Al2O3 spinel inclusions -> CaO-MgO-Al2O3 system inclusions. From Al addition to the end of RH refining, the number density of inclusions increased from 9.32 to 4.09 per mm(2). The total oxygen content in steel could be decreased from 450 to 37 ppm. The size of inclusions varied mainly less than 10 mu m, the proportion of inclusions with size less than 5 mu m gradually decreased by 15% and inclusions in the range of 5-10 increased by 10%. These inclusions with size less than 10 mu m were difficult to be removed from liquid steel through the floatation. The inclusions were Al2O3 and CaO center dot Al2O3 inclusions with a high melting point at the end of RH refining. In order to obtain inclusions with a low melting point, the reasonable C/A mass ratio of the final RH slag is 1.10 through theoretical calculations.

The electrochemical performances of the lanthanum doping nickel hydroxide were studied by means of laboratory cell and cyclic voltammetry. The results show that the structure of the lanthanum doping nickel hydroxide is similar to that of alpha-nickel hydroxide, and it has a large interlayer distance, which is helpful for the diffusion of proton; OH- group in lanthanum doping nickel hydroxide is no longer at free structure phase, which interact with the molecule of water in the lattice. When the mole fraction of lanthanum doping is 6. 32%, lanthanum doping nickel hydroxide has flat discharge curve, higher discharge plateau, higher deoxidation potential, higher oxygen evolution potential, and good cyclic reversibility.									5	3	0	0	0	0	5			1672-7207			INSPEC:8796361

Accelerated life tests, performed at 1.0 mol dm(-3) in aqueous HClO4, with an anodic current of 400 mA cm(-2), showed that the polymeric precursor maintains both a good yield between nominal and experimental composition and favours higher coating stability (5 x) compared with a traditional method of thermal decomposition of the chloride precursor, The deactivation mechanism is also discussed.

To be widely applicable, an electrocatalyst should comprise the Earth's crust's most abundant elements. The most abundant 3d metal, iron, with its multiple accessible redox states has been manifold applied in chemocatalytic processes. However, due to the low conductivity of (FeOxHy)-O-III phases, its applicability for targeted electrocatalytic oxidation reactions such as water oxidation is still limited. Herein, it is shown that iron incorporated in conductive intermetallic iron silicide (FeSi) can be employed to meet this challenge. In contrast to silicon-poor iron-silicon alloys, intermetallic FeSi possesses an ordered structure with a peculiar bonding situation including covalent and ionic contributions together with conducting electrons. Using in situ X-ray absorption and Raman spectroscopy, it could be demonstrated that, under the applied corrosive alkaline conditions, the FeSi partly forms a unique, oxidic iron(III) phase consisting of edge and corner sharing [FeO6] octahedra together with oxidized silicon species. This phase is capable of driving the oxyge evolution reaction (OER) at high efficiency under ambient and industrially relevant conditions (500 mA cm(-2) at 1.50 +/- 0.025 V-RHE and 65 degrees C) and to selectively oxygenate 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF).									40	1	0	0	1	0	40			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000655739600001	34048605

In the "hydrogen economy" society, water electrolysis is viewed as one of the most promising technologies for hydrogen production. The design and synthesis of highly active and durable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is vitally important for the development of the hydrogen economy. In this work, we successfully synthesized polyallylamine (PAA)-functionalized Pt tripods (Pt-tripods@PAA) with ultrathin and ultralong branches through a facile chemical reduction method in an aqueous solution of PAA. The morphology, structure, and composition of Pt-tripods@PAA were fully investigated by various physical techniques. The characterization results reveal that ultrathin and ultralong branches of Pt-tripods@PAA have a concave structure with high-index facets and that PAA strongly binds on the Pt surface as a proton carrier. Impressively, Pt-tripods@PAA display unexpected activity for the HER in acidic solution with an onset reduction potential of +19.6 mV vs RHE, which significantly outperforms currently reported monometallic Pt electrocatalysts. This activity is due to the increase in the local proton concentration on the Pt surface.									113	6	0	0	5	0	113			2155-5435			WOS:000391783200054

In this regard, the noncarbon anode material Ni1-xMgxFe2O4 (x = 0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9) has been prepared by nonconventional citrate gel process using metal nitrate salts as cation precursors and citric acid as a chelating agent. The X-ray analysis showed the existence of single-phase spinel structure with increase of lattice parameter and tetrahedral radius with increasing Mg2+ ion concentration, as against a decrease in density. The FT-IR spectra show the characteristic features of the synthesized ferrite compounds. The DC electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature. It also increases with an increase of Mg2+ ion concentration and reaches a maximum value of 3.3 S cm(-1) at x = 0.6 at which, the activation energy for conduction is found to be minimum. The effect of the Mg2+ substitution on the electrocatalytic activity of the electrodes towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is studied by using steady state potentiostatic polarization measurements in alkaline KOH solution. The Roughness factor (R-f) and the Double layer capacitance (C-d1) of the synthesized electrodes were measured by using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. The chemical stability of the Ni0.4Mg0.6FeO4 electrode, which is observed to possess optimum properties, was ascertained in a saturated cryolite-alumina melt at the 960 degreesC, the operating temperature of aluminium electrolysis.

Characterization of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated that Nb substituted Sn in SnO2 lattice with the chemical state of Nb5+. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement showed that Ti/Nb-Sb-SnO2 anodes, compared to Ti/Nb-Sb-SnO2 anodes, have a lower charge transfer resistance, exhibiting more efficient electrocatalytic activity. These results suggest that Ti/Nb-Sb-SnO2 anodes are suitable for use in wastewater treatment.									19	1	0	0	5	0	19			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000443663400023

The impregnated graphite exhibited higher oxidation resistance than the untreated graphite in static air at 500 degrees C up to 50 h. H3PO4, H3BO3, Al(H2PO4)(3), and Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O in the antioxidant compound formed an excellent chemically and thermally stable BPO4 through the polymerization reaction during the heat-treatment to seal in the pores on the graphite surface. Additionally, during the oxidation process, the B2O3 formed by the decomposition of the remaining H3BO3 and the Al2O3 formed by the reaction of Al-ions with oxygen could further block the oxidation channels, effectively inhibiting the combination of carbon and oxygen. In summary, the synergistic effect of BPO4, B2O3, and Al2O3 anti-oxidative products together improved the oxidation resistance of the impregnated graphite.									4	2	0	0	0	0	5			0257-8972			WOS:000528194000024

However, considerable challenges remain before the catalytic anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can occur at a satisfactory rate due to its sluggish kinetics, thus hampering the overall efficiency of this technology. Urea electrolysis provides opportunities for energy-conserving hydrogen production and the concurrent remediation of urea-enriched sewage water. Therefore, developing advanced electrocatalysts with a reduced cost and improved efficiency for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is key to the implementation of this technique. Herein, we present a three-dimensional (3D) self-supported nickel phosphide/Ni foam electrode (P-NF) that can be prepared by adopting a straightforward low-temperature phosphorization treatment of commercially available Ni foam. As a result, compared with the pristine Ni foam, the as-prepared 3D P-NF catalyst presents obviously enhanced activity for the electrocatalytic UOR, and a small potential of 1.32 V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) is required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). When the P-NF electrode is employed to catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it shows equally satisfactory performance. Moreover, a two-electrode electrolyzer system made of the as-obtained P-NF as the bifunctional electrocatalyst can deliver 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of only 1.37 V with remarkable operational stability.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			0888-5885			WOS:000614073100008

This article focuses on the anchoring of high nuclearity 16-cobalt(II)-containing POM that is, Na30.5K1.5[{Co4(OH)3PO4}4(A-alpha-GeW9O34)4]116H2O (Co16-GeW9) using 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTS) as chemical linker over nickel foam (NiF) and is tested as electrocatalyst for water oxidation studies. The fabricated POM-based electrode (Co16-GeW9@NiF) has been characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. Co16-GeW9 @NiF has been tested for its electrocatalytic water oxidation activity in 1 M KOH (pH 14) and sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) with NaNO3 as a supporting electrolyte. The catalyst exhibited excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with overpotential of 370 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 84 mV/dec in 1 M KOH, while overpotential of 530 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 153 mV/dec in sodium phosphate buffer. The immobilization of POM over NiF could generate a way for developing efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation in both neutral and basic pH.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000806383000005

Strong adsorption of all species at anodic potentials in neutral solution was accompanied by an efficient ability to block both the initial stages of OH monolayer deposition as well as the second stage involving an irreversible process of continued deposition of OH or O species. Glycine and the peptides blocked the initially and more reversibly deposited OH species in preference to those formed at higher potentials. Surface concentrations determined with the lower anodic end potentials (0.50 V) gave information on the orientation of the adsorbed molecules. Steady-state polarization measurements gave Tafel slopes in the range of 253-498 mV, considerably higher than that normally seen for oxygen evolution from a phosphate buffer solution. These results suggest that, in the pH 7.0 buffer, the negatively charged carboxylate group preferentially adsorbs under these anodic potentials in a mechanism similar to the Kolbe reaction, with the decarboxylation step being rate determining.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0008-4042			WOS:000071518100018

Here, we report a facile strategy to synthesize earth abundant nickel boride nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide (Ni3B/rGO) as multifunctional electrocatalysts for both hydrogen oxidation reaction and overall water splitting. The Ni3B/rGO catalysts produce a hydrogen oxidation reaction current density of 2.39 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 100 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, being comparable to commercial Pt/C (2.95 mA cm(-2)) and 60 times as high as bare Ni/rGO (0.04 mA cm(-2)). In addition, the Ni3B/rGO-based alkali electrolyzer affords 100 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage input of 1.85 V for electrocatalytic overall water splitting. Density functional theory calculations further demonstrate that the Ni3B/rGO catalysts possess optimal adsorption energies of both H* and OH* intermediates, which are favorable to electrocatalytic hydrogen electrochemistry in an alkaline medium. This work opens a new avenue toward the rational design of highperformance platinum group metal-free multifunctional electrocatalysts for the hydrogen economy. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Excitingly, density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the introduction of oxygen bridges in the calcination polymerization process can adjust the electronic structure and energy band position of the new material. Further, the results of elemental analysis and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy test indicate that the oxygen bridge structure was successfully introduced into the skeleton of carbon nitride. The results show that 0.1CY-C3N4 can remove bisphenol A (BPA) and 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) with a removal rate of approximately 99% in 90 min and 20 min, respectively. Its degradation rate is 17.94 times and 3.85 times faster than that the original carbon nitride, respectively. Further, through HPLC-MS analysis, the intermediate products of the reaction process were analyzed in depth to propose a possible photocatalytic degradation route. Free radical capturing test and ESR spectroscopy indicate that the formative hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot), superoxide radical (O-center dot(2)-), singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) and hole (h(+)) all play a key role in the photodegradation. This study provides a new way to synthesize brown carbon nitrides with oxygen bridges and porous defects for environmental applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we fabricate a cost-effective bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst with a self-antistacking structure, where three-dimensional (3D) Fe-Co bimetallic oxide particles (FeCoOx) are directly grown on 2D N-doped graphene (NG). The in situ grown FeCoOx particles can alleviate the NG interlaminar restacking, ensuring abundant channels for diffusion of O-2/OH- species, while the NG allows rapid electron flow. Benefiting from this self-antistacking 3D-on-2D structure and synergetic electrocatalysis, FeCoOx@NG demonstrated excellent activity for both ORR and OER (Delta E = 0.78 V), which is superior to that of the binary mixtures of Pt/C and RuO2 (Delta E = 0.83 V). A homemade ZAB with 20%-FeCoOx@NG delivers a specific capacity of 758.9 mAh g(-1), a peak power density of 215 mW cm(-2), and long-term cyclability for over 400 h. These research results suggest that designing a bimetallic oxide/N-doped carbon 3D-on-2D nanoarchitecture using an in situ growth strategy is an attractive and feasible solution to overcome electrocatalytic problems in ZABs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2637-9368		WOS:000868697500001

The key to a rational catalyst design is understanding the descriptors that govern the alkaline HER activity. Unfortunately, the principles that govern the alkaline HER performance remain unclear and are still under debate. By studying the alkaline HER at a series of NiCu bimetallic surfaces, where the electronic structure is modulated by the ligand effect, we demonstrate that alkaline HER activity can be correlated with either the calculated or the experimental-measured d band center (an indicator of hydrogen binding energy) via a volcano-type relationship. Such correlation indicates the descriptor role of the d band center, and this hypothesis is further supported by the evidence that combining Ni and Cu produces a variety of adsorption sites, which possess near-optimal hydrogen binding energy. Our finding broadens the applicability of d band theory to activity prediction of metal electrocatalysts and may offer an insightful understanding of alkaline HER mechanism.									125	7	0	0	6	0	127			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000529959000010	32279490

Herein, we propose to tune both the anionic and cationic redox chemistry of Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 via a ldquothree-in-onerdquo strategy integrating Na doping for the Li site and Si substitution for the Mn and Na2SiO3 coating layer, which is achieved by the facile coating of Na+-conductive Na2SiO3. In comparison with the pristine or Li2SiO3-coating sample, the concerns of voltage fading, poor rate capability, structure degradation, and oxygen release have all been largely alleviated due to the ldquothree-in-onerdquo effect. First, the coating layer impedes the side reaction and the dissolution of transition metals (TMs). Second, Na+ is confirmed to be doped into the Li layers to facilitate the transport kinetics of lithium ions while Si4+ is doped into the TM site, which enhances the stability of the layered structure during cycling due to the strong Si-O bond and reduces the migration of TMs. Third, the integrated strategy also decreases the covalency of TM-O bonds, which is verified to improve the reversibility of anion redox chemistry and suppress oxygen evolution. The synergetic strategy sheds some light on exploring high-performance cathode materials by tuning both anionic and cationic redox chemistry. copy 2020 American Chemical Society.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0897-4756			INSPEC:20341607

Herein, a cost-effective phosphorus-doped Co-Fe-B material with chain-like structure (denoted as Co-1-Fe-1-B-P) is reported as an efficient and novel bifunctional electrocatalyst for the OER and HER, and was produced via a facile water-bath synthesis and subsequent phosphorization. For the OER, the as-prepared Co-1-Fe-1-B-P nanochains require an extremely low overpotential of about 225 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and possess a small Tafel slope of 40 mV dec(-1) in alkaline media. Impressively, the HER properties of Co-1-Fe-1-B-P nanochains are superior to those of P-free Co-Fe-B in terms of overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (173 mV vs. 239 mV) and kinetic Tafel slope (96 mV dec(-1)vs. 105 mV dec(-1)). The synergetic effect between Co-Fe-B and doped-P is mainly responsible for the satisfactory bifunctional performance, while the one-dimensional (1D) chain-like structure endows Co-1-Fe-1-B-P with abundant catalytically active sites that enhance the atom utilization efficiency. Moreover, the developed Co-1-Fe-1-B-P nanochains can be simultaneously utilized as both the cathode and anode for overall water-splitting, which requires a cell voltage of only 1.68 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2). This work provides a feasible and promising protocol to realize metal borides as efficient electrocatalysts in energy-related applications.									141	7	0	0	6	0	144			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000465315900045	30942799

The solid-state synthesis of AgNbO3 is considered difficult and an oxidizing atmosphere is typically employed during AgNbO3 processing, on the premise that oxygen can prevent possible decomposition of the silver oxide at high temperatures. However, details about the influence of processing parameters on the functional properties of AFE AgNbO3 are insufficiently understood. In this work, the solid-state reaction of a stoichiometric AgO and Nb2O5 mixture was investigated. We found that ball milling can convert AgO into metallic Ag, which is beneficial for lowering the reaction temperature for the formation of the perovskite phase to 500-600celcius. Moreover, the influence of the processing atmosphere (air, O-2, and N-2) was investigated by thermal analysis and in situ X-ray diffraction. Since the reaction between Ag and Nb2O5 to form AgNbO3 requires oxygen uptake, AgNbO3 was only found to form in air and O-2, whereby the kinetics were faster in the latter case. All the sintered AgNbO3 samples exhibited a similar crystallographic structure, although the samples processed in O-2 had a lower oxygen vacancy concentration. Despite this, well-defined AFE double polarization loops were obtained in all cases. Our results indicate that decomposition of sliver oxide during ball milling is beneficial for the solid-state reaction, while a pure O-2 atmosphere is not essential for the synthesis of high-quality AgNbO3. These findings may simplify the processing and facilitate further research of AgNbO3-based antiferroelectrics.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000692037300001

Herein, using first-principles calculations, we investigated the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalytic activity of X-doped (X = B, N, P, S) biphenylene (BPN). BPN was successfully synthesized experimentally and our results show that heteroatom doping can effectively enhance the electrocatalytic activity towards the HER. The beta-site P-doped BPN has an optimal Gibbs free energy for hydrogen (Delta G(H*)) value of 0.01 eV and excellent exchange current density (-1.48 A cm(-2)). In addition, we also revealed that the electrocatalytic activity is better when the heteroatom replaces a beta-site C atom instead of an alpha-site C atom. According to the results of the band structure of X-doped BPN, P atom doping can enhance the charge transfer from hydrogen to C atoms, corresponding to an appropriate p-band center. Furthermore, we demonstrated that P-doped BPN prefers the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for the HER, and the reaction energy barrier is only 0.8 eV. Our work provides a strategy for designing a new metal-free HER electrocatalyst, which is predicted to be employed in HER catalysis with low cost and high performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000814712400001

Recently, Pd-based nanocrystals have attracted attention as Pt-alternative cathode catalysts towards the ORR in the alkaline electrolyte. Unfortunately, the pristine Pd-based nanocrystals lack the selectivity towards the ORR due to their inherent activity for the alcohol molecule oxidation reaction in the alkaline electrolyte. In this work, polyethyleneimine (PEI) modified AuPd alloy nanocrystals with Au-rich AuPd alloy cores and Pd-rich PdAu alloy shells (AuPd@PdAu-PEI) are successfully synthesized using a traditional chemical reduction method in presence of PEI. The rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique is applied to evaluate the ORR performance of AuPd@PdAu-PEI nanocrystals. Compared with commercial Pd black, AuPd@PdAu-PEI nanocrystals show significantly enhanced activity and durability towards the ORR, and simultaneously exhibit particular alcohol tolerance towards the ORR in the alkaline electrolyte.

This report describes novel findings of an investigation of the nanoscale alloying of gold-copper (AuCu) nanoparticles and its impact on the surface catalytic functions. Two pathways have been explored for the formation of AuCu nanoparticles of different compositions, including wet chemical synthesis from mixed Au- and Cu-precursor molecules, and nanoscale alloying via an evolution of mixed Au- and Cu-precursor nanoparticles near the nanoscale melting temperatures. For the evolution of mixed precursor nanoparticles, synchrotron X-ray-based in situ real-time XRD was used to monitor the structural changes, revealing nanoscale alloying and reshaping toward an fcc-type nanoalloy (particle or cube) via a partial melting-resolidification mechanism. The nanoalloys supported on carbon or silica were characterized by in situ high-energy XRD/atomic pair disributoin function (PDF) analyses, revealing an intriguing lattice "expanding-shrinking" phenomenon depending on whether the catalyst is thermochemically processed under an oxidative or reductive atmosphere. This type of controllable structural changes is found to play an important role in determining the catalytic activity of the catalysts for carbon monoxide oxidation reaction. The tunable catalytic activities of the nanoalloys under thermochemically oxidative and reductive atmospheres are also discussed in terms of the bifunctional sites and the surface oxygenated metal species for carbon monoxide and oxygen activation.									71	2	0	0	3	0	72			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000312564800005

This effect creates an additional ohmic resistance as well as an increased reaction overpotential, hyperpolarization, as the effective surface area decreases. This work aims to improve the understanding of how anode properties - including isotropy at the optical domain level, wettability (toward electrolyte), surface roughness and porosity - affect bubble evolution. Pilot anodes, made with single source coke types varying in isotropy, were used to study bubble evolution by electrochemical methods. In order to retain bubbles during experiments, anodes were designed to have only horizontal surface area. Bubble formation and release were monitored at different current densities, and were tracked by measuring the oscillations in anode potential and series resistance. Anodes made from different cokes were found to have different bubble evolution properties, possibly due to variation in the density of nucleation sites at the surface of each anode and varying anode-electrolyte wettability.

The overwhelming hurdle in this quest is to develop a noble-metal-free, efficient, low overpotential water oxidation electrocatalyst exhibiting tremendous stability and to be obtained from earth-abundant materials. We show here unique copper-based water oxidation electrocatalyst derived from thin film Cu-colloidal nanoparticles and is highly efficient, robust for water oxidation. The catalyst advantageously exhibits nanobeads and nanorods type mixed morphological features with narrow size distribution. The onset for oxygen evolution reaction occurs at a small potential of 1.45 V-RHE (eta=220 mV) which is the lowest observed relative to other copper-based materials. The catalyst also maintains remarkable stability during long-term water electrolysis experiments. Moreover, the catalyst shown to exhibit a high electroactive area with a Tafel slope of 52 mV dec(1-,) high TOF of 0.81 s(1-) and mass activity of 87 mA mg(-1). Copper is an interesting material because it can also serve as CO2 reduction catalysts at the cathode side. The straightforwardly prepared, handy, and inexpensive Cu-based electrocatalytic system is a flexible catalyst for electrooxidation of water and for chemical energy conversion and is an attractive alternative to Pt, Ir, and Ru based electrocatalysts obtained from expensive resources and tedious methods.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000475111600001

Quantification of gas evolution in electrochemical precision ablation								Galvanotechnik				106	3			484	9						March 2015	2015	During the electrochemical manipulation (ECM) there are, besides the anodic metal dissolution, secondary reactions taking place. These involve, for example, the decomposition of water molecules, the so called electrolysis. The products of this reaction are hydrogen and oxygen. These gases are occurring in the electrolyte as gas bubbles. The gas bubbles are impacting the local conductivity of the electrolyte and therefore also the local current density. During the ECM manipulation the slit is flushed with fresh electrolyte material, which causes a gas bubble distribution in the flushing direction. Especially for the generation of precision and micro-geometries through PECM the gas volume must be considered in the layout of the ECMprocedure [1, 2]. This study investigates the gas development during the pulsed electrochemical manipulation (PECM). To do this, a device for capturing the generated gas volumes was conceived. This device enables the quantitative determination of the generated gas volume. It was implemented in a commercial PECM machine. The generated gas volumes were captured under PECM conditions using a selection of steel materials in various erosion experiments.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-4232			INSPEC:15478967

Herein, we report the preparation of an ethylenediamine interconnected triazine based porous organic polymer (EPOP) modified with Co2+(Co-EPOP) and Co nanoparticles (Co-EPOP-300,Co-EPOP-500andCo-EPOP-HT)viaanchoring under different conditions. The amine groups on the EPOP polymer were used as ligands and as stabilizers for Co(2+)and Co nanoparticles respectively. XRD and TEM analysis indicated that theCo-NPs covered a homogeneous polymer matrix. The electrocatalytic activities of Co2+/CoNP modified POPs were evaluated under standard OER and HER conditions and were compared with that ofCo-NPs without polymer support. Amongst the electrocatalysts, theCo-EPOP(Co(2+)anchored EPOP) sample exhibited bifunctional activity towards both the OER and HER with onset potentials of 1.638 and -0.173 V respectively. Further, theCo-EPOPcatalyst showed lower Tafel slope values compared to other catalysts. Both OER and HER performances are comparable with those of reported Co based nanocatalytic systems.									9	0	0	0	4	0	9			2398-4902			WOS:000544657200057

We found that low concentrations of EDC (0.25 %) increase the order of 2D crystals of PS II. Treatments with EDC concentrations higher than 0.5 % did not improve the order of 2D crystals but induced gross structural changes, which were correlated with a decrease in oxygen evolution activity. Structural changes due to cross-linking did not affect packing or symmetry of the 2D crystals, further supporting the conclusion that PS II has a monomeric nature in vivo.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0264-6021	1470-8728		WOS:A1996VN23800036	8912698

In this work, a novel method to fabricate nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon (NHPC) is reported, which is incorporated with Co nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The NHPC is prepared using a facile and scalable MgO-Co template method. Metal nitrate-glycine solution combustion synthesis, followed by a high temperature calcination, is used to prepare MgO-Co/N-doped carbon precursor. CNTs are formed by the in situ Co-catalytic growth during heat treatment; at the same time, localized graphitic layers are also formed around the Co nanoparticles. After acid washing, NHPC with hierarchical multipores and ultrafine Co nanoparticles is obtained. When applied as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst, the NHPC displays high catalytic activity not only in terms of onset potential and current density, but also superior durability and tolerance to methanol crossover in alkaline electrolyte. The remarkable ORR activity is originated from the cooperative effects of high specific surface area, hierarchical pore structure, ultrasmall Co nanocrystals, localized graphitic layers, CNTs, and N-doping.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			2196-7350			WOS:000412603100014

Prolonged battery operation often involves repeated phase transitions, buildup of mechanical stresses, and could provoke thermal spikes. Such sophisticated chemo-thermo-mechanical interplay can cause performance degradation through structural disintegration of the cathode active materials (CAMs). Herein, we systematically investigate the thermal decomposition, fracture, and oxygen evolution of chemically delithiated Li0.3Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA) particles upon heating from 25 degrees C to 450 degrees C using a number of advanced X-ray and electron probes. We observed a continuous reduction of the Ni oxidation state upon heating, as well as the release of oxygen from the NCA lattice that undergoes the thermally induced phase transformations. The release of oxygen also created numerous mesopores throughout the analyzed particles, which could significantly affect the chemical and mechanical properties of the electrode. In addition, intergranular and intragranular fracturing at elevated temperatures also contribute to the degradation of the NCA cathode under these conditions. Our investigation of the mechanical integrity at elevated temperatures provides a fundamental understanding of the thermally driven chemomechanical breakdown of the NCA cathode active materials.									34	1	0	0	0	0	35			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472219400020

Water electrolysis (WE) is the major technology for sustainable hydrogen production. Despite the use of renewable solar and wind power as sources of electricity, one of the main barriers for the widespread implementation of WE is the scarcity and high cost of platinum group metals (pgms) that are used to catalyse the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Hence, the critical pgm-based catalysts must be replaced with more sustainable alternatives for WE technologies to become commercially viable. This critical review describes the state-of-the-art pgm-free materials used in the WE application, with a major focus on phosphides and borides. Several emerging classes of HER and OER catalysts are reviewed and detailed structure-property correlations are comprehensively summarised. The influence of the crystallographic and electronic structures, morphology and bulk and surface chemistry of the catalysts on the activity towards OER and HER is discussed.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2056-5135			WOS:000654244300006

This HOF material, namely HOF-Co, was synthesized based on very cheap raw materials. Crystallizing bimetallic HOFs of HOF-CoxFe1-x. on nickel foam (NF) can be also easily obtained via a step-by-step approach. In 1 M KOH, HOF-Co0.5Fe0.5 on the NF enables both excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, thus leading to highly effective electrocatalysis of water splitting with a cell voltage of just 1.63 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The vaule is comparable to the commercial Pt/C//IrO2 (1.59 V) and other established outstanding electrocatalysts. The mechanism, as evidenced by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, is due to a significant synergistic effect from the abundant hydrogen-bond structure between coordinated water molecules and SO42- ions that affords rich and accessible active sites, in conjunction with the bimetallic effect.									45	2	0	0	3	0	44			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000487570000044

These materials are commonly prepared via magnesiothermic reduction of silica precursors due to the ease, scalability, and tunability of this reaction. In this work, we investigate how the conditions of magnesiothermic reduction (i.e. reaction temperature and time) influence the performance of mp-Si for photocatalytic H-2 generation. The mp-Si NPs were prepared using either the conventional single temperature heating method (650 degrees C for 3 or 6 h) or a two-temperature method in which the reaction is initially heated to 650 degrees C for 0.5 h, followed by a second step heating at 100 (mp-Si100), 200 (mp-Si200), or 300 degrees C (mp-Si300) for 6 h. Of these, mp-Si300 was the best performing photocatalyst and showed the highest H-2 evolution rate (4437 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) Si). Our results suggest that crystallinity has a profound effect on the performance of mp-Si photocatalysts. Additionally, high amounts of oxygen and particle sintering lower H-2 evolution rates by introducing defect states or grain boundaries. It was also discovered that aging mp-Si NPs under ambient conditions result in continued surface oxidation which deleteriously affects its photocatalytic performance.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000614867500050	33496714

The prepared electrodes were firstly physically characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Afterwards, electrochemical characterizations were performed by voltammetric (cyclic and linear) methods in different electrolyte media (KOH and HClO4). It is shown that the prepared electrodes are composed by both PtOy(platinum and platinum oxide) and IrO2 (iridium dioxide). For xPtOy-(100-x)IrO2 electrodes having higher content of IrO2, more surface cracks and pores are formed, defining a higher surface area with more active sites. Higher surface area due to presence of both PtOy and IrO2, is for xPtOy-(100x)IrO2 electrodes in 1 M KOH solution confirmed by cyclic voltammetry at potentials of the oxide layer region. For all prepared electrodes, voltammetric charges were found higher than for PtOy, while the highest voltammetric charge is observed for the mixed 40PtOy-60IrO2 (x = 40) electrode. The Tafel slopes for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in either basic (0.1 M KOH) or acid (0.1 M HClO4) media were determined from measured linear voltammograms corrected for the ohmic drop. The values of Tafel slopes for OER at PtOy, 90PtOy-10IrO2 and IrO2 in basic medium are 122, 55 and 40 mV dec(-1), respectively. For other mixed electrodes, Tafel slopes of 40 mV dec(-1) were obtained. Although proceeding by different OER mechanism, similar values of Tafel slopes were obtained in acid medium, i.e., Tafel slopes of 120. 60 and 39 mV dec(-1) were obtained for PtOy, 90PtOy-10IrO2 and IrO2, and 40 mV dec(-1) for other mixed electrodes. The analysis of Tafel slope values showed that OER is more rapid on coupled mixed electrodes than on pure PtOy. For mixed xPtOy-(100-x)IrO2 electrodes, OER is more rapid when the molar percent of PtOy meets the following condition: 0 < x <= 80. This study also showed that the mixed coupled electrodes are more electrocatalytically active for OER than either PtOy or IrO2 in these two media.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1847-9286			WOS:000582618900004

Herein, we proposed a distinctive ORC process: the forward potential passed through the oxidation of Au and reached the oxygen evolution reaction, and once the potential briefly remained at the vertex, the various reverse rates were employed to control the reduction state. The created hybrid Au-AuOx possessed electromagnetic and chemical enhancements concurrently, wherein the rough surface provided the strong local electromagnetic fields and significant interaction between AuOx and molecule to improve the charge transfer. The synergistic effects significantly amplified the intensity of Raman signal with an enhancement factor of 5.5 x 10(6) under the optimal conditions. Furthermore, the prepared SERS substrate can simultaneously identify and quantify the mixed edible pigments, Brilliant Blue FCF and Indigo Carmine, individually. This result suggested that the development of SERS sensor based on the proposed SERS-activated methodology is feasible and reliable.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2470-1343			WOS:000454244600021	31458290

We synthesized nanoparticulate electrocatalysts consisting of cobalt-doped goethite-type iron oxyhydroxide (alpha-FeOOH) with controlled Co/Fe ratios [CoxFe1-xOOH (x <= 0.20)] based on our own wet process. A Co0.20Fe0.80OOH-coated glassy carbon electrode generated a current density (j) of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential (eta) as small as 383 mV (1.61 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode) in an alkaline electrolyte, with a small Tafel slope of 40 mV dec(-1) and excellent durability, whereas pure a-FeOOH required eta = 580 mV to reach the same current density. This can be ascribed to the effect of Co doping, which resulted in an increase in electrochemically active surface area and a decrease in charge-transfer resistance. The content of cobalt, a scarce resource, in the catalyst is much smaller than those in most of the other Fe-based catalysts reported so far.

The intrinsic inertness of N-2 molecule and competition of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are the primary challenges for NRR. Although transition metal-based electrocatalysts can solve the kinetic limitation of N.N activation through the p-back-donation process, the d-orbital electrons of transition metal atoms facilitate the formation of a metal-H bond, boosting the undesirable HER. Carbon-based materials featuring tunable electronic structures and facile formation of defects have significantly improved electrocatalytic NRR activity in the past few years. Therefore, a review on state-of-the-art carbon-based catalysts for NRR is timely to provide a summary of recent developments in theoretical and experimental aspects. In this review, various defect engineering strategies for the evolution of the desired carbon-based electrocatalysts are comprehensively summarized. The intrinsic relationships between the structures of the defective carbon materials and NRR performance are also discussed in detail. This review aims to stimulate greater interests for developing more efficient electrocatalysts for NRR in the future.									11	1	0	0	0	0	12			2168-0485			WOS:000662271200001

Here, an efficient simultaneous etching-doping sedimentation equilibrium (EDSE) strategy is proposed to design and prepare hollow Rh-doped CoFe-layered double hydroxides for overall water splitting. The elaborate electrocatalyst with optimized composition and typical hollow structure accelerates the electrochemical reactions, which can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at an overpotential of 28 mV (600 mA cm(-2)at 188 mV) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 100 mA cm(-2)at 245 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The cell voltage for overall water splitting of the electrolyzer assembled by this electrocatalyst is only 1.46 V, a value far lower than that of commercial electrolyzer constructed by Pt/C and RuO(2)and most reported bifunctional electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the existence of Fe vacancies introduced by Rh doping and the typical hollow structure are demonstrated to optimize the entire HER and OER processes. EDSE associates doping with template-directed hollow structures and paves a new avenue for developing bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. It is also believed to be practical in other catalysis fields as well.									76	2	0	0	3	0	76			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000546168400001

Herein, well-dispersed and highly alloyed Pt-Co bimetallic nanoparticles supported on commercial carbon black have been synthesized by means of a facile one-pot solvothermal approach without using any bulky capping agents. The best performing Pt1.2Co/C, with an average particle size of 4.7 +/- 0.8 nm, has a large electrochemically active surface area of 64.30 m(2) g(-1), which is comparable to that of 66.73 m(2) g(-1) of commercial Pt/C and larger than that of other synthesized catalysts. The as-synthesized Pt1.2Co/C shows about 3 times enhanced mass activity and specific activity for methanol oxidation reaction compared to commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). Meanwhile, the electrocatalytic performance of Pt1.2Co/C for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acid media is also superior to commercial Pt/C and the overpotential is only 33.8 mV when the current density reaches 70 mA cm(-2). This work demonstrates that the developed strategy provides a facile platform for the synthesis of high-performance, low-cost and robust catalysts in practical catalysis, and energy storage and conversion.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000531211600018

In particular, the catalytic performance of g-C3N4 can be easily modulated by modifying morphology, doping, and copolymerization. Simultaneous optimization, however, has little been achieved. Herein, a facile one-pot strategy is developed to synthesize porous B-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets by using H3BO3 and urea as the precursor during thermal polymerization. The resultant B-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets retain the original framework of bulk g-C3N4, while induce prominently enhanced visible light harvesting and narrowing band gap by 0.32 eV compared to pure g-C3N4. Moreover, the adsorption capacity and photodegradation kinetics of methylene blue (MB) under visible light irradiation over B-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets can be improved by 20.5 and 17 times, respectively. The synthesized porous B-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets also exhibit higher activities than pure g-C3N4 as bifunctional electrocatalyst for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The enhanced catalyst performance of porous B-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets stems from the strong synergistic effect originating from the larger exposed active sites generated by the exfoliation of g-C3N4 into nanosheets and the porous structure, as well as the better conductivity owing to B-doping. This work provides a simple, effective, and robust method for the synthesis of g-C3N4-based nanomaterial with superior properties to meet the needs of various applications.

The composites were fully analyzed by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, and BET and so on. The electrochemical explorations (OER and HER) show that the overpotential of Co@NC-6h-3 at the current density 10 mA cm(-2) is the lower the commercial RuO2 catalyst (350 mA for 3; 380 mA for RuO2). The Tafel slopes of the composite material are 63 mV dec(-1), which is comparable to the RuO2 (58 mV dec(-1)). The HER exploration show that the overpotential are 220 mv for 3, and the Tafel slopes of 3 is 119 mV dec(-1) for 3. The explorations reveals that the composites Co@NC-6h-3 reveals good and stable catalytic performances for HER and OER, providing us with an efficient method to obtain the electrocatalysts via the pyrolysis of MOFs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000760804000004

In this work, we reported a facile and universal strategy toward developing a suite of bimetallic heterostructures, representing as highly efficient catalysts of the HER/OER process. By hybridizing transition-metal sulfides (CoS2, NiS2, FeS2, and CuS) with highly active MoS2 nanosheets, all heterostructural catalysts achieved largely improved bifunctional activity originating from the special interfacial interaction as well as synergetic catalytic effects. As a result, the optimal CoS2@MoS2/CC and NiS2@MoS2/CC heterostructures displayed the lowest overpotentials at 10 mA cm(-2), which only required 31 and 225 mV for HER/OER, respectively. After assembling for water splitting, the electrolyzer exhibited a very small cell voltage of 1.58 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2). This result is obviously better than a lot of reported non-precious metal catalysts. Our strategy experimentally confirms the feasibility of the heterostructure to enhance the bifunctional performance of advanced electrocatalysts for electrochemical water splitting.									30	0	0	0	0	0	30			2168-0485			WOS:000636758600026

Herein, a facile efficient pyrolysis approach was developed to prepare graphene-encapsulated Co nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in porous nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon nanosheets (Co@G/N-GCNs), in which g-C3N4 served as C and N sources, and cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) as the Co- and N-sources. The as-obtained catalyst exhibited exceptional ORR activity (E-1/2 = 0.86 V vs. RHE), good durability (12 mV negative shift of E-1/2 after 2000 cycles), and strong methanol resistance, surpassing those of commercial Pt/C catalyst in alkaline conditions. The pyrolysis temperature and entrapped contents of metal NPs had critical impacts on the ORR features. This work offers a feasible strategy for designing low-cost non-noble-metal catalysts for energy storage and conversion. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Electrochemical characterization for the oxygen reduction reaction								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				154	4			A381	A388		10.1149/1.2454366				2007	2007	Composite film electrodes containing mechanically mixed Co3O4 or CuCo2O4 particles, carbon-black Vulcan XC-72R, and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP) were formed on the glassy carbon disk surface of a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) and studied for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in O-2-saturated 1 M KOH solution. The highest current densities were observed with CuCo2O4 and they increased with the oxide content in the film, hence clearly demonstrating the excellent intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of CuCo2O4 for this reaction. The results also showed that CuCo2O4 is a better electrocatalyst than Co3O4 with higher current densities and a greater number of electrons exchanged per O-2 molecule. It was found that the copper-cobalt spinel oxide component favors a total of 4e(-) in the oxygen reduction process. At the CuCo2O4-based composite electrode, direct reduction of O-2 into OH- ions (rate constant k(1)) and the peroxide pathway (formation of HO2- ions and their reduction into OH- ions, rate constants k(2) and k(3)) are proceeding in parallel, with a k(1)/k(2) ratio that increases with the overpotential when the oxide content is greater than 23.5%. At the Co3O4-based composite electrode, k(1) is very weak with a k(1)/k(2) ratio that decreases rapidly with the overpotential.									54	1	0	0	1	0	54			0013-4651			WOS:000244792200021

Powders were characterized by XRD, PL, DRS, BET. The effects of the doping concentration of V5+ to the photocatalytic activity of nano rutile TiO2 was investigated using Fe3+ as electron acceptor and at pH = 2.0 under 365 nm UV irradiation. The relationship between the DRS, PL spectra and the photaocatalytic activity was also discussed. Results show that with appropriate concentration, V5+ dopes into nano rutile TiO2 lattice without causing change in nano rutile TiO2 crystal structure. Therefore, surface oxygen vacancies and the donor energy level near the bottom of the conduction band lead to easier departure of photoinduced electrons from holes to achieve stronger photocatalytic activity. The highest photocatalytic oxygen evolution and PL Spectra intensity were achieved with the O-2 evolution speed of 160 umol.L-1.h(-1) when the V5+ concentration was 1.0 mol%, which demonstrated certain relationship between photoluminescence performance affected by V5+ concentration and the photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic oxidation activity also corresponds to the concentration of Fe3+.					9th Chinese International Nanoscience and Technology Symposium9th Chinese International Nanoscience and Technology Symposium	NOV 15-19, 2010NOV 15-19, 2010		Xian, PEOPLES R CHINAXian, PEOPLES R CHINA	6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1058-4587	1607-8489		WOS:000297010500010

Here, an advanced Co(OH)(2) electrocatalyst with ultralow iridium (Ir) doping is developed to enable outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties; that is, in a 1 M KOH medium, an overpotential of only 262 mV is required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a small Tafel slope of 66.9 mV dec(-1) is achieved, which is markedly superior to that of the commercial IrO2 catalyst (301 mV@10 mA cm(-2); 66.9 mV dec(-1)). Through the combination of experimental data and a mechanism study, it is disclosed that the high intrinsic OER activity results from the synergistic electron coupling of oxidized Ir and Co(OH)(2), which significantly moderate the adsorption energy of the intermediates. Moreover, we have also synthesized Ru-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets and demonstrated the universal syntheses of Ir-doped CoM (M = Ni, Fe, Mn, and Zn) layered double hydroxides (LDHs).									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000739582800001	34989735

Despite recent advances, it remains a challenge to fabricate 2D/0D heterostructures with clean and accessible surfaces, which is highly desirable for the diversity of catalytic, sensing, and energy storage applications. Herein, we report a generalized methodology that enables the facile assembly of sandwich-like 0D/2D/0D heterostructures with facilitated mass-transport channels and exposed surface active sites. A ligand-exchange strategy with HBF4 is employed to strip off the surface-coating ligands of colloidal NPs, rendering them positively charged and dispersible in polar solvents. This allows subsequent electrostatic assembly of NPs with oppositely charged 2D nanosheets to afford sandwich-like 0D/2D/0D heterostructures. The barely covered surfaces and the advantageous architectures of such sandwich-like 0D/2D/0D heterostructures induce the desired synergistic effect, making them particularly suitable for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. We demonstrate this by employing MXene/NiFe2O4 and MXene/Fe3O4 heterostructures for high-performance electrocatalytic oxygen evolution and supercapacitors, respectively.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000644310800007

In response, the coupled hierarchical Ni/Fe-based MOF nanosheet arrays with embedded metal sulfide nanoclusters onto nickel foam skeleton(denoted as Fe-Ni_3S_2 @NiFe-MOF/NF)are fabricated, in which the Fe-Ni_3S_2 clusters could effectively restrain the aggregation of the layer metal-organic frameworks(MOF)nanosheets and adjust the local electronic structures of MOFs nanosheets. Benefiting from the rapid charge transfer and the exposure of abundant active sites, the well-designed Fe-Ni_3S_2@NiFe-MOF/NF displays excellent oxygen evolution reaction(OER)and hydrogen evolution reaction(HER)performance. More importantly, when equipped in the alkaline water electrolyzer, the Fe-Ni_3S_2@NiFe-MOF/NF enables the system with a mere 1.6 V for achieving the current density of 10 mA cm~(-2).

All the synthesized anisotropic gold nanoparticles (A(n)GNPs) and especially the AuNP 75 exhibit outstanding catalytic activities (in terms of both overpotential and turnover frequency) toward HER in different pH media compared to that of normal spherical-shaped gold nanoparticles (e.g., TSC-capped 25 nm AuNPsphS) in similar physical conditions. Further, the theoretical calculation based on density functional theory (DFT) nicely corroborates with the experimental findings and discloses the effective contribution of grain-boundaries toward the free energy of hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H*)) and the position of the d-band center, which play a crucial role in their HER activities.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2574-0962			WOS:000644737800007

RuO2-TiO2 coatings doped with Sn, Ta and Ir, or La were prepared by thermal decomposition. The results indicate that good bonding between Al and Ti4O7 was obtained by plasma spraying. The dopants affected the electrochemical performance by changing the surface morphology of the active coatings. The addition of Sn not only improved the electrocatalytic activity in the chlorine evolution reaction but also inhibited the electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction. The electric potential distribution on the surface of the electrode materials with an Al-based coating and a Ti4O7 ceramic interlayer was more uniform than that of a Ti/ RuO2-TiO2 anode. The results of electrowinning tests revealed that an Al/Ti4O2/RuO2-TiO2-SnO2 anode exhibited the best anodic performance with lower energy consumption, a longer accelerated lifetime, more deposition of Co as a product, and greater efficiency.

The present work follows the evolution of the main chemical components in a cerium and in a ferroin catalysed full BZ system from the start until the end of the oscillatory regime in a batch reactor. While recording the potential oscillations of a bromide selective electrode we measured from time to time the concentration of the following components: malonic and bromomalonic acids and bromate as main components; malonyl malonate, ethanetetracarboxylic and bromoethenetricarboxylic acids which are recombination products of organic free radicals; oxidized intermediates: tartronic, oxalic (OA) and mesoxalic (MOA) acids, and brominated products: dibromoacetic and tribromoacetic acids. Recombination products are generated in the intervals when the autocatalytic reaction is "switched off". In the course of the autocatalytic periods, however, the organic radicals react with the inorganic bromine dioxide radical mainly which leads to the formation of MOA and OA. Due to a very fast Ce4+-MOA reaction, MOA can be detected in the ferroin catalysed BZ system only. Our model calculations deal exclusively with the cerium catalysed system. The suggested new Marburg-Budapest-Missoula (MBM) model includes both negative feedback loops (bromous acid-bromide ion Oregonator type and bromine dioxide-organic free radicals Radicalator type feedback) and the recently discovered radical-radical recombination reactions. Comparison of the experimental data with the model calculations shows a good qualitative agreement but some open problems still remain. To overcome these problems oxygen atom transfer and other redox reactions are proposed.

However, bubble dynamics and its influence on gas-evolving electrode systems remain ambiguous. Detailed information on the local transport process between different phases and the underlying mechanism are required for the full understanding of two-phase flow evolution and distribution. Here, we construct a three-electrode water splitting reaction system to study the bubble dynamics and system efficiency of titanium electrodes with different morphologies. The dynamics of a gas bubble at an electrode with a plate and 100-mesh, 150-mesh, and 300-mesh structures is systematically investigated with respect to applied voltage conditions. Parameters and underlying mechanisms that influence the two-phase flow evolution and electrochemical reaction performance are carefully discussed. Finally, the underlying dynamic force balance on the gas bubble is analyzed to illustrate the mechanism and experimental observations. Our study provides insights in gas-evolving electrocatalysis and offers opportunities for the design and fabrication of highperformance electrocatalytic reactors.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000703995900021	34521191	
J	Sarna, MJ; Ergma, E; Gerskevits, J								The recurrent nova U Scorpii - Evolutionary consideration								ACTA ASTRONOMICA				56	1			65	81						2006	2006	We perform evolutionary calculations of binary stars to find progenitors of systems with parameters similar to the recurrent nova U Sco. We show that a U Sco-type system may be formed starting with an initial binary system which has a low-mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf as an accretor. Since the evolutionary stage of the secondary is not well known, we calculate sequences with hydrogen-rich and helium-rich secondaries. The evolution of the binary may be divided into several observable stages as: classical nova, super soft X-ray source with stable hydrogen shell burning, or strong wind phase. It culminates in the formation of a massive white dwarf near the Chandrasekhar mass limit. We follow the chemical evolution of the secondary as well as of the matter lost from the system, and we show that observed C-12/C-13 and N/C ratios may give some information about the nature of the binary.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0001-5237			WOS:000237014800003

For the water-splitting reaction to happen on TiO2-terminated surfaces, it is necessary to have two neighboring O vacancies acting as active sites that host two adsorbing water molecules. However, eventual dissociation of O-H bonds is possible only in the presence of an additional nearest-neighbor O vacancy. Unfortunately, this necessary third vacancy inhibits the formation of molecular hydrogen by trapping the dissociated H atoms on TiO2 terminated surfaces. Formation of up to three O vacancies is energetically less costly on both terminations of PbTiO3 (001) surfaces compared with those on TiO2; the presence of Pb leads to weaker O bonds over these surfaces. Molecular hydrogen formation is more favorable on the PbO-terminated surface of PbTiO3, requiring only two neighboring oxygen vacancies. However, the hydrogen molecule is retained near the surface by weak van der Waals forces. Our study indicates two barriers leading to low productivity of direct water-splitting processes. First and foremost, there is an entropic barrier imposed by the requirement of at least two nearest-neighbor O vacancies, sterically hindering the process. Furthermore, there are also enthalpic barriers of formation on TiO2-terminated surfaces or removal of H-2 molecules from the PbO-terminated surface. The requirement dictating three nearest-neighbor oxygen vacancies for hydrogen evolution is also consistent with the chemical intuition: The nearest neighbor of the formed hydrogen should be reduced enough to inhibit spontaneous oxidation under ambient conditions.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000614317500026

Obtaining the electronic structure information on co-catalyst is a crucial step toward gaining a mechanistic understanding of the water oxidation reaction of this catalyst. In the present work, we show that the PEC performance of BiVO4 photoanodes can be enhanced by the deposition of a nickel borate co-catalyst layer (NiB,). We investigate the electronic structure of the NiB, by in situ soft and hard X-ray absorption spectroscopies (XAS) at the Ni L- and K-edges as well as at the O K-edge under different potential and illumination conditions. We discuss the involvement of the active oxygen species related to the hybridized O 2p Ni 3dt(2g) orbitals in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and further correlate the changes at the O K-edge with that of at the Ni L-edge. In situ soft XAS measurements show that Ni in the electrodeposited amorphous NiBi film is readily oxidized to higher oxidation states. This in situ soft XAS study offers the first direct observation of Ni4+ formation during solar water oxidation. Cyclic voltammetry-XAS (CV-XAS) results support that the formation of Ni4+ is prior to the formation of partly electron deficient oxygen sites. This study also provides understanding about the physical and chemical changes under potential and light illumination and represents a significant step toward obtaining a mechanistic understanding of the co-catalyst/semiconductor system.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2574-0962			WOS:000473116600023

However, measurements of the "surface" electrochemical potential during operation are not generally possible using conventional electrochemical techniques, which measure/control the potential of a conducting electrode substrate. Here we show that the nanoscale conducting tip of an atomic force microscope cantilever can sense the surface electrochemical potential of electrocatalysts in operando. To demonstrate utility, we measure the potential-dependent and thickness-dependent electronic properties of cobalt (oxy) hydroxide phosphate (CoPi). We then show that CoPi, when deposited on illuminated haematite (alpha-Fe2O3) photoelectrodes, acts as both a hole collector and an oxygen evolution catalyst. We demonstrate the versatility of the technique by comparing surface potentials of CoPi-decorated planar and mesoporous haematite and discuss viability for broader application in the study of electrochemical phenomena.									112	5	0	0	9	0	112			2058-7546			WOS:000419976100013

OER, which takes place at the anode, is accepted as a major obstacle for commercialization due to its sluggish kinetics. In this study, a two-step synthesis method, such as a hydrothermal process followed by the annealing of the reactants in an Ar-filled Swagelok cell, is briefly described to obtain a cubic type of Co3O4 core and CoP shell. As a result of synergy, Co3O4 vertical bar CoP demonstrates an onset overpotential of 280 mV and reaches a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 320 mV in an alkaline medium (pH = 13.5). The electronic property of the heterojunction is verified by the Tauc plot and valence band XPS. The band structure indicates that Co3O4 vertical bar CoP exhibits a more metallic character than pristine Co3O4 due to the fact that the charge transfer process is faster. Further, the introduction of CoP significantly modifies the redox processes of Co3O4, which we examined with the help of large amplitude alternating current voltammetry (LA-ACV). The mechanistic study suggests that "catalytic performance is directly related to the peak-to-peak current density" of the redox process of the combined catalyst and reactant.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2574-0970		WOS:000828417200001

The gel-like films prepared from aqueous solutions of the precursor salts Sn(OH)(2)(CH3COO)(2-x)Cl-x and H2IrCl6 on titanium metal support were heated in an atmosphere containing 20% O-2 and 80% Ar up to 600 degrees C.The thermal decomposition reactions practically take place in two separate temperature ranges from ambient to about 250 degrees C and between 300 and 600 degrees C. In the low temperature range the liberation of solution components and - to a limited extent - an oxidative cracking reaction of the acetate ligand takes place catalyzed by the noble metal. In the high temperature range the evolution of chlorine as well as the decomposition of surface species formed (carbonyls, carboxylates, carbonates) can be observed. The acetate ligand shows extreme high stability and is decomposed in the 400-550 degrees C range, only.Since the formation and decomposition of the organic surface species can significantly influence the morphology (and thus the electrochemical properties) of the films, the complete understanding of the film evolution process is indispensable to optimize the experimental conditions of electrode preparation.

Herein, FeNi nanoalloys-layered porous N-doped carbon nanosheets (FeNi-NCS) were large-scale synthesized by simple formamide pyrolysis method. The framework of FeNi-NCS was a micro-flowerlike structure composed of mesoporous N-doped carbon nanosheets as petals, on which FeNi nanoalloy particles were uniformly dispersed. Benefiting from the unique N doping electronic modification, hierarchically porous structure, and the synergetic effect between Fe and Ni, the FeNi-NCS exhibited high intrinsic activity and robust structure which can improve catalytic performance significantly. By tuning the pyrolysis temperature and the molar ratio of Fe and Ni, the Fe1Ni1-NCS-900 displayed optimal activity and stability for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and required 261 and 310 mV overpotential to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) respectively. This work presented a simple and effective way to fabricate high-performance and stable non-noble metal electrocatalysts for water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2365-6549			WOS:000821933900001

This Cu-CoP NRAs/CC electrode shows a good HER performance with an overpotential of 44 mV to achieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4. To get the same current density, it requires overpotentials of 81 mV in 1.0 M KOH and 137 mV in 1.0 M PBS, respectively. It also maintains a stable catalytic activity under different pH condition for 40 h. Such superior HER performance could be attributed to the strong heteroatomic interactions prompted lots of lattice distortions and defects, further provided many effective reactive sites on the nanorods. Such Cu-CoP NRAs/CC provides us highly efficient materials for water-splitting devices in industrial hydrogen production.									47	2	0	0	0	0	47			2574-0962			WOS:000458706400038

Time evolutions of vinoxy, HCO, and H2CO were pursued. The fraction of vinoxy production in the propylene and 1-butene reactions at 30 mTorr was found to be 0.29 +/- 0.15 and 0.37 +/- 0.15, respectively. The fractions seemed to increase with the decrease in pressure, by comparing the present results with those of several previous researchers. Therefore, at least some part of the vinoxy production fraction is pressure dependent. The reaction scheme explaining the pressure-dependent part is suggested as follows. Initially, a triplet biradical is produced through O(3P) attack to the terminal carbon atom of the C=C double bond, which is then converted to a singlet biradical. Subsequently, a hydrogen atom migrates and then the C-C bond adjacent to the original C=C double bond dissociates to yield the vinoxy and corresponding alkyl radicals. Thus, some part of the vinoxy radical is produced via a quite different mechanism from the case of ethylene reaction, where it is produced via a direct substitution channel on a triplet surface.									39	1	0	0	1	0	40			0022-3654			WOS:A1991EW47800038

Replacement of PhC(O)N(Me)H in the above reaction sequence with the more sterically congested amide PhC(O)N(Ph)H results in the formation of the amidoalane PhC(O)N(Ph)AlMe(2), 9, which in turn affords the lithium aluminate [PhC(O)N(Ph)Al(Me)(2)Bu(t)]Li, 10, and upon treatment of this with oxygen, the 70:30 11a:11b mixture [PhC(O)N(Ph)Al(Me)(OR)R']Li, 11 (R=Bu(t), R'=Me, 11a; R'=Bu(t), R=Me, 11b). Both 10 and 11 are dimeric in the solid state, suggesting that the selective oxygenation process, and therefore the character of the oxygenated product, is templated by the structure of the precursor aluminate complex. Calculations are presented which corroborate the competitive nature of the inclusion of oxygen atoms into Al-Me and Al-Bu(t) groups in species of the type reported here.									15	1	0	0	1	0	15			1472-7773			WOS:000165664000012

Using a noninvasive fluorometry technique to monitor sequential turnover of the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center as a function of O-2 pressures, we showed that none of the reactions of water oxidation are affected by elevated O-2 pressures up to 50-fold greater than atmospheric conditions. Thus, the terminal step of O-2 release from the water oxidation complex (S-4 -> S-0 + O-2 + nH(+)) is not reversible in whole cells, leaves, or isolated thylakoid membranes containing PSII, in contrast to reports using detergent-extracted PSII complexes. This implies that there is no thermodynamically accessible intermediate that can be populated by preventing or reversing the O-2 release step with O-2 at atmospheric pressure. To assess the sensitivity of PSII charge recombination to O-2 pressure, we quantitatively modeled the consequences of two putative perturbations to the catalytic cycle of water oxidation within the framework of the Kok model. On the basis of the breadth of oxygenic phototrophs examined in this study, we conclude that O-2 accumulation in cells or the atmosphere does not suppress photosynthetic productivity through the reversal of water oxidation in contemporary phototrophs and would have been unlikely to influence the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.									31	0	0	0	26	0	31			0006-2960			WOS:000263226400025	19166323

Dissolution of stable binary metal oxides in a DES followed by a heat treatment yields phase-pure vanadates. According to in situ powder X-ray diffraction, ternary phases (alpha-Zn2V2O7 and beta-Cu2-xV2O7, x similar to 0.27) are intermediates in the reaction pathway taken. Identifying a polymorphic phase transformation temperature for CuV2O6 as well as the narrow temperature range between formation and decomposition for both metavanadates allows for tackling the challenge of the synthesis of these materials. The oxygen vacancy introduced by the DES route is accompanied by the formation of reduced V4+ and Cu+ in the oxide matrix, based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These oxygen vacancies modify the vibrational modes in the corresponding Raman spectra and are also responsible for broad optical absorptions in the 1.8-1.1 eV range. The optical band gaps of the materials are found at 1.8 eV (CuV2O6) and 2.2 eV (ZnV2O6), approximately 0.1-0.3 eV below the values reported in the literature. The reduced band gaps and sub-band gap photon absorption are key features of the oxygen-deficient metavanadates. Surface photovoltage spectroscopy reveals that all the synthesized vanadates are n-type materials with electrons as the majority charge carriers, and photoelectrochemical measurements confirm photoanodic currents for methanol oxidation. These results provide insight into the synthesis and structure-property relationship of the metavanadates for their potential use as photoanodes.									11	0	0	0	0	0	10			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000629032600014

The MoOxSy is conformally grown on the Si-MW surface through photo-assisted cyclic voltammetric (CV) deposition. By adjusting the cycle numbers of the CV deposition, Si-MW array electrodes with different MoOxSy catalyst loadings (Si-MWs@MoOxSy) have been obtained and comprehensively characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopies. The photoelectrochemical performance of the Si-MWs@MoOxSy cathodes toward water reduction is investigated and compared with that of platinum nanoparticle decorated Si-MW array electrodes (Si-MWs@PtNPs). An optimized Si-MWs@MoOxSy photocathode is found to exhibit activity comparable to that of the Si-MWs@PtNPs one, with a much better stability in acidic medium. In neutral electrolyte, Si-MWs@MoOxSy outperforms Si-MWs@PtNPs in terms of both activity and stability. Given the low materials cost, easy and well-established electrode fabrication procedure, and high demonstrated photoelectrochemical performance, the Si-MWs@MoOxSy arrays reported here hold substantial promise for use as low-cost and efficient photocathodes for water reduction.

Highly active, low-cost, and stable electrocatalysts are crucial for producing hydrogen through water electrolysis, and the development of them is an appealing but challenging task. Herein, MOFs-derived ZnxCo1-xMoS3 microboxes were successfully fabricated by a facile and general method. Water-soluble [(CH3)(2)NH2][M(HCOO)(3)] precursors reacted with a (NH4)(2)MoS4 water solution quickly to generate insoluble precipitates and, through subsequent annealing treatment, finally generated ZnxCo1-xMoS3 microboxes. Benefiting from the synergism of Zn-Co-Mo-S, the hollow cubic structure, and the incorporation of Zn and Co atoms, the Zn1/3Co2/3MoS3 exhibits superior HER performance in acidic media, with a low overpotential of 160 mV and a small Tafel slope of 85 mV dec(-1), as well as excellent durability. This general strategy can also be applied to fabricate other hollow molybdenum-based sulfides and MOFs-derived materials.									7	2	0	0	0	0	8			2168-0485			WOS:000470331800010

Solution-processed GaSe nanoflake-based films for photoelectrochemical water splitting and photoelectrochemical-type photodetectors [arXiv]								arXiv								33 pp.	33 pp.						21 April 2020	2020	Gallium selenide (GaSe) is a layered compound, which has been exploited in nonlinear optical applications and photodetectors due to its anisotropic structure and pseudo-direct optical gap. Theoretical studies predicted that its two-dimensional (2D) form is a potential photocatalyst for water splitting reactions. Herein, we first report the photoelectrochemical (PEC) characterization of GaSe nanoflakes (single-/few-layer flakes), produced via liquid phase exfoliation, for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in both acidic and alkaline media. In 0.5 M H2SO4, the GaSe photoelectrodes display the best PEC performance, i.e. a ratiometric power-saved metric for HER (Phisaved,HER) of 0.09% and a ratiometric power-saved metric for OER (Phisaved,OER) of 0.25%. When used as PEC-type photodetectors, GaSe photoelectrodes show a responsivity of ~0.16 A W-1 upon 455 nm illumination at light intensity of 63.5 uW cm-2 and applied potential of -0.3 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The stability analysis of the GaSe photodetectors evidences a durable operation over tens of cathodic linear sweep voltammetry scans in 0.5 M H2SO4 for HER. Vice-versa, degradation effects have been observed in both alkaline and anodic operation due to highly oxidizing environment and O2-induced (photo-)oxidation effects. Our results provide new insight into PEC properties of GaSe nanoflakes for their exploitation in photoelectrocatalysis, PEC-type photodetectors and (bio)sensors.

Herein, metal-organic framework (MOF) materials are grown in situ on the surface of carbon cloth (CC) at 25 °C, and quickly "interspersed" by cobalt-boron (Co-B) via electroless plating for 30min to obtain a highly efficient and stable CoB@MOF@CC self-supporting electrode. Owing to the large specific surface area, abundant active sites, and porous structure, the MOF-based CC modified by bamboo leaf-like ultrathin CoB has remarkable electrochemical catalysis efficiency. The CoB@MOF@CC electrode exhibits excellent performance during the hydrogen evolution reaction (eta10 = 57mV, eta500 = 266mV) and oxygen evolution reaction (eta10 = 209mV, eta500 = 423mV) in alkaline simulated seawater, and is durable for 2500h at 500mA cm-2 . The OWS performance is obviously enhanced by employing the prepared electrode, which only requires 1.49V to achieve 10mA cm-2 and is durable for over 360h at industrial-grade current densities in alkaline high-salt, real seawater, rainwater, and urea electrolytes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1613-6829		MEDLINE:36287089	36287089

Simple one-step design and preparation of BILs-based porous carbonbased materials remains a challenge. Our demonstration here was to use BIL as an important precursor for synthesizing porous carbon-coated CoP nanocrystals by facile one-pot carbonization process. The as-prepared CoP@NPC-900 has a specific surface area of 979.67 m(2) g(-1) without activator and simultaneously exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with a low overpotential of 181 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and small Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(-1) in acid solution. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate lower adsorption free energy and rapid electron transfer between CoP nanocrystals and N, P co-doped porous carbon (NPC) are key factors of improving the HER performance. Our research opens up a new use of BILs, as well as provides a facile strategy to promote practical application of transition metal phosphides for HER.[GRAPHICS].									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000696786900003

Electronically conducting materials can be coated by such gels during aqueous electrolysis, when an electrochemical reaction generates a local pH decrease at the electrode surface. In this work, electro-precipitation of different TOCN gels has been performed on oxygen evolving anodes. We demonstrate that TOCN hydrogels can be electrochemically coated on the surface of any conductive material with even complex 3D shape. Further, not only TOCN but also micro- or nanosized particles containing TOCN composites can be coated on the electrode surface, and coatings containing multiple layers of different composites can be also produced. We demonstrate that this simple and facile electrocoating technique can be subject to various applications, such as coatings making electrodes selective for the hydrogen evolution reaction, as well as a new eco-friendly aqueous-based synthesis of Li-ion battery electrodes.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2168-0485			WOS:000503330400011

By optimizing the amount of the added SnO2, the total voltammetric charge for Ru0 45Sn0 55O2 prepared at 500 degrees C has been increased by one fold. Improvement in true electrocatalytic activity of the oxide anode for oxygen evolution has been confirmed in sulfuric acid solutions. Electrochemical characterizations and microstructure analyses reveal that the added SnO2 retards/suppresses the spinodal decomposition of Ru0.45Sn0.55O2, which in turn results in an increased active surface area and volumetric percentage of the active phases of the oxide, and therefore, improves the electrochemical properties. This additive-induced retardation of spinodal decomposition can be interpreted from thermodynamics and kinetics of spinodal decomposition, providing a general approach to controlling the microstructures and properties of various complex oxides. Life time analyses showed that adding a small amount of SnO2 as the spinodal decomposition retarder does not degrade the predicted service life-time of the electrode.

J	Couves, J; Atkins, M; Hague, M; Sakakini, BH; Waugh, KC								The activity and selectivity of oxygen atoms adsorbed on a Ag/alpha-Al2O3 catalyst in ethene epoxidation								CATALYSIS LETTERS				99	1-2			45	53		10.1007/s10562-004-0775-3				JAN 2005	2005	The bonding of the oxygen species held on a Ag/alpha-Al2O3 catalyst has been studied by temperature programmed desorption and their reactivity in ethene epoxidation by temperature programmed reduction using ethene as the reductant. The Ag/alpha-Al2O3 catalyst was produced by the thermal decomposition of a Ag oxalate/alpha-Al2O3 precursor. Oxygen desorbs from this Ag/alpha-Al2O3 catalyst in two states, one (peak maximum temperature 520 K) having a desorption activation energy of 140 kJ mol(-1)-oxygen desorbing from Ag(111), and one (peak maximum temperature 573 K) having a desorption activation energy of 155 J mol(-1)-oxygen desorbing from a highly stepped or defected Ag surface. Temperature programmed reduction of the two oxygen states existing on the surface of the Ag/alpha-Al2O3 catalyst using ethene as the reductant produced two peaks at 373 and 473 K in which ethene epoxide and CO2 evolved coincidently. The peak at 373 K derives from the reduction of oxygen atoms adsorbed on Ag(111). The higher temperature peak (473 K) corresponds to the reduction of oxygen atoms adsorbed on highly stepped or defected Ag surface. The selectivity to ethene epoxide for the 373 K peak is similar to57%, while that of the 473 K peak is 34%. The coincident evolution of ethene epoxide and CO2 shows that the selective and unselective reaction pathways have a common surface intermediate - probably an oxametallacycle. The higher selectivity of the oxametallacycle formed by the bonding of ethene to the weaker Ag-O bond is considered to result from its having a lower activation energy to cyclisation than that produced by ethene bonding to the higher Ag-O bond.									25	2	0	0	1	0	26			1011-372X			WOS:000226504900008

Some of these lipids are believed to be produced only by aerobic organisms, whereas others actually require molecular oxygen for their biosynthesis. A persistent question remains: Did some polycyclic lipids initially evolve in response to certain environmental or metabolic stresses, including the presence of oxygen? Here, we identify tetracyclic isoprenoids in spores of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. We call them sporulenes. They are produced by cyclization of regular polyprenes, a reaction that is more favorable chemically than the formation of terpenoids such as hopanoids and steroids from squalene. The simplicity of the reaction suggests that the B. subtilis cyclase may be analogous to evolutionarily ancient cyclases. We show that these molecules increase the resistance of spores to a reactive oxygen species, demonstrating a specific physiological role for a nonpigment bacterial lipid biomarker. Geostable derivatives of these compounds in sediments could thus be used as direct indicators of oxidative stress and aerobic environments.									73	1	0	0	54	0	74			0027-8424			WOS:000255841600039	18436644

Among them, ternary layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have attracted a lot of attention because of their low price and environmental friendliness. More importantly, LDHs with large and adjustable interlayer spacing are ideal candidate materials for cation insertion/doping, which can achieve impressive electrochemical performance. Due to the synergistic effect of different metal ions in ternary LDHs and the synergistic effect of ternary LDHs and other materials in their composites, they provide high specific capacitance/capacity, excellent cycle life, and high energy density. In this review, the crystal structure and preparation of ternary LDHs are reviewed, with an emphasis on their morphology, structural engineering, derivatives and composites, and their applications in EES. In addition, we summarize the challenges facing ternary LDHs as cathode materials for supercapacitors (SCs) and various batteries, such as metal-ion batteries, rechargeable batteries, and metal-air batteries. This review also discusses the charge storage mechanisms of ternary LDHs by various advanced characterization methods.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000853633900001

The unconventional phases of materials with distinct atomic arrangements from their thermodynamically stable phases have attracted enormous attention. Phase engineering has recently made fruitful achievements in electrocatalysis field to optimize the performance of various electrochemical reactions. In this review, theoretical and experimental advances made in phase engineering of electrocatalysts are summarized. First, we introduce basic understanding on crystal phases of catalysts to show the dialectical relationship between bulk phase and surface catalytic layer, and highlight the multiple functions of phase engineering in catalysis studies. We then describe phase-controlled synthesis of materials through various experimental methods such as wet-chemical method, phase transition, and template growth. As a focus, we discuss the wide usage of phase engineering strategy in different kinds of electrocatalytic materials, and particular emphasis is given to establishment of reasonable crystal phase-activity relationship. Finally, we propose several future directions for developing more desirable electrocatalysts by rational crystal phase design.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000823385500008

In the photocatalytic conversion of phenylacetylene with ethanol as a probe reaction, the dominant product was styrene over Pt/2D Nb2O5 nanoplates; in contrast, H-2 was the main product over the Pt/bulk Nb2O5. Compared to the metallic Pt species over bulk Nb2O5, the positively charged Pt (Pt delta+) species over 2D Nb2O5 nanoplates contributed to the reduction of phenylacetylene, which was revealed by CO adsorbed Fourier transform infrared spectra. Furthermore, the present Pt delta+ species were due to the formation of Pt delta+-O-Nb structure via oxygen transfer of 2D Nb2O5 nanoplates, which was verified by the results of X-ray photoelectron spectra and H-2 temperature-programmed reduction.

Metal impurity deposition was characterized by XPS and in situ stripping voltammetry and is coincident with loss of catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2 reduction, favoring hydrogen evolution on poisoned surfaces. Metal deposition can be suppressed by complexing trace metal ion impurities with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or solid-supported iminodiacetate resins.

Thin silver chloride layers on different electrode substrates evolve oxygen under near-W-Vis illumination in aqueous solution at appropriate conditions. The AgCl layers work photocatalytically in the oxidation of water to O-2 in the presence of a small excess of Agi ions, with a maximum O-2 evolution rate at pH 4-5. The Light sensitivity in the visible is due to self-sensitization caused by reduced silver species. Many catalytic turnovers with respect to the total amount of AgCl were experimentally realized. Reduced silver species produced during the photocatalytic oxidation of water to O-2 on AgCl-coated electrodes can be electrochemically reoxidized by anodic polarization of the electrode. Electrochemical reoxidation can be performed simultaneously with the photochemical water oxidation reaction. The photocurrent is of reversed sign with respect to what has been known as the Becquerel-type photocurrent. Different electrode preparation techniques were investigated, and electrochemical reoxidation turned out to be more efficient on electrochemically prepared AgCl layers than on precipitated AgCl layers. Very stable photoelectrodes have been obtained on SnO2 : F-coated glass plates modified with a very thin gold layer. Such electrodes were employed as the anodic part in a photoelectrochemical cell for light-assisted water splitting. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

Here we report a nitrogen and phosphorus tri-doped hierarchically porous carbon supported highly cost-effective, efficient and durable Fe single-site electrocatalyst derived from biomass. Combined aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM, XPS and XAFS measurements and theoretical calculations reveal the atomically dispersed Fe-N-P-C-O complex as the dominant active sites for ORR. This work also shows the design principle for enhancing the ORR activity of single Fe site catalysts with higher Fe charge, which can be manipulated by the coordinated structure in the active centre. Theoretical calculations reveal that the main effective sites are singleN-P-O-Fe-O centers, where the associated P-O-Fe bond can significantly lower the stability of strongly adsorbed O-star and OH star on the catalytically active sites and thus give rise to enhanced ORR performance. The insights reported here open a new avenue for constructing highly efficient molecule-like heterogeneous catalysts in electrochemical energy technologies.									70	5	0	0	3	0	70			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000464487500030

Herein, motivated by theoretical predictions of the excellent electronic properties and suitable Gibbs free energy of active intermediates (H* for the hydrogen evolution reaction and OH* for the oxygen evolution reaction) on cobalt (Co) sites at the heterointerface between CoSe and MoSe2, a new hierarchical bimetal selenide microsphere electrocatalyst (CoSe/MoSe2) with good interfacial compatibility was designed and successfully synthesized. The as-prepared CoSe/MoSe2 exhibited excellent catalytic performance. In the meantime, it only needed 1.63, 1.69, and 1.77 V in 1.0 M KOH, simulated seawater, and alkaline seawater for overall water splitting, respectively. This was attributed to the well-matched interface between CoSe and MoSe2 that effectively disperses electrons on Co atoms and adjusts the d -band center on the Co atom, thus regulating the free energy of H*/OH* on Co sites. This work provided insights into the rational design and construction of efficient electrocatalysts with interfacial compatibility for water/seawater electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000831202800001

However, studies on optimized valence configuration with extremely high activity remains a great challenge because of scanty chemical approaches. Herein, a kind of CoFe-oxide nanocubes with tunable valence composition was rationally designed for boosting water splitting electrocatalysis by partially chemical tailoring Prussian blue analogue. The resulting Co2+-rich CoFe-oxide nanocube ((CoFe)-Fe-II-ONC) exhibited higher OER and HER catalytic performance than the well-balanced CoFe-oxide. It demanded overpotentials of only 289 mV and 284 mV to drive a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. The DFT calculations revealed that Co Fe-ONC is more favorable for OER and HER since the higher capacity of water adsorption, optimized route for electrons transferring, and lower energy barrier for water dissociation by the active valance configuration.									49	2	0	0	1	0	49			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000487570000022

The robust electrochemical oxidation is performed for a variety of alcohols with good functional group tolerance, high efficiency and atom economy, whereas mechanistic studies support the benzylic radical intermediate formation and hydrogen evolution.

However, the electrolyzer assembled with highly efficient anode and cathode still remains a critical challenge. Herein, NiCo MOFs grown in situ on nickel foam (NiCo MOF/NF) were selected as the common precursor to conveniently prepare two well-targeted electrocatalysts for anodic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. The NiCo MOF/NF after electrochemical activation (NiCo MOF/NF-EA) in 1.0 M KOH displayed a prominent UOR catalytic activity with an ultra-low potential of 1.280 V vs RHE at 10 mA cm(-2). The NiCo MOF/NF after phosphorization (NiCoP/NF) exhibited a high HER activity with a low overpotential of 63 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The overall urea solution electrolyzer assembled with superior NiCo MOF/NF-EA and NiCoP/NF showed an excellent performance with a voltage of 1.447 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a good long-term stability during 24 hour test. The strategy using the same precursor to conveniently synthesize different and optimal electrocatalysts for each electrode and assembling them together is effective for constructing efficient urea solution electrolyzer and worth extensive investigation.

The photosynthetic activities were measured for PSII samples either directly in aqueous solutions of EG or in the standard buffer medium following EG treatment, Several effects on PSII arise upon exposure to EC. Below 50% EG there are no significant Irreversible changes, although there is a slowing of the Q(A)(-) reoxidation kinetics in the presence of EG. At concentrations of 50-70% EG, protein structural changes occur that include the release of the 16, 23, and 33 kDa extrinsic proteins and two of the catalytic Mn ions. For these samples, the capacity for O-2 evolution is considerably reduced and the formation of donor side H2O2 is enhanced. In 60% EC, the nanosecond components in the rate of P680(+) reduction are converted entirely to microsecond kinetics which upon return of the sample to the standard buffer medium are partially restored, indicating that EG has a reversible, solvent effect on the PSII donor side. At concentrations of EG >70% chlorophyll fluorescence measurements reveal reversible increases in the F-0 level concomitant with the generation and disappearance of a 5 mu s decay component in the P680(+) reduction kinetics. This result may indicate a solvent-induced uncoupling of the light harvesting pigment bed from the reaction center complex. As the EG concentration is increased to 80-100%, there is an irreversible loss of the primary charge separation. The use of EC as a cryoprotectant and as a water-miscible organic solvent for PSII is discussed.									7	0	0	0	4	0	7			0006-2960			WOS:A1997WB62300012	8993320

BaFeO3-delta (BFO) has long been considered a potential candidate cathode material due to its high oxygen vacancy concentration and electrical conductivity; however, it is difficult to synthesize in a single phase. To overcome this problem, Nd3+ is doped into Ba-sites to reduce impurity phases and create a single perovskite phase. In-situ high temperature and room temperature X-ray diffraction analyses are carried out to investigate Nd3+-doped BFO. We find that Ba0.97Nd0.03FeO3-delta shows the highest electronic conductivity and lowest TEC value among the various doping concentrations tested, making this material most suitable for application in RSOCs. In addition, the polarization resistance of Ba0.97Nd0.03FeO3-delta has the lowest value in yttria-stabilized zirconia symmetric cells. To determine the reasons for the high catalytic activity of Ba0.97Nd0.03FeO3-delta, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and iodometric titration are carried out, the results demonstrate that the lower doping concentration of Nd3+ results in an advantage in terms of the number of additional oxygen vacancies created. Moreover, electrical conductivity relaxation measurements show that the Ba0.97Nd0.03FeO3-delta has a fast bulk diffusion coefficient and fast surface exchange coefficient. Hence, the solid oxide fuel cell and electrolysis mode performances when using Ba0.97Nd0.03FeO3-delta are excellent and a high power output of 1.2 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C can be achieved.									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000621508900005

The observed increasing energy requirement are largely due to continued industrialization and global population explosion. The current means of energy source is not sustainable because of several reasons, most importantly, environmental pollution and human health deterioration due to burning of fossil fuels. Therefore, this study develops a new catalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution by water splitting as a potential energy vector. The binary metal oxide catalyst CdFe2O4 was synthesized by the solventless solid-mechanical alloying method. The as-prepared catalyst was well characterized by several methods including field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier Transform infrared red spectroscopy (FTIR), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (XEDS). The as-prepared catalyst, CdFe2O4 was successfully applied for water electrolysis at a moderate overpotential (470 mV). Specifically, the onset potential for the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER) were 1.6 V-/RHE and 0.2 V-/RHE respectively (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode). The electrode potential required to reach 10 mA/cm(-2) for OER (in alkaline medium) and HER (in acidic medium) was 1.70 V-/RHE (corresponding to overpotential eta = 0.47 and - 0.30 V-/RHE (eta = - 0.30 V) respectively. Similarly, the developed OER and HER catalyst displayed high current and potential stability for a period of 12 h. This approach is seen as the right track of making water electrolysis for hydrogen energy feasible through provision of low-energy requirement for the electrolytic process. Therefore, CdFe2O4 is a potential water splitting catalyst for hydrogen evolution which is a clean fuel and an antidote for world dependence on fossil fuel for energy generation.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2045-2322			WOS:000749168300002	35102188

Light-absorbing semiconductors as well as electrodes modified with sensitizers typically catalyze oxygen photoreduction to hydrogen peroxide. Here, it is reported that, in contrast to these heterogeneous systems, a homogeneous solution of a metal-free organic dye can perform the whole catalytic cycle of hydrogen peroxide photoevolution itself. This cycle can proceed with simultaneous oxidation of various organic molecules as electron donors, or even water. In the three water-soluble dyes that are experimented with, photoevolution of peroxide occurs favorably at neutral to basic pH. The reaction is first order with respect to dye concentration, and evidence implicates a single-electron reduction pathway with superoxide as an intermediate. Photostability of the dyes over time correlates with increased oxidation potential of the molecule. The finding that hydrogen peroxide can be produced in aqueous solution with single fully organic molecules performing the entire photocatalytic cycle creates a new avenue for the peroxide carbon free energy cycle.									13	1	0	0	1	0	13			2366-7486			WOS:000481496000004

Sets of free-falling monodisperse molten metal droplets were formed at repeatable initial temperatures and velocities in a pulsed microarc discharge ignited between a cold tool cathode and a consumable wire anode. The droplets formed in oxygenated environments immediately ignited and burned, while their temperature histories were studied using optical pyrometry. Burning particles were quenched at different combustion times using techniques providing variable cooling rates. Analyses of the quenched samples were used to recover the evolution of burning particle compositions for different metals. Experiments were conducted with Al, Mg, Zr, Ti, Ta, W, Mo, Fe, and Cu particles. In addition, similar combustion experiments were carried out with boron particles produced using an oxygen-acetylene torch melting an edge of a vibrating boron filament. Most of the combustion experiments were conducted in air, while argon-oxygen, helium-oxygen, and carbon-dioxide environments were also used in some tests. A limited number of experiments on aluminum-particle combustion were conducted in microgravity. The experiments were aimed at identifying correlations between the burning particle temperature and composition histories. Dissolution of oxygen and other gases was observed to occur within the burning metal, leading to phase changes coinciding with sudden changes in metal combustion regimes. Equilibrium metal-gas phase diagrams were used to interpret the experimentally observed metal combustion behavior. Based on the experimental results, an expanded mechanism of metal combustion was suggested, emphasizing reactions and phase changes occurring within the burning metal in addition to reactions occurring on and above the metal surface.									32	2	0	0	0	0	34			0010-5082			WOS:000187804600011

This review highlights the fundamentals, synthesis, and properties of MXenes, and focuses on applications of MXenes in supercapacitors, batteries, sensors, electromagnetic shielding/absorption and catalysis.

In this work, TiO2/BiYO3 photocatalysts were synthesized by an improved Sol-Gel method and their photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution from water splitting was investigated. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of the optimized TiO2/BiYO3 composite exhibited 10 times higher than that of TiO2 and 57 times higher than that of BiYO3, respectively. Such enhanced photocatalytic performance was due to the Type I heterostructure between the TiO2 and BiYO3, which promoted the transfer of photoinduced electrons and the separation of photogenerated charge carriers. This work demonstrates that the TiO2/BiYO3 composites are promising photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen production from water. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

J	Chao, Jiangkun; Chu, Tingxiang; Yu, Minggao; Han, Xuefeng; Hu, Daimin; Liu, Wei; Yang, Xinlei								An experimental study on the oxidation kinetics characterization of broken coal under stress loading								FUEL				287						119515	10.1016/j.fuel.2020.119515				MAR 1 2021	2021	As mines continue to extend deeper, the stress and ground temperature of the residual coal in the goaf are increased, and the degree of coal rock fragmentation also increases, making the spontaneous combustion of coal more prominent. In this paper, a low-temperature oxidation experiment of coal under axial stress loading conditions was conducted. By analysing the outlet gas flow rate, oxidizing gas derivatives, oxygen consumption rate, heat release intensity, apparent activation energy and other parameters, we studied the effect of axial stress variations on the spontaneous combustion of coal. The results showed that, in an experiment of heating oxidation with the same axial stress, the flow rate of gas generated by the oxidation in the coal sample room gradually decreased with an increasing temperature; at the same temperature, the flow rate of the outlet gas decreased as the axial stress increased. At a low temperature, as the axial stress increased, the rate of oxygen consumption and the amount of derived gas in the reaction system both increased, and the activation energy decreased. When the temperature reached the critical temperature and continuously increased, with an increase in the axial stress, the oxygen consumption rate, heat release intensity and the amount of derived gas in the reaction system first increased and then decreased. Moreover, the temperature point of ethylene gas produced by oxidation was advanced. The effect of the axial stress on the spontaneous combustion of coal was obtained, and the increase in the axial stress first promoted and then suppressed the spontaneous combustion of broken coal.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000604276000002

However, detailed conversion reaction processes in terms of the oxidation state evolution and chemical/mechanical stability of the electrodes are still poorly understood. Herein we explore a general synthetic strategy for versatile synthesis of various holey transition metal oxide nanosheets with adjustable hole sizes that enable greatly enhanced alkali-ion storage properties. We employ in-situ transmission electron microscopy and operando X-ray absorption structures to study the mechanical properties, morphology evolution and oxidation state changes during electrochemical processes. We find that these holey oxide nanosheets exhibit strong mechanical stability inherited from graphene oxide, displaying minimal structural changes during lithiation/delithiation processes. These holey oxide nanosheets represent a promising material platform for in-situ probing the electrochemical processes, and could open up opportunities in many energy storage and conversion systems.									277	15	0	0	24	0	280			2041-1723			WOS:000400065600001	28443642

We herein develop hybrid core-shell semiconducting nanoparticles (SPN-Ms) that can undergo O-2 evolution in hypoxic solid tumor to promote photodynamic process. Such oxygenic nanoparticles are synthesized through a one-pot surface growth reaction and have a unique multilayer structure cored and coated with semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) and manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanosheets, respectively. The SPN core serves as both NIR fluorescence imaging and photodynamic agent, while the MnO2 nanosheets act as a sacrificing component to convert H2O2 to O-2 under hypoxic and acidic tumor microenvironment. As compared with the uncoated SPN (SPN-0), the oxygenic nanoparticles (SPN-M1) generate 2.68-fold more O-1(2) at hypoxic and acidic conditions under NIR laser irradiation at 808 nm. Because of such an oxygen-evolution property, SPN-M1 can effectively eradicate cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our study thus not only reports an in situ synthetic method to coat organic nanoparticles but also develops a tumor-microenvironment-sensitive theranostic nanoagent to overcome hypoxia for amplified therapy.									233	12	0	0	68	0	235			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000420000000080	29220576

Herein, IrNi-FeNi3 hybrid self-supported on nickel foam with unique nanosheets and 1.218 wt.% Ir-loading is synthesized via hydrothermal method. In 1.0 M KOH, ultralow overpotentials for oxygen evolution reaction (OER, eta(20) = 240.0 mV, eta(1000) = 330.0 mV) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, eta(10) = 31.1 mV, eta(1000) = 288.8 mV) are needed. Only 1.47 V is required for overall water splitting to arrive at 10 mA cm(-2), indicating superior activity. For overall water splitting, it also demonstrates good stability with negligible declines after testing for 100 h at 500 mA cm(-2) in 6.0 M KOH at 60 degrees C, which is close to the practical application. The unique self-supported nanosheets structure on nickel foam can expose more active sites and the hybridization of IrNi with FeNi3 can promote the intrinsic activity of catalyst. Therefore, this work proposes an industrially promising catalyst for water splitting.									83	1	0	0	5	0	81			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000621629600006

However, the application of these linear fitting procedures become problematic in the cases of experimental data featuring nonlinearities in the Tafel (log(J) - V) response. This is especially troubling in low-overpotential regimes, where charge transfer kinetics generally dominate electrode behavior (as opposed to diffusion-limited currents at higher overpotentials) and linearization is expected to be most applicable. As a response to this complication and the ad-hoc forms of fitting that may arise from it, this report outlines a systematic method for the determination of Tafel slopes through a rigorous, quantitative framework. The algorithm's performance is benchmarked using electrochemical measurements of well-characterized reactions for water splitting, hydrogen evolution, and dioxygen reduction at iridium and platinum electrodes. As a final validation test, we show that the exchange currents extracted through this automated fitting procedure, used in conjunction with the Butler-Volmer model, are capable of reproducing the original electrochemical data in kinetically controlled regimes.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000503919500024

La-Based Perovskite Oxide Catalysts for Alkaline Oxygen Reduction: The Importance of Electrochemical Stability								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				126	6			3098	3108		10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c00108				FEB 17 2022	2022	Alkaline fuel cells represent a promising energy conversion technology since they enable the use of precious metal-free electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. Among these, La-based perovskite oxides, with great compositional and structural tunability, are especially attractive. However, we believe that the current literature lacks a thorough understanding of their inherent (in)stability issues. Here, we report on nine La-based perovskite oxide electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction, including LaMO3 (M = Mn, Co, Ni) and LaCoxM1-xO3 (M = Mn, Ni; x = 0.9, 0.5, 0.1). While some exhibited initial promising activity, they all degraded significantly, even after brief electrochemical testing. Through comprehensive structural characterization of LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3, particularly scanning transmission electron microscopy, we found evidence to support a degradation mechanism in which the B-site cation species irreversibly leach from the perovskite under testing conditions. A sample cycled 10 000 times from +0.4 to +1.2 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) showed an amorphous La oxide shell 1-2 nm thick. Bulk analyses showed that B-site leaching also occurs for samples soaked in 1 M KOH or pure EtOH. The mechanistic insights provided here should help inform the future design of La-based perovskite oxide electrocatalysts for alkaline fuel cells and stress the importance of stability metrics validating claims of promising electrocatalytic activity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000766228300018

Herein, a novel and efficient nitrogen-doped carbon material with metal cobalt co-dopant (Co-N/C) has been prepared by pyrolyzing porphyrin-based covalent organic polymer where Co is anchored. The optimized 10%-Co-N/C catalyst through facilely and efficiently tuning the cobalt content is carefully characterized by XRD, Raman, XPS, SEM and TEM for composition and microstructure analysis. This catalyst with only 0.56% Co exhibits an excellent ORR catalytic activity with a positive half-wave potential of 0.816 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH solution, which is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). Notably, the 10%-Co-N/C catalyst displays better electrochemical stability with only a loss of 5.1% of its initial current density in chronoamperometric measurement and also gives rise to stronger methanol tolerance than Pt/C. The good ORR catalytic behaviour for this catalyst may be attributed to the dispersion of the Co-N-x active sites via adjusting the contents of cobalt species in porous organic framework.

Such nanohybrids with an edge-N-rich structure are obtained through sequential doping and mechanical treatments of the pristine bulk-CNTs. The C, E-N-CNT/carbon black (C, E-N-CNT/C) demonstrates exciting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis with exceptionally low-onset potential (E-0, 913 mV versus RHE) and satisfactory half-wave potential (E-1/2, merely -7.3 mV shift compared with that of commercial 20% platinum/C (Pt/C)). Besides, the C, E-N-CNT/C presents significantly enhanced durability and tolerance in chronoamperometry test with methanol injection compared with the Pt/C.

Hydrogen is being extensively investigated as an alternative to fossil fuels. Water electrolysis is a simple and large-scale industrial method, for hydrogen production. In this research, for the first time, the needle-like structure of Co3O4 arrays was directly grown on carbon cloth (CC) by a hydrothermal method. Then Pd particles were electrochemically deposited on the needles-like structure by cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique (Pd@Co3O4/CC). The structure and morphology of the electrode surface were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) techniques. The proposed electrode was applied for electrochemical hydrogen production in acidic media. The catalytic activity of the Pd@Co3O4/CC electrode was compared with CC, Pd/CC, and Co3O4/CC electrodes, which the results showed that the HER performance was as this order: Pd@Co3O4/CC > Pd/CC > Co3O4/CC > CC.

Herein, the core-shell Cu@COP on the copper mesh was successfully synthesized. The hierarchically structured Cu@COP exhibits high surface areas and rapid electron transfer ability, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. As-prepared Cu@CoP/Cu electrodes need an overpotential of 98 mV to obtain 10 mA cm(-2) for HER in acidic solutions. This integrated catalyst also demands overpotentials of 88 and 270 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER in alkaline solution, respectively. The Cu@CoP/Cu is employed as bifunctional electrodes for water electrolysis. For acid/alkaline systems, the performance of the Cu@CoP/Cu-derived cell is comparable to noble-metal-based water electrolysis. For the alkaline water-splitting system, the performance of the Cu@CoP/Cu-derived cell is superior to noble-metalbased water electrolysis, which needs an electrolysis voltage of 1.65 V to obtain 10 mA cm(-2).									14	2	0	0	0	0	15			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000563095800110

Electrocatalytic activity of WO3 as a cheap and promising catalyst for HER is impacted by crystal phase structure, oxygen vacancy and surface state. The present paper designs Ag-WO3 catalysts with core-shell structure using Ag@C as a template with ultrasonic synthesis method to improve the structure properties and increase the active sites of hydrogen adsorption. Also, atomic Ag serves as the function of hydrogen absorption channel for the shell of tungsten oxide. As the results suggest, Ag-WO3(0.8) CSNSs at ratio of WCl6 : Ag@C with 0.8 shows the more effective Electrocatalytic activity towards the HER with low over potential of -207 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), small tafel slope (52.4 mV dec(-1)), larger active area C-dl (54.92 mF cm(-2)) and high exchange current density.

As a three-dimensional HER electrode, CoMoS4 NS/CC exhibits remarkable activity in 1.0 M phosphate buffer saline (pH 7), only requiring an overpotential of 183 mV to drive a geometrical current density of 10 mA.cm(-2). This overpotential is 140 mV lower than that for Co(OH)F NS/CC. Notably, this electrode also shows outstanding electrochemical durability and nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency.

However, efficient controlling the selectivity of products and avoiding over-oxidation under mild conditions remain to be challenging. Herein, the selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol was used as the model reaction, and through tailoring the band structure for an appropriate thermodynamic driving force, Zn2Ti-layered double hydroxide (Zn2Ti-LDH) photocatalyst showed one-step oxidation of benzene to phenol in water with a high phenol selectivity of 87.18%. Detailed characterization revealed that the formed oxygen vacancies onto the surface of the LDH photocatalyst enhanced the photoinduced charge-carrier separation/transformation efficiency, increased the content of superoxide radicals, thus promoted the photocatalytic oxidation reaction. This work may serve as a guide in designing efficient photocatalysts for selective catalytic oxidation.									48	5	0	0	5	0	49			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000533524900015

Carbon supported oxide-rich Pd-W alloy nanoparticles (PdW/C) with different Pd:W atom ratios were prepared by the reduction-oxidation method. Among the catalysts, the oxide-rich Pd0.8W0.2/C (Pd/W = 8:2, atom ratio) exhibits the highest catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data shows that similar to 40% of Pd atoms and similar to 60% of the W atoms are in their oxide form. The Pd 3d(5/2) binding energy of the oxide-rich Pd-W nanoalloys is higher than that of Pd/C, indicating the electronic structure of Pd is affected by the strong interaction between Pd and W/WO3. Compare to Pd/C, the onset potential of the oxygen reduction reaction at the oxide-rich Pd0.8W0.2/C shifts to a higher potential. The current density (mA.mg Pd-1) at the oxide-rich Pd0.8W0.2/C is similar to 1.6 times of that at Pd/C. The oxide-rich Pd0.8W0.2/C also exhibits higher catalytic stability than Pd/C, which demonstrates that it is a prospective candidate for the cathode of fuel cells operating with alkaline electrolyte.									7	0	1	0	0	0	8			2073-4344			WOS:000436128600004

However, rationally modulating these external energy fields to synergize electrocatalytic processes remains a great challenge. Herein, phosphate-incorporated iron oxide nanosheet arrays (P-FeOx/IF) are constructed as multifunctional photothermal-electrocatalytic electrodes for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The as-prepared P-FeOx/IF exhibits excellent photothermal conversion performance and enables in-situ surface self-heating under near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation, resulting in a gradual increase in local temperature on the electrode surface. Impressively, the photothermal P-FeOx/IF electrode exposed to NIR light irradiation shows significantly improved electrocatalytic performances with relatively low overpotentials for OER (eta(10): 280 mV) and HER (eta(10): 104 mV) to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, a two-electrode system using photothermal P-FeOx/IF as anode achieves a low cell voltage of 1.685 V. This study provides a new avenue for developing high-performance electrocatalysts incorporating photothermal effects. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)											10.1002/anie.202211585				2022-Oct-11	2022	Herein, we have demonstrated the control over the structure of precatalysts to tune the properties of the active catalysts and their water oxidation activity. The reaction of K3[Fe(CN)6] and Na2[Fe(CN)5(NO)] with Co(OH)2@CC produced precatalysts PC-1 and PC-2, respectively, with distinct structural and electronic features. The replacement of the -CN group with strong pi-acceptor -NO modulates the electronic and atomic structure of PC-2. As a result, a facile electrochemical transformation of PC-2 into active catalyst Fe-Co(OH)2-Co(O)OH (AC-2) has been attained only in 15 CV cycles while 600 CV cycles are required for the electrochemical activation of PC-1 into AC-1. The X-ray absorption studies reveal the contraction of the Co-O and Fe-O bond in AC-2 because of the presence of a higher amount of Co3+ and Fe3+ than in AC-1. The high valent Co3+ and Fe3+ modulates the electronic properties of AC-2 and assists in the O-O bond formation, leading to the improved water oxidation activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1521-3773		MEDLINE:36217882	36217882

In this work, a novel N-doped porous carbon substrate constructed heterojunction electrocatalyst (MoS2-MoP/NC) was fabricated by a simple and facile method. Based on the electronic interaction and synergistic effect between MoS2 and MoP phases, the fabricated MoS2-MoP/NC heterojunction catalyst exhibited excellent electrocatalytic ability. In addition, the N-doped porous carbon substrate had a good charge/mass-transfer ability, which could effectively facilitate electronic transmission or prevent the aggregation of MoS2-MoP nanosheets and improve the catalytic activity. The heterojunction catalyst significantly improved HER activity with a low overpotential of 83 and 103 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in a 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 and Tafel slope of 59.38 and 59.20 mV dec(-1) for HER, respectively. This work provides a simple, less expensive and efficient approach for constructing high-performance heterojunction catalysts for HER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000674758400001

In this study, two high strength aluminum alloys (Al2024 and Al6061) were quantitatively compared for thin film sulfuric acid anodizing (TFSAA) process, on anodizing current density, anodized coating thickness, coating weight, and anodizing efficiency, to understand the underlying mechanism for the different anodizing rates. In-situ electrochemical impedance (EIS) measurement was carried out to deconvolute the different factors that affect the anodizing process. Anodized coating thickness and weight growth were correlated to different charge transfer resistances from the equivalent circuit model. The higher Cu content in Al2024 led to slower anodizing rate due to enhanced charge transfer resistance, and to lower anodizing efficiency through its catalytic effect for O-2 evolution side reaction. A new schematic mechanism of the anodizing process was proposed taking into consideration of the electrolyte chemistry. O-2 generation from water oxidation in the porous anodic oxide layer during anodizing was elaborated as the main factor for anodizing efficiency loss.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			0257-8972			WOS:000455691100031

Ideally direct electrochemical formation of Ag and Pd foam structures without any additive reagent does not lead to a desired result; however, indirect fabrication starting from electrochemically fabricated Cu foam seems promising. Highly porous copper foam is fabricated electrochemically at a copper sheet and in turn serves as a hard template and a redox inducer for the deposition of Ag or Pd. The redox induced replacement of copper foam with Ag or Pd is done via simple immersion of as-fabricated nanoporous copper foam in cation aqueous solutions of Ag or Pd. The surface morphology of the as-fabricated foam is characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), EDX and X-ray diffraction. The hydrogen evolution reaction is investigated as an example to demonstrate the electrocatalytic ability of as-fabricated foams. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, atomically ordered Ti50NixPt50-x/CNT and disordered Ti50NixPt50-x/CNT catalysts are prepared using a simple impregnation method. Compared with the disordered samples, the ordered ones exhibit excellent HER activity and stability in alkaline electrolytes. O-Ti50Ni30Pt20/CNT can reach 10 mA cm(-2) with only 21 mV overpotential, and the Tafel slope is 25.7 mV dec(-1). The stabilization time at 10 mA cm(-2) is up to 80 h, which is about twice that of D-Ti50Ni30Pt20/CNT. Both the samples show good HER performance in acidic electrolytes. According to the experimental and DFT calculation results, it is found that the ligand effects of Ni and Pt atoms can effectively accelerate the alkaline HER kinetics. The enhanced stability of the ordered TiNiPt/CNT sample originates from its fixed and ordered atomic arrangement, resulting in strong interactions between Pt and Ni-Ti bonds. This work provides a new structural design optimization approach for the study of acid-base HER electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000861682100001

With an onsetpotential of 0.75 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the electrochemicalHzOR performance of histidine-functionalized graphene oxide (Hist@rGO) issubstantially enhanced with an achieved higher current of 24 mA/cm2at 1.95 V versusRHE in 0.5 M KOH. Hist@rGO has the highest electrocatalytic performance for hydrazineoxidation processes according to electrochemical measurements. Moreover, the Hist@rGO-supported material performs admirably that may be attributed to its synergisticcatalytic activity. The presence of an imidazole ring containing heteroatoms on the top ofGO boosts the electrocatalytic activity and electron-transfer capacities toward the HzOR,resulting in outstanding electrochemical HzOR performance for the Hist@rGOelectrocatalyst. The size of Hist@rGO is confirmed by morphological studies using high-resolution transmission electronmicroscopy. From the binding energies of C-N, C-O, and C-C signals, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy validates the surfacemodification of GO by histidine (Hist@rGO). According to our data, the metal-free amino acid-functionalized carbon-basedelectrocatalyst has an excellent electrochemical HzOR performance and plays an important role in activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000799358500013

The influence of pH and Al3+ on the galvanic coupling behavior and damage evolution on AA7050 as a function of chromate concentration were assessed. The degree of chromate inhibition was observed to decrease as pH decreased, owing to chromate speciation and reduced capacity to suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) compared to the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The addition of 0.1 M Al3+ significantly increased HER kinetics and produced a large buffer effect which overwhelmed the ability of chromate to slow damage propagation on AA7050. Assessment of cathodes indicated that Cu was more important than 316SS in driving damage initiation, but less active than 316SS in supporting high-rate damage propagation in simulated crevice environments. The implications of this study for actual bimetallic systems are discussed.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000732455100001

To enhance the water splitting ability, electrocatalysts qualify high catalytic ability and low cost are need to be explored. Herein, a bimetal phosphide (NiCoP) nanomaterial is reported as an efficient electrocatalyst for water oxidation. The ternary nickel cobalt phosphide nanoparticles were synthesized from the solution-phase reaction of organic Co and Ni precursors with trioctylphosphine. The nanoparticle size is 18 +/- 5 nm. After annealing, the catalytic ability of NiCoP is significantly enhanced. The overpotential decreased from 480 to 330 mV vs RHE at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 mol dm(-3) KOH alkaline solution. When hydrophilic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) mixed with the NiCoP to form hybrid NiCoP-CNTs, the overpential further decreased from 330 to 320 mV vs RHE at 10 mA cm(-2). The Tafel slopes of ca. 69 and 52 mV are found for annealed NiCoP and NiCoP-CNTs, respectively. The stability test of NiCoP-CNTs also shown the remarkable catalytic activity for long-term operation.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1452-3981			WOS:000391039000013

Here, three Cabernet Sauvignon wines, containing different levels of acetaldehyde from different micro-oxygenation (mOx) regimes, including yeast-mediated treatments, were aged under closures differing in oxygen ingress. Oxygen, phenolics, carbonyls and heterocyclic acetals were measured. Acetaldehyde levels at bottling was a significant factor in the phenolic compound profile after one year, with anthocyanins most affected, then flavonols, flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acids, but there were negligible effects on benzoic acids. The effect of bottle closures with increased oxygen ingress had a similar trend. Increased acetaldehyde levels and oxygen ingress also yielded higher levels of the heterocyclic acetals from glycerol. These changes reflect aging, and suggest that managing mOx during production could be used to reduce the time needed to achieve some aged wine characteristics.									18	1	0	0	9	0	19			0308-8146	1873-7072		WOS:000464920800027	31000039

However, the poor kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits their practical application. The exploration of noble metals-free cathode catalysts with high catalytic activity on both ORR and OER is still a big challenge. Herein, CoO has been confined into bimodal mesoporous carbon frameworks (CoO@BMC) via a wet-chemistry impregnation approach and the performance of CoO@BMC as cathode catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries has been largely improved. For comparison, CoO@CMK-3 composite has also been prepared. In comparison with bulk CoO, BMC and CoO@CMK-3, CoO@BMC based cathode shows a higher initial capacity (similar to 4000 mA hg(-1)), much higher cycling stability, higher rate capability and lower overpotential, which can be largely attributed to the synergetic effect of CoO and hierarchical BMC on both ORR and OER. In addition, the formation and decomposition of Li2O2 and side products in the process of ORR and OER have also been analyzed and the results indicate that CoO@BMC nanocomposite can efficiently promote the decomposition of Li2O2 and even some side products of carbonates.

In this work, periodic density functional theory calculations are applied to investigate, for the first time, the possibility of activating the inert basal surfaces of 2H-MoTe2 monolayers by N- or P-doping for overall electrocatalytic water splitting. The results show that both N- and P-doping significantly change the surface charge distribution and electronic band structure of 2H-MoTe2. In addition, the doping-induced structural disorder generates more active sites, leading to improved electrochemical activities for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Especially, N-doped 2H-MoTe2 (4 x 4 x 1) exhibits a better OER catalytic performance with a small overpotential of 1.82 eV (vs normal hydrogen electrode), while both N- and P-doped MoTe2 monolayers exhibit outstanding HER catalytic performance with a Gibbs free energy of the hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H) = -1.03 eV for N-doped MoTe2 and Delta G(H) = -0.86 eV for P-doped MoTe2) smaller than that of pristine 2H-MoTe2 (Delta G(H) = 1.83 eV). The study provides an effective strategy for regulating the electroactivity of layered transition metal dichalcogenides for enhanced overall water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2366-7486			WOS:000795970300001

Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate a fascinating nonprecious metallic plasmonic photocatalyst Sn/SnO2-x with peapod-like hetero-nanostructures fabricated via an electrospinning-hydrogenation process. The hydrogenation gives rise to the simultaneous formation of metallic Sn nanoparticle peas and oxygen vacancies in SnO2 semiconductors. Metallic Sn generates unprecedented strong LSPR absorption in the visible light region, which significantly enhances the utilization of photon energies in a broad UV-vis region for the peapod-like Sn/SnO2-x hetero-nanostructure. In addition, the built-in semiconductor-metal Schottky junctions are of great benefit in promoting charge carrier separation and the oxygen vacancies are favorable for accelerating surface catalytic oxygen evolution reaction kinetics. As a result, the peapod-like Sn/SnO2-x hetero-nanostructure delivers an improved photoelectrochemical performance with a high photocurrent density of 245 mu A cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is seven times higher than that of pristine SnO2. It is believed that the present work will deepen the comprehensive understanding of the LSPR effect from nonprecious metals and open up new opportunities for other solar energy-related areas.									17	0	0	0	3	0	17			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000476599900027

Here we elaborately synthesize lamellar-assembled PdNi super-nanosheets (SNSs) with an optimized Pd/Ni molar ratio to serve as attractive ORR and OER bifunctional electrocatalysts for rechargeable high-powered Zn-air batteries (ZABs). The products are layer-by-layer stackings of ultrathin PdNi nanosheet motifs. On the drastically extended two-dimensional (2D) surface, the inserted Ni atoms can substantially lower down the d-band center of surface Pd toward improved ORR kinetics and concurrently create oxytropic NiOx sites to adsorb -OH groups for promoting the reverse OER electrocatalysis. Specifically, the ORR mass activity and specific activity of the primary Pd92Ni8 SNSs attain 2.5 A.mg(-1) and 3.15 mA.cm(-2), which are respectively 14 and 9 times those of commercial Pt/C. Meanwhile, the OER activity and stability of Pd92Ni8 SNSs/C distinctly outperform those of the RuO2 benchmark, suggesting excellent reversible oxygen electrocatalysis. The power density of the ZAB with Pd92Ni8 SNSs/C as the air cathode is 2.7 times higher than that by Pt/C benchmark. Significantly, it can last for over 150 h without significant performance degradation during the charge-discharge cycle test. This work showcases a feasible strategy for developing self-assembled multimetallic 2D nanomaterials with excellent bifunctional catalytic performances toward energy conversion applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000862227500002

Every diminution in the oxygen content above the sample induces a broad IR absorption band (X-band) between 2300-700 cm-1 with a few small peaks in the 1400-850 cm-1 region of the spectrum superimposed on it. The X-band results from the enhanced electron concentration in the bulk of the tin dioxide domain. The fine structure is due to the absorption of several kinds of surface oxygen species associated vibration modes. The porous tin dioxide consists of domains were the outward 'shell' is depleted of electrons by the formation of adsorbed O- species on oxygen surface sites, S(O)(O-) species. In our proposed model for the impedance data this gives rise to a parallel R(p)C(p) circuit for the domain boundary characteristics and to an R(s) parameter for the intradomain resistance. The evolution of these IR and impedance spectroscopic effects with temperature and oxygen content is used to set up, to confirm and refine a physicochemical operation model of tin dioxide gas sensor. This model consists of a sensitizing reaction sequence in the presence of oxygen and a gas-detection reaction sequence when a reducing gas is present. Based on this model, the principal disadvantages of this type of gas sensor become clear. Every factor that influences the concentration of S(O)(O-) species, causes a conductance modification. If we can control and direct the nature, the number and the arrangement of the tin dioxide domains, a directed development and improvement of the sensor characteristics is possible.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0925-4005			WOS:A1994NN90000040

With metal-ion bridges, highly dispersed molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanolayers are vertically grown on the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to form RGO-M-MoS2 photocatalysts for HER, where M = Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+. The results show that the cross-bridging ions can modulate the MoS2 growth priority and act as efficient charge transfer channels between RGO and MoS2, and combine the advantages of the high conductivity of graphene with the photo-electrochemical activity of MoS2. The metal-ion bridged MoS2-M-RGO heterostructures demonstrate superior catalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction in acid medium, evidenced by the remarkable higher catalytic current density at low overpotential compared with that of MoS2-RGO without metal-ion bridge. This study provides a novel and facile route for establishing efficient composite photo-electrocatalysts for water splitting to generate hydrogen.									40	0	0	0	6	0	40			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000460495400014

Recently, research on the ORR of molybdenum disulfide-based catalysts in alkaline electrolytes has been on the rise. However, the development of MoS2 catalyst for acidic ORR is still in its infancy. Herein, without using reductant and morphology control reagent, we firstly obtained flowerball-like MoS2/Vulcan XC-72R (VC) nanocomposites via hydrothermal method. The designed composite exhibits a nearly 4e(-) ORR process with 0.78 and 0.92 V onset potentials in 0.1 M KOH and HClO4, respectively. Furthermore, the flowerball-like composite shows utmost electrochemical stability judging by 87 and 80% current retention for about 5.5 h either in alkaline or acid media, long term durability for continuous 10,000 cycles, and stronger resistance to methanol than the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The abundant Mo edges as catalytic active centers of flowerball-like structure, high electron conductivity, and enhanced mass transport in either alkaline or acidic electrolyte are favorable for catalytic performance. The prepared catalyst provides great potential for the substitution of noble metal based catalysts in fuel cells and metal-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000775971400001

Although the operational voltage window is determined by the intrinsic electrochemical stability of water (1.23 V), such an impediment could be overcome by taking advantage of the additional overpotential of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, vertical graphene nanosheet arrays (VGs) were in situ grown on carbon cloth substrate (CC-VG) via a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method, and a flexible supercapacitor cathode material CC-VG/Na0.5MnO2 was subsequently prepared by electrodeposition and electrochemical oxidation. It is interesting to find that the electrode voltage window for CC-VG/Na0.5MnO2 can be extended to 0-1.3 V with significantly increased specific capacitance up to 525 F/g at 2 A/g benefitting from the presence of VGs and the high Na+ content that increased overpotential of OER by the Na+ deintercalation/intercalation, which shed new lights on developing widen-voltage aqueous supercapacitors with high energy density.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2352-152X	2352-1538		WOS:000865014900001

Here, a highly adaptive etching method to create pores and cavities in the metallopolymer particles is established. Starting from boronate polymer (BP) and inorganic@BP core-shell particles, porous, hollow, and yolk-shell metallopolymer particles can be fabricated, respectively. By taking advantage of the easy control over composition and pore/cavity structure, these metallopolymer particles provide a universal platform for the fabrication of nitrogen, boron co-doped carbon nanocomposites loaded with metals (M-NBCs). The as-prepared M-NBCs exhibit remarkable catalytic activities toward oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction. An alkaline overall water splitting cell assembled by using M-NBCs as the anode and cathode can be driven by a single AAA battery. The proposed strategy for the construction of metallopolymer composites may enlighten for the design of complex hybrid nanomaterials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000830306400001	35871499

However, the developed ex-situ doping technologies encounter dilemmas of high cost and low yield. Herein, we report an efficient, facile and depth-controllable ex-situ flame doping and the TiO(2 )nanorod arrays, dopants of Sn and W ions are prototypical system for photoelectrochemical water splitting, in which the dopants are diffused quickly into the outer surface region of the TiO2 in less than 30 s. The characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the enhanced electron localization on coordinatively unsaturated W atoms is induced by adjacent Sn atoms, which not only facilitate to absorb H2O molecules but also diminish activation energy barrier through stabilizing the *OH intermediates during oxygen evolution reaction. The desirable ex-situ flame doping strategy exhibits great versatility in the configuration of efficient photoelectrochemical systems over prevalent metal-oxide semiconductors.

The exploration of such a synergy depends heavily on the understanding of the atomic-scale structural details of NMs and 3d-TMs in the nanomaterials. This has attracted a great deal of recent interest in the field of catalysis science, especially concerning the core-shell and alloy nanostructures. A rarely asked question of fundamental significance is how the core-shell and alloy structural arrangements of atoms in the multimetallic nanomaterials dynamically change under reaction conditions, including reaction temperature, surface adsorbate, chemical environment, applied electrochemical potential, etc. The dynamic evolution of the core-shell/alloy structures under the reaction conditions plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance of the multimetallic nanocatalysts.This Account focuses on the dynamic structure characteristics for several different types of composition-tunable alloy and core-shell nanomaterials, including phase-segregated, elemental-enriched, dynamically evolved, and structurally different core-shell structures. In addition to outlining core-shell/alloy structure formation via processes such as seed-mediated growth, thermochemical calcination, adsorbate-induced evolution, chemical dealloying, underpotential deposition/galvanic displacement, etc., this Account will highlight the progress in understanding the dynamic core-shell/alloy structures under chemical or catalytic reaction conditions, which has become an important focal point of the research fronts in catalysis and electrocatalysis. The employment of advanced techniques, especially in situ/operando synchrotron high-energy X-ray diffraction and pair distribution function analyses, has provided significant insights into the dynamic evolution processes of NM/3d-TM nanocatalysts under electrocatalytic or fuel cell operating conditions. Examples will highlight Pt- or Pd-based nanoparticles and nanowires alloyed with various 3d-TMs with a focus on their structural evolution under reaction conditions. While the dynamic process is complex, the ability to gain an insight into the evolution of core-shell and alloy structures under the catalytic reaction condition is essential for advancing the design of multimetallic nanocatalysts. This Account serves as a springboard from fundamental understanding of the core-shell and alloy structural dynamics to the various applications of nanostructured catalysts/electrocatalysts, especially in the fronts of energy and environmental sustainability.									38	1	0	0	1	0	39			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000600096800014	33170638

A comparative study shows that the underlying substrate, on which the nanoCo3O4 film is deposited, plays a role and affects the performance. A detailed electrochemical study carried out on the Co3O4@CC electrode reveals that the charge is stored at the electrode/electrolyte interface in the form of a redox state triggered by the faradaic reaction and thus provides a pseudocapacitive nature to the electrode by exhibiting a capacitance of 265 F/g at a current density of 2 A/g. Additionally, electrode's stability, coulombic efficiency, and capacitance retention were found to be excellent. In addition to the energy storage, electrically assisted water-splitting property has also been observed at the electrode surface for which the nano-Co3O4 electrodes act as catalysts to exhibit the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The overpotential for HER and OER has been measured to be 580 and 620 mV with their respective Tafel slope of 171 and 270 mV dec-1. Overall, the Co3O4@CC electrode was found to be the best-performing electrode for bifunctional application in water splitting and supercapacitive energy storage.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000869014000001

In this study, S doped NiCoP nanosheet arrays with rich P vacancies (A-NiCoP vertical bar S) are developed through plasma treatment. Starting from growing NiCoP through hydrothermal and phosphating processes, S dopant and P vacancy are simultaneously introduced into NiCoP by Ar plasma treatment. The synergic effect of S dopant and P vacancy leads to increased exposed active sites, optimized surface chemical states and improved electrical conductivity. Consequently, A-NiCoP vertical bar S shows superior activities with low overpotentials of 88 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 M KOH, as well as a low Tafel slope of 73.7 mV dec(-1). Further, theoretical calculations demonstrate that the synergistic effects of S dopant and P vacancy can modify the electronic structure and lower free energy of hydrogen adsorption in NiCoP, thus promoting the reaction mechanism. Moreover, the water-splitting configuration by A-NiCoP vertical bar S only needs 1.60 V to attain 10 mA cm(-2). (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The mesoporous carbon spheres were derived from sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as the carbon source and the nitrogen and sulfur dopants were derived from urea and p-benzenedithiol, respectively. The doping level and chemical states of nitrogen and sulfur in the prepared NSMCS can be easily adjusted by controlling the pyrolysis temperature. The NSMCS pyrolyzed at 900 degrees C ( NSMCS-900) exhibited higher oxygen reduction reaction activity than the mesoporous carbon sphere doped solely with nitrogen or sulfur, due to the synergistic effect of co-doping. Among all the NSMCS samples, NSMCS-900 exhibited excellent ORR catalytic activity owing to the presence of a highly active site, consisting of pyridinic N, graphitic N, and thiophene S. Remarkably, the NSMCS-900 catalyst was comparable with commercial Pt/C, in terms of the onset and the half-wave potentials and showed better durability than Pt/C for ORR in an alkaline electrolyte. The approach demonstrated in this work could be used to prepare promising metal-free electrocatalysts for application in energy conversion and storage. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, all-components, that are semi-char, tar and gas product obtained by Shenfu coal pyrolyzed under various residence time at 435 degrees C were comprehensively analyzed at molecular level, aiming to reveal the reaction pathways responsible for the evolution of chemical structure of coal/char. The results showed that CO2 and CO were the predominant pyrolysis gas product which inferred high content of organic oxygen species in low-rank Shenfu coal. At the initial stage of pyrolysis, cracking of bridged bonds, especially heteroatom bridged bonds, such as O, N and S, would produce relatively stable radicals in semi-char. Phase change of light components and decomposition of asphaltene in mobile phase can be strongly related with light tar aliphatic compounds formation. At the middle and later stage of pyrolysis, thermal cracking of polar radicals and decomposition of solvent extracted metaplast materials made predominant contribution to tar formation. In addition, the cracking of peripheral aromatic structures of coal/char skeleton structure, through which secondary reaction (such as methylation and dehydrogenation reaction) took place, would result in tar (light tar and heavy tar) and H-2 formation.									10	2	0	0	0	0	12			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000442977200040

Herein, we use the Ni0.85Se anchored on reduction of graphene oxide (Ni0.85Se/rGO) hybrid material skillfully established by one-step facile hydrothermal method as a robust and stable electrocatalyst applying to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In terms of morphology, Ni0.85Se nanospheres composed of many nanosheets are uniformly distributed on the graphene sheet layer. We also detailedly analyze its properties. Based on the interaction between Ni0.85Se and rGO, and the roles of graphene are as a substrate to heighten conductivity, possesses more active surface area by limiting growth of Ni0.85Se, and increases dispersion for exposing more active surface area and enlarge ion/ electron transfer rate. In HER, the Ni0.85Se/rGO catalyst displays the overpotential of 128 mV with a common current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 91 mV dec(-1), an extremely low onset potential of 37 mV, outstanding stability that a high current retention of 97.7% after 1000 cycles and well long-term stability for 18 h, outperforming the capability of Ni0.85Se nanospheres in alkaline solution for HER. The above results indicate that the Ni0.85Se/rGO hybrid material is a good HER ability and non-noble metal electrocatalyst has potential value in HER. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, bifunctional hybrid catalysts based on perovskite La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta with Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets have been prepared for Li-oxygen batteries as effective catalysts. It is the first time using high Li ionic diffusion Ti3C2Tx in Li-oxygen batteries system and making it, as substrate, in situ increase the high oxygen adsorption and O2- transport perovskite La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta. In this way, the hybrid catalysts show outstanding catalytic performance to facilitate the reaction kinetics, which display overpotential of only 0.87 V, lower than the Ti3C2Tx by about 540 mV and La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta by about 430 mV. The Li-oxygen batteries with LaSrCoO/Ti3C2Tx electrodes run more than 80 cycles at 500 mA g(-1) with capacity restriction of 1000 mAh g(-1), much better than Ti3C2Tx (9 cycles), La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (LS cycles), and other reported catalysts based on the perovskite. Moreover, the Li-oxygen batteries with LaSrCoO/Ti3C2Tx electrodes deliver the highest initial discharge capacity of about 11 340 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1), which is about twice those of the LaSrCoO cathode (6700 mAh g(-1)) and Ti3C2Tx (5210 mAh g(-1)). All the results suggest that the strategy would be a promising approach to enhance the performance of LOBs.									23	1	0	0	1	0	23			2574-0962			WOS:000473116600025

However, the atomic level interplay between active sites and catalytic activity is still an open question, owing to the large difference between idealized models and real catalysts. This stimulates us to pursue a suitable material model for studying the active sites-catalytic activity relationship, in which the atomically-thin two-dimensional sheets could serve as an ideal model, owing to their relatively simple type of active site and the ultrahigh fraction of active sites that are comparable to the overall atoms. In this tutorial review, we focus on the recent progress in disclosing the factors that affect the activity of reactive sites, including characterization of atomic coordination number, structural defects and disorder in ultrathin two-dimensional sheets by X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, positron annihilation spectroscopy, electron spin resonance and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. Also, we overview their applications in CO catalytic oxidation, photocatalytic water splitting, electrocatalytic oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, and hence highlight the atomic level interplay among coordination number, structural defects/disorder, active sites and catalytic activity in the two-dimensional sheets with atomic thickness. Finally, we also present the major challenges and opportunities regarding the role of active sites in catalysis. We believe that this review provides critical insights for understanding the catalysis and hence helps to develop new catalysts with high catalytic activity.									692	45	0	0	62	0	700			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000348922100002	25382246

This method employs relatively low synthesis temperatures to afford single-phase samples of various binary and ternary metal borides, such as Fe2B, Co2B, Ni3B, TiB2, VB2, CrB2, and Ni2CoB. This synthesis protocol can be utilized for the topotactic transformation of metal shapes into their respective borides, as exemplified by transformation of Ni foam to Ni3B foam. In situ powder X-ray diffraction studies of the Ni-BI3 system showed that the crystalline nickel borides, Ni4B3 and Ni2B, start to form at temperatures as low as 700 K and 877 K, respectively, which is significantly lower than the typical synthesis temperatures required to produce these borides. Ni3B synthesized by this method was tested as a supporting material for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media. Composite electrocatalysts of IrO2/Ni3B with only 50% of IrO2 exhibit current densities and stability similar to pure IrO2 at mass loadings lower than 0.5 mg cm(-2), indicating Ni3B could be a promising supporting material for acidic OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000862891800001

Molecular and homogeneous catalysts have the advantage to clarify the catalytic mechanisms by detecting active intermediates in catalytic water oxidation. On the other hand, heterogeneous nanoparticle catalysts have advantages for practical applications due to high catalytic activity, robustness and easier separation of catalysts by filtration as compared with molecular homogeneous precursors. Ligand oxidation of homogeneous catalysts sometimes results in the dissociation of ligands to form nanoparticles, which act as much more efficient catalysts for water oxidation. Since it is quite difficult to identify active intermediates on the heterogeneous catalyst surface, the mechanism of water oxidation has hardly been clarified under heterogeneous catalytic conditions. This review focuses on the kinetics and mechanisms of catalytic water oxidation with homogeneous catalysts, which may be converted to heterogeneous nanoparticle catalysts depending on various reaction conditions.									33	3	0	0	3	0	33			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000457270000002	30560964

Herein, we report for the first time a new concept of selective single-atom doping with high loading via the crystal-lattice mismatch of a multicomponent hetero-nanostructure. Hetero-nanostructures, with exceptional properties, bring numerous vacancy defects or voids in the hetero-interfaces between the two different components, which can trap more atoms. In this work, single Pt atoms with an ultrahigh loading density of 2.8 wt% are selectively anchored on NiS in a three-dimensional flower-like NiS@Al2O3 heterostructure. This novel strategy can be expanded to a series of transition metal sulfide (TMS, NiS2, CoS2, and MnS) composites with large crystal-lattice mismatch. Pt atom doping remarkably enhances the catalytic performance. The Pt/NiS@Al2O3 exhibits an extremely high catalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction, with a low overpotential of 34 mV and an excellent stability with a 2% increase in overpotential following 120 h under a constant density of 10 mA cm(-2).									36	3	0	0	2	0	38			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000436516700019

The as-grown SiC quasi-aligned nanowires show a gray color on carbon paper with a (111) single crystalline orientation of the 3C-SiC structure. The growth mechanism of 3C-SiC is proposed with the vapor-solid mechanism. The prepared 3C-SiC nanowires exhibited a wide UV-vis absorption range with a bandgap of 2.15 eV, making it a potential semiconductor for the photoelectrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (PEC-OER). Photo-deposited RuOx/SiC/C substrates were prepared as SiC-based nanostructures for the PEC-OER, showing an efficient OER photoelectroactivity with a 350 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) and a significant power photoconversion efficiency of 54%.

Unlike the more traditional bottom-up approach, in which the kinetic parameters are intended to be calculated using first principles, herein we show a phenomenological alternative to determine them. In this case, the model parameters are fitted by comparison between the empirical and simulated kinetic responses. From this perspective, it can be clearly observed that a kinetic model simulating only the stationary response of a system, as is usual in many studies reported in the literature, is not very representative of the chemical process under study. In this way, a mechanistic proposal of a chemical reaction gains greater credibility when it is supported by a robust microkinetic model that also simulates the dynamic response, i.e. the evolution of variables over time. In this sense, we highlight the advantages of the self-organized phenomena, observed in many chemical reactions, to validate a microkinetic model. Our discussion is focused on the electrocatalytic oxidation reactions of low-molar-mass organic compounds as case studies, but this approach can be extrapolated to other complex catalyzed reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000774175700001

Linear sweep voltammetry and Cyclic voltammetry tests were conducted to study the effect of temperature and concentrations. SEM-EDS and XRD were employed to study the surface characterisations and chemical compositions. The results revealed that the electrowinning operating conditions are more appropriate than the purification conditions for MnO2 removal. The highest current efficiency of manganese removal was 21% which was obtained in the EW electrolyte at 125 A m(-2) at 40 degrees C after 2 h of electrolysis. The Current Efficiency was increased significantly at lower Mn ion concentrations (0.1-1.0 g L-1) while it stayed constant beyond the concentration of 1.0 g L-1. The results showed that an increase in temperature depolarised the oxygen evolution reaction and the addition of Mn2+ suppressed formation of PbO2 on anode surface.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2572-6641	2572-665X		WOS:000713048100001

In this brief report, we show that on many single atom sites, adsorption of more than one hydrogen is sometimes even more thermodynamically favorable, with the presence of two or three hydrogens resulting in lower adsorption energies. These interesting non-monotonic trends indicate that modeling HER and other hydrogen-related reactions on under-coordinated sites should also consider the numbers of hydrogen being adsorbed at the same site, otherwise the results could deviate from real experimental situations.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16				2073-4344		WOS:000459732000083

The formed TNAs-C is then loaded with MoSx via electrochemical deposition to prepare MoSx/TNAs-C electrodes. The microstructure, morphology, and chemical composition of the samples are analyzed with XRD, XPS, EDS, SEM, and TEM. LSV, CV, Tafel, and EIS are conducted to provide electrochemical properties. Experimental results illustrate that carbonization of TNAs elevates the electron transport between the electrode and electrolyte, and within the electrode. The electrochemical desorption on the electrode surface is enhanced to promote the catalytic efficiency. Compared to MoSx/TNAs, MoSx/TNAs-C(0.2) offers overpotentials of 109 and 139 mV at current densities of -10 and -20 mA cm(-2), decreases of 33 and 42 mV, respectively.

To maximize reactivity toward both entails limiting the catalyst size while maintaining reactivity and avoiding aggregation. Frame-like hollow nanostructures (nanoframes) provide the required open structure with sufficient channels into the interior volume. We demonstrate here the design and synthesis of CoP nanoframes (CoP NFs) by a strategy involving precipitation, chemical etching, and low-temperature phosphidation steps. It results in impressive bifunctional catalytic activities for both HER and OER and consequently enables a highly efficient water electrolyzer with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) driven by a cell voltage of only 1.65 V. The strategy has been generalized for the preparation of nanoframe Co dichalcogenides CoX2 NFs, with X = S, Se, and Te. The results of electrochemical measurements, supported by density functional theory calculations, show that HER catalytic activities for the series follow the sequence: CoP NFs > CoSe2 NFs > CoS2 NFs > CoTe2 NFs.									207	14	0	0	8	0	212			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100046

The mechanism for generation of ER spectra by electromodulation of optical polarizability of the water layer adsorbed on the surface and in the surface layers of an IrO2 him is suggested. The mechanism helps explain the nonmonotonic potential dependence of the energy of optical transitions involving charge transfer from water molecules to vacant states of the 5d(e(g)) and 5d(t(2g)) IrO2 bands and the nature of sign inversion in the real part of ER observed at some potentials.

Exploring the relationship between the A-site cation and the structure of the active site (Ru) is highly desirable for designing efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, we rationally manipulate the substitution of the A-site atoms in Y<INF>2</INF>Ru<INF>2</INF>O<INF>7</INF> (YRO) by Ho<SUP>3+</SUP>, which has an identical ionic radius to Y<SUP>3+</SUP> but higher electronegativity due to the 4f electron effect. It was demonstrated that the higher electronegativity could enlarge the Ru-O-Ru bond angle and reduce the Ru-O bond length, mitigating the RuO<INF>6</INF> octahedral distortion in Ho<INF>2</INF>Ru<INF>2</INF>O<INF>7</INF> (HRO) for enhancing the intrinsic OER activity. Compared with other pyrochlore oxides, HRO displayed an ultralow overpotential of 215 mV @ 10 mA cm<SUP>-2</SUP> with lower Ru content and higher mass activities, showing long-term (>60 h) stability in acid media. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the higher electronegativity of Ho could strengthen the Ru-O covalency, thereby optimizing the free energy of oxygen species (Delta G<INF>OOH*</INF> - Delta G<INF>O<INF>2</INF></INF>) for better catalytic activity. In addition, the higher electronegativity could reduce the oxygen vacancies and improve the formation energy of oxygen vacancies for better resistance to Ru dissolution. This work reveals the inherent relationship of the A-site atom electronegativity, the lattice structure of the active site, and the activity-stability of the catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000775101500001

The experimental approach advanced combines different working modes and methodologies available in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), i.e. in-situ TEM and electron tomography as carried out on the very same object. The results clearly show the role of the temperature, and the environment on the ratio of encapsulated Ag NPs and on both the morphology and crystallinity of the TiO2 support. Apart from the morphology changes, this study stands as a fundamental investigation of the mechanisms of NPs coarsening particularly by Ostwald ripening. This type of behaviour can be definitely associated to the morphology changes induced by a photocatalytic reactions commonly carried out on TiO2 supports. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study reports significantly enhanced activity of a cobalt-containing carbonaceous catalyst used for the hydrogen-evolution reaction in a water electrolyzer by using a proton-exchange membrane (PEM), which is an efficient energy-conversion device that is suitable for intermittent renewable energy sources. On the basis of X-ray absorption near-edge structure, the enhancement in activity was attributed to a change in the local structure surrounding the Co atom. The PEM water electrolyzer formed by using the catalyst with an optimized structure and Co surface concentration showed an enthalpy efficiency of 80% at 1 A cm(-2).									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000340574600006

However, the transformation processes were different under different temperatures. At 200 degrees C, the transformation was mainly completed through atomic addition, while there was a contribution from both atomic addition and oriented attachment at 220 degrees C. The electrocatalytic performance towards the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) indicated the dendrites exhibited higher catalytic activity and better durability relative to the cuboctahedrons. For the cuboctahedrons with different compositions, the catalytic activity is mainly determined by the d-band position. This provides new insights into the controlled synthesis of Pt-based bimetallic nanoalloys and advances the understanding of their catalytic behaviour.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1466-8033			WOS:000336839900020

Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammograms (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), open circuit potential (OCP), and other analytical methods were used to investigate the electrochemical performances of the Pb-Na alloys in 1.28 g cm(-3) H2SO4 solution. The results indicate that the addition of sodium reduces the generation of PbO and PbSO4 greatly during anodic process, inhibits the oxygen evolution reaction and accelerates the evolution of hydrogen, and the Pb-Na alloys have good cycle performance and corrosion resistance properties. The alloys retain the merits, whilst removing the flaws, of the pure grid, thereby providing a promising positive grid alloy for spirally wound lead acid batteries.

Herein, hetero-structured Cu/Co93Cu7 nanoparticles confined inside N-doped carbon nanocages (denoted as Cu/Co93Cu7@NC NCs) are fabricated through a facile "MOF-in situ-reduction and in situ-growth-MOF" strategy. Benefiting from the unique hollow architecture and superior intrinsic activity of the optimized interfaces, the as-prepared catalyst displays an appealing electrocatalytic performance including a positive half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.88 V for ORR and a low OER over-potential of 262 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Theoretical calculations further disclose the key role of the rationally designed Co/Cu/N-doped carbon heterostructures, which significantly reduces the energy barrier for *OOH formation and eventually promotes the ORR. Rechargeable Zn-air batteries assembled with the Cu/Co93Cu7@NC NCs exhibit a large specific capacity of 884.9 mAh g(Zn)(-1) and a maximum power density of 225.9 mW cm(-2). Moreover, the assembled batteries are stable for 1000 h during the long-term charge and discharge cycling, demonstrating the great promise for practical applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000860454900001

This work presents highly porous carbon (HPC), derived from waste tree leaves, as a low-cost carbon-based bifunctional electrocatalyst. To further improve the catalytic activity, nitrogen and sulfur doping in HPC is achieved by treating it with urea (CO(NH2)(2)) and thiourea (CS(NH2)(2)), respectively. The electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of the HPC, N-doped HPC, and S-doped HPC have been investigated. Among them, the N-doped HPC was found to show excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic (ORR/OER) activity. The N-doped HPC exhibited a superior bifunctional catalytic activity with an onset potential of 0.95 V (vs RHE) at a current density of 6.31 mA cm(-2), whereas in the case of the OER, the observed onset potential was 1.4 V (vs RHE), which is comparable to that of the benchmark RuO2 (1.45 V vs RHE) catalyst. The assembled hybrid Na-air battery exhibited reversible electrochemical performance with a round-trip efficiency of similar to 83% over 30 cycles. These economical bifunctional HPC-based catalysts can be effectively employed as air cathodes in hybrid sodium-air battery applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000830769700001

However, low active site density and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity hinder the further improvement of Zn-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, the macromolecules of the different nitrogen sites have been rationally designed and fabricated to create a carbon material with a high content of pyridine N. On this basis, the activated carbon matrix allows the halfway reduction of Fe3+ to Fex+, which is coordinated with pyridinic N to form a high-loading Fe-pyridinic N bonding structure. It also stimulates the complete reduction of Fe3+ to a single Fe atom on a 3D sponge carbon structure (named Fe/Fe-NC-3). Benefiting from pyridine N, the Fe-pyridinic N-bonding structure, single atom dispersion, and hierarchical pore channels, the Fe/Fe-NC-3 shows superior ORR and OER electrochemical activity, approaching that of the commercial Pt/C and IrO2. In addition, Fe/Fe-NC-3 as a ZAB air-electrode exhibits outstanding stability for over 500 h and a remarkable power density of 304.4 mW cm(-2) in reversible ZABs. Moreover, the flexible ZABs deliver a high open-circuit voltage of 1.35 V, stable voltage gap under flat/bent states, and discharge voltage at 2 mA cm(-2). This study provides a new perspective for preparing bifunctional catalysts with enriched active sites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000855106200001		
J	Lai, Henry								Exposure to Static and Extremely-Low Frequency Electromagnetic Fields and Cellular Free Radicals								ELECTROMAGNETIC BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE				38	4			231	248		10.1080/15368378.2019.1656645		AUG 2019		OCT 2 2019	2019	This paper summarizes studies on changes in cellular free radical activities from exposure to static and extremely-low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic fields (EMF), particularly magnetic fields. Changes in free radical activities, including levels of cellular reactive oxygen (ROS)/nitrogen (RNS) species and endogenous antioxidant enzymes and compounds that maintain physiological free radical concentrations in cells, is one of the most consistent effects of EMF exposure. These changes have been reported to affect many physiological functions such as DNA damage; immune response; inflammatory response; cell proliferation and differentiation; wound healing; neural electrical activities; and behavior. An important consideration is the effects of EMF-induced changes in free radicals on cell proliferation and differentiation. These cellular processes could affect cancer development and proper growth and development in organisms. On the other hand, they could cause selective killing of cancer cells, for instance, via the generation of the highly cytotoxic hydroxyl free radical by the Fenton Reaction. This provides a possibility of using these electromagnetic fields as a non-invasive and low side-effect cancer therapy. Static- and ELF-EMF probably play important roles in the evolution of living organisms. They are cues used in many critical survival functions, such as foraging, migration, and reproduction. Living organisms can detect and respond immediately to low environmental levels of these fields. Free radical processes are involved in some of these mechanisms. At this time, there is no credible hypothesis or mechanism that can adequately explain all the observed effects of static- and ELF-EMF on free radical processes. We are actually at the impasse that there are more questions than answers.									28	1	2	0	20	0	31			1536-8378	1536-8386		WOS:000483714700001	31450976	
B	Hutchings, G.S.								Advanced nanostructured materials for energy storage and conversion								Advanced nanostructured materials for energy storage and conversion								173 pp	173 pp						2015	2015	Due to a global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to utilize renewable sources of energy, much effort has been directed towards creating new alternatives to fossil fuels. Identifying novel materials for energy storage and conversion can enable radical changes to the current fuel production infrastructure and energy utilization. The use of engineered nanostructured materials in these systems unlocks unique catalytic activity in practical configurations. In this work, research efforts have been focused on the development of nanostructured materials to address the need for both better energy conversion and storage, with applications toward Li-O2 battery electrocatalysts, electrocatalytic generation of H2, conversion of furfural to useful chemicals and fuels, and Li battery anode materials. Highly-active alpha-MnO2 materials were synthesized for use as bifunctional oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution (OER) catalysts in Li-O2 batteries, and were evaluated under operating conditions with a novel in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy configuration. Through detailed analysis of local coordination and oxidation states of Mn atoms at key points in the electrochemical cycle, a selfswitching behavior affecting the bifunctional activity was identified and found to be critical. In an additional study of materials for lithium batteries, nanostructured TiO2 anode materials doped with first-row transition metals were synthesized and evaluated for improving battery discharge capacity and rate performance, with Ni and Co doping at low levels found to cause the greatest enhancement. In addition to battery technology research, I have also sought to find inexpensive and earth-abundant electrocatalysts to replace stateof-the-art Pt/C in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a systematic computational study of Cu-based bimetallic electrocatalysts was performed. During the screening of dilute surface alloys of Cu mixed with other first-row transition metals, materials with ideal hydrogen binding energies were identified. Bulk alloy electrocatalysts with comparable compositions to the model surfaces were synthesized and tested for performance in alkaline, neutral, and acidic conditions. Cu-Ti was found to exhibit the lowest overpotentials and highest overall performance, and was redesigned as a nanoporous catalyst which achieved higher current at lower overpotentials than even commercial Pt/C, with remarkably high stability. Through applying design principles developed during the HER work, self-supported nanoporous Cu-Co alloy catalysts were synthesized for the improvement of product selectivity and overall conversion of reactants in furfural hydro(deoxy)genation. Under vapor-phase reaction conditions, it was found that adding 1% to 10% oxophilic Co in a solid solution with Cu enhanced overall conversion towards products. In particular, a Cu95Co5 alloy produced 64.9% yield of 2-methylfuran at a high sustained total conversion of 85.0% and under moderate temperature conditions, which is the highest 2-methylfuran production reported for nonprecious catalysts. Further analysis at a wider range of temperature conditions and sustained reaction time on stream provided a more detailed understanding of the behavior of these nanoporous materials, and possible mechanistic explanations of the high activity for Cu-Co are proposed to aid in the design of new materials with even higher product selectivities.									0	0	0		0	0	0					978-13-394-8723-6	INSPEC:16316564

The IrO2-Ta2O5 coatings were prepared by traditional thermal decomposition with mixing H2IrCl6 center dot 6H(2)O dissolved in hydrochloric acid and TaCl5 dissolved in alcohol with a mole ratio of 7:6. SEM, FESEM and XRD were employed to observe the surface morphology and analyze the matter phases of the anodes. CV and EIS were employed to study the electrochemical properties of the anodes. Mott-Schottky was employed to analyze the semiconducting behavior of the anodes. The anode with hydrogen treated substrate at 600 degrees C had the largest real surface area and the best electro-catalytic activities of all the anodes. The anode with nitrogen treated substrate at 600 degrees C did not own the best electro-catalytic activities, but its semiconducting behavior exhibited the advantage of being conducive to oxygen evolution.

J	NABER, JD; VANRENSEN, JJS; GOVINDJEE				Govindjee, Govindjee/ABF-3362-2021				HIGH MISSES AFTER ODD FLASHES IN OXYGEN EVOLUTION IN THOROUGHLY DARK-ADAPTED THYLAKOIDS FROM PEA AND CHENOPODIUM-ALBUM								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				38	3			309	314		10.1007/BF00046755				DEC 1993	1993	In Photosystem II (PS II), water is oxidized to molecular oxygen and plastoquinone is reduced to plastoquinol. The oxidation of water requires the accumulation of four oxidizing equivalents, through the so-called S-states of the oxygen evolving complex; the production of plastoquinol requires the accumulation of two reducing equivalents on a bound plastoquinone, Q(B). It has been generally believed that during the flash-induced transition of each of the S-states (S-n --> S-n+1 where n = 0, 1, 2 and 3), a certain small but equal fraction of the PS II reaction centers are unable to function and, thus, 'miss' being turned over. We used thoroughly dark-adapted thylakoids from peas (Pisum sativum) and Chenopodium album (susceptible and resistant to atrazine) starting with 100% of the oxygen evolving complex in the S-1 state. Thylakoids were illuminated with saturating flashes, providing a double hit parameter of about 0.07. Our experimental data on flash-number dependent oscillations in the amount of oxygen per flash fit very well with a binary pattern of misses: 0, 0.2, 0, 0.4 during S-0 --> S-1, S-1 --> S-2, S-2 --> S-3 and S-3 --> S-0 transitions. Addition of 2 mM ferricyanide appears to shift this pattern by one flash. These results are consistent with the 'bicycle' model recently proposed by V. P. Shinkarev and C. A. Wraight (Oxygen evolution in photosynthesis: From unicycle to bicycle, 1993, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90: 1834-183.8), where misses are due to the presence of P+ or Q(A)(-) among the various equilibrium states of PS II centers.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0166-8595			WOS:A1993MX41700010	24317984

The steel corroded in splash environment exhibits the high pit number density, high maximum pit depth, and high cathodic reaction activity, resulting in the most severe SCC degradation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:000834207600001

Using this modification, the PECs are able to perform overall water splitting instead of only hydrogen generation. The probable reasons for the improvement are that the photogenerated holes in the CdS valence band could be rapidly removed by DPABA, which facilitates charge separation and thus suppresses the photocorrosion process. The use of such a method might further improve the performance of overall water splitting, together with superior light-absorption sensitizers and more suitable molecular relays with better oxygen evolution reaction catalytic properties.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2196-0216			WOS:000383623400025

An ELF Analysis of the Reaction of Nitroethylene with Dimethylvinylamine								CURRENT ORGANIC CHEMISTRY				16	19			2343	2351						OCT 2012	2012	The bonding evolution in hetero-Diels-Alder (HDA) reactions has been studied by an ELF analysis of the electron reorganization along the HDA reaction between nitroethylene 6 and dimethylvinylamine (DMVA) 9 at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. This cycloaddition takes place along a two-stages one-step mechanism. In the first stage of the reaction, the C1-C6 bond is formed by coupling of two pseudoradical centers positioned at the most electrophilic carbon of nitroethylene 6 and the most nucleophilic center of DMVA 9. In the second stage, the formation of the second O4-C7 bond takes place between a pseudoradical center positioned at the C7 carbon of DMVA and some electron-density provided by the lone pairs of the O4 oxygen. This behavior is in complete agreement with the analyses of the local electrophilicity and nucleophilicity indices, and the spin density of the radical anion of nitroethylene 6 and of the radical cation of DMVA 9. Finally, a relationship between the polar character of the reaction and the regioselectivity is established.									20	1	0	0	6	1	20			1385-2728	1875-5348		WOS:000310472200010

An open-framework material, cobalt ethylenediammonium bis(sulfate) tetrahydrate, was initially used as an efficient co-catalyst to improve photocatalytic HER of g-C3N4. The unique open-framework cobalt(II) sulfate (Co-S) lead to twice higher H-2 evolution performance (10328.9 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) compared to noble metal (Pt)-decorated g-C3N4 photocatalyst under simulated sunlight. The open network structure provides abundant active sites and excellent electron transport properties, properties and then promotes electron-hole separation, which play a synergistic role with g-C3N4 in the photocatalytic process. The loading of Co-S significantly changes the microenvironment of the catalyst surface of g-C3N4 and enhances its hydrophilicity, which benefits the release of the produced gas on the catalyst surface. The formation of the Co(I) species in the open-framework material by the electron reduction of Co(II) is proposed as a vital role in the extraordinary HER process.									23	1	0	0	3	0	24			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000552015900037

In this work, we introduce a generic and scalable synthetic method by dealloying a series of Al-rich precursor alloys to produce Mn3O4-based and FeCo-based spinel oxide nanocomposites. It is found that these Mn3O4-based oxides are highly active for the ORR; doping Mn3O4 with Co further enhances the activity while doping with Fe decreases it. For the OER, doping the FeCo-based oxides with Cr, V, or Ni significantly enhances the activity among which Cr is the most effective dopant. Moreover, the addition of Ni into the precursor alloy would inhibit the doping of the negative Fe element into the obtained Mn3O4 after dealloying an AIFeCoNiMn precursor. The obtained (FeCoNi)(3)O-4/Mn3O4 nanocomposite exhibits a high bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, which is comparable with that of the commercial Pt/C + IrO2 combination. When incorporated into a Zn-air battery, the battery can be stably discharged/charged over 400 h with an open-circuit voltage of 1.44 V and a narrow voltage gap of similar to 0.7 V at 2.0 mA cm(-2).									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2574-0962			WOS:000563784400051

The cationic distributions were computed from XRD, XPS, magnetism and oxidation power measurements showing the presence of the Co3+/Co2+ and Mn4+/Mn3+ solid state redox couples and also vacancies in octahedral sites. The electrocatalytic activity and kinetic parameters for the orr were determined using the RRDE technique in I M KOH solution at 25 degreesC. Two Tafel zones of slopes b(c1) and b(c2) around -60 and -120 mV dec(-1) were observed. The disk current/ring current ratio, (I-D/I-R), increases with x and decreases with the applied overpotential. At constant overpotential eta the real electrocatalytical current densities j increase when x increases. The orr can be characterized by an intrinsic kinetic parameter J' obtained from this current ratio at various electrode rotational frequencies. This J' increases with the redox couple Co2+/Co3+ ratio, increasing more in the bulk than at the surface of the electrode. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The development of new electrocatalysts to make renewable and clean fuels from abundant and easily accessible resources is among the most challenging and demanding tasks for today's scientists and engineers. The electrochemical splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen has been known for over 200 years, but in the last decade and motivated by the perspective of solar hydrogen production, new catalysts made of earth-abundant materials have emerged. Here we present an overview of recent developments in the non-noble metal catalysts for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Emphasis is given to the nanostructuring of industrially relevant hydrotreating catalysts as potential HER electrocatalysts. The new syntheses and nanostructuring approaches might pave the way for future development of highly efficient catalysts for energy conversion.									1669	94	2	0	82	0	1690			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000340780400006	24626338

The films were synthesized on iron substrates with the aid of supercritical carbon dioxide. The experimental results demonstrated that the supercritical carbon dioxide could play an important role in evolution of phases and morphologies during the reaction process. Moreover, the prepared films were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM and EDS. The UV-vis absorption spectroscopy indicated that the absorption edge has obvious blue shift compared with bulk FeS2. Interestingly, characteristics of photoelectric response and water photolysis were shown by photoelectrochemical experiments under sunlight. Therefore, the prepared films would have an advantage in water photolysis utilizing sunlight.									27	0	0	0	2	0	27				2046-2069		WOS:000295852200011

In this work, antimony doped tin oxide nanoparticles were synthesized and further doped with an inorganic proton conducting phase based on tin pyrophosphates as the catalyst support. The materials showed an overall conductivity of 0.57 S cm(-1) at 130 degrees C under the water vapor atmosphere with a contribution of the proton conduction. Using this composite support, iridium oxide nanoparticle catalysts were prepared and characterized in sulfuric and phosphoric acid electrolytes, showing much enhanced catalytic activity. Electrolyzer tests were conducted at both 80 degrees C with an Aquivion (TM) membrane and at 130 degrees C with a phosphoric acid doped Aquivion (TM) membrane. Significant improvement in the anodic kinetics was achieved on the composite supported catalysts at 130 degrees C although the electrolyzer cells showed higher ohmic resistance primarily from the membrane and catalyst layer. A durability test of electrolyzer cells was carried out at 130 degrees C under a current density of 400 mA cm(-2) in a period of up to 760 h, showing rather good stability of the system.

Previously reported water oxidation catalysts have limited activity and selectivity, imposing a bottleneck for broad adoption of this technology. We identify ZnO as a new stable, nontoxic, active, and selective catalyst for 2e-WOR to generate H2O2. Using density functional theory calculations, we propose that the (10 (1) over bar0) facet of ZnO is an effective catalyst for 2e-WOR and confirm the prediction experimentally. We synthesize ZnO nanoparticles with a high fraction of (10 (1) over bar0) facets and find that this catalyst gives an overpotential of 40 mV at 0.1 mA/cm(2) and peak Faradaic efficiency of 81% toward H2O2 evolution.									93	1	0	0	9	0	94			2155-5435			WOS:000467335600083

In comparison to electrochemical systems, PEC cells directly utilize solar energy as the energy input, and if necessary, then an additional external bias can be applied to drive the desired reaction. In this work, a PEC cell composing of a Ni-coated Si photoanode and a nanoporous Ag cathode was developed for CO2 conversion to CO. The thin Ni layer not only protected the Si wafer from photocorrosion but also served as the oxygen evolution catalyst. At an external bias of 2.0 V, the PEC cell delivered a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a CO Faradaic efficiency of similar to 70%. More importantly, a stable performance up to 3 h was achieved under photoelectrolysis conditions, which is among the best literature-reported performances for PEC CO2 reduction cells. The photovoltage of the PEC cell was estimated to be similar to 0.4 V, which corresponded to a 17% energy saving by solar energy utilization. Postreaction structural analysis showed the corrosion of the Ni layer at the Si photoanode/catalyst interface, which caused performance degradation under prolonged operations. Astable oxygen evolution catalyst with a robust interface is crucial to the long-term stability of PEC CO2 reduction cells.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000384033600046	27588723

The performance of WO3 photoanode could be hindered by its poor oxygen evolution reaction kinetics and high charge carrier recombination rate. Additionally, scalable and cost-effective commercial procedure to prepare nanostructured electrodes is still challenging. We present, for the first time, a novel and scalable method to fabricate highly efficient self-supported WO3/W nanostructured photoanodes from commercial W-Cu powder metallurgy (P/M) parts for water splitting. The electrodes were prepared by electrochemical etching of Cu networks followed by hydrothermal growth of WO3 nanoflakes. Interconnected channels of W skeleton provided high active surface area for the growth of WO3 nanoflakes with a thickness of similar to 40 nm and lateral dimension of similar to 250 nm. The optimized photoelectrode having 35% interconnected porosity exhibited an impressive current density of 4.36 mA cm(-2) comprising a remarkable photocurrent of 1.71 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE under 100 mW cm(-2) simulated sunlight. This achievement is amongst the highest reported photocurrents for WO3 photoelectrodes with tungsten substrate reported so far. Impedance and Mott-Schottky analyses evidenced fast charge transfer, low recombination rate, and accelerated O-2 detachment provided by optimum 3D porous WO3/W electrode. Due to the nature of the commercial P/M parts and low-temperature hydrothermal processing, the procedure is cost-effective and scalable which can pave a new route for the fabrication of highly porous and efficient water splitting electrodes.

However, what advanced glycation end product structure could evoke inflammatory reactions remains unknown. We examined whether and how methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone 1, one of the advanced glycation end products formed from glyceraldehyde, elicits inflammatory reactions in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.Materials and methods: Glyceraldehyde-advanced glycation end products-aptamer was prepared using a systemic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment. The binding affinities of methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone 1 to receptor for advanced glycation end products or advanced glycation end product-aptamer were measured with a quartz crystal microbalance. Intracellular reactive oxygen species generation and THP-1 cell adhesion were evaluated using fluorescent probes. Gene expression was analysed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.Results: Methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone 1 bound to receptor for advanced glycation end products and advanced glycation end product-aptamer with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 56.7 mu M and 1.51 mM, respectively. Methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone 1 at 100 ae g/mL significantly increased reactive oxygen species generation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which were attenuated by anti-receptor for advanced glycation end products antibody or advanced glycation end product-aptamer. In all, 100 mu g/mL methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone 1 significantly increased receptor for advanced glycation end products and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 messenger RNA levels in, and THP-1 cell adhesion to, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, all of which were blocked by anti-receptor for advanced glycation end products antibody.Conclusion: Our present results indicate that methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone 1 evokes inflammatory reactions in human umbilical vein endothelial cells via receptor for advanced glycation end products, although apparently limited to supraphysiological levels of methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone 1. Methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone 1 is a distinct advanced glycation end product structure that could mediate harmful effects of methylglyoxal and glyceraldehyde-mediated glycation processes.									15	0	0	0	12	0	15			1479-1641	1752-8984		WOS:000411509000009	28631505

However, Zn-air batteries suffer from sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during the discharge and charge process. Herein, a FeN2-doped carbon with a unique three-dimensional (3D) porous structure (CeO2-FeNC-5) was synthesized as an electrocatalyst for Zn-air batteries by one-step pyrolysis and introducing CeO2 to tune the coordination environment of Fe atoms. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) results indicate that the introduction of CeO2 can convert FeN3 moieties into FeN2 moieties. The CeO2-FeNC-5 exhibits a more positive half-wave potential of 0.902V for ORR, and a low overpotential of 0.327V at 10mAcm-2 for OER. Furthermore, the Zn-air battery with CeO2-FeNC-5 achieve a maximum power density (169 mW cm-2), a high open voltage platform (1.47V) and superior cycling stability (200h). The unique 3D porous structure provides channels for mass transport and exposes sufficient active sites to facilitate the ORR and OER processes. Calculations prove that FeN2 moieties are beneficial to O2 adsorption on Fe/N-doped carbon surface. This work provides an effective strategy for designing and synthesizing FeNx-doped carbon matrix electrocatalysts for sustainable metal-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1095-7103		MEDLINE:36163054	36163054

The surface chemistry and surface electronic structures of the La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta (LSC) perovskite is greatly modified upon postsynthesis sintering. Herein, a new strategy has been demonstrated by intense pulsed light technology to accomplish the sintering process in milliseconds, and is comparatively explored with conventionally sintered LSC. The optimized sintering conditions rejuvenated a new class of a highly active bifunctional LSC electrocatalyst. The electrochemical activity and surface characteristics are orders of magnitude superior to those of the thermally sintered LSC. The best performing LSC catalyst known as LSC 30 exhibits outstanding bifunctionality with a low overpotential (similar to 0.89 V). Furthermore, LSC 30 shows a positively shifted onset potential of 0.92 V and a high limiting current of -6.1 mA cm(-2) at 20 mV s(-1), during the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline medium. 'When tested as the air cathode of a zinc-air battery, LSC 30 delivered a steady performance for 200 cycles.

High-energy X-ray diffraction (HE-XRD) offered insights in the evolution of the morphology and structure of RTO-supported Pt nanoparticles during potential cycling. The changes of the atomic composition were tracked in situ using scanning flow cell measurements coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SFC-ICP-MS). We excluded Pt agglomeration, particle growth, dissolution, or detachment as cause for the observed losses in catalytic ORR. activity. Instead, we argue that Pt surface poisoning is the most likely cause of the observed catalytic rate decrease. Data suggest that the gradual growth of a thin oxide layer on the Pt nanoparticles due to strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) is the most plausible reason for the suppressed catalytic activity. We discuss the implications of the identified catalyst degradation pathway, which appear to be specific for oxide supports. Our conclusions offer previously unaddressed aspects related to oxide-supported metal particle electrocatalysts frequently deployed in fuel cells, electrolyzers, or metal-air batteries.									32	0	0	0	0	0	32			2155-5435			WOS:000447224100076

Binder-free self-supported bifunctional catalysts can provide large active surface area, fast electron transport path, easy ion diffusion, and excellent structural stability and flexibility, thus acting as promising flexible air cathodes. In this review, recent advances on the application of nanoarrayed electrocatalysts as air cathodes in flexible Zn-air batteries are reviewed. Especially, various types of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts, including carbonaceous material arrays, transition metal compound arrays, transition metal/carbon arrays, transition metal compound/carbon arrays, and other hybrid arrays, are discussed. The applications of flexible Zn-air batteries with two configurations (i.e., planar stacks and cable fibers) are also introduced. Finally, perspectives on the optimization of arrayed air cathodes for future development to achieve high-performance flexible Zn-air batteries are shared.									55	5	0	0	2	0	55			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000547962100001	32639086

However, it is difficult to remove these contaminants on the mural surfaces without any damage to the substrate. Herein, atmospheric pressure nonequilibrium plasma (APNP) cleaning, as a potential tool to conserve and restore cultural heritage, was proposed to eliminate the contaminants on the surface of ancient Chinese murals. The experiments demonstrated that APNP was more suitable for cleaning hydrocarbon contaminants such as soot than dust. The soot containing carbonaceous particles on the mural surface could be removed entirely by APNP and did not cause significant changes to physicochemical properties on the mural interface. We found that critical plasma cleaning time and working distance were crucial for eliminating contaminants and protecting the surface of murals in an actual situation. Meanwhile, reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations were performed to simulate the complex reaction processes of removing soot contaminants by APNP. During RMD simulation, the possible reaction pathway and evolution behavior of chemical bonds of reactive oxygen species dissociating carbonaceous molecules were analyzed. 'The increased mobility capacity of atomic oxygen in the system facilitated the cleavage of carbonaceous molecular structures. (c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The purpose of investigation was to evaluate the effect of cobalt on the intrinsic catalytic activity of nickel. Cyclic voltammetry measurements, performed in a wide potential range from hydrogen to oxygen evolution, clearly showed the potential range of formation and reduction metal oxides / hydroxides. Electrocatalytic activity of the investigated electrodes was derived from pseudo-steadystate linear polarization curves, Tafel plots and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Electrochemical impedance spectra obtained in potential range of hydrogen evolution were modeled with modified Randles electric equivalent circuit. Kinetic parameters (the exchange current density and the cathodic Tafel slope), determined from linear polarization measurements and electrochemical impedance measurements, were compared for all three electrode materials. Ni57.3Co42.7 catalyst has shown better electrocatalytic activity compared with pure Co. The main pathway for the HER at investigated electrode materials is Volmer-Heyrovski with Heyrovsky as the rate determining step.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0011-1643	1334-417X		WOS:000416047000021

However, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen cathode reactions lead to huge energy loss, while the unfavorable side reactions associated with the widely used carbon and binder account for fast battery decay during cycles. Herein, hierarchically holey IrNi alloy nanosheets are facilely designed on Ni foam substrate as a freestanding, binder- and carbon-free cathode to address these challenges. The IrNi nanosheets consist of numerous interconnected nanoparticles, forming abundant nanoholes, benefiting active-site exposure. Moreover, the meso-/macropores pave channels for the transfer of oxygen and lithium ions and provide enough accommodation for the insoluble Li2O2 product. The corresponding Li-O-2 batteries demonstrate low polarization and excellent cycle stability with full discharge/charge capability (up to 292 cycles at a current density of 0.2 mA cm(-2) within a voltage range from 2.3 to 4.3 V). The long-term cycling performance is principally attributed to the exclusive catalytic stability of the holey IrNi nanosheets and its good compatibility with dimethyl sulfoxide-based electrolyte. Our research provides novel insights into the design of robust and freestanding porous cathodes for high energy density Li-O-2 batteries.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2168-0485			WOS:000588740300007

However, the agglomeration of active sites and the weak interaction between active sites and carrier severely weakens the bifunctional catalytic activity of non-precious-metal catalysts. Herein, bifunctional electrocatalysts with the full exposure of nanoparticles of controllable sizes are successfully designed and prepared through super-assembling of electrospun carbon nanofibers with zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) and subsequent calcination. Owing to the high surface area, large pore volume, and abundant exposed active sites, the resulting catalysts exhibit a large half-wave potential (0.89 V) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a low potential (1.62 V) at the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for oxygen evolution reaction. In addition, when assembled into a home-made Zn-air battery with alkaline electrolyte, this catalyst displays a more superior charge-discharge cycle durability (1256 cycles in 10 mA/cm(2)) and a higher peak power density of 115 mW/cm(2) than commercial Pt/C + IrO2 catalysts. This simple and efficient super-assembly strategy will open up the new process for fabricating diverse electrocatalysts for various performance. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen using solar light is one possible solution, the successful implementation of which depends not least on the development of efficient water oxidation catalysts (WOCs). With the water splitting reaction of photosystem II, specifically the oxygen evolving complex, which features a cubane structure with a redox-inert metal center, nature provides us with clues for the construction of such WOCs. Any approach more sophisticated than a simple trial-and-error method will rely on knowledge of mechanistic details of biomimetic catalysts. Recently, a step in that direction has been made with computational investigations of the different possible catalytic pathways of a {Co(II)(4)O-4} cubane-based WOC. The present study, which focuses on the {Co(II)(3)LnO(4)} (Ln = Er, Tm) cubane family, is complementary to the previous one and sheds light on the importance of redox inert Ln(3+) cations for the mechanism of water oxidation. Using density functional theory and an explicit solvation shell, as well as a solvent continuum model, the WOCs are compared in terms of relative free energies of their catalytic states, and the reaction barriers of water attack and oxygen release. Furthermore, in-depth investigations into the electronic and molecular structures of the catalysts are carried out, resulting in the discovery of a flexibility of the cubane cage during the catalytic cycle.									31	0	0	0	2	0	31			2155-5435			WOS:000385057900054

In the first model, the oxygen concentration u(x, t) is computed based on the geometry of the growing blob, while in the second one, u(x, t) satisfies a reaction-diffusion equation. A threshold theta value exists such that cells give birth at rate beta(u(x, t) - theta)(+) and die at rate delta(theta - u(x, t)(+). In the first model, a phase transition was found between growth as a solid blob and "fingering" at a threshold theta(c) = 0.5, while in the second case, fingering always occurs, i.e., theta(c) = 0.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1058-6458	1944-950X		WOS:000345319900012	26430353

In this work, it is demonstrated theoretically and experimentally that metastable, face-centered-cubic alpha-MoC1-x phase shows superior water dissociation capability and alkaline HER activity than stable, hexagonal-close-packed Mo2C phase. Next, high surface area ordered mesoporous alpha-MoC1-x (MMC) is designed via a nanocasting method. In MMC structure, the alpha-MoC1-x phase facilitates the water dissociation reaction, while the mesoporous structure with high surface area enables a high dispersion of metal NPs and efficient mass transport. As a result, Pt nanoparticles (NPs) supported on MMC (Pt/MMC) show substantially enhanced alkaline HER activity in terms of overpotentials, Tafel slopes, mass and specific activities, and exchange current densities, compared to commercial Pt/C and Pt NPs supported on particulate alpha-MoC1-x or beta-Mo2C. Notably, Pt/MMC shows very low Tafel slope of 30 mV dec(-1), which is the lowest value among the reported Pt-based alkaline HER catalysts, suggesting the critical role of MMC in enhancing the HER kinetics. The promotional effect of MMC support in the alkaline HER is further demonstrated with an Ir/MMC catalyst.									55	3	0	0	6	0	56			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000478851700015

However, the selectivity and efficiency of current electrocatalysts for CO2 reductions are still not satisfactory. In this paper, the development of machine learning methods in screening CO2 reduction electrocatalysts over the recent years is reviewed. Through high-throughput calculation of some key descriptors such as adsorption energies, d-band center, and coordination number by well-constructed machine learning models, the catalytic activity, optimal composition, active sites, and CO2 reduction reaction pathway over various possible materials can be predicted and understood. Machine learning is now realized as a fast and low-cost method to effectively explore high performance electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2366-9608			WOS:000705529300001	34927959

The successful commercial application of water electrolysis to produce hydrogen gas, in particular, requires highly active electrocatalysts that can operate for prolonged periods. However, the high activity and high durability of electrocatalysts are often mutually exclusive. Recent studies have demonstrated that vacancy engineering might effectively modulate the electronic structures of catalysts, which can lead to high catalytic activity. Furthermore, it has been shown that vacancies are closely related to catalyst stability under operational conditions. To understand the benefits of vacancies in the catalyst structures, we discuss the recent advances in the development of vacancy-engineered catalysts for water electrolysis. In addition, we discuss the present limitations in this nascent field and provide directions for valuable future research.									26	1	0	0	0	0	27				1466-8033		WOS:000526761000002

Herein, new hydroxy-pyridine-carboxylate iridium complexes are reported exhibiting high activity in water oxidation with both cerium ammonium nitrate and NalO(4) as sacrificial oxidants. With the latter, the catalytic activity strongly depends on the pH and position of the OH-substituent in the pyridine ring, reaching a record turnover frequency of 458 min(-1) and turnover number (>14 500) limited only by the amount of NalO(4). Kinetic experiments measuring O-2 evolution paralleled by NMR studies on oxidative transformation with NalO(4) suggest that Cp* of the catalyst is readily degraded, whereas the hydroxypyridine-carboxylate ligands remain coordinated at iridium, tuning its activity.									35	1	0	0	2	0	35			2380-8195			WOS:000392260400016

Substitutional boron atoms are illustrated to be capable of initiating the NRR active centers, and charge accumulation on the nanostructured diamond surface enables further enhancement of catalytic activity through reducing the reaction free energy for the rate-determining step of the NRR on certain surfaces.									36	3	0	0	0	0	36			2380-8195			WOS:000562954100018

When nitrogen monoxide (NO) was contacted with Cu/mordenite at room temperature, the evolution of dinitrogen monoxide (N2O) and nitrogen occurred, accompanied by the formation of the adsorbed oxygen species (Os). In the TPD runs, three NO desorption peaks appeared, with maxima at 383 K (alpha-NO peak), 523 K (delta-NO peak), and 673 K (gamma-NO peak). The desorptions of oxygen and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were observed together with the desorption of NO at 673 K. These alpha-NO and beta-NO peaks correspond to the desorptions of nitrogen oxide species which adsorbed as NO-type species. The desorptions of gamma-NO, gamma-NO2 and gamma-O-2 at 673 K arose from the decomposition of NO3-type adsorbed species. The NO3-type species may have formed by the reaction between NO and the adsorbed oxygen species (Os). By comparison of the :ate of the NO decomposition with that of the decomposition of NO3-type adsorbed species, it was shown that the NO3-type adsorbed species plays a pivotal role in the decomposition of NO as intermediate of the reaction.

In the present study, the encoding sequences of Epo and Epor genes were cloned in Gymncypris eckloni by RT-PCR method. The coding region of Epo and Epor were 552 bp and 1 590 bp, which encoded 183 and 529 amino acid residues respectively (Fig.1 and 2). The high homology of EPO and EPOR protein of G. eckloni with other cyprinid fishes indicated that the two proteins were evolutionary conserved (Table 2). Molecular evolution analysis suggested that Epo and Epor genes of G. eckloni did not undergo positive selection (Table 3). Under severe (the dissolved oxygen was 0.30.1 mg/L) and moderate hypoxic (the dissolved oxygen was 3.0 0.1 mg/L) conditions, the Epo mRNA levels in key tissues such as brain and red muscle were increased significantly (Fig.4 and 5), implying its potential roles in movement, neuroprotection and neurotrophy, which may be a regulatory mechanism of fish to hypoxic adaptation.			促红细胞生成素(EPO)是一种糖蛋白激素,在动物低氧适应中发挥着重要作用。本研究采用RT-PCR方法克隆了花斑裸鲤(Gymncypris eckloni) Epo和Epor基因的编码序列,并开展了分子进化和低氧诱导表达研究。结果表明,花斑裸鲤Epo基因编码序列长度为bp,编码183个氨基酸;Epor基因编码序列长度为1 590 bp,编码个氨基酸。氨基酸序列同源性分析显示,花斑裸鲤促红细胞生成素(EPO)和促红细胞生成素受体(EPOR)与鲤科其他鱼类均有较高的同源性,表明在进化过程中具有较强保守性,同时花斑裸鲤Epo和Epor基因均未经历正向选择。在重度低氧[溶解氧为(0.3 0.1 )mg/L]和中度低氧[溶解氧为(3.0 0.1) mg/L]胁迫下,花斑裸鲤部分关键组织如红肌、脑组织中Epo mRNA表达量急剧升高,表明促红细胞生成素(EPO)可能在花斑裸鲤运动、神经营养和神经保护方面发挥了重要作用,是对低氧环境适应的一种调节机制。						0	1	0	0	0	0	1			0250-3263			CSCD:6209259

Two types of calcite were identified in Murchison, Mighei, Cold Bokkeveld and LaPaz Icefield 031166 by differences in their petrographic properties and oxygen isotope values. Type 1 calcite occurs as small equant grains that formed by filling of pore spaces in meteorite matrices during the earliest stages of alteration. On average, the type 1 grains have a delta O-18 of similar to 32-36 parts per thousand (VSMOW), and Delta O-17 of between similar to 2 parts per thousand and similar to 1 parts per thousand. Most grains of type 2 calcite precipitated after type 1. They contain micropores and inclusions, and have replaced ferromagnesian silicate minerals. Type 2 calcite has an average delta O-18 of similar to 21-24 parts per thousand (VSMOW) and a Delta O-17 of between similar to-1 parts per thousand and similar to 3 parts per thousand. Such consistent isotopic differences between the two calcite types show that they formed in discrete episodes and from solutions whose delta O-18 and delta O-17 values had changed by reaction with parent body silicates, as predicted by the closed-system model for aqueous alteration. Temperatures are likely to have increased over the timespan of calcite precipitation, possibly owing to exothermic serpentinisation. The most highly altered CM chondrites commonly contain dolomite in addition to calcite. Dolomite grains in two previously studied CM chondrites have a narrow range in delta O-18 (similar to 25-29 parts per thousand VSMOW), with Delta O-17 similar to-1 parts per thousand to similar to 3 parts per thousand. These grains are likely to have precipitated between types 1 and 2 calcite, and in response to a transient heating event and/or a brief increase in fluid magnesium/calcium ratios. In spite of this evidence for localised excursions in temperature and/or solution chemistry, the carbonate oxygen isotope record shows that fluid evolution was comparable between many parent body regions. The CM carbonaceous chondrites studied here therefore sample either several parent bodies with a very similar initial composition and evolution or, more probably, a single C-type asteroid.

Herein, inspired by the density function theory (DFT) calculation result that Ru-dopants have a climbing effect on both OER and HER processes, we construct a Ru doped three-dimensional flower-like bimetallic phosphide on nickel foam (Ru-NiCoP/NF) derived from Co leaf-like zeolitic imidazolate framework (Co ZIF-L), effectively driving both OER (216mV@20 mA cm(-2)) and HER (44mV@10 mA cm(-2)) in 1 M KOH solutions. The overall water splitting device assembled by using Ru-NiCoP/NF as both anode and cathode shows an ultralow cell voltage of 1.515 V to obtain 10 mA cm(-2). Interestingly, almost 100 % Faradic yield is achieved for the overall water splitting. This work represents a significant addition to exploring a new class of transition metal phosphides with outstanding performance in producing hydrogen via electrochemical water electrolysis.									154	8	0	0	11	0	155			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000566452900002

COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS				401						213068	10.1016/j.ccr.2019.213068				DEC 15 2019	2019	Complete biomimicking, a quest that has motivated many of scientific communities to attempt to unravel strange aspects of biological water oxidation reaction (WOR). Achieving this utopia allows designing nature-resemble artificial leaves for the final production of oxygen with yields comparable to nature, and ultimately facile production of eco-friendly fuel i.e. molecular hydrogen. The former case, WOR, has been traditionally regarded as the bottleneck which mostly suffers from high energy loss due to the difficulty in decreasing activation energy. Toward this end, tremendous boosts have been assigned to explore the mechanism of a water oxidation reaction in nature and discover the tricks of the trade. The formation of molecular oxygen is catalyzed via an active core in the oxygen-evolving catalyst (OEC) located in photosystem II, where the oxido-manganese bonds arranged in an asymmetrical cluster structure, is responsible for the accumulation of the redox equivalents that are capable for the concurrent abstraction of four electrons/protons from two water molecules. Understanding the precise mechanism of WOR in nature being the subject of frequent of research items, in this way, a reliable approach is constructing artificial architectures that either one mimic different aspects of PSII including the OEC core, the electron transfer chain, and the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) aiming to investigate the structural-dependent electronic properties and the redox chemistry of the biomimetic systems, which can discover new details in PSII supercomplex. Here, we discuss a critical overview of the latest advancements in biomimicry that being able to delineate new insights on uncover secrets of WOR in nature. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A promising approach demonstrated previously is the formation of catalysts with mixed valent metal active sites. Because catalysis happens primarily on the surface of the catalyst, we hypothesize that creating such active sites only on the surface will be an effective strategy for improving the catalytic activities. Here, we present a partial oxidation approach that grows delta-MnO2 nanoflakes on the surface of octahedron Mn3O4 nanocrystals for increasing their ORR activity. The delta-MnO2/Mn3O4 nanocomposite exhibits significantly improved ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.75 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is similar to 110 and similar to 90 mV lower than those of the Mn3O4 nanocrystal and delta-MnO2 nanoflakes in their pure forms, respectively. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals that the delta-MnO2/Mn3O4 nanocomposite possesses a lower ORR charge transfer resistance than either component alone. We propose that the reason for such significant improvement in catalytic activities is due to the tuning of the position of delta-MnO2 nanoflake d-band center by the Mn3O4 nanocrystal which can effectively facilitate the electron transfer between the active sites and adsorbed oxygen molecules. This work illustrates a facile pathway to improve catalytic activity of mixed valence metal oxides.									13	3	0	0	0	0	13			1932-7447			WOS:000445711100029

To further enhance the ORR performance of Fe-NC electrocatalysts, efforts have been focused on two main methods. One is to enhance the intrinsic activity of FeN(x)sites through electronic and geometric regulation, and the other is to increase the density of active sites by introducing high-nitrogen-containing precursors or co-doping methods. Herein, we report a strategy to further increase the Fe loading through the introduction of a trace amount of Cu atoms. Significant enhancement of the electrocatalytic ORR property is observed in the as-prepared Fe and Cu co-doped electrocatalyst with superior half-wave potential (E-1/2) in both alkaline and acid electrolyte. Experimental and theoretical study reveals that the introduction of a trace amount of Cu atoms is beneficial for the formation of FeN(4)sites, owing to the reduced formation energy. This work opens up a wide avenue to further increase the Fe loading in Fe-NC electrocatalysts through bimetal co-doping method.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			2196-0216			WOS:000563880800016

The two maximums of the current efficiency for ozone (CEO) observed at 2-3.5 V are largely due to the participation of various chemisorbed particles in the ozone synthesis. In the vicinity of the first CEO maximum at lead dioxide, ozone forms only in a discharge of water molecules with the participation of adsorbed oxygen-containing radicals. In the potential range of the second maximum, the adsorbed anion radicals, e.g., . HSO4 and . SO4, also take part in the reaction of ozone generation. At the electrode not subjected to anodic polarization, CEO is considerably higher than that on the preliminarily polarized electrode. On the basis of the experimental data, schemes for the ozone evolution at PbO2 in sulfuric acid at 2 to 3 V are proposed.									3	2	0	0	0	0	5			1023-1935	1608-3342		WOS:000086934700005

Resembling the trichome and epidermis of a cactus stem, vertically aligned MoS2 along with a carbon species hydrolyzed from glucose on Bi19Cl3S27 comprised the unique biomimetic structure. During the photocatalytic process of MoS2/Bi19Cl3S27 heterostructures, the characteristic biomimetic structure endows the heterostructures with greatly enhanced light adsorption and charge separation capabilities, the whole hydrogen evolution reaction was boosted by the combination of optimized charge and mass transfer paths, like the plant morphogenesis of a cactus which plays a significant role in mucilage-based energy-transmission. As a consequence, the improved photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate reaches up to 876.6 mol g(-1) h(-1) with an optimal loading of 5 wt% MoS2. The successful preparation of biomimetic structured MoS2/Bi19Cl3S27 samples with good stability shows that bismuth-based materials have great potential for applications in energy conversion systems, while providing enlightenment for the design of other biomimetic structured nanomaterials.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000449701900017

This trend has been driven primarily by the need to improve upon 'conventional' carbon (C) uptake- or oxygen (O-2) evolution-based productivity estimates that require water samples to be incubated ex situ. Unlike the conventional approaches to measuring productivity, chlorophyll fluorescence measurements inherently describe only the activity of photosystem 11 (PSII) in the light reactions; thus, the photosynthetic 'currency' of the fluorescence-based approach is an electron turnover rate for PSII (ETRPSII). A photosynthetic currency of electrons has limited ecological relevance but can be converted to a currency of carbon if an 'exchange rate', i.e. a value or factor of equivalence for any single time point, is applied. We used fast repetition rate fluorometry (FRRf), mass inlet membrane spectrometry (MIMS) and C-14 uptake to determine ETRPSII, gross and net O-2 evolution and C fixation measured simultaneously for 6 microalgal species and for different steady-state growth conditions. Quantifying the PSII reaction centre (RCII) concentration and the spectral dependency of the effective absorption cross section yielded an FRRf approach that provided a robust estimate of the ETRPSII and gross O-2 evolution for all species and conditions tested; however, the ETRPSII exceeded carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake by a factor of similar to 5.4 to 11.6. At least 3 species exhibited substantial light-dependent 02 cycling to account for similar to 40 to 60% of the difference between the ETRPSII and CO2 uptake. The highly variable nature of the ETRPSII:CO2 uptake 'exchange rate' observed here highlights the need for future studies that rely on active fluorescence to examine aquatic productivity to focus towards a systematic description of how electrons are coupled to C fixation in nature.					8th International Workshop of the Group-for-Aquatic-Primary-Productivity8th International Workshop of the Group-for-Aquatic-Primary-Productivity	APR, 2008APR, 2008	Int Soc Limnol; Int Assoc Ecol; Grp Aquat Primary ProductInt Soc Limnol; Int Assoc Ecol; Grp Aquat Primary Product	Eilat, ISRAELEilat, ISRAEL	95	7	0	0	75	2	102			0948-3055	1616-1564		WOS:000270467800005

This perspective analyzes some recent examples of 'systemic catalysts', which are based on the modification of the reaction microenvironment and exploitation of concurrent/parasitic reactions or different types of chemical looping, in order to bypass some drawbacks that cannot be easily circumvented by standard approaches.

The reaction uses a dual catalytic system that is formed by a photocatalyst simple and cheap, 9,10-phenanthrenedione, and a Lewis acid, Zn(OTf)(2). 5W white LEDs are used as visible-light source and oxygen from air as a terminal oxidant, obtaining the corresponding products with good yields. The reaction can be extended to other electron-rich arenes. Our methodology represents one of the most valuable and sustainable approach for the functionalization of 3,4-dihydro-1,4-benzoxazin-2-ones, as compared to the reported procedures.

However, they suffer from irreversible structural changes resulting in significant capacity loss and limited oxygen redox reversibility. Here the effect of Cu substitution on the electrochemical performance of P3-type sodium manganese oxide is examined by evaluating the structural and electronic structural evolution upon cycling, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Over the voltage range 1.8-3.8 V vs. Na/Na+, where the redox reactions of the transition metal ions contribute entirely towards the charge compensation mechanism, stable cycling performance is maintained, showing a capacity retention of 90% of the initial discharge capacity of 166 mA h g(-1) after 40 cycles at 10 mA g(-1). Over an extended voltage range of 1.8-4.3 V vs. Na/Na+, oxygen anion redox is invoked, with a voltage hysteresis of 110 mV and a greater initial discharge capacity of 195 mA h g(-1) at 10 mA g(-1) is reached. Ex-situ powder x-ray diffraction patterns reveal distortion of the P3 structure to P ' 3 after charge to 4.3 V, and then transformation to O ' 3 upon discharge to 1.8 V, which contributes towards the capacity fade observed between the voltage range 1.8-4.3 V. DFT with projected density of states calculations reveal a strong covalency between the copper and oxygen atoms which facilitate both the cationic and anionic redox reactions in P3-type Na0.67Mn0.9Cu0.1O2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2515-7655			WOS:000865871000001

A classic S-cycle model for oxygen evolution involves five states, but only four have been identified. The missing S-4 state is particularly important because it is directly involved in dioxygen formation. Now progress comes from an x-ray technique that can monitor redox and structural changes in metal centers in real time with 10-microsecond resolution. We show that in the O-2-formation step, an intermediate is formed-the enigmatic S-4 state. Its creation is identified with a deprotonation process rather than the expected electron-transfer mechanism. Subsequent electron transfer would give an additional S-4' state, thus extending the fundamental S-state cycle of dioxygen formation.									375	4	2	0	177	0	381			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000233343400044	16284178

In order to examine the evolutionary mechanism of adaptation to the extreme environment with low temperature and low oxygen concentration, the liver transcriptome data from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau endemic bird, the ground tit (Parus humilis) was analyzed and compared with the zebra finch's draft genome. Our results showed that the vast majority of the highly expressed genes in the ground tit had been involved in metabolic processes. In comparison with the genome data of zebra finch, we obtained 214 rapidly evolved genes, most of which were enriched to KEGG pathways associated with energy metabolism, immune response, and digestion. Our analysis of highly expressed genes confirmed that the liver is the location of many important metabolic processes in organisms, such as bile secretion, fatty acid conversion and detoxification, and also suggested that these genes are essential in maintaining the basic hepatic functions in organisms. Our analysis of rapidly evolved genes revealed that adaptive evolution and natural selection have acted on those genes associated with energy metabolism, immune response and digestion.			肝脏是生物新陈代谢的重要器官。为了探究青藏高原特有鸟类地山雀(Parus humilis)如何适应低温、低氧等恶劣环境,我们对其肝脏转录组数据进行分析,并结合斑胸草雀基因组数据进行了比较研究。结果显示,地山雀肝脏转录组中的大部分高表达基因都直接参与机体的新陈代谢活动;通过与斑胸草雀基因组数据进行比较,对筛选出的214个快速进化基因进行代谢通路的功能富集,发现多数基因富集到与能量代谢、免疫反应和消化相关的通路上。本研究表明,高表达基因的功能一方面验证了肝脏是机体新陈代谢的主要场所,参与胆汁分泌、脂肪酸的转化及解毒等多项生理活动;另一方面也说明这些高表达基因对于维持肝脏的正常功能是必要的。快速进化基因的功能富集分析揭示了地山雀中与能量代谢、免疫反应和食性等相关的基因受到自然选择压力的影响而发生了适应性的快速进化。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-568X			CSCD:5883589

The role of diatomic SiO in dry oxidation of Si								SiO2 and Its Interfaces: Symposium								145	50						1988	1988	The interaction of O2(g) with clean Si(s) surfaces at high temperature and low pressure leads to an etching reaction, 1/2 O2(g)+Si(s)rarrSiO(g), which results in the evolution of SiO molecules from the surface. Above a critical O2 pressure, an oxide film SiO2(s) begins to grow. The evolution of diatomic SiO during the early stages of film growth may provide a mechanism to account for deviations from standard models of oxidation kinetics for thin oxides, and for the results of oxygen isotope tracer studies of oxide formation. In order to monitor the rate of SiO evolution, the authors have made in-situ measurements of the SiO concentration in the gas phase, using a laser-induced fluorescence technique. With this method, SiO(g) can be monitored in the furnace with good spatial resolution and a sensitivity limit of ~106 molecules cm-3. Measurements of SiO evolution and the implications for oxide growth are discussed.

The evolution of different regulated functions within an ancient gene family allows an examination of the types of biosequence data that are informative for various types of issues. Alignment of amino acid sequences is informative for the phylogenetic relationships among the hemoglobins in bacteria, fungi, protists, plants and animals. Although many of these diverse hemoglobins are induced by low oxygen concentrations, to date none of the molecular mechanisms for their hypoxic induction shows common regulatory proteins; hence, a search for matches in non-coding DNA sequences would not be expected to be fruitful. Indeed, alignments of non-coding DNA sequences do not reveal significant matches even between mammalian alpha- and beta-globin gene clusters, which diverged approximately 450 million years ago and are still expressed in a coordinated and balanced manner. They are in very different genomic contexts that show pronounced differences in regulatory mechanisms. The alpha-globin gene is in constitutively active chromatin and is encompassed by a CPG island, which is a dominant determinant of its regulation, whereas the beta-globin gene is in A+T-rich genomic DNA, Non-coding sequence matches are not seen between avian and mammalian beta-globin gene clusters, which diverged approximately 250 million years ago, despite the fact that regulation of both gene clusters requires tissue-specific activation of a chromatin domain regulated by a locus control region. The cis-regulatory sequences needed for domain opening and enhancement do show common binding sites for transcription factors. In contrast, alignments of non-coding sequences from species representing multiple eutherian mammalian orders, some of which diverged as long as 135 million years ago, are reliable predictors of novel cis-regulatory elements, both proximal and dietal to the genes. Examples include a potential target for the hematopoietic transcription factor TAL1.									264	6	1	0	229	1	276			0022-0949			WOS:000073772900006	9510523

Herein, a facile electrodeposited approach is presented to fabricate hierarchically amorphous (Ni-Fe)S-x/NiFe(OH)(y) films on Nickel foam. By accurately tuning multi-components and electrochemical-parameters resulting in abundant micro-tube/sphere morphologies and phase evolution to obtain unique amorphous nano cluster architectures, the (Ni-Fe)S-x/NiFe(OH)(y) catalyst performs super electrocatalytic performance, driving the current density of 100 mA.cm(-2) at ultralow overpotential of 124 mV and 290 mV for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH solution with first-class long-term stability for at least 50 h, respectively. In addition, the bimetallic Ni-Fe sulfides and NiFe hydroxides are confirmed to be highly-intrinsic active components for HER and OER. More importantly, the (Ni-Fe)S-x/NiFe(OH)(y) material directly as cathode and anode electrodes, achieves 10 mA.cm(-2) at low electrolytic voltage of 1.46 V in 1 M KOH, even at large current density of 1200 mA.cm(-2) only needing 2.2 V as well as super-durability at 1000 mA.cm(-2) for 50 h in quasi-industrial conditions. Further experimental results reveal that both temperature and appropriate alkalinity arc in favour of reducing the overall hydrolytic overpotential due to accelerating sluggish thermodynamics and dynamics. Parallelly, the bifunctional (Ni-Fe)S-x/NiFe(OH)(y) electrode is one of the best efficient electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolyte up to now and expected for large-scale industrial water-splitting at large-current-density.									103	11	0	0	5	0	108			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000460495400035

Eleven singlet pathways and four triplet pathways were found based on CCSD(T)//M06-2x calculations. The nature of chemical bonding evolution was also studied using electron localization function and atoms in molecules analysis. Moreover, reaction rate constants were calculated between 200 and 800K at the level of the transition state theory by Wigner tunneling correction. The results suggest that the main products should be CH2SO, H2O, CH3OH, SO, CH4, and SO2, respectively, basically coinciding with the experimental results. The corresponding feasible pathways are channels R7, R8, and R9, respectively, with an effective energy barrier of 56.21kJ/mol. Obviously, given the low energy barrier similar to the main paths mentioned above, the products CH2SH and HO2 should assume a definite proportion in all possible products, although such species were not yet detected in experiment.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			0020-7608	1097-461X		WOS:000459620000007

Herein, we developed a novel electrocatalyst based on 3D carbon nanoarchitecture hybrid, which consists of CoP nanoparticles (CoP NPs) embedded into N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT), grafted on carbon polyhedron (CoP/NCNT-CP) that was prepared by carbonization and low-temperature phosphatization treatment of cobalt-based zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF). Benefiting from the strong synergistic effect and unique 3D structure, the CoP/NCNT-CP hybrid loaded on Ni foam exhibited excellent electrocatalytic HER performance in base with a low overpotential of 165 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is competitive with the previously reported Co-based hybrid electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the CoP/NCNT-CP also demonstrated high HER electrocatalytic activities in both neutral and acidic conditions with the overpotentials of 203 and 305 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Additionally, the bifunctional CoP/NCNT-CP electrode simultaneously acted as an anode for hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and a cathode for HER. Excellent catalytic performance was demonstrated in base conditions with a low cell potential of 0.89 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which was much lower than the voltage of overall water splitting (1.91 V) at the same current density.									45	3	0	0	6	0	45			2168-0485			WOS:000470331800036

We used ReaxFF-lg molecular dynamics to elucidate the dehydrogenation and oxidation mechanisms of aluminum hydride nanoparticle (AHNP). Results show that the morphological evolution of AHNP is induced by temperature and structure, and classified into four shapes: sphere, notched sphere, large branch, and small string. The surface dehydrogenation and oxidation are almost co-occurring. The initial dehydrogenation inhibits the rapid oxidation of the surface layer of AHNP. The increase in temperature induces the instability of the oxide shell and provides sufficient kinetic energy for the hydrogen bubbles. As a result, the oxidation shell ruptures, and the internal hydrogen bubbles physically escape from the nanoparticles. Some simultaneous notches appear in the shell, making its appearance to be branchy at 3000 K. AHNP explodes and ejects small strings of atoms at 3500 K. We also investigated the effect of different temperatures and initial oxygen densities on the morphologies of AHNP. Our results emphasize the complicated interplay between the structural evolution of nanoparticles and environmental conditions. It provides insights into the atomic-level dehydrogenation and oxidation mechanism of metal hydride nanoparticles.									15	1	0	0	2	0	15			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000531751300003

On porous titanium in the potential ranges 0.1 < E < 0.5 and 0.5 < E < 1.1 V (NHE), the formation of titanium hydrides and passive oxide layers, respectively, is observed; the processes decay with time. In the ranges E < 0.1 and E > 1.1 V, the dissolved oxygen reduction and chlorine evolution, respectively, are observed on porous titanium at high overpotentials. On porous titanium activated with thin-layer Pt, Au, and RuO2 coatings, the functional E vs. pH dependence, which is typical for these electrocatalysts, breaks down due to the conjugate reactions of titanium oxidation. On porous titanium activated with Co3O4 and MnO2, at pH below unity, chlorine evolution is observed; its rate is limited by the chlorine mass transfer into the bulk solution. Under a gas-diffusion control, the chlorine evolution rate is determined by the diffusion of absorbed hydrogen chloride. The conditions of application of porous titanium as the support for catalytically active electrodes of electrochemical sensors in acidic chloride solutions are considered.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1023-1935			WOS:000169003300011

We use a photochemical model to follow the evolution of the impact-derived species. Our results regarding the nitrogen and oxygen compounds are presented here. NH3 photolysis initiates the nitrogen photochemistry. Much of the nitrogen ends up in N-2, nitrogen-sulfur compounds, and HCN, but NH3 and nitriles such as C2H3CN may also exist in observable quantities a year or so after the impacts. Oxygen species survive for a long time in the Jovian stratosphere. The only major oxygen-containing compounds that exhibit dramatic changes in the lower stratosphere in the first year following the impacts are SO, SO2, and OCS - H2O, CO2, and CO are comparatively stable. We discuss the important photochemical processes operating on the nitrogen and oxygen species in the Jovian stratosphere, make predictions concerning the temporal variation of the major species, and identify molecules that might act as good tracers for atmospheric dynamics.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			0094-8276			WOS:A1995RE52800036

However, this process still faces a major challenge in efficiently producing H-2 with high redox kinetics and yields. In this paper, the promoting effects of Ce3+ substitution into LaFeO3 redox catalysts on thermochemical H2O splitting as well as partial oxidation of methane are presented. An appropriate amount of Ce3+ substitution in A site of LaFeO3 (La0.5Ce0.5FeO3) promotes the lattice oxygen conversion rate in methane partial oxidation step and boosts the reaction kinetics in H2O splitting step by enhancing the surface water activation and lattice oxygen mobility of the perovskite. In the CL-SRM process, the perovskite is reduced into Fe-0/(La0.5Ce0.5)(2)O-3 and Fe-0/(La0.5Ce0.5)O2-x phases in methane partial oxidation step and recovered to the original perovskite structure in H2O splitting step with simultaneous production of hydrogen, which maintains a reversible phase transformation during 100 redox cycles. As a result, the La0.5Ce0.5FeO3 achieves high stability with the superior performance for syngas and hydrogen production. These findings provide the fundamental understanding on the synergy between the catalytic sites and enhanced lattice oxygen mobility for the promotion of H2O activation and hydrogen productivity in chemical looping process.

In this paper, noble-metal free Mn-Cd-S@amorphous-Ni3S2 hybrid catalyst (MCS@a-Ni3S2) with bifunctionality of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and electrocatalytic OER is designed and prepared by simple hydrothermal method. The characterization results show that Mn-Cd-S was composed of cubic manganese sulfide and manganese doped cadmium sulfide, and amorphous Ni3S2 coating on the surface of Mn-Cd-S. The resultant Mn-Cd-S@amorphpus-Ni3S2 catalyst presents good stability and a high photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of 12,069.27 mu molh(-1) g(-1). Besides, both Mn-Cd-S and Mn-CdS@amorphpus-Ni3S2 show good OER property with overpotential of 333 mV. Mn-Cd-S@amorphpus-Ni3S2 shows more favorable kinetics than that of Mn-Cd-S for OER.

Creating p-n junction is an effective strategy to enhance charge separation because the built-in electric field could inhibit charge recombination. However, in many situations, the high reaction barrier will limit the surface reaction rate, resulting in poor carrier utilization of the p-n junction. Here, with carefully designed cocatalyst loading, we successfully overcome the limitation and obtain the full effectiveness of the p-n junction. When used for photocatalytic water splitting, the well-designed catalyst exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity, with a hydrogen evolution rate as high as 13.2 mmol h(-1) g(-1), which is 18 times higher than that of the pristine p-n junction. Further investigation reveals that the enhancement should be attributed to the synergistic effect between cocatalyst and p-n junction, with the cocatalyst improves reaction rate on the surface and the p-n junction accelerates charge separation in the bulk simultaneously. This work provides an effective strategy to modify the surface properties of p-n junction through cocatalysts-loading for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

Significantly, we show that the incorporation of nitrogen functionalities on graphene nanoribbon with tunable nickel content not only catalyzes efficiently the water oxidation reaction but enables to tweak the catalytic reactivity. Thus, Ni/NGNRs composite with higher nickel content exhibits an overpotential of 380 mV with a Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1) to sustain 10 mA cm(-2) under alkaline conditions. Furthermore, only a negligible current density drop is witnessed during the chronoamperometric studies suggesting the robust nature of the electrocatalyst. XPS analysis of the composite before and after polarization studies confirms the formation of nickel oxide on the exposed nickel nanoparticles during the electrochemical reaction but without any major adverse effect on the performance. We attribute the formation of nickel oxide on the exposed nickel nanoparticles as the major reason for the observed enhancement of electrocatalytic performance.

However, the corrosion and deactivation of active sites in the solution still restrict the inherent reaction kinetic rate. For this reason, it is important to stabilize the catalyst through a controllable doping strategy to obtain high activity catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). Herein, the pyrolysis strategy is demonstrated in the synthesis of iron-based catalysts co-doped with nitrogen and biomass-derived phosphorus (denoted as N, P-Fe/C), and the pore size of the catalyst is mostly distributed at 1 nm or 50 nm, respectively. The half-wave potential (0.893 V) and the current density (4.05 mA cm(-2)) at 0.85 V of the catalyst exceed those of the commercial Pt/C. The remarkable ORR performance can be attributed to its distinct hierarchical pore structure, the modulation effect of nitrogen and phosphorus co-doping on the carbon matrix, and the combined effect of the FeNx active sites, which improves the accessibility of reactants and accelerating the absorption/desorption of the reaction intermediate, thereby increasing reaction rates. And N, P-Fe/C has great potential as a promising substitute for platinum-based catalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000626088400001

It has been found that the strict control of oxygen pick up during the oxidation curing is essential to produce near-stoichiometric SiC fibers. When the molar ratio of oxygen to excess carbon in the pyrolyzed fibers (SiCxOy) is slightly over 1 (O/C-Excess=y/(x-1)> 1), the excess carbon is eliminated during the subsequent sintering as CO and CO2 as a result of the decomposition of SiCxOy; the remaining oxygen is removed as SiO and CO vapor, leaving near-stoichiometric SiC as the residue. However, with still increasing oxygen pick up, the final ceramic fibers become more porous and rich in silicon. The evolution of CO, CO2, and SiO generates high porosity in the absence of a sintering additive, leading to low fiber density. The inter-connected and open porosity favors the formation of CO. In contrast, for the fibers containing aluminum (Al) or Al/B sintering additives, the pores are much smaller and essentially closed, favoring the formation of CO2. Therefore, after sintering at 1800 degrees C, the fibers without sintering additives contain excess silicon, while those with sintering additives are near stoichiometric. Al is beneficial to the densification but it alone cannot produce fibers of high density. When B is added in addition to Al, the fibers can be sintered to nearly full density.									15	8	0	0	1	0	17			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000252930100012

Self-discharge rates are relatively high in non-pre-electrolyzed solutions due to the presence of iron impurities. These rates are lower in pre-electrolyzed solutions because iron impurities are partially eliminated by cathodic deposition. The discharge efficiency depends largely on the electrolyte nature, decreasing in the order KOH > NaOH > LiOH.

The optimized Fe SAs-Fe2P NPs/NPCFs-2.5 catalyst shows a superior ORR activity and stability in 0.5 m H2SO4 and 0.1 m KOH, respectively. Theoretical calculations reveal a synergistic effect, in that the existence of Fe2P weakens the adsorption of ORR intermediates on active sites and lowers the reaction free energy. The doped P atoms with a strong electron-donating ability elevate the energy level of Fe-3d orbitals and facilitate the adsorption of O-2. The active Fe atoms exist in a low oxidation state and are less positively charged, and they serve as an electron reservoir capable of donating and releasing electrons, thus improving the ORR activity. Operando and in situ characterization results indicate that the atomically dispersed Fe-N-4/Fe-P coupled active centers in the Fe SAs-Fe2P NPs/NPCFs-2.5 catalyst are characteristic of the different catalytic mechanisms in acidic and alkaline media. This work proposes a novel idea for constructing coupling catalysts with atomic-level precision and provides a strong reference for the development of high-efficiency ORR electrocatalysts for practical application.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000811806400001	35606157

Direct electrolysis of seawater is a transformative technology for sustainable hydrogen production without causing freshwater scarcity. However, this technology is severely impeded by a lack of robust and active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Here, we report a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst composed of multimetallic layered double hydroxides, which affords superior catalytic performance and long-term durability for high-performance seawater electrolysis. To the best of our knowledge, this catalyst is among the most active for OER and it advances the development of seawater electrolysis technology.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1091-6490		MEDLINE:35476529	35476529

The protective roles of Lhcb4 (CP29), Lhcb5 (CP26) and Lhcb6 (CP24), three minor chlorophyll binding antenna proteins during photoinhibition have been well studied. However, their regulatory mechanisms against oxidative damages under natural light conditions remain unknown. Here we investigated their specific roles in oxidative stress responses and photosynthetic adaptation by using the Arabidopsis thaliana knockout lines grown in the field condition. All three mutant lines exhibited decreased energy-transfer efficiency from the LHCII (light-harvesting complex II) to the PSII reaction center. Oxygen evolution capacity decreased slightly in the plants lacking Lhcb4 (koLHCB4) and Lhcb6 (koLHCB6). Photosynthetic rates and fitness for the plants lacking Lhcb5 (koLHCB5) or koLHCB6 grown in the field were affected, but not in the plants lacking Lhcb4, Antioxidant analysis indicated the lowest antioxidant enzyme activities and the lowest levels of non-enzymatic antioxidants in koLHCB6 plants. In addition, koLHCB6 plants accumulated much higher levels of superoxide and hydrogen, and suffered more severe oxidative-damages in the field. Our results clearly demonstrate that Lhcb6 may be involved in alleviating oxidative stress and photo protection under natural conditions.									16	1	0	0	14	0	17			0981-9428			WOS:000444789200027	30032070

Based on the anion intercalation mechanism, the capacitance is contributed by surface redox reactions and oxygen ion intercalation in the bulk materials. A high concentration of oxygen vacancies is needed because it is the main charge carrier. In this study, we propose a B-site cation ordered Ba2Bi0.1Sc0.2Co1.7O6-delta as an electrode material with an extremely high oxygen vacancy concentration and oxygen diffusion rate. A maximum capacitance of 1050 F g(-1) was achieved, and a high capacitance of 780 F g(-1) was maintained even after 3000 charge discharge cycles at a current density of 1 A g(-1) with an aqueous alkaline solution (6 M KOH) electrolyte, indicating an excellent cycling stability. In addition, the specific volumetric capacitance of Ba2Bi0.1Sc0.2Co1.7O6-delta reaches up to 2549.4 F cm(-3) based on the dense construction and high tap density (3.2 g cm(-2)). In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor was constructed using activated carbon as a negative electrode, and it displayed the highest specific energy density of 70 Wh kg(-1) at the power density of 787 W kg(-1) in this study.									45	2	0	0	1	0	45			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000428356800026	29468868

We investigated the effect of bulk oxidation on the overpotential of ink-casted LiMn2O4 electrodes by a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) setup and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the K shell core level of manganese ions (Mn-K edge). The cyclic voltammogram of the RRDE disk shows pronounced redox peaks in lithium hydroxide electrolytes with pH between 12 and 13.5, which we assign to bulk manganese redox based on XAS. The onset of the OER is pH-dependent on the scale of the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with a Nernst slope of -40(4) mV/pH at -5 mu A monitored at the RRDE ring. To connect this trend to catalyst changes, we develop a simple model for delithiation of LiMn2O4 in LiOH electrolytes, which gives the same Nernst slope of delithiation as our experimental data, i. e., 116(25) mV/pH. From this data, we construct an E-RHE-pH diagram that illustrates robustness of LiMn2O4 against oxidation above pH 13.5 as also verified by XAS. We conclude that manganese oxidation is the origin of the increase of the OER overpotential at pH lower than 14 and also of the pH dependence on the RHE scale. Our work highlights that vulnerability to transition metal redox may lead to increased overpotentials, which is important for the design of stable electrocatalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000481185300001	31359564

Here, we explored the deep effects of oxygen vacancies on activating CO2 photoreduction via coupling theoretical calculations and experimental results. In broad themes, oxygen vacancies improved the transport and separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs and enhanced the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. The deep effects, however, were that for n-Type semiconductor, the introduced oxygen vacancies could drive up the Fermi level, optimize the band structure, boost the reduction capability of the photogenerated electrons, and enhance the adsorption properties of reactants of the photocatalyst for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. We highlighted the rational design of the photocatalysts, and how the essential theory deserves to be integrated into the exploitation of the photocatalysts to accelerate the development of photocatalysis.									46	3	0	0	5	0	46			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000672570400003

Among others, they have the ability to exhibit surface plasmon resonance, electrochemical activity towards the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER, HER) as well as improved photoresponse in relation to monometalic but those properties depend highly on the substrate where bimetallic structures are immobilized.In this work, bimetallic gold-copper mosaics over the conducting structured titanium substrate were fabricated via following steps: anodization of Ti foil, chemical etching of as-formed titania resulting in nanodimpled Ti substrate (TiND), sputtering of thin metal layer (Au, Cu) in various sequences, and finally thermal treatment in furnace at 450 degrees C or 600 degrees C. The morphology, optical and structural properties were investigated in details and it was shown that both arrangements of metallic films and thermal conditions strongly affect the morphology and optical features. The XPS results confirmed the presence of gold-copper alloys and copper oxide species. Last but not least, the electrochemical activities were verified in 0.1 M NaOH using cyclic voltammetry and linear voltammetry measurements performed in dark and under visible light illumination. Among all investigated materials in both anodic and cathodic regimes bimetallic 5Au/5Cu sample annealed at 450 degrees C exhibits the highest response towards OER and HER, respectively. This is further boosted by the light with lambda > 420 nm. Upon exposure to visible light, the current density for 5Au/5Cu and 5Cu/5Au electrodes reached 1.32 mA cm(-2) and 1.26 mA cm(-2), respectively, while in the case of monometallic structures the current was below 10 mu A cm(-2). Both optical and electrochemical behaviour indicate a strong synergistic effect arising within the bimetallic mosaic formed over the TiND.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000567386900012

The aim is to investigate the effect of pH values on the catalytic activity of LaAlO3 catalysts in this reaction. The results showed that the co-precipitation pH value affected greatly on the formation of chemical species of precipitate precursors in the co-precipitation step, leading to different phases of the finally obtained LaAlO3 catalysts. When the co-precipitation pH value increased up to 8, the lanthanum-related phases such as La2O3 and La(OH)(3) were gradually formed as by-products, preventing the formation of LaAlO3 perovskite crystalline structure and facilitating the formation of oxygen vacancies on catalyst surface. However, at pH value of 9 or higher, the lanthanum content in the precipitate precursor was increased greatly. Not LaAlO3 perovskite but lanthanum-related phases were developed as main phases, reducing their catalytic activities in this reaction. Among LaAlO3 catalysts, the one prepared at pH = 8 showed the highest C-2 yield due to its well-developed oxygen vacancies and electrophilic lattice oxygen. Therefore, the co-precipitation pH value strongly affected the LaAlO3 catalyst activity in OCM reaction. A precious pH control should be required to prepare various perovskite catalysts for the OCM.

Herein, we use amorphous mesoporous fumed silica (MFS) as a skeleton material to disperse Ni(2+)and Fe(3+)through a simple impregnation strategy. The MFS isin situetched away during the OER process in 1 M KOH to prepare a stable mesoporous Ni-Fe electrocatalyst. The high specific surface area and abundant surface silanol groups in the mesoporous fumed silica afford rich anchor sites for fixing metal atomsviastrong chemical metal-oxygen interactions. Raman and XPS investigations reveal that Ni(2+)formed covalent bonds with surface Si-OH groups, and Fe(3+)inserted into the framework of fumed silica forming Fe-O-Si bonds. The mesoporous Ni-Fe catalysts offer high charge transfer abilities in the OER process. When loaded on nickel foam, the optimal 2Ni1Fe-MFS catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and a Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1). Notably, 2Ni1Fe-MFS shows a turnover frequency value of 0.155 s(-1)at an overpotential of 300 mV, which is 80 and 190 times higher than that of the state-of-the-art IrO(2)and RuO(2)catalysts. Furthermore, 2Ni1Fe-MFS exhibits 100% faradaic efficiency, large electrochemically active surface area, and good long-term durability, confirming its outstanding OER performance. Such high OER efficiency can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of high surface area, dense metal active sites and interfacial conductive path. This work provides a promising strategy to develop simple, cost-effective, and highly efficient porous Ni-Fe based catalysts for OER.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6				2046-2069		WOS:000543298000046	35520306

Herein, a cobaltgluconate-derived nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped micro/mesoporous carbon sphere (Co9S8/N, S-MCS) with encapsulated high-density cobalt sulfide (Co9S8) nanocrystals is developed by annealing and subsequent high-temperature vulcanization. Particularly, the vulcanization temperature has a critical impact on the formation of high-density Co9S8 nanocrystals. Benefiting from the favorable material characteristics of large surface area, abundant micro/mesopores and high graphitic nanostructures, as well as the synergistic effects between high-density Co9S8 nanocrystals and N, S-dual doped graphitic carbon shells, the resulting catalyst demonstrates superior ORR catalytic activity and durability compared to platinum/carbon (Pt/C) catalyst. More notably, the proposed approach can be extended potentially to fabricate other transition metal sulfide (or oxide, carbide) based electrocatalysts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Adsorption of eosin on platinum at potentials exceeding the oxygen evolution potential was discovered. The adsorbate orientation on platinum is presumably planar. The kinetics of electrocatalytic oxidation of eosin in aqueous solution were studied; the reaction orders, rate constants, half-lives, and activation energy were determined. Eosin is oxidized to mineral products (carbonates, bromates). Schemes of the electrocatalytic oxidation of the substrates were suggested.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1070-3632			WOS:000176939500020

In this work, we proposed a rapid and scalable synthesis route for fabricating Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocubes with tunable compositions and uniform particle size. With the structural benefits of abundant surface sites, facile charge transfer behavior and favorable Co2+-to-Co3+ pre-oxidation reaction, fast generation and accumulation of the catalytically active Co3+ sites can be achieved for the CoCo PBA nanocubes, leading to remarkable OER activity with simultaneously achieved low overpotential, large anodic current density, small Tafel slope as well as outstanding intrinsic activity. Of note, by performing long-term OER operation, the CoCo PBA nanocubes exhibit a remarkable 5.5-folds performance enhancement, and obvious surface reconstruction and the accumulation of high-valence Co species can be identified, proving the crucial role of pre-oxidation process in boosting the OER catalysis. This work proposed a universal approach for the rapid, scalable and controllable fabrication of the PBA-based materials, and the elucidation of the pre-oxidation process in facilitating the OER catalysis may provide useful guidance for designing and optimizing advanced catalysts for energy-related electro-oxidation reactions in the future.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1001-604X	1614-7065		WOS:000668845600001

The Janus nanostructure composed of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and N-C with individual exposed surface meets this purpose quite well. This can be achieved via pyrolyzing the core-shell Ag@polypyrrole (Ag@PPy) with eccentric encapsulated structure, where the AgNPs locate away from the center of the PPy spheres. The as-synthesized Janus nanostructured Ag@N-C demonstrates comparable ORR activity to commercial Pt/C catalyst with an onset and half-wave potential of 0.955 V and 0.821 V vs. RHE, respectively, and a limited current density of 4.976 mA cm(-2) at 0.365 V, and it also illustrates better stability and stronger methanol tolerance. The excellent ORR activity is largely attributed to the synergistic effect originating from the interaction between AgNPs and carbonized PPy half-shell, where the former one leads to a higher disordered degree in the carbon layer and the latter results in the positive shift of Ag 3d binding energy to facilitate the active oxygen adsorption and keeps the AgNPs from aggregation to avoid activity losing.

Herein, we present a simple and general strategy for the preparation of a series of metal (M: Fe, Co and Ni) phosphide catalysts that were anchored on metal-caged carbon matrix. In the first step, metal-grafted carbon precursors (M/M@NC) were rationally synthesized through metal-catalyzed growth process. Following phosphorization treatment transformed the metal precursors to metal phosphides (MP/M@NC) with the inheritance of the strong catalyst-support connection, which leads to efficient charge transport and prevents the detachment of the catalysts from the support. Benefitting from several structural advantages including high dispersability of active sites, good conductivity and strong interfacial interaction, the as-prepared MP/M@NC catalysts show high performance for HER in acidic solution. In particular, the FeP/Fe@NC exhibits extremely low overpotentials of -49 and -130 mV for achieving current densities of -10 and -100 mA cm(-2), respectively, and remarkable long-term durability, which highlights the importance of rational catalyst/support design towards efficient and stable electrocatalysis.									54	7	0	0	2	0	55			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000432604600058

On the gas-evolution efficiency of electrodes I - Theoretical								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				56	3			1409	1416		10.1016/j.electacta.2010.08.101				JAN 1 2011	2011	At gas-evolving electrodes, the product of an electrochemical reaction, e.g. H-2 or O-2, does initially not exist as a gas but in dissolved form in the electrolyte liquid. Its appearance in the form of gas bubbles results from subsequent desorption. However, the process of desorption from the liquid phase into the gaseous phase is commonly not complete in the vicinity of the electrode or at all in the interelectrode space. The fraction of the product transferred into the gaseous phase of gas bubbles adhering to the electrode surface is termed the gas-evolution efficiency. This quantity is one of the controlling parameters in estimating the rate of microconvective mass transfer, the industrially most important mechanism. A theoretical investigation shows the impact of the bubble coverage - previously only derived from an analysis of experimental data in combination with an unsubstantiated perception and gives information on further controlling quantities: the mass transfer coefficients of two competing mechanisms.

Herein, we show that the alkaline HER/HOR kinetics can be unified by the catalytic roles of the adsorbed hydroxyl (OHad)-water-alkali metal cation (AM(+)) adducts, on the basis of the observations that enriching the H-ad abundance via surface Ni benefits the HER/HOR; increasing the AM(+) concentration only promotes the HER, while varying the identity of AM+ affects both HER/HOR. The presence of OHad-(H2O) (H2O)(x)-AM(+) in the double-layer region facilitates the OHad removal into the bulk, forming OH--(H2O)(x)-AM(+) as per the hard-soft acid-base theory, thereby selectively promoting the HER. It can be detrimental to the HOR as per the bifunctional mechanism, as the AM(+) destabilizes the OHad, which is further supported by the CO oxidation results. This new notion may be important for alkaline electrochemistry.									127	6	0	0	6	0	127			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000459642000057	30673227

The structure of the material, named MoSx-SIM, was characterized spectroscopically and through a single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurement. These measurements and others established that the catalyst is monometallic, with mixed oxygen and sulfur coordination, and that it forms from a MOF-node-supported molybdenum-based cluster featuring only oxy ligands. Notably, the formal potential for the MOF-grafted complex, like that for the metal sulfur active site of hydrogenase, is nearly coincident with the formal potential for the hydrogen couple. Its effective concentration within the mesoporous MOF is several hundred millimolar, and its porous-framework-based immobilization/heterogenization obviates the need for aqueous solubility as a condition for use as a well-defined catalyst. MoSx-SIM was evaluated as an electrocatalyst for evolution of molecular hydrogen from aqueous acid. Although the MoSx-functionalized framework exhibits catalytic behavior, the highly insulating nature of the support inhibits high electrocatalytic performance. Introduction of an archetypal redox mediator (RM), methyl viologen (MV2+), resulted in more than 20-fold enhancement in its catalytic performance on a turnover frequency basis, implying efficient RM-assisted electron transfer to otherwise electrochemically non addressable MoSx moieties. Electrochemical kinetic studies with additional viologens as mediators reveal an unexpected square root dependence of overall reaction rate on mediator concentration, as well as sensitivity to the strength of RM center dot+- as a reductant. These observations, together with observations of potential-dependent H/D isotope effects and potential-dependent pH effects, provide useful insights into the catalysis mechanism and help to explain how the MOF-affixed monometallic catalyst can effectively catalyze a two-electron reduction reaction, i.e., hydrogen evolution from acidified water.									70	2	0	0	10	0	70			2155-5435			WOS:000447224100093

However, the formation mechanism and controlling factors of porphyry copper deposits remain obscure. Previous studies have revealed that porphyry copper deposits are usually associated with oxidized, calc-alkalic, adakitic shallow intrusive rocks. Here we show that hematite-magnetite intergrowths are commonly found in porphyry copper deposits, suggesting high and fluctuating oxygen fugacity (fO(2)). Oxidation promotes the destruction of sulfides in the magma source, and thereby increases initial chalcophile element concentrations. Sulfide remains undersaturated during the evolution of oxidized sulfur-enriched magmas where sulfate is the dominant sulfur species, leading to high chalcophile element concentrations in evolved magmas. The final porphyry copper mineralization is controlled by sulfate reduction, which starts with magnetite crystallization, accompanied by decreasing pH and correspondingly increasing fO(2). Hematite forms once sulfate reduction lowers the pH sufficiently and the fO(2) reaches the hematite-magnetite oxygen fugacity buffer, which in turn increases the pH for a given fO(2). The oxidation of ferrous iron during the crystallization of magnetite and hematite is the causal process of sulfate reduction and consequent mineralization. Therefore, the initial pH and fO(2) ranges of porphyries favorable for porphyry copper mineralization are defined by the hematite-magnetite oxygen fugacity buffer and SO42--HS--S-3(-) reaction lines. Adakitic rocks have higher initial contents of copper, sulfur and iron than normal arc rocks, and thus are the best candidates for porphyry copper deposits. These provide a plausible explanation for the formation of copper porphyry deposits. The hematite-magnetite intergrowth marks the upper limits of fO(2) favorable for the mineralization, and thus may be a powerful tool for future prospecting of large porphyry copper deposits.

Samples were transferred between the diamond growth chamber and attached ultrahigh vacuum analysis chamber without exposure to air. The time-dependent evolution of surface carbon species was monitored by interrupting growth at specific times and analyzing the surface with XPS. In this paper we compare samples prepared from four different mixtures of H2/CH4/O2. With low gas phase O/C ratios (less-than-or-equal-to 0.5) diamond growth on Pt proceeds by a three-step mechanism: (1) decomposition of surface contaminants to form graphitic carbon, (2) conversion of these graphitic species to stable hydrocarbon species, (3) replacement of hydrocarbons with diamond. At higher gas phase O/C ratios (greater-than-or-equal-to 0.75) we observed that the Pt surface had less than 1 ML of carbon. In other words, the surface was very clean, and diamond growth did not occur at a measurable rate. However, once diamond is nucleated on the surface under conditions of low oxygen concentration, diamond growth proceeds readily using a high oxygen feed with O/C = 1. We conclude that the addition of oxygen affects diamond formation primarily by decreasing the nucleation rate on metals like Pt. Growth rates of existing diamond films are not strongly affected by oxygen.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0021-8979			WOS:A1991FA70500039

For this purpose, electrochemical Cu(II) sensors appear as fully suitable because of their relatively high sensitivity, selectivity and adaptability for in situ measurements. So far, one of the usual electrochemical methods for Cu(II) sensing is adsorptive anodic stripping voltammetry (AdASV), since it offers a good selectivity, accumulation at open circuit potential and a reliable analytical response for concen-trations above 10 nmol.L-1. Surprisingly, no work has ever addressed an electrocatalytic procedure to enhance the electrochemical copper sensing and allowed detection below 10 nM. Thus, we have developed an original two-step strategy based on the surface modification of pencil graphite electrodes (PGE) with p-aminobenzyl-C-functionalized cyclam, a strong chelating ligand for Cu(II), as well as the use of a simple reaction which can be electrocatalyzed by Cu such as HER (Hydrogen Evolution Reaction) to finally determine the accumulated amount of copper catalyst on the PGE. We show here that (i) a well-defined diffusion-limited catalytic peak can be obtained from cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments with Cu(II)-cyclam-modified PGE, (ii) this HER peak po-tential is correlated to copper surface concentration, which can be sensed at the same time by adsorptive anodic stripping voltammetry and (iii) peak shift analysis (SA) of the voltammetric curves is a more sensitive method than the commonly used stripping voltammetry to reveal copper accumulation at modified PGE. Indeed, the limit of detection (LOD) reached with this method is one order of magnitude lower compared to AdASV (LOD = 1.1 nM and 16 nM, respectively). These results illustrate the ability of electrocatalysis to be a relevant tool under certain conditions for metal trace detection through SA.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000868933900001

Nickel (Ni) is considered one of the most active metal catalysts for electrochemical water oxidation reaction in the alkaline environment. To gain more insight into corroded nickel electrodes in the water oxidation reaction, we employed operando ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to detect the nickel/electrolyte interface under various potentials. To probe the influence of various halide anions on cycled Ni electrode/electrolyte interfaces undergoing the oxygen evolution reaction, we examined the surface changes in nickel electrodes after repeated electrochemical cycles in the presence of KOH mixed with KBr and KI under various potentials. As the applied potential became more anodic, we detected the formation of surface hydroxide and bromide when Br- was present in the electrolyte, whereas in I- -containing electrolytes, we found only hydroxides. The formation of oxidized Ni species was highly dependent on the type and concentration of halide ions. Br- facilitated the formation of more oxidized Ni species than I- did under the same concentration. In the presence of higher concentrations of potassium halide (100 mM) in the bulk electrolyte, metallic nickel could be completely oxidized at the most anodic potentials with surface hydroxide formation. This work reports the observation of cationic metal ions in the bulk electrolyte and describes in situ observation of degradation at the metal/electrolyte interface.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000668707800001

The catalytic efficiency of this material is dependent on both its surface morphology and surface chemistry. The surface chemistry was studied by photoelectron spectroscopy, and correlated with the electrochemical behavior through scanning voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. The results showed that the surface activity of the anode material is dependent on the amount of antimony present.

The prepared catalysts were subjected toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electro catalytic water splitting and photocatalytic degradation of bromophenol blue (BPB). TiO2 doped NiO having monoclinic phase with GO is confirmed by XRD profile. The introduction of TiO2 into NiO matrix and addition of GO has reduced intensity of XRD peaks in composites. The morphological structures confirm fluffy NiO with small spherical dark patches of TiO2 nanoparticles which are dispersed randomly on broken sheets of GO in composite structure. UV-Vis spectra illustrated obvious band gap reduction (similar to 2.0-2.6 eV) in various GO/Ti-NiO composites with improvement in visible light absorption. The generation of Ti - Ni - C junction in composite samples is examined by FTIR and Raman analysis. In OER (1M KOH) 4.0 wt. % GO/Ti-NiO generated the small Tafel slope of similar to 60 mVdec(-1), low R-ct similar to 4.1 Omega and high current density similar to 70 mAcm(-2) as compared to other samples. The composite materials govern OER process by Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. GO/Ti-NiO composite with 4.0 wt. % Ti shows the highest degradation (similar to 95 %) of BPB due to active surface sites generated by Ti - Ni - C linkages and interconnected conductive carbon materials of GO. Defective structure of GO provides favorable kinetics to the electro catalytic OER and supportive in enhancement of the electronic conduction. Ni2+ offers more active sites along with Ti4+ for OH- adsorption. Intermediate species of BPB have been identified by HPLC analysis. This work brings new insight for designing multifunctional materials for energy conversion and environmental remediation applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the assumed simplicity of oxides bears little relation to reality, impeding the progress towards fundamental understanding of electrocatalytic reactions on such materials. Here, we discuss the complexity of oxide surfaces and oxide-electrolyte interfaces and emphasize the challenges and pitfalls that receive little attention but are vital for the future of the field. We also make critical remarks on the existing experimental and theoretical approaches in fundamental electrocatalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2451-9103			WOS:000829180000005

The structure and texture of the platinum coatings were studied by X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and reflection high-energy electron diffraction. Potentiodynamic, polarization, mass-balance, and corrosion measurements were performed at electrodes having different types of texture, under the conditions of ammonium peroxydisulfate electrosynthesis and oxygen evolution in sulfuric acid solutions. It was found that in the processes studied, the textured Pt-Ti anodes have a higher electrocatalytic activity and corrosion resistance than potycrystalline Pt without texture and secure a maximum of efficiency in the desired reaction with a minimum of noble-metal consumption.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0038-5387			WOS:A1992KF13600001

This process, unfortunately, has been significantly impeded by the puzzles in either the efficient but economically unaffordable noble-metal-based catalysts or the low-cost but kinetically sluggish abundant-element-based catalysts. Particularly, the discovery of efficient bifunctional catalysts that can simultaneously trigger the reactions of both anode and cathode for overall water splitting still remains as a grand challenge. Herein, a novel low-cost bifunctional Ni2P/Ni0.96S heterostructured electrocatalyst, which is active for both the urea oxidation reaction at the anode and the hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode, is innovated for high-efficiency overall splitting of urea-rich wastewater. A systematic configuration of a Ni foam (NF)-supported Ni2P/Ni0.96S catalyst electrode exhibits superior catalytic activity and stability. The Ni2P/Ni0.96S/NF parallel to Ni2P/Ni0.96S/NF cell needs only 1.453 V to reach a current density of 100 mA/cm(2) in basic urea-containing water, while it is 1.693 V for a reference noble-based Pt/C/NF parallel to IrO2/NF electrolysis cell. This work therefore not only contributes to develop a low-cost, high-efficiency, bifunctional electrocatalyst but also provides a practically feasible approach for urea-rich wastewater treatment.									39	3	0	0	2	0	39			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000508464500026	31850739

A heteroatom-rich-conjugated microporous polymer is first chemically deposited on a carbon fiber cloth, and after addition of a cobalt salt, pyrolyzed to produce a heteroatom-doped C/Co nanocrystal composite. With this process, the use of additional binders for preparation of electrodes can be avoided. With a trace cobalt loading (0.46 wt%), the electrodes achieve a low Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1) and overpotential of only 69 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 m H2SO4. Experimental and computational studies reveal that the superior HER behavior is due to a decreased free energy of hydrogen adsorption, induced by i) electrons transferred from the cobalt nanocrystals to graphite layers and ii) N,O-dual doping reduced the Fermi level of neighboring C atoms.									31	4	0	0	4	0	33			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000447660700015	30230234

In this study, the alkoxide intermediate was isolated and characterized by in situ FT-IR spectroscopy. By using C6D12, we found that the rate-determining step involved the elimination of a proton. A kinetic study was carried out on the basis of our proposed photocatalytic cycle to identify the rate-determining step. Further, the rate of evolution of cyclohexanone produced by the photooxidation of cyclohexane was measured under various conditions to determine the reaction order. The rate-determining step was found to be the elimination of a proton from the adsorbed hydrocarbon under photoirradiation.									23	3	0	0	2	0	25			1932-7447			WOS:000269999700030

In particular, the exchange of hydrogen to deuterium is a standard approach to investigate kinetics and pathways of a wide spectrum of key reactions involving proton transfer. However, KIE in electrocatalysis is still challenge. One main reason is because of high sensitivities of electrochemical systems to impurities. Aiming to establish an appropriate approach to observe KIE in electrocatalysis, we investigated KIE in oxygen reduction reaction with platinum electrodes, which is well-known to be sensitive to impurity, by comparing electrochemical properties in fully deuterated ultrapure electrolytes and high purity but not ultrapure grade solutions. This experimental plan is based on the fact that D2O is usually used in electrochemical systems without additional purifications to reach an ultrapure grade. In the conclusion, the KIE in electrode processes in these systems can be strongly influenced by a purity of a deuterated electrolyte, especially in the case of alkaline conditions. Therefore, additional purifications of D2O is indispensable to study KIE in electrocatalysis. This work shows a method to observe a reliable KIE in electrocatalysis, and therefore, provides a general approach to investigate complicated electrode processes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the independence of each ZIF-8 particle with rhomb dodecahedral results in a physical stack and undesirable charge transfer path and subsequently induce the iron buried in the carbon matrix after the pyrolysis process, which further impedes the high loading of atomic iron (usually less than 1 wt%). Herein, we newly designed a novel steric tetra-imidazole structure to anchor iron in a cross way. This strategy achieves the synthesis of atomically dispersed FeN4 rich carbon-based electrocatalyst in one-step approach without any pretreatment and/or further acid leaching. Unlike the traditional imidazole in ZIF-8, the novel steric tetraimidazole structure exhibits a benzene ring located in the center of each four imidazole groups acting as sharing side-chain substitution, which can control the distance of each metal rivet center and impede the aggregation of iron effectively. The obtained catalyst, named as TimB-Fe-5-C, exhibits high atomic iron loading content up to 2.58 wt% and exhibits efficient ORR electrocatalytic performance in both alkaline and acid medium. Significantly, this new steric tetra-imidazole endows one-step facile synthesis of atomically dispersed electrocatalysts with high loading and to avoid unpredictable changes of structure brought by tedious pretreatment as well as post-treatment.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000618006100001

In conventional water electrolysis, the water oxidation and reduction reactions are coupled in both time and space, as they occur simultaneously at an anode and a cathode in the same cell. This introduces challenges, such as product separation, and sets strict constraints on material selection and process conditions. Here, we decouple these reactions by dividing the process into two steps: an electrochemical step that reduces water at the cathode and oxidizes the anode, followed by a spontaneous chemical step that is driven faster at higher temperature, which reduces the anode back to its initial state by oxidizing water. This enables overall water splitting at average cell voltages of 1.44-1.60 V with nominal current densities of 10-200 mA cm(-2) in a membrane-free, two-electrode cell. This allows us to produce hydrogen at low voltages in a simple, cyclic process with high efficiency, robustness, safety and scale-up potential.									151	14	0	0	9	0	155			2058-7546			WOS:000486098400013

Carboxylate groups (including possibly the C-terminus) on the manganese-stabilizing protein were modified with glycine methyl ester in a reaction facilitated by 1-ethyl-3- [3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide. The manganese-stabilizing protein that was modified while associated with NaCl-washed photosystem II membranes contained 1-2 modified carboxylates, whereas the protein that was modified while free in solution contained 4 modified carboxylates. Both types of modified protein could reconstitute oxygen evolution at high manganese-stabilizing protein to photosystem II reaction center ratios. However, the protein that had been modified in solution exhibited a dramatically altered binding affinity for photosystem LT. No such alteration in binding affinity was observed for the protein that had been modified while associated with the photosystem. Mapping of the sites of modification was carried out by trypsin and Staphylococcus V8 protease digestion of the modified proteins and analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. These studies indicated that the domains D-157-D-168 and E-212-(247)Q (C-terminus) are labeled only when the manganese-stabilizing protein is modified in solution. Modified carboxylates in these domains are responsible for the altered binding affinity of this protein for the photosystem.									31	0	0	0	30	0	31			0006-2960			WOS:000083417800018	10572001

The stability of these materials under different operating conditions is, however, still not fully understood. In the current work, activity and stability of well-defined Ru, RuO2, Ir, and IrO2 thin film electrodes are evaluated in acidic and alkaline electrolytes using an electrochemical scanning flow cell (SFC) connected to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Identical experimental protocols are intentionally employed for all electrodes and electrolytes, to obtain unambiguous and comparable information on intrinsic activity and stability of the electrodes. It is found that independent of the electrolyte, OER activity decreases as Ru >Ir approximate to RuO2 >IrO2, while dissolution increases as IrO2 << RuO2< Ir << Ru. Moreover, dissolution of these metals in both solutions is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher compared to their respective oxides, and dissolution is generally more intense in alkaline solutions. Similarly to the OER, metallic electrodes are more active catalysts for HER. They, however, suffer from dissolution during native oxide reduction, while Ir02 and Ru02 do not exhibit significant dissolution. The obtained results on activity and stability of the electrodes are discussed in light of their potential applications, i.e. water electrolysers or fuel cells. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here we investigate the water-oxidation reaction on haematite using infrared spectroscopy under photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-oxidation conditions. A potential-and light-dependent absorption peak at 898 cm(-1) is assigned to a Fe-IV=O group, which is an intermediate in the PEC water-oxidation reaction. These results provide direct evidence of high-valent iron-oxo intermediates as the product of the first hole-transfer reaction on the haematite surface and represent an important step in establishing the mechanism of PEC water oxidation on semiconductor electrodes.									252	7	0	0	30	0	253			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000380743300011	27442283

Herein, we demonstrate a novel one-pot incorporating-assisted compositing strategy to realize fine-tuning the concentration of S-vacancies (CS-vacancies) of MoS2-based materials to boost highly active EMAs for efficient HER. In our strategy, S-vacancies are modulated into basal planes of MoS2 via decreasing the formation energy of S-vacancies by oxygen incorporation; moreover, CS-vacancies of the basal planes is precisely regulated by simply controlling the molar amount of the Co precursor based on the electron injection effect. At low or excessively high CS-vacancies, the as-synthesized electrocatalysts lack "highly active EMAs" in quantity or nature. The balance between the intrinsic activity of EMAs and NEMAs is realized for boosting EMAs with high catalytic performance. The optimal electrocatalysts exhibit excellent activity and stability at fine-tuning CS-vacancies to 9.61%. Our results will pave a novel strategy for unlocking the potential of an inert basal plane in MoS2 for high-performance HER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000823340500001	35767388

In our work, Cu-Co-M (M = O, S, P, Se, S-P, and P-S) materials were grown in situ on three-dimensional (3D) porous nickel foam (NF) with good electrical conductivity by hydrothermal synthesis, vulcanization, selenylation, and phosphorization of the Cu-Co-precursor under an Ar atmosphere. Cu-Co-P-S/NF presents an overpotential value of 220 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) for OER and that for Cu-Co-P-S/NF of 120 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER in an alkaline medium. In addition, considering the superior activities of Cu-Co-P-S/NF for OER and HER, the electrode pairing of Cu-Co-P-S-OER//Cu-Co-P-S-HER is designed for overall water splitting, and the experimental result shows that only a cell voltage of 1.55 V is needed to obtain a current density of 20 mA cm(-2). According to the literature, this cell voltage is also among the lowest values that have been previously reported for electrocatalytic water splitting. Further, Cu-Co-P-S//Cu-Co-P-S exhibited efficient stability during a 20 h durability test without significant attenuation under alkaline conditions. By using XPS spectroscopy characterization, it was shown that Cu-Co-P-S presented the highest catalytic performance and long-term durability owing to the abundance of Co3+. The novelty of selecting the highest activity with the same catalyst for OER and HER from Cu-Co-M (M = O, S, P, Se, S-P, and P-S) in order to obtain a well-matched electrode pair, and therefore, simplifying the water-splitting device affords a wide range of possibilities for further exploitation of environmentally friendly and highly efficient electrode pairs.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000459625900015	30608092

Although studying the impact of thermo-oxidative degradation during sintering has significant practical importance, few studies have focused on this aspect of the sintering process. In the present work, we have investigated the active thermo-oxidative degradation mechanisms during sintering of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) particles, the conditions that promote them, and their respective impact on the morphological evolution of the polyethylene particles. To perform a comprehensive study, we have complemented the rheological, thermal, chemical, and morphological analysis of the sintered HDPE particles with the study of their ensemble pore structure. We observed two distinct degradation regimes. At the beginning, the relatively low concentration of oxygen in the particles led to the dominance of branching and resulted in a pore structure evolution limited to surface relaxation. In the second regime and with the diffusion of more oxygen, chain scission became the dominant route. In this regime, the emergence of highly mobile short chains markedly accelerated the pore evolution.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0021-8995	1097-4628		WOS:000597755700001

Physical processes related to the problem of nucleosynthesis at the surface of stars								Rivista del Nuovo Cimento				1				334	55						April 1969	1969	A schematic summary of star formation and evolution is given. Stellar abundances of the elements are reviewed and evidence for the production of cosmic rays at the surface stars is examined. The production of the light elements (Li, Be, B) by spallation of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen due to protons generated in the outer layers of the stellar atmosphere is discussed. Acceleration mechanisms for these protons are considered. It is seen that several processes are probably required to account for the formation of the observed abundances of the heavier processes and these processes are discussed.

In this work, double boron atom-anchored two-dimensional (2D) graphdiyne (GDY-2B) electrocatalysts have been designed and examined for the N-2 reduction reaction (NRR) by density functional theory computations. Our calculations revealed that double boron atoms can be strongly embedded in a graphdiyne monolayer. In particular, configuration GDY-2B(S2S2 ') with two boron atoms substituting two equivalent sp-carbon atoms of diacetylene linkages exhibits excellent catalytic performance for reducing N-2, with an extremely low overpotential of 0.12 V. The "pull-pull" mechanism imposed by doped double boron atoms is responsible for the magnificent effect of N-2 activation. Besides, the competitive reaction of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is suppressed owing to a large Delta G(H*) value of -1.25 eV. Based on these results, our study provides useful guidelines for designing effective double atomic catalysts (DACs) based on nonmetal 2D nanosheets for effective electrochemical reduction reactions.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000683362900001	34373884

Herein, we attempt to synthesize a low-cost copper sulfide bifunctional electrocatalyst and modulated the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity by silver doping at desired amounts by a facile chemical bath deposition technique. The intrinsic activity of the CuS by Ag doping was closely monitored and presented with detailed OER and HER electrochemical characterizations. Finally, the optimized overall water splitting electrolyzer with a doping level of Ag 10 % exhibited a relatively low cell voltage of 1.55 V at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). The surface having Ag1+ and Cu1+ oxidation states could effectively fetch electrons from OH- species leading to higher intrinsic activity. The stability of the best electrocatalyst checked up to 40 hours at a high current rate of 200 mA/cm(2) and shows a stable oxidation state. This work provides an important Ag doping strategy for bifunctional electrocatalyst to enhance their intrinsic catalytic activity for overall water splitting application.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000799213100001

The most efficient photocatalyst for the overall water splitting is the trimetallic MOF UiO-66(Zr/Ce/Ti) which achieves 230 mu mol.g(-1) of H-2 and 110 mu mol.g(-1) of O-2, upon UV light irradiation, and 210 mu mol.g(-1) of H-2 and 70 mu mol.g(-1) of O-2, under visible light irradiation. These productivity data indicate that a considerable percentage of its photocatalytic activity derives from the visible region of the spectrum (lambda > 450 nm). The photocatalytic activity of trimetallic UiO-66(Zr/Ce/Ti) was maintained upon reuse. Kinetics of the charge separated state monitored by transient absorption spectroscopy shows similar deactivation profiles for the five UiO-66 samples, suggesting that it is the charge separation efficiency the main factor responsible for the differences in the photocatalytic activity. The use of methanol as sacrificial agent during the photocatalytic experiments indicated that the high photocatalytic efficiency for overall water splitting in UiO-66(Zr/Ce/Ti) derives from the favorable kinetics of oxygen evolution. These results show the potential of multimetallic metal-organic frameworks as solar photocatalysts by tuning light absorption towards the visible region.									50	2	0	0	2	0	50			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000564570600005

Highly active and durable electrocatalysts are required to sustain seawater splitting. Herein we report the phosphidation-based synthesis of a cobalt-iron-phosphate ((Co,Fe)PO4) electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) toward alkaline seawater splitting. (Co,Fe)PO4 demonstrates high HER activity and durability in alkaline natural seawater (1 M KOH + seawater), delivering a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 137 mV. Furthermore, the measured potential of the electrocatalyst ((Co,Fe)PO4) at a constant current density of -100 mA/cm(2) remains very stable without noticeable degradation for 72 h during the continuous operation in alkaline natural seawater, demonstrating its suitability for seawater applications. Furthermore, an alkaline seawater electrolyzer employing the non-precious-metal catalysts demonstrates better performance (1.625 V at 10 mA/cm(2)) than one employing precious metal ones (1.653 V at 10 mA/cm(2)). The non-precious-metal-based alkaline seawater electrolyzer exhibits a high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency (12.8%) in a commercial silicon solar cell.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2079-4991		WOS:000726916400001	34835753

In this work, for the first time, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanodots have been synthesized by ionic liquid assisted grinding exfoliation of bulk platelets and isolated by sequential centrifugation. The nanodots have a thickness of up to 7 layers (similar to 4 nm) and an average lateral size smaller than 20 nm. Detailed structural characterization established that the nanodots retained the crystalline quality and low oxidation states of the bulk material. The small lateral size and reduced number of layers provided these nanodots with an easier path for the electron transport and plentiful active sites for the catalysis of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic electrolyte. The MoS2 nanodots exhibited good durability and a Tafel slope of 61 mV dec(-1) with an estimated onset potential of -0.09 V vs RHE, which are considered among the best values achieved for 2H phase. It is envisaged that this work may provide a simplistic route to synthesize a wide range of 2D layered nanodots that have applications in water splitting and other energy related technologies.									245	2	0	0	13	0	246			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000357436800046	26052739

Electrocatalytic reaction and catalyst materials play vital roles in the process of catalysis. Two dimensional layered materials have been widely used as electrode materials in electrocatalysis and energy storage devices thanks to their high specific surface area and unique electronic properties. Among them, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have a good development prospect in the electrocatalysis process and preparation of catalyst materials due to their typical layered structure and unique advantages such as low price, easy to be prepared and functionalized, good tunability in the composition and structure, etc. This review summarizes the research progress of LDHs applied in catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), catalyst supporter and used as precursor to prepare electrocatalyst. Especially, we discusse the recent advances in tuning LDHs including electronic structure, morphology, interface interaction and synergetic catalytic effect with noble metal catalyst to improve the catalytic performance. In addition, we briefly describe the preparation of electrocatalysts using LDHs as precursors. Finally, the current difficulties and future research directions of LDHs are also discussed to give an outlook of their prospect in electrocatalysis.									6	5	0	0	0	0	8			1005-281X			WOS:000465198900005

In this work, a brief and scalable strategy was presented to synthesize nickel sulfide and multi-walled carbon nanotube composites on Ni foam, denoted as Ni3S2/MWCNTs/NF. Electrochemical measurements show that Ni3S2/MWCNTs/NF can be an efficient electrocatalyst for UOR. A potential of 1.338 V was required at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2)for UOR with Ni3S2/MWCNTs/NF. This UOR catalyst was used to replace OER for hydrogen production, which reduced the overpotential required for H-2-production and reduced overall power consumption. Also, the Ni3S2/MWCNTs/NF catalyst exhibited high electrocatalytic efficiency to evolve hydrogen, which provided a low overpotential of only 104 mV at 10 mAcm(-2). As a proof of concept, a water-urea electrolysis measurement was carried out in 1 M KOH with 0.5 M urea using Ni3S2/MWCNTs/NF as the cathode and anode, respectively. Ni3S2/MWCNTs/NF divide divide Ni3S2/MWCNTs/NF electrodes provided a current density of 10 mAcm(-2)at a voltage of 1.509 V, which was 149 mV lower than that of water splitting, which proved that this catalyst may be commercially viable in energy-saving hydrogen production.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000568418900001

The key is to obtain a catalyst with optimal and balanced OH adsorption energy and H adsorption/H-2 desorption energy. Herein, we synthesized a Ni17W3/WO2 catalyst on the Ni foam that optimized the coverage and size of Ni17W3 alloys decorated on the NiWO4/WO2 substrate. Our experiments showed that Ni17W3-NiWO4 interfaces could accelerate water dissociation, and Ni17W3-WO2 interfaces facilitate adsorbed H atoms spillover and H-2 desorption. In addition, we applied a suite of characterization techniques to analyze surface evolution processes in catalysts under various cathodic potentials so as to illustrate the competition between chemical oxidation and electrochemical reduction reactions. The results demonstrated that high coverage of large Ni17W3 nanoparticles resulted in a greater stable interface. The two efficient interfaces synergetically promote the Volmer-Tafel reaction. Ni17W3/WO2 catalysts exhibited extraordinary HER activity with a low overpotential of 48 mV at a 10 mA cm(-2) current density and a Tafel slope of 33 mV dec(-1).

While these photoanodes exhibit very different current/voltage performance, their underlying water oxidation kinetics are found to be almost invariant. Higher temperature thermal annealing was found to correlate with a shift in the photocurrent onset potential toward less positive potentials, assigned to a suppression of both back electron-hole recombination and of charge accumulation in intra-bandgap states, indicating these intra-bandgap states do not contribute directly to water oxidation.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			1948-7185			WOS:000569375400050	32787321

The viscosity of the HEC solution decreased significantly and the evolution of carbon dioxide was found during irradiation. The degree of polymerization of the HEC changed rapidly (especially in the initial reaction stages). The molecular size distribution of the irradiated HEC was studied by high performance liquid chromatography. Similar effects were observed during solar irradiation of HEC in aqueous Pt-TiO2 suspension. The mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of HEC is suggested.									19	1	0	0	7	1	19			1010-6030			WOS:A1991GQ54600010

So far, only platinum (Pt)-group catalysts have shown adequate performance and stability. A well-known approach to increase the efficiency and decrease the Pt loading is to alloy Pt with other metals. Still, for catalyst optimization, the nature of the active sites is crucial. In this work, electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (EC-STM) is used to probe the ORR active areas on Pt5Gd and Pt5Pr in acidic media under reaction conditions. The technique detects localized fluctuations in the EC-STM signal, which indicates differences in the local activity. The in situ experiments, supported by coordination-activity plots based on density functional theory calculations, show that the compressed Pt-lanthanide (111) terraces contribute the most to the overall activity. Sites with higher coordination, as found at the bottom of step edges or concavities, remain relatively inactive. Sites of lower coordination, as found near the top of step edges, show higher activity, presumably due to an interplay of strain and steric hindrance effects. These findings should be vital in designing nanostructured Pt-lanthanide electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000813026400001	35442013

This continuous, 3.8 Ga long secular trend has been attributed to 80 degrees C hot early Earth oceans, a similar to 15 parts per thousand lower O-18/O-16 ratio of Archean seawater, or diagenetic obliteration of the original isotope signal. We demonstrate that high-precision triple oxygen isotope measurements including the rare third stable oxygen isotope O-17 on silica rocks (cherts) can be used to shed light on this major problem in geochemistry. Our triple oxygen isotope data do not support 80 degrees C hot oceans in the Archean. The data also exclude that the O-18/O-16 of seawater was much lower in the Archean. Also, a simple freshwater-origin of cherts is not supported by the new data. We discuss the effects of diagenetic alteration on the triple oxygen isotope compositions of cherts and show that the Archean and Proterozoic cherts could have equilibrated with fluids with higher O-18/O-16 than today's oceans. For the Archean cherts, the high O-18/O-16 fluids required to explain the observations could reflect the composition of ambient seawater or of modified hydrothermal fluids. Oceans with higher O-18/O-16 ratio would be expected for an Archean "water world" without large continents. High O-18/O-16 fluids, however, could also have formed locally by reactions between seawater and the oceanic crust. Our study shows that high-precision triple oxygen isotope data provide new understandings of processes deep in time.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			0009-2541	1872-6836		WOS:000580659800002

Morphological reconstruction and phase transformation of CuxO occurs through the iterative electrochemical redox reaction, as indicated by energy-dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The activated Ag/CuxO/C catalysts exhibits enhanced oxygen reduction reaction performance, with an onset potential of 0.86 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, a Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1), and a high stability as compared to Ag/C. A mechanistic study using density functional theory shows that the weakened binding energy of the OH intermediate, originating from the charge transfer from Ag to CuxO, improves the ORR activity at the interface sites of the Ag/CuxO electrocatalysts. Ag/CuxO shows a higher limiting potential of 0.14 V for interface sites than isolated Ag nanoparticles. The interfacial charge transfer between Ag and CuO is verified experimentally.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000807019600001

Electrochemical water splitting by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a straightforward route to producing hydrogen (H-2), which requires an efficient electrocatalyst to minimize energy consumption. Recent advances have created a rapid rise in new electrocatalysts, particularly those based on non-precious metals. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the recent developments of ternary and quaternary 6d-group transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) based electrocatalysts for water splitting, especially for HER. Detailed discussion is organized from binary to quaternary TMCs including, surface engineering, heterostructures, chalcogen substitutions and hierarchically structural design in TMCs. Moreover, emphasis is placed on future research scope and important challenges facing these electrocatalysts for further development in their performance towards water splitting.									30	1	1	0	1	0	30			2073-4344			WOS:000451150200067

Recently, electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by water splitting has been extensively studied with a focus on developing efficient electrocatalysts that can afford HER at overpotential with minimum power consumption. The two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitride, also known as MXenes, are becoming the rising star in developing efficient electrocatalysts for HER, owing to their integrated chemical and electronic properties, e.g., metallic conductivity, variety of redox-active transition metals, high hydrophilicity, and tunable surface functionalities. In this review, the recent progress about the fundamental understanding and materials engineering of MXenes-based electrocatalysts is summarized in concern with two aspects: i) the regulation of the intrinsic properties of MXenes, which include the composition, surface functionality, and defects; and ii) MXenes-based composites for HER process. In the end, we summarize the present challenges concerning the efficiency of MXenes-based HER electrocatalysts and propose the directions of future research efforts.

In this work, the nanohybrid of carbon quantum dots and molybdenum phosphide nanopartide (CQDs/MoP) has been firstly demonstrated as an efficient alkaline HER electrocatalyst. The CQDs/MoP nanohybrid is readily prepared through a charge-directed self-assembly of CQDs with phosphomolybdic acid (H3PMo12O40) at the molecular level, followed by facile phosphatizing at 700 degrees C. The introduction of CQDs greatly helps to alleviate the agglomeration and surface oxidation of MoP nanoparticles and ensures each MoP nanoparticle to be electronically addressed, thus significantly enhancing the intrinsic catalytic activity of MoP. The optimized CQDs/MoP exhibits high-efficiency synergistic catalysis toward HER in 1 M KOH electrolyte with a low onset potential of -0.08 V and a small Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1) as well as high durability with negligible current loss for at least 24 h.									58	3	0	0	4	0	58			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000428356800031	29485265

Here, we present a deep fundamental work on the influence of the various possible facets exposed on this material for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions using hybrid density functional theory. The energetic, electronic, water redox, and charge carrier transport features of the four possible (100), (010), (001), and (110) facets (low-Miller index surfaces) are investigated, and significant anisotropic nature is revealed. The relevant properties of each facet to the water oxidation/reduction reactions are correlated with the surface W coordination number. Taking into account the stability and combining optoelectronic and water redox features together of each surface, our work demonstrates that the (110) facet is photocatalytically the best candidate for the OER, while the (100) facet is the best candidate for the HER. Their transport characteristics are found to be much better than those obtained for the three major (121), (210), and (111) facets of synthesized alpha-SnWO4 samples. Substitutional Ge at the Sn site and Mo at the W site on the two (110) and (100) facets are expected to increase the rates of the water oxidation/reduction reactions. An analysis of the reaction mechanism for the OER in (110)-oriented alpha-SnWO4 reveals a promising performance of this facet for electrocatalytic water oxidation. These outcomes will greatly motivate experimentalists for carefully designing (110)- and (100)-oriented alpha-SnWO4 samples to enhance the photo(electro)catalytic OER and photocatalytic HER performances.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000647271300003

Pt-TiN systems are strong contenders for commercial catalysts, although the charge screening of Pt and non-involvement of N reduces their effective MSI and limits it to the Pt-Ti interface. Here, the bias driven landing of gas phase synthesized Pt nanoparticles (NPs) is used to change the nature of the MSI and enhance the charge transfer phenomenon. Bias driven landing of the Pt NPs translates their impact energies to the TiN surface, resulting in a weakening of the Ti-N bonds. This facilitates a new interaction between the Pt and N atoms, resulting in an electronic equilibration in the N-Pt-Ti triumvirate, nullifying the charge screening of Pt. This change in the nature of the MSI enables long range charge transfer throughout the catalyst surface and an increase in the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of the Pt-TiN system.									3	1	0	0	1	0	4			2055-6756	2055-6764		WOS:000573313700005	32851387

The effects of the surface treatment on the oxygen and hydrogen evolution from the electrodes are studied by using cyclic voltammetry tests. Although the positive and negative active materials of the Ni-MH batteries show a lower self-decomposition rate after the CMC treatment, the self-discharge rate of the batteries show little change. On the contrary, the self-discharge rate of the batteries decreases from 35.9% to 27.1% by using the PTFE-treated Ni(OH)(2) electrodes, which might be related to the suppression of the reaction between NiOOH and H-2 by the hydrophobic film.

Herein, thin layers of manganese oxide nanosheets supported on nitrogen-functionalized carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) were formed by the treatment of NCNTs dispersed in aqueous solutions of KMnO4 or CsMnO4 under reflux or under hydrothermal (HT) conditions and used as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. The samples were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Our results show that the NCNTs treated under reflux were covered by partly amorphous and birnessite-type manganese oxides, while predominantly crystalline birnessite manganese oxide was observed for the hydrothermally treated samples. The latter showed, depending on the temperature during synthesis, an electrocatalytically favorable reduction from birnessite-type MnO2 to gamma-MnOOH. OER activity measurements revealed a decrease of the overpotential for the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) from 1.70 V-RHE for the bare NCNTs to 1.64 V-RHE for the samples treated under reflux in the presence of KMnO4. The hydrothermally treated samples afforded the same current density at a lower potential of 1.60 V-RHE and a Tafel slope of 75 mV dec(-1), suggesting that the higher OER activity is due to gamma-MnOOH formation. Oxidative deposition under reflux conditions using CsMnO4 along with mild HT treatment using KMnO4, and low manganese loadings in both cases, were identified as the most suitable synthetic routes to obtain highly active MnOx/NCNT catalysts for electrochemical water oxidation.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2470-1343			WOS:000446186000085	31459231

Herein, four different hollow porous platinum-copper (PtCu) nanotubes (NTs) with controllable compositions were precisely fabricated by a facile wet-chemistry method. Importantly, Pt5Cu2 NTs display the best hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in all pH con-ditions compared to other samples, which just require overpotentials of 34 +/- 2, 32 +/- 2, and 284 +/- 2 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in basic, acidic, and neutral solutions, respectively. Moreover, Pt5Cu2 NTs also exhibit out-standing stability and corrosion resistance in all pH ranges. Then, mechanism analysis reveals that the electronic structure of Pt sites is regulated by changing the ratio of Pt and Cu, which directly optimizes the binding energy of reaction intermediates and promotes electron transfer during the HER process. In addition, a porous nanotube structure with countless nanoparticles on the surface provides a large num-ber of active sites, enhancing the adsorption/desorption of reactants. This work emphasizes the impor-tance of catalyst composition and provides a highly active potential HER catalyst for practical hydrogen production. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Fluorine has been added to the batch compositions by the direct exchange of fluorine for oxygen (2F(-) = O2-). The first join is the pseudo-ternary Forsterite - Diopside - KAlSiO3F2 system. Forsterite, diopside, F-phlogopite and leucite crystallisation fields and a fluoride-silicate liquid immiscibility solvus are present on the liquidus surface of the join. Sub-liquidus and sub-solidus phases include akermanite, cuspidine, spinel, fluorite and some other minor fluorine phases. The second system is the pseudobinary Akermanite - F-phlogopite join that intersects the Forsterite - Diopside - KAlSiO3F2 join. Akermanite, forsterite, diopside, F-phlogopite, leucite and cuspidine are found to crystallise on the join. Forsterite (fo) and leucite (Ic) are related to F-phlogopite (phl) by a reaction with the fluorine-bearing liquid: fo + Ic + l = phl, and the reaction proceeds until forsterite or leucite are completely consumed. The reaction temperature and resulting phase association depend on batch composition. Thus, leucite is not stable in the sub-solidus of the Akermanite - F-phlogopite join, but is preserved in a part of the Forsterite - Diopside - KAl-SiO3F2 system where forsterite reacts out, or does not crystallise at all. The phlogopite-in reaction has an important effect on the composition of the coexisting liquid. The liquids initially saturated in forsterite evolve to extremely Ca rich, larnite-normative residuals. The experimental data show that larnite-normative melilitolites can crystallise from evolved melilititic melts generated from "normal" melanephelinitic parental magmas with no normative larnite. The evolution towards melilitites requires fractionation of phlogopite-bearing assemblages under volatile pressure.									25	3	0	0	0	0	26			0010-7999			WOS:000074435700003

And the mesoporous structure and high surface area inherited from the TiN carrier were also maintained in the composite. Benefit from these characteristics, the as-prepared TiN/IrO2 with IrO2 loading of 31 wt% possessed a mass-normalized OER activity of 874.0 A g(-1)(IrO2) at the potential of 1.6 V that was about 5.0 times of the unsupported IrO2 (176.0 A g(-1)IrO(2)).									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000509689700025

Cobalt nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Co-NCNT) was synthesis by a facile method. Using CoCl2 center dot 6H(2)O and melamine as raw material, products with different morphologies and properties were obtained at different temperatures. Among them, the material has the best HER performance at 700 degrees C, and the overpotential has reached 251 mV when the current density is 10 mA center dot cm(-2). At the same time, the Tafel slope of the sample is 79 mV/dec. The improvement in HER performance was attributed to the N-doping of carbon nanotubes with nano-scale cobalt particles.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1536-383X	1536-4046		WOS:000488709200001

The main challenge to promote the deployment of the polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis (PEMVVE) technology lies in the design of robust catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under acidic conditions, since most of the transition metal-based oxides undergo structural degradation under these harsh acidic conditions. To broaden the variety of candidate materials as OER catalysts, a cation-exchange synthetic route was recently explored to reach crystalline pronated iridates with unique structural properties and stability. In this work, a new protonated phase H3.6IrO4 center dot 3.7H(2)O, prepared via Sr2+/H+ cation exchange at room temperature starting from the parent Ruddlesden-Popper Sr2IrO4 phase, is described. This is the first discovery of crystalline protonated iridate forming from a perovskite-like phase, adopting a layered structure with apex-linked IrO6 octahedra. Furthermore, H3.6IrO4 center dot 3.7H(2)O is found to possess not only an enhanced specific catalytic activity, superior to that of other perovskite-based iridates, but also a mass activity comparable to that of nanosized IrOx particles, while showing an improved catalytic stability owing to its ability to reversibly exchange protons in acid.									21	1	0	0	1	0	21			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000529878600019

Here we report a simple method for the synthesis of Ru octahedral nanocrystals with an fcc structure and an edge length of 9 nm. The success of this synthesis relies on the use of 4.5 nm Rh cubes as seeds to facilitate the heterogeneous nucleation and overgrowth of Ru atoms. We choose Rh because it can resist oxidative etching under the harsh conditions for Ru overgrowth, it can be readily prepared as nanocubes with edge lengths less than 5 nm, and its atoms have a size close to that of Ru atoms. During the seed-mediated growth, the atomic packing of Ru overlayers follows an fcc lattice, in contrast to the conventional hexagonal close-packed (hcp) lattice associated with bulk Ru. The final product takes an octahedral shape, with the surface enclosed by {111} facets. Our in situ measurements suggest that both the octahedral shape and the fcc crystal structure can be well preserved up to 400 degrees C, which is more than 100 degrees C higher than what was reported for Ru octahedral nanocages. When utilized as catalysts, the Ru octahedral nanocrystals exhibited 4.4-fold enhancement in terms of specific activity toward oxygen evolution relative to hcp-Ru nanoparticles. We also demonstrate that Ru{111} facets are more active than Ru{100} facets in catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction. Altogether, this work offers an effective method for the synthesis of Ru nanocrystals with an fcc structure and well-defined {111} facets, as well as enhanced thermal stability and catalytic activity. We believe these nanocrystals will find use in various catalytic applications.									71	8	0	0	5	0	71			0002-7863			WOS:000466987900034	30973711

Herein, we synthesize a phosphorus (PO) protection layer and non-precious FexCoyNizP and MnOa cocatalysts on Zn0.4Cd0.6S by a safe and energy-saving two-step photochemical strategy. The prepared Zn0.4Cd0.6S/PO/Fe(x)Co(y)Ni(z)Pi-MnOa photocatalyst displays average hydrogen and oxygen evolution rates of similar to 1.14 mmol h(-1) g(-1) and similar to 0.54 mmol h(-1) g(-1) in POWS, respectively, where FexCoyNizP and MnOa act as the photogenerated electron and hole acceptors and provide the active sites for the two reactions. The superior POWS performance was maintained for 12 hours without any obvious attenuation. Moreover, photocatalytic partial water splitting (PPWS) is induced by the oxidation of NaH2PO2 during the photochemical synthesis process, yielding hydrogen evolution rates of 7.22 mmol h(-1) g(-1) and 5.90 mmol h(-1) g(-1), respectively. By integrating the two-step photochemical synthesis and POWS process (PPWS -> PPWS -> POWS), we obtain a total H-2 yield of about 4.85 mmol under 17 h visible light irradiation, which corresponds to an average H-2 evolution rate of 0.29 mmol h(-1). This work develops a safe and energy-saving photochemical synthesis strategy for Zn1-xCdxS-based photocatalysts, which not only exhibits excellent POWS performance but opens an avenue for the tandem application of PPWS and POWS to achieve a high H-2 total yield for solar-energy conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000825693800001

Chemistry involving the high energy oxygen metastable molecules O-2(M)(A (3)Sigma(u)(+)+C (3)Delta(u)+c (1)Sigma(u)(-)) was included in the simulation. This chemistry was necessary to capture the experimentally observed increase in the O- negative ion density in the afterglow of the pulsed discharge. As the electron temperature drops in the afterglow, the rate coefficient of electron attachment with O-2(M) increases several fold. The wall recombination probability of oxygen atoms affected the O- density drastically. For the conditions studied, the maximum O- density in the afterglow increased with pressure, decreased with power, and showed a maximum with pulse period. The time in the afterglow at which the peak O- density occurred decreased with pressure and power, and was independent of the pulse period. Knowing the temporal evolution of O- in the afterglow may be important for applications requiring extraction of negative ions out of the discharge. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

PCC7942 on its photoinhibition were investigated. The photosynthetic oxygen evolution of samples under a strong irradiance treatment at 100 mu M KHCO3 was much higher than that at 10,000 mu M KHCO3. After strong irradiance treatment, the abundance of the sbtA transcript encoding a Na+-dependent HCO3- transporter was significantly higher under treatment at 100 mu M KHCO3 than at 10,000 mu M KHCO3. Lincomycin had little effect on the difference of photosystem II (PSII) activity decline under these two treatments, which suggests that CCM activity reduces photodamage but does not boost the rate of PSII repair. The maximal photosynthetic efficiency was decreased significantly during the strong irradiance treatment, and its decrease was enhanced when the external DIC concentration was raised from 100 to 10,000 mu M KHCO3. The JIP test showed that there were more active reaction centres under low C-i conditions after high light treatment. Studies on 77-K fluorescence emission spectra showed that the fluorescence peaks F-692 (nm) and F-710 nm in 10,000-mu M KHCO3 treated samples both decreased after strong irradiance treatment and were significantly smaller than those of 100-mu M KHCO3 treated samples. Samples treated with 100 mu M KHCO3, compared to 10,000 mu M KHCO3 had a higher possibility of transmitting an exciton to a closed reaction centre rather than to an open reaction centre and thus to reduce the overexcitation of the reaction centres. These results indicated that higher external inorganic carbon concentration was associated with more severe photoinhibition under high irradiance and that the operation of CO2 concentrating mechanism might reduce the overexcitation of reaction centres to reduce photodamage.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0031-8884	2330-2968		WOS:000260876600005		
J	Khan, MA; Al-Jalal, AA; Bakhtiari, IA					Aljalal, Abdulaziz/0000-0003-3967-2763			'Decoking' of a 'coked' zeolite catalyst in a glow discharge								ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				377	1			89	96		10.1007/s00216-003-2027-6				SEP 2003	2003	'Decoking' of a 'coked' zeolite catalyst in a glow discharge in oxygen is investigated. The 'decoking' process involves reactions of atomic oxygen (O atoms) with 'coke' and yields gases such as CO, CO2 as well as other gaseous products that could be easily pumped out.Three different modes of discharge were investigated including a static mode, a flowing-gas mode, and a periodic-purge mode where the oxygen and other gaseous products of the discharge were replaced by fresh O-2 gas after short but regular intervals of time. In some cases, additional heating was also used to provide base temperatures of the order of 100 degreesC to facilitate penetration of oxygen atoms into the inner layers and cages of the zeolite catalyst.This paper presents some results of spectroscopic analytical techniques used to monitor the atomization of oxygen, oxidation of 'coke', and to confirm the process of 'decoking'. More specifically, radiation emission on the 3 s S-5- 3p P-5 transitions of O around 777.2-777.5 nm were selected for monitoring the atomization of O-2. On the other hand, X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the amount of residual carbon and extent of 'decoking'. Furthermore, evolution of CO and CO2 gases as a function of time was systematically monitored in real time. For CO, the 451.1 nm band head belonging to the B(1)Sigma - A(1)Pi bands of the Angstrom system of the CO spectrum was used, while for CO2, the band head at 353.4 nm belonging to the CO2+ spectrum was used. The rates of evolution of CO and CO2 were related to the rate of 'decoking' of the catalyst. It is noted that in the periodic-purge mode, about 63% of the total yield of CO from a given sample of the catalyst appears in the first 3-min exposure to discharge whereas it takes up to 15 min to remove nearly 94% of the removable carbon under our experimental conditions.

It uses solar energy to catalyse the breakdown of water to reducing equivalents and molecular oxygen(1). Native photosystem II comprises more than 25 different subunits, and has a relative molecular mass of more than 600K. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of a photosystem II subcomplex, containing the proteins D1, D2, CP47 and cytochrome b-559, determined by electron crystallography. This CP47 reaction centre, which has a relative molecular mass of 160K, can perform light-mediated energy and electron-transfer reactions but is unable to oxidize water(2). The complex contains 23 transmembrane alpha-helices, of which 16 have been assigned to the D1, D2 and CP47 proteins. The arrangement of these helices is remarkably similar to that of the helices in the reaction centres of purple bacteria and of plant photosystem I, indicating a common evolutionary origin for these assemblies. The map suggests that redox cofactors in the D1-D2 complex are located in positions analogous to those in the bacterial reaction centre, but the distance between the chlorophylls corresponding to the bacterial 'special pair' is significantly larger.									283	9	1	0	202	1	296			0028-0836			WOS:000077110400052	9834037

Palladium (Pd) holds great promise for catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) but 2D Pd-based ORR catalyst has rarely been reported. Herein, 2D ternary palladium phosphoronitride (Pd3P2Nx) is synthesized, for the first time, for ORR catalysis. The synthesis is guided by a rational design using first-principles density functional theory calculations, and then realized via a postsynthesis substitutional doping of ternary palladium thiophosphate (Pd3P2S8), which almost completely replaces sulfur atoms by nitrogen atoms without destroying the 2D morphology. The doping process exposes the interlocked Pd atoms of Pd3P2S8 and introduces ligands that improve the affinity of oxygen intermediates, resulting in greater kinetics and lower activation energy for ORR. The mass activity of the pristine Pd3P2S8 is dramatically increased as much as 5-fold (from 0.03 to 0.151 mA mu g( Pd)(-1) in Pd3P2Nx. The ORR diffusion-limited current density of Pd3P2Nx (6.2 mA cm(-2)) exceeds that of commercial Pt/C, and it shows fast kinetics and robust long-term stability. Our theoretical calculations not only guide the experimental doping process, but also provides insights into the underlying mechanism of the outstanding ORR activity and stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000787549000013	35255212

Considering the large surface/volume ratio, exploration of two-dimensional materials with high-efficient basal plane has attracted a great enthusiasm in designing electrocatalysts. Herein, tetragonal copper selenide (CuSe) was identified as a promising candidate toward HER by density functional theory calculations. The low exfoliation energy Eexf of 41.47 meV/& ANGS;(2) ensures the exfoliation of CuSe monolayer along [001] direction, which allows the exposure of the basal plane. More importantly, the pristine CuSe monolayer without any treatment delivers relatively good activity, as reflected by the small thermodynamic barrier of 0.3 eV. Furthermore, CuSe possesses good electron conductivity, which makes it beneficial to the electron transfer during electrocatalysis. Therefore, these results indicate that CuSe acts as a promising material for the next generation HER catalysis with the high basal utilization.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000790012300006

Synthesizing a series of carbon fiber paper (CFP) supported Ni(OH)(2)/MnO2 catalysts, we explored relevant redox transitions and catalysis of both UOR (urea oxidation reaction, in KOH-with-urea) and OER (oxygen evolution reaction, in KOH). Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) in KOH-only solution demonstrated a more cathodic transformation from Ni(III/IV) to Ni(II) compared with that in KOH-with-urea solution. The water oxidation overpotential was shifted to higher values (from 0.48 to 0.53 V-RHE) as the Mn:Ni atom ratio increases in CFP-NiMn films. In contrast, a higher Mn content results in higher UOR activity and lower onset potential in KOH solution containing urea (1.395-1.375 V-RHE). Quasi in-situ, freeze-quench X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Ni and Mn K-edges was employed to uncover oxidation state changes as well as structural transformations at the atomic level showing that CFP-Ni(OH)(2) underwent oxidation state changes by about 1.15 e(-) and 0.21 e(-) per Ni ion during OER and UOR processes, respectively, versus only 0.71 e(-) and 0.07 e(-) per Ni ion in CFP-NiMn2.4. Mn incorporation can stabilize the Ni in lower valent states in a mixed NiMn catalyst without significant changes in oxidation state and structure. The here investigated, readily synthesized CFP-NiMn films exhibit opposite activity trends in KOH and KOH-with-urea electrolytes: Mn incorporation depresses water oxidation, but it promotes the urea oxidation process. We propose that the water oxidation rate (OER) is positively correlated with the capacity for accumulation of Ni and Mn oxidation equivalents, while the urea oxidation (UOR) rate is negatively correlated with this capacity. Our work offers a mechanistic guideline for designing and synthesizing nonprecious metal-coupled Ni-based catalysts with appropriate redox-properties for urea-oxidation applications.

The evolution of the growth of metal nanoparticles with the formation of graphite during the carbonization process was investigated. Inseparable from graphitic carbon-encased metal nanoparticles with the coexistence of graphitized nanoribbons and graphene-like sheets, FB-CoFe-700 exhibited a remarkable long-term electrocatalytic stability with 90.7% current retention after 50 000 s much superior to that of the commercially available Pt/C (20 wt %) in an alkaline medium. Meanwhile, FB-CoFe-700 displayed promising ORR catalytic activity (E-0 = 0.92 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), E-1/2 = 0.82 V vs RHE, and n = 3.97) very similar to that of commercial Pt/C and outstanding methanol tolerance in an alkaline medium.

Herein, a simple and straightforward approach was developed to tune the electronic properties of cobalt oxide nanostructures by doping them with nickel and then using them to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an aqueous solution of 1.0 M KOH. The addition of a nickel impurity improved the conductivity of the cobalt oxide, and further increased its activity towards the OER. Analytical techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to investigate, respectively, the morphology, composition and crystalline structure of the materials used. The nickel-doped cobalt oxide material showed randomly oriented nanowires and a high density of nanoparticles, exhibited the cubic phase, and contained cobalt, nickel and oxygen as its main elements. The nickel-doped cobalt oxide also yielded a Tafel slope of 82 mV dec(-1) and required an overpotential of 300 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). As an OER catalyst, it was shown to be durable for 40 h. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis showed a low charge-transfer resistance of 177.5 ohms for the nickel-doped cobalt oxide, which provided a further example of its excellent OER performance. These results taken together indicated that nickel doping of cobalt oxide can be accomplished via a facile approach and that the product of this doping can be used for energy and environmental applications.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10				2046-2069		WOS:000527993500029	35492082

Splitting water in acidic media has had limited progress to date because of the low anodic oxygen evolution reaction activity and serious catalyst degradation. Here, we report a bifunctional Ir catalyst stabilized by cucurbit[6]uril for water splitting in acidic media. We achieved a 10 mA/cm(2) overall water-splitting current density at only 1.56 V, which is among the highest activities reported. Moreover, our cell showed a high stability of at least 20 h of continuous operation at 5 mA/cm(2). Spectroscopic experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that the coordination interaction between Ir atoms and cucurbit[6]uril facilitates the controllable synthesis and stabilization of surface active IrOx species, which leads to the excellent catalytic activity and stability observed.									40	3	0	0	0	0	40			2380-8195			WOS:000472121800012

Volume weighted average grain size, unit cell expansion, oxygen deficiency, and microstrain values as a function of milling time were obtained from XRD. SAXS data revealed different nanostructures for samples synthesized by one-step solid-state reaction (SSR) or HEBM-treated powders. The latter presented the characteristics of a multilayered nanoscale solid system with surface fractal behavior. Correlation of the XRD microstructural parameters and the power law exponent of the SAXS curves as a function of temperature and milling time provided a coherent picture of the structure of HEBM-treated powders. The overall structural information presented in this article may shed some light on the macroscopic physical properties of CuO nanostructures.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000254964200051		
J	Cluff, Daniel R.; Corbin, Stephen F.; Gharghouri, Michael A.								Investigating the influence of Ti powder purity on phase evolution during NiTi sintering using in-situ neutron diffraction								INTERMETALLICS				83				43	54		10.1016/j.intermet.2016.12.001				APR 2017	2017	The influence of Ti powder purity on phase evolution during the reactive sintering of elemental Ni and Ti powders to form NiTi was studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and in-situ neutron diffraction. Reaction between the Ni and Ti is not significant until 600 degrees C. From 600 to 700 degrees C, Ti2Ni forms in mixtures made from high (HP) and low purity (LP) Ti powder. The Ni3Ti phase also grows in this temperature range in the LP mixture. The most significant phase evolution takes place between 700 and 920 degrees C. The alpha to beta phase transformation in (Ti) begins at the eutectoid temperature (765 degrees C) and ends at 820 degrees C. The highest growth rates for all three intermetallic phases, including NiTi, and the decay rate of the elemental Ni occur in this temperature range. At approximately 1000 degrees C, all reactants are consumed and homogenization occurs, with NiTi continuing to grow at the expense of the other intermetallic phases. The Ti rich intermetallic phase persists above its melting point, due to the formation of a solidsolution with oxygen (i. e. Ti2Ni(O)). From 1100 to 1200 degrees C, the microstructure becomes a stable mixture of NiTi with a small fraction of Ti2Ni(O). The phase evolution is similar in the LP and HP mixtures. However, the rate of reaction is higher in the LP mixture due to the influence of impurities (O, Fe and Ni) on the diffusivities in the many phases involved.

The model self-consistently accounts for the thermodynamics and kinetics of the evolution of film thickness, diffusion of all components, oxidation reaction rates and the effects of stresses on these. Numerical solution of the models shows that large compressive stresses and significant stress gradients can be developed across the oxide layer. The signs of the stress and stress gradients are consistent with experimental observations. Following an initial transient, the concentration profiles and stresses settle into a steady-state, in which the concentration profiles and stresses are independent of the relative magnitudes of the oxygen and cation diffusivities. We have developed an approximate, analytical solution for the composition and stress that accurately matches the steady-state results obtained numerically. (C) 2003 Acta Materialia Inc.

Here, we developed an easy-to-operate, environment-friendly, and scaled-up electrochemical engineering method without adding metal salts to synthesize Fe/Al-LDHs via an electrolytic reaction of active metal electrodes (Fe and Al). The process resulted in the growth of thin hexagonal Fe/Al-LDHs with a lateral size of approximately 100 nm and thickness of approximately 32 nm. The crystallization process of Fe/Al-LDHs strongly relied on the crystal nucleus of the first precipitate Al(OH)(3) and the Fe chemical valence. The oxidation state of Fe was markedly influenced by hydroxyl ions that formed on the cathode surface and the oxygen evolution reaction at high current density (i). The fast and simple manufacturing technique not only had high yield (approximately 0.2 g of Fe/Al-LDHs was obtained when i was 2 mA/cm(2) within 25 min) but also afforded Fe/Al-LDHs with excellent reducibility for the removal of Cr(VI). This study demonstrated an attractive option for the rapid and large-scale synthesis of Fe/Al-LDHs to enhance their application prospects. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The current response of the developed Ti/Na2Ti6O13/Co(OH)(2) nanocomposite electrode attained 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 159 mV. The nanocomposite electrode exhibited a high stability at an applied current of 100 mA cm(-2). The remarkable catalytic behavior was achieved with a loading amount of ca. 0.06 mg cm(-2) cobalt hydroxide. This is attributed to the high electrochemically active surface area (EASA) gained by the nanowire-structured substrate and considerable enhancement of electrochemical conductivity with the use of Co (OH )(2) quantum dots as an active material. The superior catalytic activity and high stability show that the developed catalyst is a promising candidate for hydrogen production in alkaline media.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000848468300001	36006793

The concentrations of Al, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Sn, and Zn were determined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Oxygen exposure significantly impacted 13 metal ions at different phases of winemaking. However, only the concentrations of Cr, Cu, and Fe were impacted by early oxygen exposure during pressing, with lower Cr and Cu concentrations in wines that were aerobically pressed and lower concentrations of Fe in wines that were inertly pressed. The sequestering of Al, Cu, Ni, and Zn by wine lees was significantly affected by oxygen treatment, with lees collected from wines that were treated oxidatively sequestering significantly greater amounts of Cu and Zn and removing these metals from the wine supernatant. The metal ion that was most affected by oxygen exposure during pressing and handling was Cu, with significantly lower Cu measured in wines that were produced under oxidative conditions. It is known that elevated Cu concentrations have negative implications for wine aroma and flavour. This study demonstrated that oxygen management during winemaking significantly impacts metal ion concentrations in lees and wine, which may decrease the risk of developing taints and faults.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			1420-3049			WOS:000467765700078	30999713

Recent developments regarding stateof- the-art Fe-N-C catalysts in terms of precursor development, synthesis innovation, and active site identification are compelling. Here, an efficient and sustainable Fe-N-C catalyst was successfully synthesized by temperature-programmed N-2-pyrolysis from a ferrous ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) chelate. The unique structural properties were characterized by a wide existence of FeN4/C species encapsulated by a N-C coat, multiple porous morphologies, and a defective graphitic matrix, all of which greatly enhanced their intrinsic conductivities and prevented the aggregation of active moieties. The best Fe-N-C-800 catalysts promoted the ORR peak potential to -0.21 V with a nearly four-electron transfer pathway, only facilitating similar to 14% H2O2 production. Both the Mossbauer fingerprints and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis revealed the origin of the ORR features derived from the structural compositions and corresponding hyperfine interaction. Interestingly, the embedding of oxygen in the Fe-N-C structure was found favorable for boosting durability and methanol endurance, which also hints at a strategy for rationally designing and producing promising ORR electrocatalysts from proper approaches and precursors.									180	9	0	0	6	0	184			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000424466300013

Enhancing the water splitting performance via decorating Fe2O3 nanoarrays with oxygen-vacancy-rich Ni1-xFexS electrocatalyst								MATERIALS TODAY PHYSICS				16						100317	10.1016/j.mtphys.2020.100317				JAN 2021	2021	In this work, oxygen-vacancy-rich Ni(1-x)FexS electrocatalyst modified Fe2O3 nanoarrays photoanode (denoted as Ni1-xFexS/Fe2O3) has been prepared firstly through a facile dripping solution method and a sulfurized process. As-prepared Ni1-xFexS/Fe2O3 anode shows a very high photocurrent density of similar to 3.48 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a saturated photocurrent density of 7.03 mA/cm(2) at 1.57 V vs. RHE in PEC water splitting, which is 2.5 times of Fe2O3 (1.38 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE and 2.98 mA/cm(2) at 1.57 V vs. RHE, respectively). Moreover, the photocurrent onset potential shows a distinct negative shift of about 272 mV. The Ni1-xFexS/Fe2O3 photoanode is controllable to achieve superior PEC performance because of the synergistic effects of Ni1-xFexS electrocatalyst and oxygen vacancies. Since in situ formed Ni1-xFexS electrocatalyst not only increase electrochemical active surface area of electrode, but also dramatically decrease solid and electrolyte interface resistance as well as dramatically suppresses charge carrier recombination in Fe2O3 photoanodes. In the meanwhile, introduced the oxygen vacancies in a sulfurized process of Ni1-xFexS electrocatalyst serve as active sites for sufficient chemical reaction. Hence, our work testifies oxygen-vacancy-rich Ni(1-x)F(e)xS not only act as a promising OER electrocatalyst, but also offers a new strategy to prepare efficient and low-cost PEC solar energy conversion devices.

During the continuous potential cyclic sweeping, the gamma phases preferentially dissolve during the anodic scan and dominant reduction reactions of Ag cations lead to redeposition and accumulation of Ag atoms together to form SAgPs during cathodic scan. The epsilon phases stay inactive to form a continuous skeleton in the inner regions. SAgPs with an average particle size of 94-129 nm can be obtained at scan rates of 25, 50 and 100 mV.s(-1) for 100 triangle wave potential cycles. SAgPs formed at a scan rate of 50 mV.s(-1) exhibit superior oxygen reduction reaction performances with the onset potential of 0.93 V, half-wave potential of 0.72 V and an electron transfer number of 4.0. The above-mentioned SAgPs have superior stabilities as ORR catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000629105500003

The actual species contributing to the catalytic activity observed in the WOR are derived from the transformation of these cobalt compounds. The catalytic activity observed is highly dependent on the initial compound structure and on the particular WOR methodology used. Co-cubane shows no activity in the electrochemical WOR and negligible activity in the photochemical WOR, but is active in the photoelectrochemical WOR, in which it behaves as a precursor to catalytically active species. Co-dimer also shows no activity in the electrochemical WOR, but behaves as a precursor to catalytically active species in both the photochemical and photoelectrochemical WOR experiments.

The structure evolution, ablation property and behavior of the coating were investigated under an oxyacetylene torch environment with different heat fluxes. Results show that the ablation performance decreases with the increase of heat fluxes from 2380 to 4180 kW/m(2). Oxidation erosion is proposed as the major ablation mechanism. The ablated coating consists of three layers (outer ZrO2 layer, transitional ZrCxOy, layer and residual ZrC layer). An oxidation progress that the ZrC is oxidized into ZrCxOy firstly and then into ZrO2 is inferred and accelerated by the continuous diffusion of oxygen resulted from the increase of heat fluxes. During different heat flux environments, the coating exhibits efficacious mechanical denudation resistance and the formed transitional ZrCxOy and outer ZrO2 layers act as a good oxygen diffusion barrier, which could be the reason for its high ablation resistance at the temperature of 2000-3000 degrees C.

Special emphasis was placed on the calcination temperature-dependent interaction between Ir oxide film and Ti substrate and its impact on the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The Ir oxide films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, temperature programmed reduction was applied to study the Ir oxide species formed as a function of calcination temperature and its interaction with the Ti substrate. A previously unachieved correlation between the electrocatalytic OER activity and the nature and structural properties of the Ir oxide film was established. We find that the crystalline high temperature Ir oxide species is detrimental, whereas low temperature amorphous Ir oxy-hydroxides are highly active and efficient catalysts for the OER. Moreover, at the highest applied calcination temperature (550 degrees C), Ti oxides, originating from the substrate, strongly affect chemical state and electrocatalytic OER activity of the Ir oxide film.

However, the two separated photo catalytic processes require good production and separation of carriers, which greatly limit the efficiency of overall water splitting. Herein, to solve the recombination problem of photogenerated charge carriers, we developed a one-step hydrothermal process to synthesize TiO2/C3N4 heterojunctions. The layered g-C3N4 provides the template and guidance for the anatase TiO2 heterogeneous nucleation with (001) facet exposed. Meanwhile, the bulk g-C3N4 turned into thicker nanosheets through the self-exfoliation with the growth of TiO2. The heterojunctions with TiO2 (001) facet exposed ensure the efficient separation of photogenerated carriers, which accordingly enhances the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. WO3 and BiVO4 are chosen as photocatalysts for the half reaction of oxygen evolution. With suitable redox mediators i.e. I-/IO3- or Fe2+/Fe3+, the overall water splitting to H-2 and O-2 could be achieved. If beta-Ni(OH)(2), was loaded on the oxygen evolution photocatalysts, the efficiency of Z-scheme water splitting was greatly enhanced. Under the monochromatic light irradiation of LEDs, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) values for the Z-scheme of TiO2/C3N4,beta-Ni(OH)(2)/WO3(PtOx) and I-/IO3- system were 4.94% and 4.01% under 365 and 405 nm, respectively. The heterojunction strategy for enhancing Z-scheme overall water splitting may give us some hints on the design of composite systems for overall water splitting. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In a single-compartment electrochemical cell, the procedure yields black films that have the appearance of glassy carbon. XPS analyses reveal that the films consist of a mixture of Ni(OH)(2) and NiOOH in a proportion that depends on the deposition potential; furthermore, SIMS analyses indicate that the coatings are richer in NiOOH in the inner regions towards the support. The electrochemical behavior has been compared with data obtained on electrodes based on pure Ni(OH)(2) prepared by cathodic electrodeposition from Ni(NO3)(2), following literature procedures. This comparison confirms the composite nature of black nickel hydroxide (BN) coatings, adding that Ni(OH)(2) and NiOOH are present in nearly equal amounts. The electrocatalytic activity of BN electrodes was tested in the oxidation of methanol in alkaline solutions. Experimental results are consistent with a mechanism previously proposed in literature for the oxidation of organic compounds on nickel electrodes. Comparison with electrodes based on pure Ni(OH)(2) shows that, in the low potentials region, the presence of a high amount of NiOOH causes a decrease of activity, while an opposite effect is observed when the potential is increased. The black nickel electrodes show a remarkable stability in repeated cycles of oxidation of methanol and O-2 evolution; under similar conditions, conventional Ni(OH)(2) films show an appreciable decrease in thickness, as evidenced by the decrease of peak charge in cyclic voltammetry experiments.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000328166300019

Herein, the NiFe2O4 nanoparticles/NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheet heterostructure array on Ni foam was prepared via a simple one-step solvothermal approach. The as-prepared heterostructure array displays high catalytic activity toward the OER with a small overpotential of 213 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and can afford a current density of 500 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 242 mV and 1000 mA cm(-2) at 265 mV. Moreover, it also presents outstanding HER activity, only needing a small overpotential of 101 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and can drive large current densities of 500 and 750 mA cm(-2) at individual overpotentials of 297 and 314 mV. A two-electrode electrolyzer using NiFe2O4 nanoparticles/NiFe LDH nanosheets as both the anode and the cathode implements active overall water splitting, demanding a low voltage of 1.535 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2), and can deliver 500 mA cm(-2) at 1.932 V. The NiFe2O4 nanoparticles/NiFe LDH nanosheet array electrodes also show excellent stability against OER, HER, and overall water splitting at large current densities. Significantly, the overall water splitting with NiFe2O4 nanoparticles/NiFe LDH nanosheets as both the anode and the cathode can be continuously driven by a battery of only 1.5 V. The intrinsic advantages and strong coupling effects of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles and NiFe LDH nanosheets make NiFe2O4 nanoparticles/NiFe LDH nanosheet heterostructure array abundant catalytically active sites, high electronic conductivity, and high catalytic reactivity, which remarkably contributed to the catalytic activities for OER, HER, and overall water splitting. Our work can inspire the optimal design of the NiFe bimetallic heterostructure electrocatalyst for application in practical water electrolysis.									138	6	0	0	5	0	138			1944-8244			WOS:000441477800050	30009602

In this study, a novel type of self-assembled melamine aggregate was formed in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) without additional chemicals and templates, and these aggregates were then directly calcined to obtain three-dimensional hierarchically nanoporous CN. This structure-retention from the precursor to CN demonstrated that the structure and shape of CN were free from collapse during melamine thermal polycondensation and thus exposed vast active sites. Besides, the oxygen dopant resulting from structure-retention adjusted the electronic properties of CN derived from melamine aggregates (MACN), facilitating the hydrogen evolution reaction. The Pt-decorated MACN showed the fastest hydrogen production rate of 8.2 mu mol h(-1)for 3 wt% Pt/MACN under visible light, which is 4.5 times higher than that of the Pt-decorated CN sample obtained from the calcination of commercial melamine precursor. The structure-retention strategyviamelamine self-assembly is a facile, rapid, and robust method to access unique nanostructured CN with enhanced photocatalytic performance under visible light, thereby enriching the toolbox for the fabrication of CN materials.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000571594100022

In this composite material, Mo2C particles with size about 5 to 8 nm disperse evenly in the framework of nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon matrix. In acid media, to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotential required was 142 mV with a Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1). Under basic conditions, the overpotential reduced to as low as 56 mV with a Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(-1). To realize overall water splitting, MoO2-based composite material (MoO2@NC) with nitrogen-doped carbon as matrix was obtained using the same precursor as Mo2C@NC. MoO2@NC exhibits excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with an over potential of 302 mV. With Mo2C@NC as cathode and MoO2@NC as anode, an efficient electrolyzer was constructed, which required a cell voltage of 1.60 V to achieve a current of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Furthermore, besides overall water splitting, Mo2C@NC also shows striking catalytic removal property towards 4-nitrophenol and Rhodamine B.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2052-1553			WOS:000430328200010

The high conductivity makes this material a good candidate for electrocatalysis, and here its catalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was evaluated. Cu-BHT shows good activity and stability for HER in acidic solutions under high current densities. By changing the preparation conditions, the morphology of Cu-BHT materials was controlled at the mesoscale, which allows the preparation of a thin film (TF-1), nanocrystal (NC-1), and amorphous nanoparticle (NP-1) of Cu-BHT. The overpotential of Cu-BHT toward HER shows an improved activity from 760 mV (NC-1) to 450 mV (NP-1) at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2). A Tafel slope of similar to 95 mV.dec(-1) and an exchange current density of 10(-3) mA.cm(-2) were achieved under optimized conditions. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the "Cu-edge site" on the (100) surface plays an important role in improving the HER catalytic performance of Cu-BHT nanoparticles.									90	3	0	0	4	0	92			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000416614600097	29086557	
J	Roose, Johnna L.; Yocum, Charles F.; Popelkova, Hana								Function of PsbO, the Photosystem II Manganese-Stabilizing Protein: Probing the Role of Aspartic Acid 157								BIOCHEMISTRY				49	29			6042	6051		10.1021/bi100303f				JUL 27 2010	2010	The D157N, D157E, and D157K mutations in the AshO gene encoding the photosystem 11 (PSII) manganese-stabilizing protein from spinach, exhibit near-wild-type PSI! binding but are significantly impaired in 02 evolution activity and Cl- retention by PSII [Popelkova et al. (2009) Biochemistry 48, 11920-11928]. To better characterize the role of PsbO-Asp157 in eukaryotic PSI 1, the effect of mutations in Asp157 on heat-induced changes in PsbO solution structure, O-2 release kinetics, and PSII redox reactions both within and outside the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) have been examined. The data presented here show that Asn, Glu, or Lys mutations in PsbO-Asp157 modify PsbO thermostability in solution, which is consistent with the previously reported perturbation of the functional assembly of PsbO-Asp157 mutants into PSII that caused inefficient Cl- retention by PSII. Fluorescence decay signals from PSII reconstituted with Asp 157 mutants indicate that that the Q(A)(-) to Q(B) transition on the PSII reducing side is unaffected, but complex alterations are detected on the PSI I oxidizing side that affect the recombination of Q(A)(-) with the O-2-evolving complex. In addition, oxygen yield on the first flash is increased, which indicates an impaired ability of mutant-reconstituted PSI I samples to decay back to the SI state in the dark.									15	0	0	0	15	0	15			0006-2960			WOS:000280060700010	20568728

Herein, two kinds of waste biomass, catkins and Okara were used as precursors for the preparation of novel nitrogen doped carbon fibers via hydrothermal and pyrolysis process. The blend of nitrogen-rich Okara with catkins effectively enhanced the content of doped nitrogen in the product. The as-prepared sample (denoted as NCF900) exhibited a hollow fiber like structure with a diameter of 2 to 5 mu m and had abundant highly active sites of pyridinic N and graphitic N, thereby improving its electrocatalytic activity in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The typical rotating disk electrode test proved that the NCF900 exhibited a high onset potential (0.82 V vs RHE) and a nearly four-electron pathway for ORR in alkaline solution as well as stronger methanol tolerance and better long-term durability than commercial Pt/C. The green, low cost synthetic method and the excellent ORR catalytic efficiency of NCF900 made it a promising electrocatalytic material for the ORR in fuel cells.									20	2	0	0	0	0	21			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000443663400009

Under reaction conditions, the Cu surface is activated, typically involving 2-3 atomic layers with the formation of a reversible metastable phase that only exists during catalytic reactions. The distinctive role of CO and O-2 in the surface activation is revealed, which features CO exposure to lead to surface roughening and consequently formation of low-coordinated Cu atoms, while O-2 exposure induces a quasi-crystalline CuOx phase. Supported by DFT calculations, it is shown that crystalline CuOx reversibly transforms into the amorphous phase, acting as an active species to facilitate the interaction of gas reactants and catalyzing CO oxidation.									18	2	0	0	2	0	20			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000504791400001	31816140

The bridging dithiolate comprising a secondary amine as bridgehead is the key element for the reactivity of native [FeFe]-hydrogenases and was therefore the midpoint of hundreds of biomimetic hydrogenase models. However, within those mimics, phosphorous is barely seen as a central element in the azadithiolato bridge despite being the direct heavier homologue of nitrogen. We herein synthesized three new phosphorous based [FeFe]-hydrogenase models by reacting dithiols (HSCH2)(2)P(O)R (R = Me, OEt, OPh) with Fe-3(CO)(12). All synthesized mimics show catalytic reactivity regarding HER and change their mechanisms depending on the strength of the used acid. In all presented mimics, the oxide is the center of reactivity, independent of the nature of the bridgehead. However, the phosphorous atom might be reduced by the methods we present herein to alter the reactivity of the model compounds towards protons and oxygen.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4				2073-4344		WOS:000546007000049

The tests-at open circuit showed that the rate of O-2 reduction at the negative plates is about four orders of magnitude higher than that of the other four reactions examined (evolution of O-2 at positive plates and of H-2 at freshly charged negatives, H-2 consumption at positive and partially discharged negative plates). H-2 leaking through the battery walls, which showed a perm-selective membrane behaviour, was also considered. Overcharge tests allowed the mathematical model proposed elsewhere to be verified and provided information on the cell behaviour when the overcharge current became equal or lower than the O-2-reduction limiting current. The experiments on single plates and on couples (1 positive and 1 negative) sealed in glass vessels showed that the cell construction has a strong influence on the rate of gas-recombination processes.									7	1	0		0	0	8			0378-7753			WOS:A1995RG55000007

When the power was 400 W, with temperature increasing from 800 to 1000 degrees C, the CO content in the gas products increased by 8.16%, the H-2 content increased by 8.39%, and the CH4 concentration in the gas products initially increased and then decreased. When the temperature is 900 degrees C, with power increasing from 0 to 400 W, the CO content in the gas products increased by 58.27%, the H-2 content increased by 81.33%, and the CH4 concentration in the gas products increased from 1.31 to 2.37%. The gasification reactivity and the concentration of combustible gas generated during ECG were higher than those during common coal gasification. Thermal electrons play important roles in ECG. These electrons could promote ring opening reactions and aromatic compound cracking and inhibit aromatization reactions while increasing the number of oxygen-containing functional groups in char, consequently enhancing the char gasification reactivity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-1343			WOS:000754397700017	34841145	
J	Duraivel, Malarkodi; Nagappan, Saravanan; Park, Kang Hyun; Ha, Chang-Sik; Prabakar, Kandasamy								Transition metal oxy/hydroxides functionalized flexible halloysite nanotubes for hydrogen evolution reaction								JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE				618				518	528		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.03.095				JUL 15 2022	2022	An efficient transition metal oxy/hydroxides (NiOOH, Co(OH)2 and CuO) functionalized halloysite nanotubes (HNT) based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst was fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method on flexible carbon cloth (CC). The Co(OH)2@HNT/CC showed excellent HER performance in alkaline electrolyte with an ultra-low overpotential of 65 mV@10 mA cm-2. The synergetic effect between Co(OH)2 and HNT greatly improves electrocatalytic activity since Al atoms could easily donate electrons to the adjacent Co atoms and the d-band center of the Co atoms reduces the barrier to produce hydrogen.The hierarchical halloysite nanotubes (HNT) have alumina containing positive Al-OH groups on its inner surface and silica-containing negative siloxane groups of Si-O-Si on its outer surface. The silicate laminate consists of silicon-oxygen at tetrahedral sites and aluminum-oxygen at octahedral sites. Since HNT has an abundant hydroxyl group on the surface with exceptional cation/anion exchange capacity, the surface-functionalized HNT could boost electrocatalytic activity. Hence, we have synthesized Ni, Co, and Cu metal oxy/hydroxides functionalized HNT by a facile hydrothermal method for HER. Among them, Co(OH)2@HNT on flexible carbon cloth displays an ultra-low overpotential of 65 mV at 10 mA cm-2 current density and Tafel slope of 181 mV dec-1 and also exhibited a larger exchange current density of 3.98 mA cm-2 in alkaline 1 M KOH electrolyte due to superior electrostatic affinity between OH- and Co2+. The electrolyzers with anion exchange membrane consisting of RuO2||Co(OH)2@HNT show remarkable stability of over 50 hat 10 mA cm-2 in alkaline electrolyte. The post stability sample retains the same surface oxidation state which confirms the robustness of the electrocatalyst. The reported results are far better than many of the transition metal oxides/chalcogenides electrocatalysts and hence it is expected that HNT could act as a potential alternative candidate to replace the benchmark platinum catalyst.

Asteroseismology of white dwarf stars is a powerful tool that allows us to reveal the hidden chemical structure of white dwarfs and infer details about their present and past evolution by comparing the observed periods with those obtained from appropriate stellar models. A recent asteroseismological study has reproduced the period spectrum of the helium-rich pulsating white dwarf KIC 08626021 with the unprecedented precision of (P-obs- P-model)/P-model < 10(-8). The chemical structure derived from that asteroseismological analysis is notably different from that expected for a white dwarf according to currently accepted formation channels. It therefore poses a challenge to the theory of stellar evolution.Aims. We explore the relevant micro- and macrophysics processes that act during the formation and evolution of KIC 08626021 and might lead to a chemical structure similar to that found through asteroseismology. We quantify to which extent it is necessary to modify the physical processes that shape the chemical structure in order to reproduce the most important features of the asteroseismic model.Methods. We modeled the previous evolution of KIC 08626021 by exploring specific changes in the C-12(alpha, gamma)(16) reaction rate, screening processes, microscopic diffusion, and convective boundary mixing during core-He burning.Results. We find that in order to reproduce the core chemical profile derived for KIC 0862602, the C-12+alpha nuclear reaction rate has to be increased by a factor of -10 during the helium-core burning, and reduced by a factor of similar to 1000 during the following helium-shell burning as compared with the standard predictions for this rate. In addition, the main chemical structures derived for KIC 0862602, such as the very thin helium-pure envelope, the mass of the carbon-oxygen core, and the pure C buffer, cannot be reconciled with our current knowledge of white dwarf formation.Conclusion. We find that within our current understanding of white dwarf formation and evolution, it is difficult to reproduce the most important asteroseismologically derived features of the chemical structure of KIC 08626021.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000487978300007

Herein, we have prepared ultra-thin RuO2 nanosheets (RuO2 NSs) using a simple molten salt method. The as-prepared RuO2 NSs with a thickness of 1-2 nm possess abundant defects. Toward the OER, the RuO2 NSs achieve an extremely low overpotential of 199 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(geo-)(2) with a loading of 125 mu g cm(geo)(-2). Furthermore, the RuO2 NSs exhibit specific and mass activities of up to 0.89 mA cm(oxide)(-2) and 0.52 A mg(Ru)(-1) at 1.46 V vs. RHE, which are 14.9 and 80.6 times enhanced in specific and mass activity as compared to the commercial RuO2 nanoparticles, respectively. In a homemade PEMWE, with RuO2 NSs as the OER catalyst, the electrolyzer achieves a current density of 0.93 A cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.65 V without iR drop correction, which is 3 times larger than that of the commercial RuO2 catalyst (0.31 A cm(-2)). Density functional theory calculations indicate that the Ru vacancy on the RuO2 NS surfaces significantly weakens the binding energy of O* with respect to that of OOH*, which decreases the energy cost in the transformation from O* to OOH*, and thus dramatically enhances the OER performance. The unique defect-rich structure and outstanding performance demonstrate that the RuO2 NSs possess great potential for developing high-performance PEMWEs.									65	0	0	0	1	0	65			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000599751100041

Its fundamental combustion characteristics have attracted much attention. Benzaldehyde is a key intermediate in toluene oxidation and could have a potential impact in the construction of a toluene kinetic mechanism. Unfortunately, the understanding of benzaldehyde oxidation mechanism has not as yet reached consensus in the combustion community. Benzoyl as primary intermediate of benzaldehyde after H-atom abstraction, the recognition of its consumption pathway is to direct dissociation in both high- and low-temperature regimes, without considering the reaction channels of C6H5CO + O-3(2). In order to clarify the importance of this acyl radical addition to oxygen reaction in aldehydes oxidation particularly at low temperatures. The potential energy surface of C6H5CO + O-3(2) was evaluated at the DLPNO-CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ/M06-2X/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. RRKM/ME calculations were performed on the C6H5CO + O-3(2) reaction using thermochemical and kinetic parameters obtained from the ab-initio calculations, with micro-canonical variational transition state theory for treatment of barrierless kinetics. Impact of the newly calculated reaction channels on auto-ignition and oxidation of benzaldehyde was investigated computationally. Current results reveal that the benzaldehyde sub-mechanisms derived from different sources take on distinguished sensitivity for updating the C6H5CO + O-3(2) kinetics. Thermodynamic analysis was carried out to interpret the dependence of benzaldehyde model performance on C6H5CO + O-3(2) kinetics. Thermodynamic parameters of benzoyl radical was calculated by the compounded methods of G3, G4 and CBS-APNO due to the excessive effect on equilibrium of reaction for benzoyl consumption. Our results indicate that more accurate determination of thermochemistry of benzoyl is critical to improve the model capability of benzaldehyde in prediction of ignition delay time and identification of species evolution at lower temperature in particular.

Three commercial EVA copolymers were selected, and the results obtained in the experiments performed in the presence and in the absence of HY zeolite are compared. The air atmosphere causes significant differences among the thermal and catalytic pyrolysis. The oxidative pyrolysis involves four main decomposition steps, and each of them also involves different types of reactions. In the first stage, the loss of acetoxi groups of the VA units occurs, with formation of acetic acid, but also CO, CO2 and carbonylic compounds are produced, increasing the formation of these compounds as the VA content of the copolymer decreases. The second and third decomposition steps, which are better distinguished as the VA content of the copolymer increases, correspond to the degradation of the polymeric chain which results from the previous step, and involves cracking reactions, without O-2 consumption, as well as oxidation reactions. Finally, the fourth reaction step corresponds to the slower oxidation of the carbonous residues formed in the previous stages. The presence of the HY zeolite contributes to a decrease of the CO and CO2 formation, or in other words, to an increase of the reactions without oxygen consumption. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the melting loss reaction in a blast furnace was simulated under laboratory conditions and the microstructure evolution of coke after melting loss under CO2 and CO2 + H2O conditions was studied. The results showed that under a CO2 atmosphere, the specific surface area and pore volume of coke and the number of micropores in coke first increased and then decreased with the increase in reaction time, while the average pore size first decreased from 17.289 to 8.641 nm and then increased to 9.607 nm. In the gasification reaction between CO2 and coke, the relative content of the graphitized structure (I-G/I-All) increased first, then decreased and then increased with the increase in reaction time, while the change trends of disordered structure (I-D3/I-G) and unstable structure (I-D4/I-G) were opposite to I-G/I-All, indicating that coke still tended to be more orderly with the increase in time. In the mixed atmosphere of CO2 and H2O, the specific surface area and I-G/I-All of coke increased with the increase in H2O content. However, when the proportion of H2O exceeded 50%, the specific surface area decreased slightly, and the pore-size value corresponding to the peak value in the pore-size distribution curve shifted to the right, and the average pore-size increased in the nanosize range.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2079-6412		WOS:000847006900001

However, to explore the high catalytic performance of air electrocatalysts still remains a challenge. In response, a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) Co3O4 electrocatalyst is designed and synthesized through a nanocasting strategy. A well-controlled phosphorization treatment is further conducted to induce defect engineering on the resulting P-doped Co3O4-delta(3DOM P-Co3O4-delta). With the oxygen vacancy (Vo) tailoring, partial reduction from Co3+ to Co2+ is verified as the key to improving the intrinsic electrocatalytic bifunctionality. By incorporating the geometric and electronic merits, 3DOM P-Co3O4-delta possesses an ORR half-wave potential of 0.82 V and an OER overpotential of 366 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), which is comparable to noble-metal benchmarks. Particularly, under galvanostatic cycling measurements, ZABs using 3DOM P-Co3O4-delta containing air cathode showcase a potential gap of 0.84 V with negligible voltage fading over 250 h at 10 mA cm(-2).									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			2405-8297			WOS:000684950400005

This mutation shifts the redox potential of Q(A) by similar to-60 mV. This mutant provides an opportunity to test the hypothesis, proposed earlier from herbicide-induced redox effects, that photoinhibition ( light-induced damage of the photosynthetic apparatus) is modulated by the potential of Q(A). Thus the influence of the redox potential of Q(A) on photoinhibition was investigated in vivo and in vitro. Compared with the wild-type, the A249S mutant showed an accelerated photoinhibition and an increase in singlet oxygen production. Measurements of thermoluminescence and of the fluorescence yield decay kinetics indicated that the charge-separated state involving Q(A) was destabilized in the A249S mutant. These findings support the hypothesis that a decrease in the redox potential of Q(A) causes an increase in singlet oxygen-mediated photoinhibition by favoring the back-reaction route that involves formation of the reaction center chlorophyll triplet. The kinetics of charge recombination are interpreted in terms of a dynamic structural heterogeneity in photosystem II that results in high and low potential forms of Q(A). The effect of the A249S mutation seems to reflect a shift in the structural equilibrium favoring the low potential form.									67	0	0	0	57	0	68				1083-351X		WOS:000245942800018	17327225

Its kinetic and structural properties have been intensively studied for more than half a century. Yet important aspects of the catalytic mechanism remain poorly understood, especially the oxygenase reaction. Because of its relatively modest turnover rate (a few catalytic events per second) and the competitive inhibition by oxygen, Rubisco is often viewed as an inefficient catalyst for CO2 fixation. Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving its catalytic efficiency, so far without success. In this review, we re-examine Rubisco's catalytic performance by comparison with other chemically related enzymes. We find that Rubisco is not especially slow. Furthermore, considering both the nature and the complexity of the chemical reaction, its kinetic properties are unremarkable. Although not unique to Rubisco, oxygenation is not systematically observed in enolate and enamine forming enzymes and cannot be considered as an inevitable consequence of the mechanism. It is more likely the result of a compromise between chemical and metabolic imperatives. We argue that a better description of Rubisco mechanism is still required to better understand the link between CO2 and O-2 reactivity and the rationale of Rubisco diversification and evolution.									44	2	0	0	35	0	45			0140-7791	1365-3040		WOS:000426870500001	29359811

Deconvolution of the intermixed electrode circuits is accomplished through analysis of the inherent resistance of the electrolyte, which allows for precise and independent control of the electrochemical potential at each electrode without altering concentrations of supporting or background electrolyte species. Sequential electrolysis involving oxidation of hydrogen and reduction of the generated protons downstream is demonstrated at nearly 100% efficiency on Pt-decorated dealloyed porous Nb catalysts. The conversion efficiency of the catalysts is discussed in terms of their geometries and active surface composition, elucidating strategies for use of sequential electrolysis cells for fundamental and applied studies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000544943400001

However, the relationship between active sites of catalysts and their catalytic efficiency toward lithium peroxide (Li2O2) has not been clarified. Herein, unsaturated coordination active sites in CoIn2S4 are created by embedding Ru into S vacancies (Ru-V-VIS) to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen electrodes in Li-O-2 batteries. The formation of the unsaturated coordination Co-Ru center is conducive to the deposition and decomposition of Li2O2 during oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. Furthermore, the highly polarized asymmetrical electron donation from Ru and Co to O-2 and Li2O2 can boost the catalytic efficiency, thus reducing the overpotential and ameliorating energy efficiency. As expected, the Li-O-2 battery with the Ru-V-CIS electrode achieves a high Coulombic efficiency (98.73%), large specific capacity (9170 mA h g(-1)), and extended cycling life (200 cycles) with a low charge overpotential (0.96 V). This work provides a strategy of constructing an unsaturated coordination center for enhancing the intrinsic activity of catalysts to develop highperformance Li-O-2 batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000661302000011

In this report, we aim to study the formation mechanism of IrO2 nanoparticles on graphene by inducing nanoscale defects artificially. The defects on graphene grown on a copper foil by chemical vapor deposition were created by UV-ozone treatment, and IrO2 nanoparticles were deposited by hydrothermal synthesis method. We investigated the amount of defects and oxygen-functional groups on graphene by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The size and distribution of defects and IrO2 nanoparticles on graphene were analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Raman spectroscopy and XPS measurement showed that defects and oxygen-functional groups increased with the UV-ozone treatment time. The size of IrO2 nanoparticles was reduced to ca. 4.5 nm on defective graphene, whereas the nanoparticles deposited on pristine graphene is ca. 8.8 nm in diameter. It is found that the IrO2 nanoparticles were deposited and anchored on the edge of hole-like defects on graphene. In addition, the size of deposited nanoparticles can be controlled by the extent of modification in graphene. (C) The Author(s) 2020.

The gene encodes a putative polypeptide of 154 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 16,714 Da. The full sequence of the protein includes two characteristic transit peptides, one for transfer across the chloroplast envelope and another for targeting into the thylakoid lumen. This indicates that the protein is encoded in the nuclear genome. The mature protein consists of 93 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 10,513 Da. The cloned gene was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and the resulting protein was purified, reconstituted to CaCl2-washed PS II complex together with the other extrinsic proteins of 33 and 20 kDa and cyt c-550.

An effective solution is to develop a new bifunctional electrocatalyst that is effective for both the ORR/OER processes. In this study, we prepared the alpha-MnO2/Co3O4 bifunctional composite catalyst by the in situ generation of Co3O4 nanoparticles on alpha-MnO2 nanorods. ORR/OER catalytic activity and structures of the prepared catalysts have been investigated systematically. Compared with single-component alpha-MnO2 nanorods and Co3O4 particles catalyst, the alpha-MnO2/Co3O4 composite catalyst possesses the smallest average pore diameter (11.84 nm), and the largest specific surface area (41.34 m(2) g(-1)), which is due to the restriction of the growth of Co3O4 particles by alpha-MnO2 nanorods. Besides, during the ORR process, the alpha-MnO2/Co3O4 composite catalyst shows the most positive onset potential of 0.833 V, the most positive half-wave potential of 0.760 V, and the biggest limiting current density of 3.881 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, during the OER process, the composite catalyst exhibits the lowest onset potential of 1.630 V, the lowest overpotential of 554 mV, and the biggest limiting current density of 24.590 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the alpha-MnO2/Co3O4-assembled aluminum-air battery (AAB) delivers the best cycling performance. Our work provides an idea for optimizing the bifunctional catalyst with high ORR/OER activity and low cost used in secondary AAB. Highlights A novel alpha-MnO2/Co3O4 bifunctional composite catalyst was prepared successfully. The alpha-MnO2/Co3O4 composite catalyst was applied in a rechargeable Al-air battery. The alpha-MnO2/Co3O4 exhibited better ORR/OER catalytic activity than alpha-MnO2 and Co3O4. The Al-air battery using alpha-MnO2/Co3O4 catalyst showed excellent cycling performances.

USE - Method for preparing a double active site modified nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon for modifying surface of the electrode for electro-catalytic oxygen reduction reaction and electro-catalysis in oxygen evolution reaction (claimed) in fuel battery and zinc-air battery. ADVANTAGE - The method enables to prepare double active site modified nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon having a good mesoporous structure which is conducive to mass transfer in the catalytic process. The active site of CoN4 formed during the pyrolysis process enables the catalyst to have a high oxygen reduction catalytic activity and the catalytic process is close to the ideal four-electron transport path. NiCo2O4 active site is also formed at the same time which makes the catalyst have super high oxygen precipitation catalytic activity. The double active site modified nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon has good stability and methanol resistance, prepared using wide range of raw materials in cots effective manner, and has good performance. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Preparing a double active site modified nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon involves mixing 1.44g of sodium dodecylsulfonate as a template, 1.27g of resorcinol, 7ml of formaldehyde as a carbon source, 1.26g of melamine resin as a nitrogen source, adding to 30ml of water, stirring well to form a turbid liquid, adjusting the turbidity to pH 9 with potassium hydroxide, continuously stirring for 30 minutes, then adding 0.6 g of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate, 0.3 g of nickel nitrate hexahydrate, continuously stirring for 1 hour, adjusting the pH to 9 plus minus 0.2, putting the mixture at 60 degrees C in a water bath at constant temperature, stirring for 3 hours to obtain brown viscous liquid, placing in a petri dish for 24 hours to form a colloidal resin mixture, freeze-drying the colloidal resin mixture for 36 hours to form a brown-red brittle resin mixture, maintaining the mixture at a temperature of 500 degrees C for 2 hours under the protection of a nitrogen atmosphere, heating to 700 degrees C for one hour and taking the mixture out after cooling to obtain a double-active-site modified nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon.															0						DIIDW:2019A04290		
J	Cheng, Lei; Yang, Xin-an; Liu, Xiao-na; Zhang, Wang-bing								A novel electrooxidation vapor generation technique for the direct analysis of trace Os in ore/water samples								ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA				1230						340378	10.1016/j.aca.2022.340378				OCT 16 2022	2022	All electrolytic vapor generation technologies are based on cathodic reduction, but this paper focuses on how to use anodic oxidation to realize the gaseous transformation of noble metal Os. Supported by RuO2-based dimensionally stable anode (DSA), we found that the conversion from trivalent/tetravalent Os to the OsO4 can be carried out continuously and stably, even at the mu g L-1 level. Interestingly, there was a negative correlation between the conversion of OsO4 and the RuO2 content in the DSA. The decrease of oxygen absorption potential and the increase of current density suggest that the oxidation process of Os belongs to electrocatalytic behavior. The catalytic activity of the material has an obvious influence on the conversion of osmium while the formation of free radical may be crucial for the effective oxidation. Under the optimum conditions, this electrocatalytic synthesis of OsO4 combined with ICP-MS can realize the same effect of oxidation and detection of two osmium species [Os(III) and Os(IV)]. The proposed method exhibits a low limit of detection (5 pg kg- 1), a wide linear range (0.1-100 mu g L-1) and excellent anti-interference performance, which promotes the direct analysis of total Os in real ore samples without separation. Considering the catalytic activity of OsO4 in specific reactions, this green anodic electrosynthesis technology is also expected to provide more possibilities.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0003-2670	1873-4324		WOS:000869096800001	36192061

For practical applications, the scalable synthesis of efficient HER catalysts, which work in both acidic and alkaline media, is highly desired. In this work, the mechanochemically assisted synthesis of a Ru catalyst with HER performance surpassing Pt in both acidic and alkaline media is reported. Mass production of this Ru catalyst can be achieved via a two-step procedure: the mechanochemical reaction between graphite and dry ice produces edge-carboxylic-acid-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (CGnP); mixing a Ru precursor and the CGnP in an aqueous medium introduces Ru ions, which coordinate on the CGnP. Subsequent annealing results in uniform Ru nanoparticles (approximate to 2 nm) anchored on the GnP matrix (Ru@GnP). The efficient Ru@GnP catalyst can be easily powered by a single silicon solar cell using a wireless integration device. The self-powered device exhibits robust hydrogen evolution under the irradiation of standard AM 1.5 solar light. This work provides a new opportunity for the low-cost mass production of efficient and stable catalysts for practical applications.									144	10	0	0	9	0	145			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000450232800005	30216563

Among the various hydrogen evolution methods, electrocatalysis is the most convenient and effective way. However it is still problematic to find low-cost and high-efficiency electrocatalysts. In this work, Os-Ag-Si and Os-Au-Si ternary electrocatalysts were investigated. It is interesting that Os-Ag-Si exhibits higher hydrogen evolution performance than that of Os-Au-Si, even though Ag is a worse HER catalyst than Au. The optimal ternary catalyst Os-Ag-Si with mass ratio of 15:15:70 (Os:Ag:Si) was synthesized by a facile Si-H bond reduction method, which shows superior hydrogen evolution reaction performance with a low Tafel slope of 40 mV.dec(-1). In addition, the current density of Os-Ag-Si-15 catalyst surpasses that of 20% Pt/C when the overpotential is larger than 160 mV. The introduction of Ag in the Os-Ag-Si ternary catalyst could enhance the electrocatalytic activity, reduce the cost of catalysts, and even be better than Os-Au-Si. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The Kirkendall cavitation process is a typical method of producing hollow structured nanoparticles. It should be noted that only precursors with proper diffusion couples can guarantee a successful preparation. In this work, based on a matching diffusion rate of graphene with that of iron atoms, hollow iron carbides nanoparticles anchoring on N-doped reduced graphene oxides (hollow Fe3C/N-rGO) are designed via a simple carbonization synthesis method. As expected, the obtained Fe3C/N-rGO exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance both in oxygen reduction (E-1/2 = 0.829 V) and evolution reactions. Rechargeable Zn-air batteries are assembled based on the composite, which can also deliver a notable peak power density (160.2 mW cm(-2)), long cycle life (over 300 cycles) and deformable property.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000784438800001

The effect of pulse reverse electrodeposition parameters, such as reverse pulse frequency, reverse peak current density and reverse duty cycle, on the content of CeO2 nanoparticles in the PbO2-CeO2 nanocomposite electrodes was investigated. The SEM and XRD tests show that PbO2-CeO2 nanocomposite electrodes possess finer grain size than PbO2-CeO2 nanocomposite electrodes (P) by pulse electrodeposition and PbO2-CeO2 nanocomposite electrodes (D) by direct current electrodeposition. The service life of PbO2-CeO2 nanocomposite electrodes can reach 285 h, which is 1.3 times longer than that of PbO2-CeO2 electrodes (P), and 2.3 times longer than that of PbO2-CeO2 electrodes (D). The electrochemical measurements show that PbO2-CeO2 nanocomposite electrodes possess highest oxygen evolution overpotential and largest electrochemical active surface area among these electrodes. The electrocatalytic property of PbO2-CeO2 nanocomposite electrodes was examined for the electrochemical degradation of methylene blue (MB). The bulk electrolysis shows that PbO2-CeO2 nanocomposite electrodes exhibit the highest COD removal efficiency and lowest energy consumption, which can be ascribed to the highest oxygen evolution overpotential, largest electrochemical active surface area and highest CeO2 content.

They combine a high density of transition metal states (concentrated into small energy bands because of energy gaps) with the ability to induce coordination chemical interfacial mechanisms. A change of the electron number in the cluster, of the degree of substitution with foreign atoms, and of additional metal atoms introduced into channels besides the clusters allows far reaching conclusion on requirements for electrocatalysis during single and multi-electron transfer. A prominent additional property of catalysts of metal centered mechanisms is the ability to favor these compared to other electrochemical interfacial processes. This gives the catalysts a selective behavior with interesting possibilities for application (e.g. methanol fuel cell). At ambient temperature, technical catalysts do not match biological catalysts. The degree of order (decreasing entropy) which is reached during the process of electrocatalysis is recognized as an important quality factor. The most efficient way to build up temporary order is by dynamic self-organization in an open system. It requires the existence of autocatalytic processes. Mechanisms are discussed which may lead to an improvement of electrocatalysis via microscopic self-organization in (photo)electrochemistry and photosynthesis: the thermodynamic force of a reaction (e.g. photon energy, electrochemical potential) may induce a structural reorganization providing an optimized activation complex for charge separation (reaction center) or for multi-electron transfer during water oxidation (manganese complex of photosynthesis).

Insights into the ancestral physiological roles of globins								IUBMB LIFE				56	11-12			689	696		10.1080/15216540500037299				NOV-DEC 2004	2004	Neuroglobin and cytoglobin are two recently discovered vertebrate globins, which are expressed at low levels in neuronal tissues and in all tissues investigated so far, respectively. Based on their amino acid sequences, these globins appear to be phylogenetically ancient and to have mutated less during evolution in comparison to the other vertebrate globins, myoglobin and hemoglobin. As with some plant and bacterial globins, neuroglobin and cytoglobin hemes are hexacoordinate in the absence of external ligands, in that the heme iron atom coordinates both a proximal and a distal His residue. While the physiological role of hexacoordinate globins is still largely unclear, neuroglobin appears to participate in the cellular defence against hypoxia. We present the current knowledge on the functional properties of neuroglobin and cytoglobin, and describe a mathematical model to evaluate the role of mammalian retinal neuroglobin in supplying O-2 supply to the mitochondria. As shown, the model argues against a significant such role for neuroglobin, that more likely plays a role to scavenge reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that are generated following brain hypoxia. The O-2 binding properties of cytoglobin, which is upregulated upon hypoxia, are consistent with a role for this protein in O-2-requiring reactions, such as those catalysed by hydroxylases.

The energy coupling between photons, excitons, and oxygen is the crucial step in this reaction and still remains a challenge. In this study, a dual-purpose strategy for enhanced molecular oxygen activation is established by in situ carbon homogeneous doping on ultrathin Bi2MoO6 nanosheets for the first time. The C-doped ultrathin 2D material exhibits an enlarged bandgap straddling the electro-chemical potential of O-2/center dot O-2 -and H2O/center dot OH, without any attenuation of light absorption. An internal electric field and shortened carrier-transportation distance are also found in the longitude orientation of the nanosheets ([001] axis), leading to a higher density of effective photogenerated carriers localized on the exposed {001} surface. As applied for the nitric oxide removal, the reactive rate over the ultrathin C-doped Bi2MoO6 nanosheets is 4.3 times higher than that over the bulk counterparts as a result of the increasing reactive oxygen species. This new proof-of-concept strategy not only realizes the band structure engineering and charge transportation regulation but also paves a new way to construct highly efficient photocatalytic materials.									114	7	0	0	21	0	115			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000417921800007

Here, we highlighted an electronic structure engineering on Cu-based catalyst with atomically dispersed Cu-N3S1 active sites, representing as highly active electrode material for oxygen reduction. The structurally-new Cu-N3S1 species shows unique electron interactions with both phosphorus atoms/carbon support, which not only activate the electron transfer around the Cu-N3S7 sites but also enhance the interaction with oxygenated species, resulting in a promoting reaction kinetics process. As expected, this catalyst exhibits superior catalytic activity for oxygen reduction and evolution. A rechargeable flexible solid Zn-air battery based on this catalyst behaves superior performance of a high open-circuit voltage (1.41 V), a large power density (138.2 mW/cm(2)), and a small charge/discharge voltage gap (0.72 V at 2.0 mA cm(-2)) even under different bending angles. Specifically, this strategy is general and can be extended to other metal single atom catalyst systems (such as Fe-N3S1 species). This work will open a new avenue to design structurally-new single atom catalysts for energy-related field.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19				2639-4979		WOS:000519669700023

The electrodeposition of Pt was performed on a rotation disk electrode (RDE) of glass carbon (GC), on which a layer of Nafion-bonded carbon of Vulcan XC 72R was dispersed in advance. The behaviors of Pt RDE and GC RDE in an aqueous solution containing HCl and H2PtCl6 were firstly studied. It was found that Pt deposition could be achieved if the electrode potential is controlled below -0.20 V versus (saturated-potassium-chloride silver chloride electrode) SSCE. However, quite a high overpotential is necessary if a quick and apparent deposition were required. Unfortunately, at a high overpotential, the hydrogen evolution would be unavoidable and even accelerated by the formation of nanometer size of Pt particles on the RDE. It was found that it is futile to increase platinum deposits just through extending the deposition time. It was also found that too large deposition current is not helpful for increase of platinum deposition because most of the current was consumed on hydrogen evolution in this case. It has been confirmed that it is conducive to richen Pt ions, present in the form of anionic complex in solution, onto the working electrode to be deposited. It is also helpful to eliminate the hydrogen bubbles formed on the working electrode, i.e., uncatalyzed carbon electrode (UCE), by imposing a positive current on the UCE for a length of time in advance of each cathodic deposition. The potential changes during deposition were recorded. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) of electrodes in 0.5 M H2SO4 before and after the deposition were used to assess loading of metal catalysts in a wide range of potential from -0.20 to 1.1 V versus SSCE. The results have shown that the performance of such an electrode with loadings estimated to be 50 mu g Pt/cm(2) is much better than those of a conventional electrode with loadings of 100 mu g Pt/cm(2).

Selecting an appropriate strategy to construct a optimal structure for cobalt sulfides to explore the potential of their application in zinc-air battery is one of the meaningful topics. Here we propose a facile strategy to synthesize Co/Co9S8@N, S doped porous carbon composite material with mesoporous structure by ball milling. The Co/Co9S8@N, S doped porous carbon composite material exhibits excellent dual function catalytic activity for OER and ORR. Also, the material exhibits excellent power density and cycle stability when applied to the electrode catalytic material of normal zinc-air battery. Among them, the optimal sample present better power density than N-Ru-C mixed catalyst used in the normal zinc-air battery, and the limit value is 202.5 mW cm(-2). Connecting two solid-state zinc-air batteries in series can meet the normal operation of 53 LED light-emitting diodes.

One of the major challenges for Li-O-2 battery is exploring efficient catalysts for the decomposition of Li2O2 and by-products. In this work, a robust cathode employing RuO2 center dot nH(2)O clusters anchored on the carbon nanofibers (RNCs@CNFs) is fabricated for Li-O-2 battery. RNCs demonstrate an excellent oxidation activity towards both Li2O2 and Li2CO3 during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The unique structure of RuO2 center dot nH(2)O clusters also alleviate the deactivation caused by the coverage of active sites. As a result, the as-built battery exhibits a high specific capacity, a superior rate capability and an excellent cycling stability with low overpotentials. After 200 cycles, new Li anode is replaced and the battery continues 100 cycles without attenuation at a limited capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1) and a current of 200 mA g(-1). These results provide necessary information for the development of efficient cathode catalysts for the decomposition of Li2O2 and Li2CO3 in Li-air batteries.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000534411100005

The reduced bandgap suggests the appearance of the intragap various localized defect states and oxygen vacancies. The formation of oxygen vacancies and its effect on photocatalysis with the presence of the colour centres (F, F+, F++) in the photocatalytic mechanism by replacement of anion vacancy and electron pair displacement are discussed. The low concentration (0.02 M) of Ni2+ doping represents a large amount of oxygen vacancy, which assures the high capability of visible light absorbance. The chemical reaction mechanism of oxidation/hydrogenation-induced photocatalytic behaviour through formation of Leuco-MB is also established. The design of anatase/rutile heterostructure and the proposed mechanism of Schottky induced charge transfer phenomenon under visible light irradiation are also embedded in our work. In comparison with many other early reports, our results show that the 0.02 M concentration of Ni2+ doping has an outstanding photocatalytic activity with complete decolouration with evolution of Leuco-methylene blue and thus obtained 100% total degradation of toxic MB compounds from the aqueous solution after just only 30 min of visible light illumination.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0922-6168	1568-5675		WOS:000870938200003

We modify the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency to circumvent the existing limitations for precisely estimating the energy transformation efficiency under valid conditions. The light sources, surface area of counter electrodes, and oxygen content in electrolytes, and photo-anode materials are changed to investigate their impact on the energy transformation efficiency. This work clarifies that a larger counter electrode surface area results in the enhancement of the oxygen reduction reaction, reducing the applied bias voltage but also reducing the hydrogen generation rate. Furthermore, positive potential biases on the photo-anode and removal of dissolved oxygen molecules in the electrolyte are effective to promote the hydrogen generation rate because of efficient electron/hole separation and the ORR elimination. Due to the high photocurrent generated by the ultraviolet light source, the consumption of photocurrents by the ORR is generally negligible.

The high affinity site has a K(d) = 80 nM, is present at a concentration of 120 nM (1 site / 470 Chl); binds in less than 500 ms; and blocks the electron flow reaction, Q(a)-Q(b) --> Q(a)Q(b)-. The low affinity site has a K(d) = 420 nM; is present at a concentration of 120 nM (1 site / 470 Chl); binds with a half-time of 4 to 5 s; and partially inhibits the charge recombination reaction in Photosystem II, Sn+1Q(a)- --> SnQ(a). In the same thylakoids, the concentration of Photosystem II centers active in oxygen evolution is 100 nM (1 / 540 Chl) and the concentration of those active in charge separation is 120 nM (1 / 450 Chl). Therefore, there are approximately two atrazine-binding sites per Photosystem II reaction center; one with high affinity and one with low affinity. High-affinity labelling with [C-14]azidoatrazine is associated with a 34.5 kDa protein, which is identified as D1, using polyclonal antisera. Low-affinity labelling with [C-14]azidoatrazine is associated with a 30-32 kDa protein, which is identified as D2 with the monoclonal antibody FQC3. Our findings indicate that both high- and low affinity sites are specific for Photosystem II function.									15	0	0	0	13	1	15			0006-3002			WOS:A1991GG96800007

Herein, we report the successful synthesis of a highly efficient bifuctional ORR/OER electrocatalyst, comprising tubular assemblies of 20-40 nm N-doped carbon nanotubes containing NiFe alloy nanoparticles (denoted herein as TA-NiFe@NCNT). To synthesize TA-NiFe@NCNT, we first prepared g-C(3)N(4)nanotubes with a diameter similar to 200 nm as a sacrificial template and nitrogen source, then decorated the nanotubes with NiFe-layered double hydroxide nanoparticles (NiFe-LDH). The NiFe-LDH/g-C(3)N(4)composite obtained was then coated with a thin layer of glucose (an additional carbon source), then the resulting NiFe-LDH/g-C3N4@Glu composite was pyrolyzed at 900 degrees C in N-2. The obtained TA-NiFe@NCNT product exhibited a low overpotential of only 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)during OER in 0.1 M KOH (cf.401 mV for IrO2) and an ORR activity in 0.1 M KOH (onset potential of 0.93 V and half-wave potential of 0.81 Vvs.RHE) comparable to a commercial Pt/C catalyst (onset potential of 0.99 V and half-wave potential of 0.82 Vvs.RHE). The remarkable bifunctional performance of TA-NiFe@NCNT can be attributed to the excellent OER and ORR activities of NiFe alloy nanoparticles and NCNTs, respectively, as well as the high porosity and excellent conductivity of the electrocatalyst that benefitted mass and electron transfer processes, respectively. A custom-built rechargeable zinc-air battery constructed using TA-NiFe@NCNT at the air electrode delivered a lower charge-discharge voltage gap (0.92 V) and longer cycling lifetime (170 h at 25 mA cm(-2)) than a battery fabricated using a mixture of IrO(2)and Pt/C as air electrode catalysts.									59	1	0	0	3	0	59			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000545599900043	32584366

Compared with exfoliation of bulk layered materials, wet chemistry synthesis of 2D LMH materials under mild conditions still remains a big challenge. Here, an "MgO-mediated strategy" for mass production of various 2D LMH nanosheets is presented by hydrolyzing MgO in metal salt aqueous solutions at room temperature. Benefiting from this economical and scalable strategy, ultrathin LMH nanosheets (M = Ni, Fe, Co, NiFe, and NiCo) and their derivatives (e.g., metal oxides and sulfides) can be synthesized in high yields. More importantly, this strategy opens up opportunities to fabricate hierarchically structured LMH nanosheets, resulting in high-performance electrocatalysts for the oxygen-and hydrogen-evolution reactions to realize stable overall water splitting with a low cell voltage of 1.55 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This work provides a powerful platform for the synthesis and applications of 2D materials.									32	4	0	0	6	0	33			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000436238500013	29774641

Electrochemical carbon corrosion of membrane electrode assemblies containing different amounts of IrO2 or shape-controlled Ir dendrite catalysts were characterized using on-line mass spectrometry. In particular, Ir dendrite catalysts possess high activity toward oxygen evolution reactions when compared to IrO2. As a result, Ir dendrites provided a very effective method of removing water from the catalyst layer. Therefore, the addition of 1 wt% Ir dendrite (0.008 mg cm(-2)) to the catalyst layer of the cathode decreased electrochemical carbon corrosion by 84% at 1.6 V-NHE compared with a conventional membrane electrode assembly in the absence of water electrolysis catalysts.

The influence of nickel content on the physico-chemical properties and electrocatalytic performance of PbO2 electrodes was investigated. The electrodes were characterized by SEM, EDX and XRD techniques. A limited amount of doping nickel could produce a more compact PbO2 film and diminish the size of the crystal grains. The steady-state polarization curves and the cyclic voltammetry analysis showed that the 1% Ni-PbO2 electrode had the highest oxygen evolution potential and the optimal electrochemical oxidation ability. The cyclic voltammograms with various scan rates showed that the oxidation of aspirin on these PbO2 electrodes was a typical diffusion-controlled electrochemical process. Stability tests of different PbO2 electrodes showed that I% Ni-PbO2 electrode had the highest electrochemical stability. In addition, nickel modified PbO2 electrodes were used to degradation aspirin in aqueous solution, which gave the direct evidence of the electrocatalytic capabilities of these electrodes. The results showed that I% Ni-PbO2 electrode obtained the highest kinetic rate constant, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) removals, which were 1.41, 1.22, 1.20 times than those of undoped PbO2 electrode, respectively. Moreover, the energy required for the treatment of 1 m(3) aspirin solution significantly decreased and the hydroxyl radical utilization rate was enhanced after appropriate nickel doping. As a result, the 1% Ni-PbO2 electrode is a promising anode for the treatment of organic pollutants. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, CoNi nanoalloys wrapped with N-doped graphene embedded into N-doped carbon nanotubes (CN@NC) have been prepared by a universal two-step pyrolysis method. The optimal CN@NC-2-800 affords a positive half-wave potential of 0.83 V for ORR and a small overpotential of 400 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, outperforming most of the current non-precious bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. Expectedly, the liquid Zn-air battery based on CN@NC-2-800 displays a high open-circuit voltage of 1.52 V, a large peak power density of 172 mW cm(-2), and a long cycle life of 300 h. Furthermore, the developed all-solid-state Zn-air battery also shows remarkable stability with various degrees of bending. This work offers a simple and effective way to explore highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts for renewable energy applications.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2168-0485			WOS:000708391800011

Nevertheless, a systematic analysis of whether mutations are selected in cancer because they lead to the deregulation of specific biological processes independent of the type of cancer is still lacking. In this study, we correlated the genome and transcriptome of 1,082 tumors. We found that nine commonly mutated genes correlated with substantial changes in gene expression, which primarily converged on metabolism. Further network analyses circumscribed the convergence to a network of reactions, termed AraX, that involves the glutathione- and oxygen-mediated metabolism of arachidonic acid and xenobiotics. In an independent cohort of 4,462 samples, all nine mutated genes were consistently correlated with the deregulation of AraX. Among all of the metabolic pathways, AraX deregulation represented the strongest predictor of patient survival. These findings suggest that oncogenic mutations drive a selection process that converges on the deregulation of the AraX network.									18	1	0	0	13	1	18			2211-1247			WOS:000380264200025	27396332

An obvious route to increase performance is to increase the catalyst mass loading-as long as the intrinsic performance (i.e., specific activity or turnover frequency) of the catalyst is independent of loading, and other electrical, ionic, or masstransfer resistances are not severe. Here we report the geometric and intrinsic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of Ni(Fe)OOH films, the fastest known water oxidation catalyst in basic media, as a function of mass loading from 0 to similar to 100 mu g cm(-2). We discuss practices for measuring and reporting intrinsic activities, highlighting experimental conditions where the film activity on a per-metal-cation basis can be accurately measured and where capacitance measurements of electrochemically active surface area fail. We find that the electrochemical reversibility of the (nominally) Ni2+/3+ redox wave correlates with the apparent intrinsic activity as a function of loading. We report a pulsed-electrodeposition method that dramatically improves the catalyst reversibility and performance at high loading compared to continuous electrodeposition, which we attribute to improved connectivity in the micro/nanostructure and better composition control. Pulse electrodeposited films are shown to have geometric performance similar to a number of advanced composite electrocatalyst structures and to maintain effective per-metal turnover frequencies of >0.4 s(-1) at 300 mV overpotential, even for loadings of similar to 100 mu g cm(-2).									210	8	0	0	10	0	212			2155-5435			WOS:000364441300054

Employing the rotating ring disc electrode, a transition from a mixed process of O(2)(-)and O(2)(2-)formation to an exclusive O(2)(-)formation at gold electrodes is observed. It is shown that in this system Ca-superoxide and Ca-peroxide are formed as soluble species. However, there is a strongly adsorbed layer of products of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) s on the electrode surface, which is blocking the electrode. Surprisingly the blockade is only a partial blockade for the formation of peroxide while the formation of superoxide is maintained. During an anodic sweep, the ORR product layer is stripped from the electrode surface. With X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) the deposited ORR products were shown to be Ca(O-2)(2),ek; CaO2, and CaO as well as side-reaction products such as CO(3)(2-)and other oxygen-containing carbon species. It is shown that the strongly attached layer on the electrocatalyst, that was partially blocking the electrode, could be adsorbed CaO. The disproportionation reaction of O(2)(-)in presence of Ca(2+)was demonstrated via mass spectrometry. Finally, the ORR mediated by 2,5-di-tert-1,4-benzoquinone (DBBQ) was investigated by differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and XPS. Similar products as without DBBQ are deposited on the electrode surface. The analysis of the DEMS experiments shows that DBBQ(-)reduces O(2)to O(2)(-)and O-2(2-), whereas in the presence of DBBQ(2-)O(2)(2-)is formed. The mechanism of the ORR with and without DBBQ is discussed.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000571628000001	32865298

The biochar was derived from rice husk and charred at 550 degrees C in N-2 atmosphere, which showed a significant degradation of chlorobenzene in ambient atmosphere. The results from Scanning Electron Microscope, X-Ray Diffraction and Raman Spectroscopy indicated the formation of poorly ordered graphene stacks embedded in amorphous phases on biochar. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance suggested the existence of hydroquinone-quinone moieties on biochar, which could induce the generation of reactive oxygen species and promote the degradation of chlorobenzene. Furthermore, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals were generated from the reduction of oxygen with the oxidization of phenolic hydroxyl groups on biochar, which was responsible for chlorobenzene degradation. In addition, more types of intermediate products of chlorobenzene degradation were detected in biochar system compared with conventional Fenton reaction, which could be possibly ascribed to the interfacial reaction between chlorobenzene and reactive oxygen species on biochar surface. The findings in this study would provide a new insight into the application of biochar in organic pollutant removal. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

While some PBAs have recently been reported to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic electrolytes, the present study focuses on their integration in a PEMWE device. Cobalt hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles were interfaced with an electrically conductive support that withstands the PEMWE anodic conditions, namely Sb-doped SnO2. The OER activity of the composite materials was first verified in liquid electrolytes and then in PEMWE. A promising current density of 50-100 mA cm(-2) was reached at 2 V cell voltage. The PBA/Sb-SnO2 anode was stable up to 1.9 V, but showed more and more instability at higher potentials. Increasing leaching rates of Sn and Sb observed above 1.9 V suggest that the material instability above 1.9 V can mainly be assigned to Sb-doped SnO2 conductive support. These results are overall promising for the use of PBAs as catalytic sites at the anode of PEMWE. The study also identifies the need for more active PBAs in order to reach a higher current density at a cell voltage of 1.6-1.9 V, a potential range necessary for an acceptable energy efficiency of the PEMWE.									27	1	0	0	2	0	28			2398-4902			WOS:000426712600009

Assuming a subsonic, isobaric nuclear flame, these properties are computed by four independent methods: a numerical radiation transport code which includes implicit hydrodynamics; a moving mesh diffusion code; an eigenvalue method; and a quasi-analytical, integral expression. The dependence of the physical properties of the flame on the assumed values of nuclear reaction rates, the nuclear reaction network employed, the thermal conductivity, and the choice of coordinate system are all investigated. The new results have implications for the formation of neutron stars by the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf and for the production of Type Ia supernovae. The occurrence of AIC is critically dependent on the velocity of the nuclear conductive burning front and the growth rate of hydrodynamic instabilities. However, electron capture in nuclear statistical equilibrium behind the flame causes the density to increase (at constant pressure), restoring the density to its initial value some distance behind the front. There consequently exists a maximum length scale for the development of hydrodynamic instabilities. Treating the expanding area of the turbulent burning region as a fractal whose tile size is identical to the minimum unstable Rayleigh-Taylor wavelength, we find, for all reasonable values of the fractal dimension, that for initial C + O or 0 + Ne + M densities above about 9 x 10(9) cm-3 the white dwarf should colla se to a neutron star.									246	3	1	0	0	0	247			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:A1992JL15200021

These magmas have oxygen fugacities some 10-1,000 times higher than magmas generated at mid-ocean ridges. Whether this oxidized magmatic character is imparted by slab fluids or is acquired during ascent and interaction with the surrounding mantle or crust is debated. Here we study the petrology of metasedimentary rocks from two Tertiary Aegean subduction complexes in combination with reactive transport modelling to investigate the oxidative potential of the sedimentary rocks that cover slabs. We find that the metasedimentary rocks preserve evidence for fluid-mediated redox reactions and could be highly oxidized. Furthermore, the modelling demonstrates that layers of these oxidized rocks less than about 200 m thick have the capacity to oxidize the ascending slab dehydration flux via redox reactions that remove H-2, CH4 and/or H2S from the fluids. These fluids can then oxidize the overlying mantle wedge at rates comparable to arc magma generation rates, primarily via reactions involving sulfur species. Oxidized metasedimentary rocks need not generate large amounts of fluid themselves but could instead oxidize slab dehydration fluids ascending through them. Proposed Phanerozoic increases in arc magma oxygen fugacity may reflect the recycling of oxidative weathering products following Neoproterozoic-Palaeozoic marine and atmospheric oxygenation.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1752-0894	1752-0908		WOS:000770230700001

However, large over-potential in oxygen evolution reactions (OER) caused by the decomposition obstacles of Li(2)O(2 & nbsp;)seriously impedes its electrochemical performances. Herein, a novel N, O, S and F co-doping vesicular carbon was prepared by self-template pyrolysis method and used in Li-O-2 battery to tune the nucleation and decomposition of Li2O2. The introduction of F in the carbon matrix with suitable content can regulate the adsorption of intermediates, through which the morphology of Li(2)O(2 & nbsp;)can be controlled to film, favorable to its decomposition in charge process. The cathode based on the optimized F doped carbon vesicle exhibits improved electrochemical performances including a low over-potential, large capacity and a long-term stability. Density functional theory (DFT) results show that F and C in C-F bond hasve a strong interaction to Li and O in Li2O2, respectively, which can enhance the transfer of electrons from Li(2)O(2 & nbsp;)to the carbon matrix to generate hole polaron and thus accelerate the delithiation and decomposition of Li2O2.

This work demonstrates the simple immersion-based chemical etching of nickel foam (NF) in an ethanolic FeCl3 solution to generate microporous nickel (Ni) backbones decorated with hierarchically structured metallic Fe doped Ni-Fe-hydroxide nanoparticles serving as a highly promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrode in alkaline water. The optimally etched NF-based OER electrode exhibits a low Tafel slope of 47.3 mV dec(-1) and a low overpotential of 220, 270, and 310 mV at 10, 100, and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively. Intriguingly, this electrode also exhibits a perfectly reversible OER and HER performance between +400 and -40 mA cm(-2) with no evidence of electrode potential decay for 80 h. Importantly, when used with an industrial-type 30 wt% KOH aqueous electrolyte and compared to a benchmark Pt/C(20wt%)||IrO2-based cell, the electrolyzer exhibits a lower cell voltage of 1.52 (vs. 1.56 V of Pt/C(20wt%)||IrO2-cell), 1.62 (vs. 1.79), 1.69 (vs. 1.92) and 1.79 (vs. 2.08) V at 10, 50, 100, and 240 mA cm(-2), respectively, with the cell voltage maintained for similar to 100 h.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000772522800001

Nagarajan, Aparna/0000-0003-4434-5601			An Atypical psbA Gene Encodes a Sentinel D1 Protein to Form a Physiologically Relevant Inactive Photosystem II Complex in Cyanobacteria								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				290	6			3764	3774		10.1074/jbc.M114.604124				FEB 6 2015	2015	Photosystem II, a large membrane-bound enzyme complex in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts, mediates light-induced oxidation of water to molecular oxygen. The D1 protein of PSII, encoded by the psbA gene, provides multiple ligands for cofactors crucial to this enzymatic reaction. Cyanobacteria contain multiple psbA genes that respond to various physiological cues and environmental factors. Certain unicellular cyanobacterial cells, such as Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142, are capable of nitrogen fixation, a highly oxygen-sensitive process, by separating oxygen evolution from nitrogen fixation using a day-night cycle. We have shown that c-psbA4, one of the five psbA orthologs in this cyanobacterium, is exclusively expressed during nighttime. Remarkably, the corresponding D1 isoform has replacements of a number of amino acids that are essential ligands for the catalytic Mn4CaO5 metal center for water oxidation by PSII. At least 30 cyanobacterial strains, most of which are known to have nitrogen fixing abilities, have similar psbA orthologs. We expressed the c-psbA4 gene from Cyanothece 51142 in a 4E-3 mutant strain of the model non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, which lacks any psbA gene. The resultant strain could not grow photoautotrophically. Moreover, these Synechocystis 6803 cells were incapable of PSII-mediated oxygen evolution. Based on our findings, we have named this physiologically relevant, unusual D1 isoform sentinel D1. Sentinel D1 represents a new class of D1 protein that, when incorporated in a PSII complex, ensures that PSII cannot mediate water oxidation, thus allowing oxygen-sensitive processes such as nitrogen fixation to occur in cyanobacterial cells.									18	0	0	0	18	0	19				1083-351X		WOS:000349456000047	25525275
