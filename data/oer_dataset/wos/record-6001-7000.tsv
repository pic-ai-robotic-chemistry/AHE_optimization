Being a multistep and a relatively more complex half-cell reaction than its counter hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), OER always requires higher overpotentials than HER. In order to minimize the associated energy loss as overpotentials, these electrochemical half-reactions of water splitting are to be catalyzed with appropriate materials. The recent evolution of transition metals based layered double hydroxides (LDH) as OER catalysts in electrochemical water splitting have lifted the field of H-2 generation with the uttermost purity to a greater height. In addition, these materials possess a lot of advantages like being non-precious, gaining excellent catalytic activity and stability in high alkaline solution along with the ease of preparation methods. With all those LDH materials used in electrochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting, the presence of any of the three iron group metals (Ni, Co and Fe) is essentially seen. In this review, a detailed view on the basics of OER electrocatalysis, evaluation perspectives, current trends in OER electrocatalysis, evolution of these LDH materials as OER catalysts, activity trends, relationship among structure, activity and mechanism, trends in the synthesis methodologies, dominance of Ni-Fe LDH materials in OER electrocatalysis and the challenges and opportunities have been elaborated in detail.

J	Cooper, Ian B.; Barry, Bridgette A.								Azide as a Probe of Proton Transfer Reactions in Photosynthetic Oxygen Evolution								BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL				95	12			5843	5850		10.1529/biophysj.108.136879				DEC 15 2008	2008	In oxygenic photosynthesis, photosystem II (PSII) is the multisubunit membrane protein responsible for the oxidation of water to O-2 and the reduction of plastoquinone to plastoquinol. One electron charge separation in the PSII reaction center is coupled to sequential oxidation reactions at the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC), which is composed of four manganese ions and one calcium ion. The sequentially oxidized forms of the OEC are referred to as the S-n states. S-1 is the dark-adapted state of the OEC. Flash-induced oxygen production oscillates with period four and occurs during the S-3 to S-O transition. Chloride plays an important, but poorly understood role in photosynthetic water oxidation. Chloride removal is known to block manganese oxidation during the S-2 to S-3 transition. In this work, we have used azide as a probe of proton transfer reactions in PSII. PSII was sulfate-treated to deplete chloride and then treated with azide. Steady state oxygen evolution measurements demonstrate that azide inhibits oxygen evolution in a chloride-dependent manner and that azide is a mixed or noncompetitive inhibitor. This result is consistent with two azide binding sites, one at which azide competes with chloride and one at which azide and chloride do not compete. At pH 7.5, the K-i for the competing site was estimated as 1 mM, and the K-i' for the uncompetitive site was estimated as 8 mM. Vibrational spectroscopy was then used to monitor perturbations in the frequency and amplitude of the azide antisymmetric stretching band. These changes were induced by laser-induced charge separation in the PSII reaction center. The results suggest that azide is involved in proton transfer reactions, which occur before manganese oxidation, on the donor side of chloride-depleted PSII.									9	0	0	0	4	0	9			0006-3495	1542-0086		WOS:000261559300030	18805932

Compared with noble-metal based materials, such transition metal-based sulfides have been widely investigated in catalysis and energy storage, which can be easily controlled into various morphology due to their various valences. However, it is still a challenge to engineer transition metal-based sulfides of 3D nanostructure with rich edges. In this work, hierarchical cobalt sulfide nanocomposites (HCSN), with the vertical growth of Co9S8 nanosheets on horizontal Co1-xS nanoplates, were fabricated via simple one-pot synthesis. Due to adequate exposed-edge planes, the HCSN exhibited remarkably catalytic property for OER with low overpotential of 275 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 30 mV/decade and excellent stability. By investigating the chemical states before and after OER, the possible catalytic mechanism was provided. This work may provide a simple and efficient method to prepare hierarchical metal sulfides for electrocatalytic OER. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

These fundamental ideas can be achieved by designing the morphology, tuning the electronic structure, and using dopants in their higher oxidation states. Herein, we have fabricated a binder-free FeO(OH)-CoCeV-layered triple hydroxide (LTH) bifunctional catalyst by a two-step hydrothermal method, in which the nanograin-shaped FeO-(OH) coupled with CoCeV-LTH nanoflakes provides more electro-catalytically active sites and enhances the charge-transfer kinetics for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The composition-optimized electrocatalyst (FeO-(OH)-Co0.5Ce0.05V0.15-LTH) acts as an efficient water cleavage composite by virtue of its favorable oxidation states leading to cyclic redox couples, which yields an overpotential of 53 mV for HER and 227 mV for OER to drive 10 mA/cm(2) current density in 1 M KOH with a corresponding Tafel slope of 70 mV/dec for HER and 52 mV/dec for OER. Furthermore, for the overall water splitting reaction, the heterostructure FeO(OH)-Co0.5Ce0.05V0.15-LTH acts as a dual-functional electrocatalyst, which requires a cell voltage of 1.52 V versus RHE to drive 10 mA/cm(2) current density.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000715852100050	34693708

However, the high cost of current systems limits their widespread application. Here, we developed a highly efficient TiC-supported Pt nanocluster catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction that rivals the commercial Pt/C catalyst with 5 times less Pt loading. Combining with the NiFe-layered double hydroxide for oxygen evolution reaction and driven for the first time by a monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell, we achieved a solar water splitting system with 18.7% solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, setting a record for water splitting systems with earth-abundant and inexpensive photo-absorbers.									50	5	0	0	3	0	51			2542-4351			WOS:000503428000007

We developed a facile and inexpensive method to transform waste paper into graphene-tethered carbon fiber composite paper (GCCP). Urea was the only additive for the carbonization of the GCCP. The as-obtained GCCP exhibited high electrical conductivity, and GCCP/polydimethyl siloxane (GCCP/PDMS) composites showed good stretchability with great electromechanical stability. The surface of the GCCP membrane was observed to be superhydrophobic; this property apparently endowed the membrane with the ability to separate oil from water in our experiments, which makes GCCP a promising candidate material for cleanup of oil spills. The hierarchical structure, N doping feature and low decoration with Pt make GCCP a potential electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions with superior activity and high stability, and hence also a promising candidate for application as a direct working electrode in future energy systems.									30	1	0	0	0	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000356865300039

Herein, we demonstrate a novel bifunctional electrocatalyst - Co-3(PO4)(2) nanosheet arrays - prepared by a combined hydrothermal growth and plasma treatment. Owing to the large surface area, enhanced conductivity, the abundance of coordinately unsaturated Co3+ sites and numerous oxygen vacancies, the plasma activated Co-3(PO4)(2) nanosheet arrays exhibit low overpotentials for oxygen evolution reaction (240 mV) and hydrogen evolution reaction (50 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) with excellent stability. The overall performance is comparable to the best reports for precious-metal-free electrocatalysts. Also, the plasma activated Co-3(PO4)(2) nanosheet arrays show superior kinetics for hydrogen- and oxygen-evolution with Tafel slope values of 35 and 53 mV dec(-1), respectively. The overall-water-splitting, with 10 mA cm(-2) at a low voltage of 1.48 V, is achieved using the nanosheet arrays as both the anode and cathode and the performance surpasses that of the IrO2/C-Pt/C couple for sufficiently high overpotentials. This work presents a promising strategy for designing high-performance electrocatalysts toward overall water splitting.									69	8	0	0	4	0	70			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000447555400018

Metal oxides containing multiple components are promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER); but their development demands exhaustive experiments, resulting in long term cycles and high cost in research. In this paper, a high-throughput experimental scheme is employed for searching effective OER oxide electrocatalysts.

The composition of Mn5Co10Fe30Ni55Ox has been found to exhibit the highest catalytic activity.

The durability of the electrodes were examined by electrolysis in 0.5 M NaCl solution at current density of 1000 Am-2 and compared with their corresponding electrodes that were prepared by continuous anodic deposition. The electrodes repeatedly and continuously deposited for 90 min kept the oxygen evolution efficiency higher than 99% for 2600 h and 120 h of electrolysis, respectively. The improvement in the electrode durability by repeated deposition was attributed to the formation of single phase oxide deposits of MnMoW-oxides with optimized thickness, composition and structural water content, which enables the reduction of the electrode overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction and increase overall stability and adhesion of the oxide deposits to Ti/IrO2 substrate. A mechanism for oxygen evolution at the anode surface during electrolysis was proposed. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Intensive efforts have focused on developing highly efficient and earth-abundant electrocatalysts for water splitting. An effective strategy is proposed, using a bifunctional tubular cobalt perselenide nanosheet electrode, in which the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction is substituted with anodic hydrazine oxidation so as to assist energy-efficient hydrogen production. Specifically, this electrode produces a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at -84 mV for hydrogen evolution and -17 mV for hydrazine oxidation in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M hydrazine electrolyte. An ultralow cell voltage of only 164 mV is required to generate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for 14 hours of stable water electrolysis.									248	12	0	0	20	0	252			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000435766800008	29696766

These electrocatalysts are usually deposited on a 3D conductive support (e.g., carbon paper or carbon cloth (CC)) to facilitate mass and electron transport. For practical applications, it is desirable to create in situ catalysts on the carbon fiber support to simplify the fabrication process for catalytic electrodes. In this study, the first example of in situ exfoliated, edge-rich, oxygen-functionalized graphene on the surface of carbon fibers using Ar plasma treatment is successfully prepared. Compared to pristine CC, the plasma-etched carbon cloth (P-CC) has a higher specific surface area and an increased number of active sites for OER and ORR. P-CC also displays good intrinsic electron conductivity and excellent mass transport. Theoretical studies show that P-CC has a low overpotential that is comparable to Pt-based catalysts, as a result of both defects and oxygen doping. This study provides a simple and effective approach for producing highly active in situ catalysts on a carbon support for OER and ORR.									484	31	0	0	11	0	490			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000400636400013	28276154

An Au-sputtered Teflon membrane (with a thickness of Au of only 50 nm resulting in an extremely short pore length on the electrolyte side) has been used as a model for a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) in this study: The oxygen molecules diffuse through a membrane from the gas side and are reduced at Au on the electrolyte side. The redox couple O-2(-center dot)/O-2 is the predominant reaction during ORR in N(Bu)(4)ClO4 based electrolytes whereas the calculated number of electron transferred is one. In presence of Li-ions, the average number of electrons transferred is 2 during oxygen reduction, which indicates the formation and oxidation of peroxide during ORR and OER respectively. The mass spectrometric cyclic voltammograms (MSCVs) data show that the maximum true coulombic efficiency of OER/ORR in DMSO and NMP is about 60% and 25%, respectively, with the evolution of CO2 in NMP at 0.1 V (vs. Ag+/Ag) due to the decomposition of the electrolyte.

In this paper, the ORR and OER catalytic activity of bimetallic alloys encapsulated in fullerenes M1(x)M(24-x)@C-n (M1(x)M(24-x) represents FexCo4-x, FexNi4-x, CoxNi4-x; x = 1, 2, 3; n = 40, 50, 60) are investigated by density functional theory methods. The calculated encapsulation energy (Eenc) indicates that except for the value on Fe1Ni3@C60, all the Eenc values are positive on the studied M1(x)M(24-)x@C-n, suggesting that additional externally supplied energy will be needed to encapsulate bimetallic alloys in fullerenes. As the size of the C-n cage decreases, the charge transfer between the alloy core and the carbon shell becomes greater, resulting in a roughly increase in the binding strength of the reaction intermediates on M1(x)M(24-x)@C-n. Compared with C-40, C-50 and C-60 fullerenes are recognized as the more suitable shell for encapsulating bimetallic alloys toward ORR and OER. Based on the current study, Co1Ni3@C-50 is screened out with the best ORR activity (eta(ORR) = 0.35 V) and Co2Ni2@C-60 shows the most excellent OER activity (eta(OER) = 0.36 V) among all the M1(x)M(24-x)@C-n.

J	Fanjoux, G; Lescop, B; Le Nadan, A					Lescop, Benoit/0000-0003-4163-4707			MIES and UPS study of O-predosed nickel surface reduction by H-2 deposition								SURFACE AND INTERFACE ANALYSIS				34	1			555	559		10.1002/sia.1359				AUG 2002	2002	The present study was aimed at investigating the reduction by hydrogen of an oxygen-predosed nickel surface at high temperature (530 K) using metastable impact electron spectroscopy (MIES) and UPS (with He(I)) experimental techniques. Both techniques have allowed us to follow the evolution of the electronic structure of the valence band during H-2 deposition. The work function variation seems to be related directly to the oxygen coverage of the surface and exhibits two stages: an induction period during which no reduction reaction occurs; a rapid reaction period corresponding to the reduction of oxygen. The reaction mechanism entails the formation of hydroxyl compounds but, owing to their thermal desorption at lower temperature in the form of water, no evident OH features have been observed in the MIES and UPS spectra.The 3d band intensity, measured at 0.5 eV under the Fermi level using UPS, increased linearly during H-2 deposition. This evolution could correspond to that of bare Ni atoms in the three or four surface layers. On the other hand, evolution of the MIES signal taken at 5.7 eV under the Fermi level provided us with more accurate information about the evolution of the outermost layer of the predosed nickel surface during H-2 exposure.

Overpotentials do not directly translate to electrostatic surface potentials but act mainly by changing the concentration of point defects in the MIEC. This has severe consequences for the mechanistic interpretation of current voltage curves of MIEC electrodes. In this contribution it is shown how overpotential dependent defect concentrations affect the current-voltage curves of oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution at MIEC surfaces. Exemplarily, quantitative current-voltage curves are deduced from the known defect chemical data set (Brouwer diagram) of La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-delta (LSF). Various curve shapes result, from Tafel-like exponential relations to essentially voltage independent limiting currents. Tafel slopes have a very different meaning compared to charge transfer limited reactions at metal electrode interfaces. It is shown how mechanistic information can be obtained from the difference of anodic and cathodic Tafel slopes or by comparing exchange current densities and ac resistances. Moreover, partial pressure dependences of anodic and cathodic currents are deduced, showing that exponents of power laws often do not indicate whether atomic or molecular oxygen species are involved in the rate limiting step.

Here we describe a rational protocol to prepare mesoporous sub-stoichiometric WO2.83 through controlled oxygen vacancy formation in mesoporous WO3. Different from bulk WO3, the use of a mesoporous WO3 not only greatly decreases the H-2 reduction temperature, but also causes reduction to WO2.83 with high selectivity. Oxygen vacancies enable exceptional plasmon resonance in mesoporous WO2.83, which further could be tailored in a wide range through redox chemistry. Furthermore, mesoporous WO2.83 exhibits superior hydrogen evolution reaction activity compared to pristine mesoporous WO3, and it can be shown that the HER activity is crucially dependent on the amount of oxygen vacancies.									58	2	0	0	4	0	59			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000423981200038

Herein, to mitigate this challenge, a novel cost-effective flower-like Ni and N codoped hierarchical porous carbon microspheres (denoted as F-Ni/N-HPCMs) electrode has been fabricated by a simple two-step method. Benefiting from the unique structure property, the F-Ni/N-HPCMs show excellent ORR and OER performance. More importantly, H-2-O-2 alkaline polymer electrolyte fuel cell (APEFC) fabricated with the F-Ni/N-HPCMs cathode shows an open circuit potential of 0.84 V and a high performance of 208 mW cm(-2). And, the performance is better than the reported APEFCs constructed with other non-precious metal electrodes. Hence, this work provides a new strategy to fabricate high performance electrodes for fuel cell storage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Built-up from earth-abundant elements, they offer affordable alternatives to precious-metal based catalysts for application in fuel cells and electrolysers. For the understanding of a catalyst's activity, insight into its structure on the atomic scale is of highest importance, yet commonly challenging to experimentally access. Here, the structural integrity of a bimetallic iron tetrapyridylporphyrin with co-adsorbed cobalt electrocatalyst on Au(111) is investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Topographic and spectroscopic characterization reveals structural changes of the molecular coordination network after oxygen reduction, and its decomposition and transformation into catalytically active Co/Fe (oxyhydr)oxide during oxygen evolution. The data establishes a structure-property relationship for the catalyst as a function of electrochemical potential and, in addition, highlights how the reaction direction of electrochemical interconversion between molecular oxygen and hydroxyl anions can have very different effects on the catalyst's structure.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000461667900037	30657498

Perovskite oxides (ABO(3)) have emerged as promising candidates to accelerate the OER process owing to their high intrinsic activities and tailorable properties. Fe ions in perovskite oxides have been proved to be a highly catalytic element for OER, while some Fe-based perovskites such as SrTi0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (STF) and La0.66Ti0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (LTF) exhibit inferior OER activity. Yet the essential reason is still unclear and the effective method to promote the activity of such perovskite is also lacking. Herein, an in-situ exsolution strategy was proposed to boost the OER by migrating Fe from the bulk to the surface. Significantly enhanced OER activity was achieved on STF and LTF perovskites with surfacedecorated oxygen vacancies and Fe nanoparticles. In addition, theoretical calculation confirmed that the oxygen vacancies and Fe nanoparticle on surface could lower the overpotential of OER by facilitating the adsorption of OH center dot. From this study, migration of the active elements in perovskite is found to be an effective strategy to increase the quantity and activity of active sites, providing new insights and understanding for designing efficient OER catalysts.

The catalyst is derived through carbonization and subsequent phosphorization of two-dimensional (2D) cobalt porphyrinic metal-organic framework nanosheets. It consists of cobalt phosphide nanoparticles embedded in mesoporous N-doped graphitic carbon materials. The catalyst shows good electrocatalytic activities for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 and OER in 1 M KOH with overpotentials of 98 and 370 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slopes of 74 and 79 mV dec(-1), respectively. In addition, the catalyst also shows good durability.

The reasonable engineering of the MOF materials is the key to highly efficient energy conversion technologies. Here, we present a facile Ar plasma treatment to introduce various defects in MOF nanosheets while maintaining their morphology. The generated coordinatively unsaturated metal sites with electron-rich structure are conducive to improving intrinsic catalytic activity, and the formed mesopores are beneficial to mass transport during the catalytic process. Compared with the pristine MOF nanosheets grown on nickel foam, the plasma-etched MOF nanosheets exhibits excellent OER performance with an ultralow overpotential of 213 mV at current density of 50 mA cm(-2). This work could deepen our understanding of the structure-property relationship of the plasma-treated MOF electrocatalysts, and open up new prospects for the engineering of highly efficient MOF-based electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-0216			WOS:000741461300001

However, the catalytic activities of porphyrins are still moderate for oxygen reduction /evolution (ORR/OER) due to the high binding energies between the catalyst and reactant. Herein, we propose a novel strategy to modulate the binding energies of the oxygenated intermediates by introducing electron coupling between the substrate and the metal porphyrin. Our results reveal remarkable enhancement of OER/ORR performance when the Co-porphyrin molecule is supported on the graphene/Ni (111) substrate. The ORR/OER overpotentials can be greatly reduced, in particular for ORR from 0.6 V to 0.31 V. The enhanced ORR/OER activity of Co-porphyrin/graphene/Ni system stems from the electronic coupling between the catalyst and the substrate that modulates the binding strength between catalytic active sites and the reaction intermediates. Our study represents an efficient strategy to design low-cost, high performance, bifunctional electrocatalysts for the application in rechargeable metal-air batteries.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000537667800016

Herein, based on powder metallurgy, a Ni-Fe based compound (Ni8Fe2 alloy) with unique porous structure and controllable phase has been designed and synthesized. Without using a solvent or template, the alloy exhibits a porous structure with uniformly distributed multi-phase. The obtained Ni8Fe2 alloy exhibits an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance and good long-term stability in alkaline electrolyte (i.e. 1.0 M KOH). Additionally, an alkaline water splitting device has been assembled using porous Ni8Fe2 alloy as both anode and cathode materials. The system requires a cell voltage of 1.65 V to reach the 10 mA cm(-2) current density for overall water splitting and maintains good stability for 25 h. The efficient electrocatalytic performance of the Ni8Fe2 alloy is owing to the unique porous microstructure, increased active sites and accelerated charge transfer. Consequently, the reaction kinetics of OER are significantly promoted.

Here a new electrocatalyst of graphdiyne-coated nickel oxide heterostructures is synthesized. It can effectively facilitate the charge transfer, increase the electrocatalytically active surface area, maximize the number of electrocatalytically active sites, and protect the catalyst from corrosion during the stability test. Benefiting from these advantages, the electrocatalyst shows superior HER and OER catalytic activities than commercial Pt/C and RuO2, respectively. When being used as both cathode and anode in a two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer, the graphdiyne-based heterostructure shows an excellent OWS performance superior to that of the Pt/C parallel to RuO2 couple. In combination with the theoretical calculations, our results reveal that the as-synthesized heterostructure can significantly improve the charge transfer kinetics and the hydrogen/oxygen-containing species adsorption abilities, therefore maximizing the overall water splitting activities.									29	7	0	0	1	0	30			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000487931500029

Despite the recent renewal in interest in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at transition metal oxide based electrodes in alkaline solution, the details of the mechanism remain controversial. In the present extended essay, the redox, charge storage and electrocatalytic behavior with respect to the OER of oxidized Ni, Fe and Co oxides in alkaline solution is discussed, the acid/base properties of the oxide is emphasized, and a plausible general reaction pathway involving the rate determining formation of a superoxy (-OOH) intermediate is proposed.									20	0	0	0	3	0	20			1452-3981			WOS:000297503300057

The SEM results demonstrated that the Cu2S possessed nanoparticle- and nanoflake-shaped, which are effective in supplying more surface reactive sites and enhancing the ions transfer rate during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process. Compared to other Cu2S-CF catalysts, the electrocatalytic results indicate that the optimized 6-Cu2S-CF catalyst exhibits a remarkable OER activity of 332 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) (is near by IrO2, i.e., 309 mV). The outstanding catalytic performance is attributed to the optimized morphology that provide lots of surface reaction sites and offer more charge transfer pathway during the OER process.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7				2352-4928		WOS:000600970700008

However, the high cost of the catalysts such as platinum and iridium oxide severely hinders the commercial development of these devices. Herein, we report a simple method for synthesizing effective bifunctional oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution catalysts through the rationally design of bimetallic metal organic framework precursor. The ratio of Zn and Co was optimized to search the critical factors affecting the catalysis of the ORR and OER. We found that for ORR catalysis, both Co/Co9S8 species and heteroatom-doped porous carbons played important roles. In contrast, the Co/Co9S8 species play more important role in OER catalysis. The optimized catalyst NSC-1-5 showed excellent ORR performance, with an onset potential of 0.879 V and a half wave potential of 0.81 V, as well as good OER catalytic activity. This was achieved simply by controlling the ratio of Co and Zn in the precursor, and NSC-1-5 could serve as a bifunctional catalyst for both ORR and OER. This work could shed some light on the design of bifunctional catalyst for both ORR and OER.

Electrochemical water splitting has been considered to be an effective method to produce hydrogen cleanly. The two reactions, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), in water splitting need efficient and Earth-abundant catalysts. Previous research indicates that the introduction of heteroatoms is an efficient way to improve the catalytic performance of metal sulfides due to the synergistic effect. Here, we demonstrate a yolk-shell phosphosulphide (FeCoNi-PS) with a porous structure, which shows good catalysis for both the HER and OER in alkaline media. In particular, the present catalyst showed geometrical current densities of 10 mA cm(-2)and 100 mA cm(-2)for the OER at overpotentials of 162 mV and 205 mV, respectively. In addition, the catalyst showed outstanding stability in a long-term operation test. This achievement sheds light on an effective route to design a high-performance, low-cost catalyst for large-scale water splitting.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2052-1553			WOS:000542745200011

Unfortunately, it has not been widely adopted in the electrodes of commercial electrolyzers because of difficulties associated with scalability and process complexity. As a remedy to this long-standing problem, we demonstrate a facile thermal route to transform poor oxide electrocatalysts into highly active ones by utilizing hot H2S gas as a dual functional agent. Using bulk cobalt oxide as a model system, we reveal that H2S that would otherwise be stable up to 1000 degrees C can be catalytically decomposed on the surface of Co3O4 into H-2 and sulfur species at a moderately high temperature. The produced H-2 and sulfur react with Co3O4 and transform it into nanostructured Co3O4/CoO@CoSx particles that are highly active towards the oxygen evolution reaction. The optimum sample can be produced after only 10 min of H2S treatment, highlighting the simplicity and scalability of our process.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000706858100009

However, the development of efficient and inexpensive electrocatalysts is crucial for future industrial applications. Amorphous catalysts possess a large specific surface area with abundant structural defects. In addition, their structures can be tuned to provide more efficient active sites, leading to superior water electrolysis activity compared with their crystalline counterparts. In this review, we summarize recent progress on amorphous electrocatalysts for water splitting, with a focus on the reaction mechanisms under both acidic and alkaline conditions, catalyst synthesis, and the application of these catalysts to the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. Moreover, we highlight the current challenges and promising opportunities relating to amorphous catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1008-6234			WOS:000855304000001

We investigated the effects of lithium content (x) on the electrocatalytic activity of LixNi(0.5)Mn(1.5)O(4), a spinel that provides only divalent and tetravalent nickel ions in a KOH aqueous electrolyte for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The lithium content was controlled by the chemical delithiation of Li0.96Ni0.49Mn1.51O4 using NO2BF4. Upon employing this approach, nickel changed from the divalent to tetravalent state. The OER activity increased with decreasing x, and a higher activity than that of standard LaNiO3 was observed at x = 0.00. Comprehensive Tafel analyses and X-ray spectroscopic investigations revealed a downshift in the Ni conduction band, indicating that high OER activity correlated with strong hybridization of the Ni 3d and O 2p orbitals. These insights into the role of Ni4+ in high OER activity are expected to facilitate the development of other highly active Ni-based electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000711236300033

In this study, BaMnO3 - a non-rare-earth element based perovskite nanorods have been prepared and investigated for the first time, and a thin carbon-coating with a thickness of approximately 10 nm has been successfully introduced to enhance the electrical conductivity of the bare perovskite. Electrochemical tests reveal that bare BaMnO3 nanorods exhibit very good catalytic activity. More interestingly, a remarkably enhanced ORR activity for the perovskite BaMnO3 nanorods was observed after coating with a thin layer of carbon, which dominated with a direct four-electron pathway. Meanwhile, the OER process has also been enhanced extraordinarily with the carbon-coating, reaching a maximum of 14.8 mA cm(-2) at 1.0V (vs. Ag/AgCl), which is far superior to both the bare BaMnO3 nanorods and commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) catalysts. Furthermore, the stabilities of bare BaMnO3 nanorods for both ORR and OER have also been improved dramatically with the help of carbon coating. These results shed light on the significant potential application of the carbon-coated perovskite BaMnO3 porous nanorods on fuel cells and metal-air batteries as an efficient bifunctional catalyst.

Heterogeneous electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) exhibit catalytic activity that depends on the electronic properties, oxidation states, and local surface structure. Spinel ferrites (MFe2O4; M = Ni and Co) based materials have been attractive for the catalytic water oxidation due to their well-known stability in alkaline medium, easy synthesis, existence of metal cations with various oxidation states, low cost, and tunable properties by the desired metal substitution. To understand the better catalytic activity of MFe2O4 in detail the role of Ni and Co was studied through MxNi1-xFe2O4 (M = Co; 0 < x < 1), which was prepared by the sol-gel method. The results showed that bare NiFe2O4 has better catalytic activity (eta = 381 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 46.4 mV dec(-1)) compared to Co-containing MxNi1-xFe2O4 (eta = 450-470 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 50-73 mV dec(-1)) in alkaline medium, and the substitution of Co is found to suppress the catalytic activity of NiFe2O4. The degradation of catalytic activity with an increase in Co content was accounted for in further detailed investigations.									87	3	0	0	5	0	87			1944-8244			WOS:000399965700025	28339180

In this frame, a set of experiments was performed on a symmetrical cell using a three-electrode setup. A micro-scale electrode model considering two reaction pathways, i.e. bulk and surface paths, has been developed to describe the experimental results. The microstructural parameters of the electrode were obtained by FIB-SEM tomography. The model was calibrated using the experimental polarization curves measured at different temperatures, and it was validated using electrochemical impedance diagrams recorded at open circuit potential (OCP) and under polarization for different oxygen partial pressures. It has been evidenced that the LNO reaction mechanism depends on both the temperature and the polarization. At OCP, the reaction mechanism is controlled by the bulk path at 650 degrees C and by the surface path at higher temperatures. A transition from the bulk path towards the surface path was observed under cathodic polarizations. These results have been interpreted by considering the evolution of the LNO over stoichiometry with the electrode polarization. The evolution of the electrode polarization resistance with the oxygen partial pressure has been also investigated.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000769730400001

The band gap of this photoactive material is determined to be 1.7 eV. The Bi2O2CO3 agglomerates are anchored on NiFe-LDH plates and g-C3N4 nanosheets intercalated between the LDH plates. This architecture helps in expediting electron transfer for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The pristine NiFe-LDH photoanode acquires bifunctional character because of Bi2O2CO3 agglomerates and g-C3N4 embedded in the architecture of BOC/NiFe-LDH@g-C3N4 . This is found to be an efficient photoanode for oxygen evolution and photocathode for hydrogen evolution reactions. The water splitting process occurs along the heterojunction formed between g-C3N4 nanosheets and Bi2O2CO3 grafted NiFe-LDH. Further, an additional interfacial charge transfer aided by Bi2O2CO3 results in S-scheme mechanism, which enhances the rate of photoelectrochemical hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions.

Organometallic complexes have attracted considerable interests due to their scientific significance and their ability to efficiently photo-and electro-catalyze H-2 and O-2 evolution reactions. Here, we combine density functional theory (DFT) and computational electrochemical analysis to predict the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of a series of organometallic complexes containing methyl thiol ligands and compare it to that of Ni complex. We find that the OER activity versus the diameter of the hexagonal ring shows a maximum activity which corresponds to that of Ni complex. We also find an existence of linear correlations of the adsorption energies with the ring diameter of the oxidized complexes. In an effort to improve the OER activity of these complexes, we substitute a metal cation with Ni, and we show that Ni-doped complexes give rise to smaller overpotentials. The enhanced overpotential can be explained in terms of the overall affinity of active sites for reactive species resulting in a shift of their binding energies. Finally, we find that substituting Fe atoms into small organometallic Ni complex does not appear to have the same influence that has been observed in bulk materials. We believe these predictions will help guide catalyst design by identifying active and robust OER catalysts, capable to reduce the energy required for the anodic water oxidation.

Creating oxygen vacancies and adjusting their density has proven to be an effective strategy to design high-performance OER catalysts. Herein, a hydrogenation method is applied to treat a two-dimensional (2D) iron-cobalt oxide (Fe1Co1Ox-origin), with the purpose of tuning its oxygen vacancy density. Notably, compared with Fe1Co1Ox-origin, the iron-cobalt oxide hydrogenated at 200 A degrees C and 2.0 MPa optimized conditions exhibits a markedly improved OER activity in 1.0 M KOH (with an overpotential eta of 225 mV at a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2)) and a rapid reaction kinetics (with a Tafel slope of 36.0 mV center dot dec(-1)). Moreover, the OER mass activity of the hydrogenated oxide is 1.9 times that of Fe1Co1Ox-origin at an overpotential of 350 mV. The experimental results, combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, reveal that the optimal control of oxygen vacancies in 2D Fe1Co1Ox via hydrogenation can improve the electronic conductivity and promote OH- adsorption onto nearby low-coordinated Co3+ sites, resulting in a significantly enhanced OER activity.									119	13	0	0	2	0	121			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000433048600051

This deliberately designed oxygen electrode is found to yield lower overpotential (0.82 V), improved specific capacity (9673 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)), and enhanced cycle life (164 cycles) as compared to the traditional carbonaceous electrode. The improved performance can be ascribed to the superb spinet structure of CuCo2S4, in which both Cu and Co exhibit more abundant redox properties, improving oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction kinetics effectively and boosting the electrochemical reactions. Furthermore, the well-designed architecture also plays a critical role in the improved performance. Encouraged by the excellent catalytic activity of this free-standing cathode, large-scale pouch-type Li-O-2 cell based on CuCo2S4@Ni cathode is fabricated and can work under different bending and twisting conditions. This free-standing electrode provides a new strategy for developing Li-O-2 batteries with excellent performance and flexible wearable devices.									47	6	0	0	1	0	48			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000457816900018	30620172

Carbonaceous materials have been investigated as these catalysts since the early stage of ZAB research. Recent studies have revealed promising carbonaceous materials with heteroatoms and transition metals doped into the surface or incorporated as nanoparticles, although the activity still needs improvement. In this study, the double coating of carbonaceous thin film containing Fe and N on a graphitic carbon fiber surface was performed via sublimation, deposition, and pyrolysis of iron phthalocyanine (FePc). In the first coating, the thin film and Fe nano-aggregates on the surface were generated, which were encapsulated in the carbonaceous shell to generate protrusions in the second coating. The presence of the protrusion enhanced the oxygen reduction activity. Such protrusion was also formed by the single coating with a sufficient FePc feed; however, the activity enhancement was limited. Contrarily, the double coating considerably enhanced the activity and surpassed that of Pt in the high potential region. In addition, the oxygen evolution reaction was improved by the FePc-derived thin film coating. The durability was confirmed by the stable cycling performance of ZAB with the double-coated electrode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000597952800001

In this work, we develop FeNiCoOX hierarchical hollow nanocages via a cation exchange reaction with annealing in air, which show excellent OER performances in 1 M KOH. This FeNiCoOx catalyst exhibits a small overpotential of 248 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 45.4 mV dec(-1), as well as the remarkable stability. Excellent electrocatalytic performances are attributed to the synergistic effects from the multi-metal element compositions and the hierarchical hollow structures.

ORR activities of single and mixed metal oxide and carbon electrocatalysts were studied using rotating disc electrode (RDE) measurements, Tafel slope and Koutecky-Levich plots. It was found that MnOx combined with XC-72R demonstrated high ORR activity and good stability-up to 100 mA cm(-2). The performance of the selected ORR electrode and a previously optimised oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrode was thereafter tested in a custom-built secondary Zn-air cell in a tri-electrode configuration, and the effects of current density, electrolyte molarity, temperature, and oxygen purity on the performance of the ORR and OER electrode were investigated. Finally, the durability of the secondary Zn-air system was assessed, demonstrating energy efficiencies of 58-61% at 20 mA cm(-2) over 40 h in 4 M NaOH + 0.3 M ZnO at 333 K.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000785968500029	35461322

However, direct experimental evidence and the physical mechanism of a quantitative relationship between physical factors and oxygen evolution activity are still lacking, which makes it difficult to theoretically and accurately predict the oxygen evolution activity. In this work, a datadriven method for the prediction of overpotential (OP) for (Ni-FeCo)Ox catalysts is proposed via machine learning. The physical features that are more related to the OP for the OER have been constructed and analyzed. The random forest regression model works exceedingly well on OP prediction with a mean relative error of 1.20%. The features based on first ionization energies (FIEs) and outermost d-orbital electron numbers (DEs) are the principal factors and their variances (OFIE and ODE) exhibit a linearly decreasing correlation with OP, which gives direct guidance for an OP-oriented component design. This method provides novel and promising insights for the prediction of oxygen evolution activity and physical factor analysis in (Ni-Fe-Co)Ox catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2470-1343			WOS:000812565300001	35559173

Initial selectivity analysis shows that three electron collision reactions are important for NO, evolution in O-2/N-2. The rate constants of these reactions decrease with increasing oxygen concentration. This is because oxygen is electronegative and thus reduces electron concentration. The rate constant of 02 dissociation by electron collision reaction is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of N-2 dissociation. NO formation occurs predominantly through N(D-2) + O-2 -> NO + O. The critical oxygen concentration, defined as the concentration at which the NOx formation rate counterbalances the NO, decomposition rate, increases with increasing initial NO concentration.

We introduce, for the first time, a facile approach towards the fabrication of versatile electrode composed of free-standing multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as electrocatalyst for the water splitting reaction. Directly extracted MWCNTs as sheets from vertically grown arrays transferred over the glass substrate, are used without any post treatment as a working electrode for OER. Onset potential of 1.60 V was achieved for MWCNTs which is significantly reduced as compared to platinum based metal electrode (1.72 V) with excellent current density. No surface modification, metal-free nature, flexibility and low cost with excellent catalytic activity proved this material as a promising candidate for the replacement of metal based electrodes in electrochemical water splitting.

The mechanism for each stage was illustrated. The synergistic effect of the large dissolution of the active components and the localized oxidation of the Ti substrate is regarded as the main reason for the failure of the Ti/IrO2-RuO2-SiO2 anode.									14	1	0	0	0	0	15			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:000533523500008

Herein, it is demonstrated that surface reorganization engineering by oxygen plasma engraving on electocatalysts successfully realizes a dramatically enhanced alkaline HER activity. Taking CoP nanowire arrays grown on carbon cloth (denoted as CoP NWs/CC) as an example, the oxygen plasma engraving can trigger moderate CoOx species formation on the surface of the CoP NWs/CC, which is visually verified by the X-ray absorption fine structure, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping. Benefiting from the moderate CoOx species formed on the surface, which can promote the water dissociation in alkaline HER, the surface reorganization of the CoP NWs/CC realizes almost fourfold enhanced alkaline HER activity and a 180 mV decreased overpotential at 100 mA cm(-2), compared with the pristine ones. More interestingly, this surface reorganization strategy by oxygen plasma engraving can also be effective to other electrocatalysts such as free-standing CoP, Co4N, O-CoSe2, and C-CoSe2 nanowires, which verifies the universality of the strategy. This work thus opens up new avenues for designing alkaline HER electrocatalysts based on oxygen plasma engraving.									186	14	0	0	6	0	187			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000419033700007	29171706

We show the rise of a pre-peak feature at 529 eV in the O K-edge spectra, correlated to the appearance of a shoulder at the Ni L-3-edge and formation of oxidized Ni3+/4+-O. Then, for the first time, we track the spectral changes in a dynamic fashion in both the soft and hard X-ray regimes during cyclic voltammetry (in situ CV-XAS) to obtain a fine-tuned resolution of the potential-related changes. The pre-peak feature at the O K-edge likely signifies formation of an electron deficient oxygen site. The electrophilic oxygen species appears and disappears reversibly in correlation with the Ni2+ <-> Ni3+/4+ process, and persists during OER catalysis as long the metal is oxidized. Our study provides new insight into OER electrocatalysis: Before onset of the O-O bond formation step, the catalytic oxyhydroxide has accumulated electron deficiencies by both, oxidation of transition metal ions and formation of partially oxidized oxygen sites.									59	3	0	0	7	0	59			2045-2322			WOS:000457868400078	30728373

Currently, such design is limited by challenges in atomic-scale experimental characterization and computational modeling of solid liquid interfaces. Here, we begin to address these issues by developing a general-, first principles, and electrochemical-principles-based framework for prediction of catalyst surface structure, stoichiometry, and stability as a function of pH, electrode potential, and aqueous cation concentration. We demonstrate the approach by determining the surface phase diagram of LaMnO3, which has been studied for oxygen evolution and reduction and computing the reaction overpotentials on the relevant surface phases. Our results illustrate the critical role of solvated cation species in governing the catalyst surface structure and stoichiometry, and thereby catalytic activity, in aqueous solution.									49	0	0	0	3	0	49			1948-7185			WOS:000355014900049	26263350

Herein we report the synthesis of cobalt-embedded nitrogen-rich carbon nanotubes (NRCNTs) that 1) can efficiently electrocatalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with activities close to that of Pt and 2) function well under acidic, neutral or basic media alike, allowing them to be coupled with the best available oxygen-evolving catalystswhich also play crucial roles in the overall water-splitting reaction. The materials are synthesized by a simple, easily scalable synthetic route involving thermal treatment of Co2+-embedded graphitic carbon nitride derived from inexpensive starting materials (dicyandiamide and CoCl2).

Herein, Ni@NiO@graphite nanoparticles less than 20 nm in average diameter were synthesized by a one-step chemical vapor deposition process. Due to the deliberately controlled lack of oxygen, Ni particles and carbon clusters decomposed from NiCp2 precursors were oxidized incompletely and formed Ni@NiO core-shell nanoparticles coated by a graphite layer. The thickness of the graphite layer and the content of Ni were controlled by varying deposition temperature. The electrochemical activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction was assessed within alkaline media. Compared with commercial NiO powder, the Ni@NiO@graphite nanoparticles with the unique core-shell microstructure exhibit excellent OER performance, i.e., an overpotential of 330 mV (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1), due to the improved electrical conductivity and more active sites. This work provides a facile and rapid strategy to produce nanoparticles with unique microstructures as highly active electrocatalysts for the OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000778358800001	35424973

Perovskite oxides have emerged as potential candidates to replace the less economically attractive Pt and IrO2 water splitting catalysts. In this work, excellent electrical conductivity (980 S cm(-1)) was found for the double perovskite of composition GdBa0.6Sr0.4Co2O6-delta which is consistent with a better oxygen evolution reaction activity with the onset polarisation of 1.51 V with respect to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). GdBa1-xSrxCo2O6-delta with increasing Sr content was found to crystallise in the higher symmetry tetragonal P4/mmm space group in comparison with the undoped GdBaCo2O6-delta which is orthorhombic (Pmmm), and yields higher oxygen uptake, accompanied by higher Co oxidation states. This outstanding electrochemical performance is explained by the wider carrier bandwidth, which is a function of Co-O-Co buckling angles and Co-O bond lengths. Furthermore the higher oxygen evolution activity was observed despite the formation of non-lattice oxides (mainly hydroxide species) and enrichment of alkaline earth ions on the surface.									29	0	0	0	1	0	29			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000428670000013

Herein, inspired by the highly electric conductivity of CoB, shell-core structured Ni(OH)(2)@CoB nano-chains are synthesized as highly active OER catalyst with the assistance of the magnetic field. In the shell-core structured Ni(OH)(2)@CoB nano-chains, Ni(OH)(2) nanoflakes were directly grown onto CoB nano-chains via a facile and wet chemical method. Ni(OH)(2) in nanoflake form can provide more available active sites on the surface for electrochemical reaction that is evidenced by high BET surface area (648.9 m(2) g-(1)). At the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the over potentials of OER occurred on Ni(OH)(2)@CoB is 320 mV. The obtained Ni(OH)(2)@CoB also shows very good OER durability without any observable decline for 12 h. The high OER catalytic performance combined with its low-cost makes the Ni(OH)(2)@CoB nano-chains promising OER catalyst for water splitting in alkaline media.

The catalytic activity was changed by the kind of oxygen atom transfer reagent (hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite). The polymer catalyst produced oxidized forms in a high yield using sodium hypochlorite as oxygen atom transfer reagent. The inhibition of the oxygen evolution was observed in the decomposition reaction of hydrogen peroxide when cyclohexene was added to the solution. A mechanism involving formation of a Mn-oxo complex and oxygen transfer from a reactive Mn-oxo intermediate to cyclohexene was proposed for this reaction. The inhibition of oxygen evolution was considered to be oxygen transfer to cyclohexene from the Mn-oxo species. On the other hand, the oxygenation of cyclohexene preferentially proceeded with sodium hypochlorite because of no reaction with the second hypochlorite. Overall, the polymer catalyst showed activity as a catalyst for oxygenation of cyclohexene using sodium hypochlorite in aqueous solution.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			1381-5148			WOS:A1996UK53100002

To overcome this drawback, we take the lesson from other catalysis researches that showed improved catalytic activities by employing metal alloy catalysts. Such research effort has led us to find Pt3Co nanoparticles as an effective OER catalyst in Li-O-2 batteries. The superior catalytic activity was reflected in the substantially decreased overpotentials and improved cycling/rate performance compared to those of other catalysts. Density functional theory calculations suggested that the low OER overpotentials are associated with the reduced adsorption strength of LiO2 on the outermost Pt catalytic sites. Also, the alloy catalyst generates amorphous Li2O2 conformally coated around the catalyst and thus facilitates easier decomposition and higher reversibility. This investigation conveys an important message that understanding elementary reactions and surface charge engineering of air-catalysts are one of the most effective approaches in resolving the chronic sluggish charging kinetics in Li-O-2 batteries.									141	5	0	0	10	0	144			2045-2322			WOS:000331956600009	24573326

Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)											10.1002/anie.202214541				2022-Oct-23	2022	NiFe-based oxides are one of the best-known active oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. Unfortunately, they rapidly lost performance in Fe-purified KOH during the reaction. Herein, tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) was loaded on a catalyst/electrolyte interface to alleviate the destabilization of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide. We propose that the degradation occurs primarily due to the release of thermodynamically unstable Fe. TPP acts as a protective layer and suppresses the dissolution of hydrated metal at the catalyst/electrolyte interface. In the electric double layer, the nonpolar TPP layer on the NiFe surface also invigorates the redeposition of the active site, Fe, which leads to prolonging the lifetime of NiFe. The TPP-coated NiFe was demonstrated in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, where hydrogen was generated at a rate of 126L h-1 for 115 h at a 1.41 mV h-1 degradation rate. Consequently, TPP is a promising protective layer that could stabilize oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1521-3773		MEDLINE:36274053	36274053

However, its efficiency is limited by the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), calling for highly active catalysts to accelerate the reaction rate. Herein, NiO is reduced by cellulose through a hydrothermal method to obtain the highly active OER catalysts. The obtained cellulose-partially-reduced-NiO (CL-prNiO) shows a hybrid structure, composed of 3.6 wt.% face-centered cubic (fcc) Ni and 96.4 wt.% rock salt structured NiO with highly disordered interface. The CL-prNiO delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential of 288 mV, which is comparable to the commercial RuO2 and outperforms many of the recently reported Ni-NiO based OER catalysts. As benefited from the hybrid and disordered structure, CL-prNiO shows great ability of converting Ni2+ to Ni3+ at a potential prior to the OER onset. The in situ generated Ni3+ species can activate the lattice oxygen in the unreduced NiO of CL-prNiO, significantly boosting the OER activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000645531500001

Herein, N, O-codoped graphene nanorings-integrated boxes (denoted NOGB) are crafted via high-temperature pyrolysis and following acid etching of hybrid precursors containing polymers and Prussian blue analogue cubes. The electrochemical results signified that the resulting NOGB-800 (800 refers to pyrolysis temperature) is highly active for trifunctional electrocatalysis of ORR/OER/HER. This can be reasonably attributed to the advanced nanostructures (i.e., the hierarchically porous nanostructures on the hollow nanorings) and unique chemical compositions (i.e., N, O-codoped graphene). More attractively, the rechargeable Zn-air battery based on NOGB-800 displays maximum power density of 111.9 mW cm(-2) with small charge-discharge potential of 0.72 V and excellent stability of 30 h, comparable with the Pt/C+Ir/C counterpart. The NOGB-800 could also be utilized as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting to yield current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.65 V, surpassing most reported electrocatalysts. Therefore, the NOGB-800 is a promising candidate instead of precious metal-based electrocatalysts for the efficient Zn-air battery and water splitting.									148	2	0	0	8	0	148			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000467132300010

Cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry studies reveal very low ORR activity of carbon-free perovskite and remarkably enhanced ORR of perovskite-carbon composites. The ORR current density at -0.5 V vs. Hg/HgO is higher than 200 mA cm(-2) in a wide range of perovskite-carbon composition, suggesting good peroxide reducing capability of the perovskite. The ORR mechanisms of perovskite-carbon composites are consistent with the 2+2-electron mechanisms. The ORR and OER properties of perovskite-carbon composite electrodes are significantly influenced by the carbon species. The electrode exhibits a higher ORR current density, but inferior cycling performances when a carbon material with a higher specific surface area is used, and vice versa. Under a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) and ORR and OER durations of 30 min, a gas diffusion type electrode consists of La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 and a low surface area carbon are capable of more than 150 cycles.

Herein we describe the fabrication of a ternary NiFeCo oxide catalyst with a RF-magnetron sputtering technique and investigated as durable catalyst oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A comparative study of the electrocatalytic activities of pure, bimetallic, and trimetallic catalysts is performed. With the synergetic effects of electronic structural modification and the large electrochemical area of the ternary NiFeCo oxide catalyst, current densities of 1 and 10 mA cm(-2) are attained at small overpotentials of 248 and 280 mV, respectively. The relatively low Tafel slope of the trimetallic electrode (32.25 mV dec(-1)) indicates favorable catalytic kinetics during OER. This is attributed to the catalytic performance of metal constituents with high oxidation states. The electrode exhibits outstanding durability during rigorous oxygen evolution testing in 1 M KOH for 500 hours. Simple sputtering deposition of multimetallic oxide catalyst films can be applied to fabricate other multimetallic catalysts and electrodes for robust, efficient water spitting, and electrochemical energy storage.									28	1	0	0	0	0	29			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000503738900001

Controllable Synthesis of 2D Nonlayered Cr2S3 Nanosheets and Their Electrocatalytic Activity Toward Oxygen Evolution Reaction								Frontiers in Chemical Engineering				3				703812 (7 pp.)	703812 (7 pp.)		10.3389/fceng.2021.703812				2021	2021	The design of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts based on Earth-abundant materials holds great promise for realizing practically viable water-splitting systems. In this regard, two-dimensional (2D) nonlayered materials have received considerable attention in recent years owing to their intrinsic dangling bonds which give rise to the exposure of unsaturated active sites. In this work, we solved the synthesis challenge in the development of a 2D nonlayered Cr2S3 catalyst for OER application via introducing a controllable chemical vapor deposition scheme. The as-obtained catalyst exhibits a very good OER activity requiring overpotentials of only 230 mV and 300 mV to deliver current densities of 10 mA cm-2 and 30 mA cm-2, respectively, with robust stability. This study provides a general approach to optimize the controllable growth of 2D nonlayered material and opens up a fertile ground for studying the various strategies to enhance the water splitting reactions.

Heteroatom-doping and defect-introduction are critical strategies in activating OER electrocatalysts. Herein, a combined magnetron sputtering, Co-Ga alloying, dealloying and selenization strategy was adopted to realize Ga-doped CoSe2 nanosheets with enriched oxygen vacancies supported on stainless steel mesh (SSM) for OER. The as-obtained L-CoSe2/SSM exhibits remarkable OER performances with an ultralow overpotential of 227 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and small Tafel slope of 49.15 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. In addition, the catalyst displays negligible activity decay after more than 25 h of continuous operation. The enhanced OER performances of the L-CoSe2/SSM can be rationalized by plentiful oxygen vacancies, Ga doping, unique roughened nanosheets structure and substrate (SSM). The findings provide promising and controllable synthetic strategy for low-cost CoSe2 based electrocatalyst toward practical applications of water electrolysis.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000644228800003

Rationally designed, N-doped carbons (NDCs) with wider mesopores (15-27 nm) exhibiting superior mass transfer properties were obtained following pyrolysis and demineralization of polydopamine-coated halloysite clay nanotubes. NDCs thus obtained exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a lower onset potential (117 mV), smaller Tafel slope (94 mV dec(-1)) and high exchange current density (j(o) = 1.5 x 10(-2) mA cm(-2)), which is comparable and even superior to other multiple heteroatom-doped carbons and transition metal chalcogenide/oxide-based systems reported previously. Furthermore, NDCs participate in an efficient, direct four-electron pathway for the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. The observed bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of the NDC can be attributed to the synergistic effect of enhanced mass transfer and efficient charge transfer processes at the electrodes and hence deems fit to be a promising candidate for future renewable energy blueprints viz. metal-air batteries and regenerative fuel cell technology.									59	4	0	0	3	1	61			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000397608000005

Recent developments of theoretical methods based on density functional theory have enabled computational screening of catalysts, to achieve fundamental understanding of which catalyst is optimal for a certain reaction. In the present work, such screening is employed to elucidate the electrocatalytic properties of doped rutile TiO2. Electrodes based on this material are widely used in industrial production of, e.g., chlorine and sodium chlorate. The screening covers 38 different dopants, including all fourth, fifth and sixth row transition metals. Several dopants are predicted to activate TiO2, resulting in a material optimal either for the oxygen evolution reaction, or for selective chlorine evolution. The results can serve as a map for the rational design of electrocatalysts based on TiO2. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report tuning of the atomic structure of one-dimensional single-crystal cobalt (II) oxide (CoO) nanorods by creating oxygen vacancies on pyramidal nanofacets. These CoO nanorods exhibit superior catalytic activity and durability towards oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. The combined experimental studies, microscopic and spectroscopic characterization, and density functional theory calculations reveal that the origins of the electrochemical activity of single-crystal CoO nanorods are in the oxygen vacancies that can be readily created on the oxygen-terminated {111} nanofacets, which favourably affect the electronic structure of CoO, assuring a rapid charge transfer and optimal adsorption energies for intermediates of oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. These results show that the surface atomic structure engineering is important for the fabrication of efficient and durable electrocatalysts.									463	24	0	0	17	0	468			2041-1723			WOS:000385384100010	27650485

The initial scheme included 44 reactions from the literature. Sensitivity analysis proved that this initial scheme was equivalent to a simple 22-reaction scheme. Results calculated with this scheme were compared against the spatial distributions of oxy-myoglobin (MbO2), metmyoglobin (MMb) and deoxymyoglobin (DMb) measured in meat cuts stored at 20C under air-permeable packaging. We found global agreement between measured and calculated distributions when adequate rate constant values were used, particularly for the formation of MbO2 from DMb. The model was used to calculate evolutions in MbO2 and MMb distributions under different situations (modified-atmosphere packaging, Fenton chemistry with or without water-soluble antioxidants, increased mitochondrial oxygen con-sumption). Results were used to discuss the underlying kinetics reaction mechanisms and the performances and limits of the model.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0309-1740	1873-4138		WOS:000811513200002	35667192

While exciting progress has been made in noble metal-based catalysts, earth-abundant materials that can actively catalyze the water splitting at high current densities (e.g. >= 500 mA cm(-2)) are rare. In this work, we show that a rational design of the catalysts could promote the charge transfer, facilitate the gas release, as well as boost the surface active sites, and therefore significantly enhance the electrocatalytic activity toward both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Using NiCo/NiCo-OH and NiFe/NiFe-OH as examples, we achieved ultralow overpotentials of 184 and 296 mV at 500 mA cm(-2) in 1M KOH for HER and OER, respectively. More importantly, the alkaline electrolyzer based on these two materials is able to actively drive the overall water splitting at 1000 mA cm(-2) for at least 300 h at a low cell voltage without significant performance decay, which is much superior to the state-of-the-art 20 % Pt/C parallel to RuO2 combination. Our work points out a promising pathway to achieve inexpensive electrocatalysts for practical water splitting at high currents.									96	3	0	0	6	0	97			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000564573800010

The air electrode, with bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction ( ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction ( OER), plays the most important role in determining battery performance. Direct deposition of catalysts on the air electrode, using methods such as electrodeposition, electroless deposition, chemical vapor deposition ( CVD) and physical vapor deposition ( PVD), is shown to be a viable way to fabricate durable and active catalysts with high efficiency and low cost. This review examines recent research activities which apply direct deposition methods to prepare bifunctional catalysts.

A Comprehensive Study on Oxygen Reduction and Evolution from Lithium Containing DMSO Based Electrolytes at Gold Electrodes								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				163	8			A1765	A1775		10.1149/2.1281608jes				2016	2016	In the present study, we investigated the reduction and the evolution of oxygen from lithium containing DMSO based electrolytes at gold. The number of electrons that are transferred per O-2 (z-value) during oxygen reduction depends on the structure of the electrode: Despite the presence of Li+, O-2 is reduced electrochemically to superoxide at smooth gold electrodes and at low overpotentials. At porous electrodes a z-value close to 2 e(-)/O-2 indicates Li2O2-formation even at low overpotentials. This is ascribed to a reaction of superoxide, which is catalyzed by gold-particles at open circuit. This behavior is also responsible for the non-proportionality between reduced and evolved amounts of oxygen. Furthermore, we observed a linear relationship between evolved amounts of CO2 and reduced amounts of oxygen, indicative for electrolyte decomposition during oxygen reduction. Combined electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (eQCMB) and Differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS) measurements reveal that mass changes that occur in the anodic sweep are due to the evolution of CO2, whereas oxygen evolution takes place without any mass changes. The observed m.p.e-values (mass changes per transferred electron) are affected by convection due to the formation of soluble reduction products which observed in rotating ring disc electrode measurements.

The synergistic effect of bulk charge transport and surface oxygen evolution could significantly improve the photoelectrochemical properties (0.45 mA cm(-2), 1.23 V-RHE) for water splitting under simulated solar light, which are much higher than those of traditional Bi2WO6 particle photoanodes (0.02 mA cm-2, 1.23 V-RHE). These demonstrations clearly reveal that the rational construction of a photoanode structure and selective decoration of oxygen evolution cocatalysts could serve as an alternative strategy toward the development of highly efficient water splitting systems.									32	1	0	0	3	0	32			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000412800300006

However, there is an urgent necessity but it is still a significant challenge to explore electrocatalysts with excellent performance, low cost, and environmental benignity for expediting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) owing to the sluggish reaction kinetics. Fe-based materials, especially FeOOH, have great potential as OER electrocatalysts but suffers from poor electrical conductivity. Herein, we rationally designed and successfully synthesized FeOOH nanosheet arrays supported on alkali-treated nickel foam (FeOOH NSAs/ATNF) and applied it as an electrocatalyst toward OER. The FeOOH NSAs/ATNF catalyst exhibited outstanding performance with small overpotential, fast kinetics and superior stability in alkaline medium. Our research opens up a facile and effective approach to develop cost-effective and high-performance electrocatalysts for energy conversion, especially for these Fe-based materials with poor electrical conductivity.

It is the ratio of carbon to oxygen at the end of the helium burning stage that governs the following phases of stellar evolution leading to different scenarios depending on the initial stellar mass. In addition, helium burning in Asymptotic Giant Branch stars, provides the two main sources of neutrons, namely the C-13(alpha, n)O-16 and the Ne-22(alpha, n)(25) Mg, for the synthesis of about half of all elements heavier than iron through the s-process. Given the importance of these reactions, much experimental work has been devoted to the study of their reaction rates over the last few decades. However, large uncertainties still remain at the energies of astrophysical interest which greatly limit the accuracy of stellar models predictions. Here, we review the current status on the latest experimental efforts and show how measurements of these important reaction cross sections can be significantly improved at next-generation deep underground laboratories.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1434-6001	1434-601X		WOS:000373644500005

Ni50Fe50/N-CNTs exhibited the best OER and ORR performance in the series. When employed as air cathode, Ni50Fe50/N-CNTs demonstrated superior properties in the primary rechargeable zinc air battery to the Pt/C+RuO2 catalyst. Developing cost-effective, efficient and durable electrocatalysts to replace the high cost and low poison resistant platinum-group-metal (PGM) catalysts to boost the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical for promoting the practical performance of zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a series of NiFe alloyed nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NixFe100-x@N-CNTs, where x denotes the Ni ratio in NiFe alloys) have been fabricated as bifunctional catalysts for both OER and ORR. Among the series, the Ni50Fe50@N-CNTs sample exhibited the best oxygen reversible electrocatalytic performance, of which it possessed an overpotential of 318 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and a half-wave potential of 0.86 V for ORR. The ZAB cell using Ni50Fe50@N-CNTs as an air-cathode also showed a power density of 203.6 mW cm(-2), and a specific capacity of 778 mA h g(-1), outperforming the noble-metal-based Pt/C+IrO2 catalyst. In addition, such ZAB cell also demonstrated a superlong stable rechargeability over 200 h without structural deletoriation, presenting promises for pushing forward into practical applications.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000490012200001

In this study, a novel oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst based on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) layers encapsulated with Ni2P nanoflowers (Ni2P @ g-C3N4) is synthesized, which exhibits low overpotentials of 237 mV for OER at 10 mA cm(-2) and remarkable stability. The combination of the reactive Ni2P core and the chain-mail material is an important reason for the excellent electrocatalytic performance. The robust g-C3N4 chain-mail protects the internal transition metal phosphides (TMPs) core from the harsh reaction environment, and well balances the catalytic activity and stability. As the core of the catalyst, the encapsulated Ni2P nanoflower core can transport electrons to the surface of the chain-mail layer. Our work demonstrates an efficient and robust Ni-based chain-mail electrocatalyst and provides a novel prospect for the development of the electrocatalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000797571500002

Herein, a novel CeO2/NiCoP nanoarray with intimate phosphide (NiCoP)-oxide (CeO2) interface was developed via in situ generation on nickel foam (NF). This structure is conducive to increasing active sites and accelerating charge transfer, and may be conducive to regulating electronic structure and adsorption energy. As expected, optimal 1.4-CeO2/NiCoP/NF delivers a low overpotential of 249 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 77.2 mV dec(-1). CeO2/NiCoP/NF boasts one of the best OER catalytic materials among recently reported phosphides (TMP)-based OER catalysts and composite catalysts involving CeO2. This work provides an effective strategy for the construction of hetero-structure with CeO2 with oxygen vacancies to improve the OER performance of phosphides.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000620951500001	33508817

Herein, we developed a low-cost and efficient method to prepare the nitrogen-doped carbon supported nickel-iron nanoparticle (NiFe@NC) electrocatalysts, simply by one-step conversion from cross-linked polyphthalocyanine under the direct pyrolysis treatment. The resultant NiFe@NC electrocatalysts exhibit the efficient catalytic activity and durability for both OER and HER as bi-functional electrodes in water splitting device. The water splitting device based on the same NiFe@NC electrocatalyst at both sides of anode and cathode can operate with lower cell voltage (1.81 V, at 10 mA cm(-2)) in 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, as well as excellent durability (over 15 h of operation at 8, 10 and 20 mA cm(-2)) and high reversibility. The excellent electrocatalytic performance indicates that NiFe@NC electrocatalysts can be the promising replacement of the precious metals for more practical and cost-efficient water splitting. This work develops a new method for the preparation of high efficient and low-cost Ni-based electrocatalysts for symmetrical water splitting devices.									92	2	1	0	3	0	92			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000390636100051

Designing heterojunction photocatalysts that can evolve oxygen from water splitting through an artificial Z-scheme pathway is a promising strategy for solving environmental problems. In this study, flower-like MoS2 nanostructures were fabricated via a simple hydrothermal process, and the electrostatic-based assembly ion-exchange method was used to construct a tandem Ag3PO4/MoS2/g-C3N4 (AMC) heterojunction. The as-synthesized photocatalyst exhibited significant improvements in harvesting visible light and transporting charge carriers. Moreover, the catalyst that was similar to the Z-scheme with intimate interface contact exhibited a strong oxygen evolution performance. The oxygen evolution activity of the optimal AMC-10 catalyst was approximately 11 times that of the pristine Ag3PO4. The results indicated that addition of a small amount of the flower-like MoS2 could significantly enhance the efficiency of oxygen evolution by the heterojunction. The findings in this study provide an alternative pathway for rationally designing efficient oxygen-evolving photocatalysts in order to improve the quality of water and rehabilitate the water environment.

In this study, a bamboo-structured nitrogen doped carbon nanotube coencapsulated with metallic cobalt and Mo2C nanoparticles (Co-Mo2C@NCNT) is designed and synthesized by a successive pyrolysis approach and demonstrated to be an efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in alkaline medium. Attributing to favorable synergy interaction in composition and structure, the resultant Co-Mo2C@NCNT presents the superior performances toward HER, OER, and even overall water splitting in alkaline medium. To drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), it needs only an overpotential of similar to 186 and similar to 377 mV for the electrocatalytic HER and OER, respectively, and a relatively low cell voltage (similar to 1.628 V) for overall water electrolysis. The present finding would open a new avenue to design and develop electocatalytically active multicomponent architectures for overall water splitting.									98	6	0	0	7	0	101			2168-0485			WOS:000441475500045

As a new type of catalyst for LOBs, the advancements have never been reviewed and discussed comprehensively. Herein, breakthroughs in the design of various types of SACs as cathode catalysts for LOBs are summarized, including Co-based, Ru-based, and other types of SACs. Moreover, considerable emphasis is placed on the correlations between the structural feature of the SAC active sites and the electrocatalytic performance of LOBs. Finally, an overview and challenges of SACs for practical LOBs are also provided. This review provides an intensive understanding of SACs for designing efficient oxygen electrocatalysis and offers useful guidelines for the development of SACs in the field of LOBs.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2399-1984		WOS:000751065500001

Herein, we report that an activated carbon sheet (ACS) derived from chitin is an efficient non-metal bifunctional electrocatalyst for both ORR and OER. In alkaline media, the as-prepared ACS exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction, which was significantly superior to an unactivated carbon sheet (CS) and comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst with excellent durability and resistance to the crossover effect. Meanwhile, the same ACS also presents high catalytic activity towards OER, with a small overpotential of similar to 1.64 +/- 0.02 V versus RHE. The excellent electrocatalytic properties of the ACS originated from the combined effect of optimal nitrogen doping, high surface area, and porous architecture. This work demonstrates that the ACS is a promising material candidate with high-performance in electrocatalytic applications in energy technologies.									70	10	0	0	7	0	73			2046-2069			WOS:000357803200061

The OER potential of the Fe/C/N catalyst at a current density of 10 mA cm(2) was 1.59 VRHE, and its ORR half-wave potential was 0.83 VRHE. Significantly, the Fe/C/N catalyst provided a potential gap of 0.76 V between the OER potential (at 10 mA cm(2)) and the ORR half-wave potential; this is the highest activity reported to date for a non-precious-metal catalyst.

Herein, cost-effective and highly conductive few-layer ferric and nickel chloride co-intercalated graphite intercalation compounds (FeCl3-NiCl2-GIC) are designed as bifunctional oxygen catalysts for ZAB.

The theoretical analysis demonstrates the electron-rich state on the carbon layers of FeCl3-NiCl2-GIC during the catalytic process favors the kinetics of electron transfer and lowers the absorption energy barriers for intermediates. Impressively, the ZAB assembled with few-layer FeCl3-NiCl2-GIC catalyst displays a 160 h cycling stability and a high energy efficiency of 72.6%.

Here we have successfully designed and synthesised a binary metal oxide composite consisting of CoO and Fe3O4 phases with special CoO (111)/Fe3O4 (311) interface as bifunctional catalysts for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Co-Fe binary oxide composite showed the overpotential values of eta = 220 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) and eta = 290 mV at -100 mA cm(-2) for HER, and as for the OER performance the catalyst is more efficient than the benchmark catalyst Ir/C requiring the smaller overpotential of eta = 369 mV and 406 mV to deliver a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) and at 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. As a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting, the cell can achieve a current density of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) at cell potentials of 1.92 V and 2.05 V, respectively. In addition, the bifunctional electrode also shows long-term water electrolysis stability at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for 24 h.									32	1	0	0	0	0	32			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000537667800008

Their physicochemical and electro-catalytic properties towards O-2-evolution in alkaline solutions have been investigated using TGA/DTA, XRD, IR, SEM, cyclic voltammetry, impedance and Tafel polarization techniques. The X-ray diffraction indicated that samples calcined at 750 degrees C, exhibit a pure perovskite structure in the range 0 <= x <= 0.2. The FTIR spectra confirm the presence of metal oxygen bond of Fe-O in the FeO6 octahedra. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) show the agglomeration of the particles with different shapes. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) study on each oxide catalyst in 1 M KOH showed two Tafel slopes, (b(1) approximate to 60 mV/dec) and (b(2) approximate to 120 mV/dec) at low and high over-potentials respectively. The highest electrode activity performance is achieved with LaFe0.8Zn0.1Cu0.1O3 at 0.66 V. The EIS study was carried out to investigate the effect of the partial substitution of iron by zinc and copper in the oxide lattice, on the catalytic performance towards the OER and also on the oxide film/1 M KOH interface.

Pure IrO2 and Sn1-xIrxO2 combinatorial mixtures were prepared by a sol-gel route to form arrays of electrocatalyst spots. The experimental setup has been developed to optimize screening of electrocatalyst libraries under conditions where the entire array is capable of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The activity of individual spots was determined by reducing the interference from the reaction products of neighboring spots diffusing to the tip over the spot of interest. A gold layer deposited on the external wall of the SECM tip was used as a tip shield. In this study the shield was kept at a constant potential to reduce oxygen under mass transfer controlled conditions. The tip shield consumes oxygen coming from the neighbor spots in the array and enables the tip to correctly detect the activity of the spot below the tip. Simulations and experimental results are shown, demonstrating the effectiveness of the tip shield with the SG-TC setup in determining the properties of the composite materials and imaging arrays.									63	3	0	0	2	0	63			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000256327200025	18447323

Herein, nanostructured spinels LiMn2O4, delithiated lambda-MnO2, and Li4Mn5O12 have been synthesized at low temperatures and are investigated as electrocatalysts for alkaline water oxidation reactions. Among the nanostructured spinels, LiMn2O4, delithiated lambda-MnO2, and Li4Mn5O12, the former spinel which is classical LiMn2O4 with 1/6th of the Mn replaced by Li outperforms for the OER that shows a current density of 5 mA cm(-2) at a lowest overpotential of 430 mV and Tafel slope of 74 mV per decade. Electrochemical impedance studies revealed the least value of charge transfer resistance of the Li4Mn5O12 spinel and suggest fast reaction kinetics for the oxygen evolution reaction as compared to other spinels. The XPS and TEM of Li4Mn5O12, recorded after a 12-hour stability test for oxygen evolution activity, confirm that the oxidation state of Mn and the morphology of Li4Mn5O12 remain intact even after the electrocatalytic reaction, however, it undergoes amorphization. The higher activity of Li4Mn5O12 synthesized in the present work is attributed to the low temperature synthesis resulting in the formation of a nanostructured Li rich spinel with a high surface area, along with an increased percentage of ionic bonding and the presence of 3D Li diffusion channels. The role of Li was further supported by XPS studies that revealed a shift in Li 1s binding energy as well as quantitative reduction relative to Mn for Li4Mn5O12 after a long term test.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000835920900001	35920308

Air electrodes can be very lightweight and thin because the active material, oxygen, does not need to be stored inside the cell. However, air electrodes are restricted by poor reaction kinetics and low activity of many catalysts towards the oxygen evolution and reduction reactions. In addition, it is a challenge to maintain chemical and mechanical stability of the catalyst and supporting materials at oxidising currents under the strong alkaline conditions commonly used, and under gas evolution. This paper reports a novel bifunctional oxygen electrode with remarkable stability, able to perform at current densities up to 1,000 mA cm (2) and withstand 3,000 cycles continuously. The electrode is catalysed by a mixture of Pd/C and mixed nickel-iron hexocyanoferrate, which have high activities towards the ORR and OER reactions, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Heteroatom-doped carbon nanomaterials have been reported to be efficient metal-free electrocatalysts for ORR in fuel cells for energy conversion, as well as ORR and OER in metal-air batteries for energy storage. We reported that metal-free three-dimensional (3D) graphene nanoribbon networks (N-GRW) doped with nitrogen exhibited superb bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for both ORR and OER, with an excellent stability in alkaline electrolytes (for example, KOH). For the first time, it was experimentally demonstrated that the electron-donating quaternary N sites were responsible for ORR, whereas the electron-withdrawing pyridinic N moieties in N-GRW served as active sites for OER. The unique 3D nanoarchitecture provided a high density of the ORR and OER active sites and facilitated the electrolyte and electron transports. As a result, the as-prepared N-GRW holds great potential as a low-cost, highly efficient air cathode in rechargeable metal-air batteries. Rechargeable zinc-air batteries with the N-GRW air electrode in a two-electrode configuration exhibited an open-circuit voltage of 1.46 V, a specific capacity of 873 mAh g(-1), and a peak power density of 65 mW cm(-2), which could be continuously charged and discharged with an excellent cycling stability. Our work should open up new avenues for the development of various carbon-based metal-free bifunctional electrocatalysts of practical significance.									812	49	0	0	39	0	819			2375-2548			WOS:000380072100008	27152333

Urchin-like MnO2 nanorods were deposited on the carbon spheres by hydrothermal method and the thickness of alpha-MnO2 shell is about 700 similar to 800 nm. Pd particles with a diameter of around 8 similar to 15 nm are dispersed on the surface of vertically aligned alpha-MnO2 rods which have a diameter of 40 similar to 50 nm. Three-dimensional (3D) Pd-MnO2/CS shows better activity and stability than Pd/CS and MnO2/CS for anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis, which shows that Pd-doped urchin-like CS-MnO2 core-shell structure material would be a superiority catalyst for the OER. The onset potential shifts negatively and current density improves on the Pd-MnO2/CS for the OER, showing a synergistic effect between Pd and MnO2. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, highly efficient OER catalysts TMS@MOF-5 have been prepared by in-situ incorporation of pre-synthesized various transition metal sulfide (TMS = MnS, FeS, CoS, NiS, CuS and ZnS) nanoparticles into MOF-5. Structure, morphology and composition of prepared samples have been analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy, Elemental Mapping and Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy. OER activity of all these samples was determined by coating them on Ni-foam to form TMS@MOF-5/NF as working electrode through cyclic voltammetry. Among all the samples, NiS@MOF-5/NF exhibited excellent stability and OER catalytic activity as it required just 174 mV overpotential to achieve the 10mAcm(-2)current density, which is better than many other 3d transition metal based and Ni-based OER catalysts.

However, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen electrochemistry, a chronic issue, is holding them from commercialization. Herein, we address this issue through a molecular level design of a Graphene oxide anchored Metal Organic Molecular Assembly (G-MOMA) based catalyst. This non-precious metal catalyst consists of Ni and Fe ions ligated by graphene oxide supported terpyridine, a unique molecular assembly design that maximizes the utilization of active metal centers. This G-MOMA catalyst brings down an over potential (240 mV) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as close as that of the bench mark catalyst Ru/C with an impressive Tafel slope of 58 mV/dec and a cyclic stability of >30,000 cycles. G-MOMA excels in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) too with an onset at 0.88 V (vs RHE). The remarkably stable G-MOMA catalyst surprises with an excellent bi-functionality towards both OER and ORR with an overall potential difference of mere 0.77 V, which is 180 mV and 70 mV lesser than the standard Pt/C and Ru/C catalysts, respectively. The G-MOMA catalyst is well in the activity range of the state-of-art bi-functional catalysts and yet cheaper by many folds.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2452-2627			WOS:000703564100001

Herein, we successfully synthesized nickel-iron-cobalt diselenides on the nickel foam (NiFeCoSe2) by a one-step electrodeposition method. The as-prepared NiFeCoSe2 nanosheets on nickel foam (NF) exhibited significantly improved electrocatalytic performance and stability in a highly alkaline medium (1 M KOH) with and without 0.33 M urea. In particular, the obtained NiFeCoSe2 only requires a po-tential of 1.52 V (vs. RHE) for OER and 1.37 V (vs. RHE) for UOR to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm-2, along with a stability of 30 h. This was attributed to the unique interconnected nanosheets, binder-free in-situ selenium electrodeposition, synergistic effect, and strong electron interaction of Ni, Fe, Co, and Se elements. This study provides a new avenue for the construction of multimetal selenide electrocatalysts with excellent prop-erties for the oxidation of water and urea.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000812830100004

Over the past few years, great efforts have been made in the development of non-precious metal bifunctional catalysts. This review selectively evaluates the advantages, disadvantages and development status of recent advanced materials including pure carbon materials, carbon-based metal materials and carbon-free materials as bifunctional oxygen catalysts.

However, it shows extremely poor activity toward hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) due to the weak hydrogen adsorption. We demonstrated that the integration of Rh species and NiFe-LDH can dramatically improve its HER kinetics without sacrificing the OER performance. The Rh species were initially integrated into NiFe-LDH as oxidized dopants and metallic clusters (< 1 nm). In 1 M KOH electrolyte, an overpotential of 58 mV is needed to catalyze 10 mA cm(-2) HER current density. Furthermore, this catalyst only requires 1.46 V to drive an electrolyzer at 10 mA cm(-2). A strong interaction between metallic Rh clusters and NiFe hydroxide during the HER process is revealed. The theoretical calculation shows the Rh ions replace Fe ions as the major active sites that are responsible for OERs.									77	4	0	0	6	0	77			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000507151600019	31774999

Interestingly, the simple application of ultrasonication endowed the catalyst with a fascinating morphology comprising cloud-like IGnPs on NSC nanorods (NSC@IGnP). Benefiting from the unique morphological features, NSC@IGnP provides superior bifunctional activities toward both ORR and OER, remarkable cell performance, and exceptionally high stability for hybrid Li-air batteries.									49	3	0	0	3	0	49			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000369568700012

Meantime, its thermal kinetic parameters were calculated by Kissinger's and Ozawa's method. As observed by DSC/TG, two exothermic peaks at 239 and 313 degrees C in washed cathode (4.6 V), were attributed to two steps of oxygen evolution. More importantly, the temperature of its oxygen release processes decreased obviously compared with that charged to 2.8 V. Activation energy (E) for the first and second oxygen evolution, both of which were assumed closely to be the first order reaction, between 200 and 350 degrees C in Li0.204Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2-based electrode were calculated as 113.63 and 158.13 kJ.mol(-1), respectively and the corresponding Arrhenius pre-exponential factors (A) of 1.05x10(11) and 6.46x10(13) s(-1) were also obtained. The different energy barrier of such two steps of oxygen evolution should probably be ascribed to the different bond energy of M-O (M=Mn, Co, Ni).									57	9	0	0	2	0	64			1001-604X	1614-7065		WOS:000294779400004

Owing to their maximized utilization efficiency and excellent catalytic performance, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have obtained tremendous attention in the field of electrochemical energy conversion. In the last few years, graphene oxide (GO) has been considered to be a promising precursor for fabricating graphene-supported SACs due to its advantageous features such as large surface area, high density of intrinsic defects, and scalability. In this review, the recent advances in the preparation of graphene oxide-derived single-atom catalysts (GO-SACs) and their diverse electrochemical applications are summarized. Firstly, the synthetic strategies of GO-SACs are discussed with focuses on the advantages and shortages of each method. Subsequently, the electrochemical applications of GO-SACs in various energy conversion processes, including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), are discussed in detail. Finally, the remaining challenges and future prospects in the fabrication and application of GO-SACs are presented.

Such bifunctional catalysts are primarily harmed by either low catalytic activity or degradation during prolonged cycling. We devise a relatively low-temperature hydrothermal strategy for producing a perovskite oxide-based catalyst composed of potassium-substituted LaMnO3. In an alkaline environment, the catalyst performs admirably, with improved kinetics and activity for the ORR (half-wave potential of 0.78 V) and OER (potential at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is 1.66 V). Furthermore, as a two-electrode cell, this catalyst renders the potential for use as an electrode in zinc-air batteries with unprecedented stability (no visible sign of degradation even after 1000 cycles of charge-discharge).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000818898900001

In this work, highly monodisperse CoP and Co2P nanocrystals (NCs) are synthesized using a robust solution-phase method. The highly exposed (211) crystal plane and abundant surface phosphide atoms make the CoP NCs efficient catalysts toward ORR and HER, while metal-rich Co2P NCs show higher OER performance owing to easier formation of plentiful Co2P@COOH heterojunctions. Density functional theory calculation results indicate that the desorption of OH* from cobalt sites is the rate-limiting step for both CoP and Co2P in ORR and that the high content of phosphide can lower the reaction barrier. A water electrolyzer constructed with a CoP NC cathode and a Co2P NC anode can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.56 V, comparable even to the noble metal-based Pt/C and RuO2/C pair. Furthermore, the CoP NCs are employed as an air cathode in a primary zinc-air battery, exhibiting a high power density of 62 mW cm(-2) and good stability.									218	9	0	0	11	0	219			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000426491600027	29334145

Herein, we reported a low-cost and highly efficient OER catalyst, Fe-doped NiCoP nanosheet arrays in situ grown on nickel foam (NiCoFeP/NF), which was synthesized via a simple and mild hydrothermal and phosphorization method. In 1 M KOH solution, the as-prepared NiCoFeP/NF produces a larger current density of 200 mA.cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 271 mV and exhibits a low Tafel slope of 45 mV.dec(-1), which is superior to commercial RuO2. The outstanding OER performance of the as-prepared NiCoFeP/NF can be attributed to the synergetic effects among Fe, Ni, and Co elements, unique nanosheet arrays structure, and the great intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. On the basis of the above factors, the as-prepared NiCoFeP/NF may work as a promising OER electrocatalyst.									69	4	0	0	1	0	70			2574-0962			WOS:000458705100044

In the synthetic process, separate selenization and sulfurization on the Co(OH)F precursor in different solvents have played an important role in constructing CoSexS2-x (Co-Se-S) hierarchical nanotubes, which was further transformed into the nanotube-like Co-Se-S-O via an in situ electrochemical oxidation process. The Co-Se-S-O obtained by the Kirkendall effect through two stepwise anion exchange reactions represents the first quaternary Co-Se-S-O nanotube array, which dramatically enhances its surface area and conductivity. Further, it only requires low overpotentials of 230 and 480 mV to achieve a 10 mA cm(-2) current density. The OER performance of Co-Se-S-O is much more efficient than that of its monochalcogenide counterparts, as well as the commercial benchmark catalyst IrO2.									34	2	0	0	3	0	34			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000427204100078	29433305

Nonetheless, the near-surface structure of electrocatalysts during the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is still largely unknown, which hampers knowledge-driven optimization. Here using operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we provide quantitative near-surface structural insights into oxygen-evolving CoOx(OH)(y) nanoparticles by tracking their size-dependent catalytic activity down to 1 nm and their structural adaptation to OER conditions. We uncover a superior intrinsic OER activity of sub-5 nm nanoparticles and a size-dependent oxidation leading to a near-surface Co-O bond contraction during OER. We find that accumulation of oxidative charge within the surface Co3+O6 units triggers an electron redistribution and an oxyl radical as predominant surface-terminating motif. This contrasts the long-standing view of high-valent metal ions driving the OER, and thus, our advanced operando spectroscopy study provides much needed fundamental understanding of the oxygen-evolving near-surface chemistry.The near-surface structure of oxide electrocatalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction is key to performance but remains elusive. Here the authors use operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy to track the size-dependent catalytic activity of CoOx(OH)(y) nanoparticles down to 1 nm and their structural changes under reaction conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2058-7546			WOS:000837601000002

The synthesized MoS2 exhibits low overpotential of -0.06 V and 1.22 Vat 10 mA cm(-2) with small Tafel slope (33 and 62 mV dec(-1)) for HER and OER, respectively, which it is comparable to platinum (30 and 172 mV dec (-1)). The high HER and OER performance attributes to increased electrochemical active surface area by twice and reduced impedance by almost twice compared to precursor MoS2 which has no plasma treatment, indicating that the plasma treatment introduces catalytic active surface area, which is a key factor for the efficient HER and OER and provides a positive effect on HER and OER performance.

The vapor-solid growth process is proposed as a possible mechanism for the growth of the NiO nanostructures. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of the fabricated electrodes were examined employing electrochemical measurements in 1.0 M NaOH. Among the fabricated electrodes, the nanoleaf-like NiO electrocatalysts composed of ultra-small NiO nanoparticles were shortly exposed to an alkaline solution at a voltage of 50 V (anodization) prior to the thermal annealing and followed by the reduction in NaBH4 exhibited the best electrocatalytic performance towards OER compared to the electrodes synthesized in the absence of reduction and solely by thermal annealing. The NiO nanoleaves delivered a current density of 135 mA/cm2 at 1.6 V potential versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under alkaline conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000804435300012

Much research has been done to screen carbon-based catalysts for ORR or OER. Catalytic activity is not satisfactory to both sides, and the unclear catalytic mechanism greatly limits their wide application. Here, we describe a family of heteroatoms (Fe, N, and S)-codoped carbon foams with excellent electrocatalytic activity for both ORR and OER, giving an exceptional small overpotential of 0.688 V, superior to the case for commercial 20% Pt/C. Remarkably, the rechargeable Zn-air battery with the catalysts as the air cathode delivers an ultrahigh power density of 578 mW cm(-2), along with an excellent charge and discharge cycling stability beyond 250 h (1500 cycle), surpassing that of most bifunctional catalysts reported to date. More importantly, the perfect combination of experiments and DFT calculations confirms that the unique configuration of FeN4/S-N-Gra endows the heteroatoms-codoped carbon foams with excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability. The DFT-guided advantageous configurative heteroatoms-doped carbon foams as bifunctional catalysts for ORR and OER may provide guidance for the design of nonprecious metal catalysts in the practical application of Zn-air batteries.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2168-0485			WOS:000509432200002

However, due to the slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, competition of chlorine evolution reaction (ClER), and corrosion of chloride ions on the anode, the direct seawater splitting faces many challenges. Herein, we develop a perovskite@NiFe layered double hydroxide composite for anode catalyst based on Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (BSCF) and NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) heterostructure. The optimized BSCF@CeO2@NiFe exhibits excellent OER activity, with the potential at 100 mA cm(-2) (E-j =100) being 1.62 V in the alkaline natural seawater. Moreover, the electrolytic cell composed of BSCF@CeO2@NiFe anode shows an excellent stability, with negligible attenuation during the long-term overall seawater splitting with the remarkable self-recovery ability in the initial operation stage, and the direct seawater splitting potential increasing by about 30 mV at 10 mA cm(-2).

The electrochemical behaviour of these composite layers was examined in 0.1 M NaOH solution, both oxygen free and oxygen saturated, using rotating disc technique. In the potential region of oxygen reduction reaction, the Au/TiO2 layer obtained by potentiodynamic polarization, displayed the voltammetric curve similar to that observed on (10 0) plane of Au monocrystal.

Herein, spinel-structured NiCo2O4 nanosheet with oxygen defects and ultrathin structure was developed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR and OER. The ultrathin thickness of NiCo2O4 nanosheets provided numerous active sites, and the oxygen vacancies improved the reactivity of the catalyst, thus leading to appropriate catalytic performance (an onset potential of 0.85 V for ORR and an onset overpotential of 340 mV for OER). Furthermore, the ultrathin NiCo2O4 nanosheets also showed superior activity for rechargeable Zn-air battery with the power density of 102.08 mW cm(-2), which was comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst.

Herein, we synthesize the novel "three-in-one" catalyst that engineers core-shell Mott-Schottky Co9S8/Co heterostructure on the defective reduced graphene oxide (Co9S8/Co-rGO). The Co9S8/Co-rGO catalyst exhibits abundant Mott-Schottky heterogeneous-interfaces, the well-defined core-shell nanostructure as well as the defective carbon architecture, which provide the multiple guarantees for enhancing the electron transfer and ion/oxygen transport, thus boosting the catalytic ORR and OER activities in neutral electrolyte. As expected, the integrated core-shell Mott-Schottky Co9S8/Co-rGO catalyst delivers the most robust and efficient rechargeable ZABs performance in neutral solution electrolytes accompanied with a power density of 59.5 mW cm(-2) and superior cycling stability at 5 mA cm(-2) over 200 h. This work not only emphasizes the rational designing of the high-efficient bifunctional oxygen catalysts from the fundamental understanding of accelerating the electron transfer and ion/oxygen transport, but also sheds light on the practical application prospects in more friendly environmentally neutral rechargeable ZABs.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials provide great potential for high-performance electrocatalysts because of their high specific surface area, abundant active edges, and tunable electronic structure. Here, we report few-layer NiPS3 nanosheet-graphene composites for high-performance electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The pure NiPS3 nanosheets show an overpotential of 343 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is comparable to that for IrO2 and RuO2 catalysts. More importantly, the NiPS3 nanosheet-graphene composites show significantly improved OER activity due to the synergistic effect. The optimized composite shows a very low overpotential of 294 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), 351 mV for a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 42.6 mV dec(-1), and excellent stability. These overall performances are far better than those of the reported 2D materials and even better than those of many traditional materials even at a much lower mass loading of NiPS3.									73	4	0	0	4	0	74			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000436910200024	29901983

An eutectic reaction CuO+Ag=L1 (99at%Ag) at 1215 K and a monotectic reaction CuO+L1 (98at%Ag)=La (34.5at%Ag) at 1242 K were detected in air. TG experiments showed the weight loss at the monotectic temperature due to oxygen evolution. The oxygen content of L2 in air at 1242 K was an atomic ratio (O/Cu)=0.802 by the compositional dependency of oxygen loss. Under the oxygen partial pressure p(O2) of 0.01 atm, the mixture of Cu2O and Ag absorbed some amount of oxygen by the monotectic reaction at 1320 K. Based on the isobaric sections in Ag-CuO-Cu2O system at the various oxygen partial pressures, the liquidus was estimated.

However, it remains a challenge to directly use MOFs for oxygen electrocatalysis because it is quite difficult to manipulate their dimension, composition, and morphology of the MOFs with abundant active sites. Here, a facile ambient temperature synthesis of unique NiCoFe-based trimetallic MOF nanostructures with foam-like architecture is reported, which exhibit extraordinary oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity as directly used catalyst in alkaline condition. Specifically, the (Ni2Co1)(0.925)Fe-0.075-MOF-NF delivers a minimum overpotential of 257 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 41.3 mV dec(-1) and exhibits high durability after long-term testing. More importantly, the deciphering of the possible origination of the high activity is performed through the characterization of the intermediates during the OER process, where the electrochemically transformed metal hydroxides and oxyhydroxides are confirmed as the active species.									267	14	0	0	12	0	269			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000474087100028	30972836

However, due to the complexity of material synthesis and electrode construction, it still remains a challenge to achieve multifunctionality while maintaining high catalytic activity. In this work, inspired by the unique structure of submerged plants, three dimensional hierarchical electrodes were constructed via 3D printing and applied in water splitting devices and Zn-air batteries to emulate the photosynthesis and respiration, respectively. The fabricated electrodes possess surface single-Fe-atom-doped Ni/Ni(OH)2 and embedded Fedoped carbon nanotubes (Fe-CNTs), which contribute to water splitting and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), respectively. Benefiting from the hierarchical synergetic structure and appropriate location of active center, overpotentials of 175 mV and 108 mV were respectively achieved for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction to reach 30 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH solution, and corresponding overall water splitting required a low voltage of 1.51 V. In addition, the assembled Zn-air battery achieved a power density of 143.8 mW cm-2. Overall, the fabricated 3D electrodes presented remarkable potential for overall water splitting and Zn-air batteries, and this strategy also put forward a new avenue for designing and constructing high-performance trifunctional electrocatalyst electrodes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000810318600002

The electrochemical water splitting can be significantly and efficiently enhanced using bifunctional catalysts, which are active toward both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a stable and high-performance catalyst based on hybrid-metal/metal-hydroxide nanosheet arrays electroplated onto Cu-metallized cotton textile (Co(OH)(2)@Ni) was designed and fabricated as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for complete water-splitting reactions. It was found that the interconnected alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets were evenly formed onto the metalized cotton textile, and the optimized Co(OH)(2)@Ni sample exhibited an overpotential of +96 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), with excellent stability toward HER. The as-prepared catalyst also showed superior electrochemical activity and durability toward OER, which was found to be comparable to those of conventional precious group metal-based catalysts. In addition, when Co(OH)(2)@Ni were assembled as electrodes in a water electrolyzer (1 M KOH), a cell voltage of 1.640 V was achieved at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), enabling it to be a promising bifunctional catalyst for water electrolysis in real applications.									36	1	0	0	3	0	36			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000482546000030	31343158

The prepared N-MCF catalyst shows enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst. The N-MGF catalyst demonstrates lower oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential (324 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) than most of the previously reported carbon based materials, non-noble metal oxides and their hybrids, and comparable with noble metal oxides (ruthenium/iridium oxide, RuO2 and IrO2) catalysts. The prepared N-MGF catalysts also exhibit negligible mass transfer resistance, good durability and bifunctionality in ORR and OER. The significantly improved electrocatalytic performance results from their large surface area, ordered pores, excellent internal diffusion property, and superior intrinsic conductivity. The materials show great potential for various applications in energy conversion and storage, including fuel cells, electrolyzers and metal-air batteries.									127	7	0	0	4	0	129			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000390636100060

In this study, we reported the preparation of pure Ni nanoplates by using two-dimensional Ni-Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as the precursor. The Ni@Pt core shell nanoplates composites have been successfully prepared by partially replacing the Ni with Pt. Meanwhile, Ni/rGO composites can be prepared by combining Ni nanoplates with graphene oxide. The electrocatalytic activities of Ni@Pt core shell nanoplates and Ni/rGO composites toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media are investigated, revealing that Ni/rGO achieved a low overpotential of 0.33 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 68 mV dec(-1). Ni@Pt core-shell nanoplates exhibit a lower overpotential of 0.29 V (10 mA cm(-2)) and smaller Tafel slope of 52 mV dec(-1). Owing to the remarkable electrocatalytic properties, the obtained materials could be promising catalysts with low-cost and high catalytic performance.									33	2	0	0	1	0	33			2168-0485			WOS:000455288800037

Herein, we report unique Co4N nanoparticles loading on g-C3N4 nanotubes (Co4N@CNNT) bifunctional electrocatalyst for OER and ORR by an in-situ method. Highly dispersed Co4N nanoparticles as the active sites gather at the top of the g-C3N4 nanotube (CNNT), while the six-fold cavities from smooth CNNT with an outer diameter of 48 nm and an inner diameter of 22 nm act as anchor sites to preferentially coordinate with the active sites. Benefiting from the distinctive structure features, the intrinsic metallic Co4N@CNNT exhibits high electrocatalytic performances. Electrochemistry studies show that an onset potential of 0.94 V and a half-wave potential of 0.86 V of Co4N@CNNT are obtained that are superior to Pt/C catalyst. A low overpotential of 285 mV at an anodic current density of 10 mA cm-2 during the OER process is obtained that is superior to the IrO2 catalyst; and lower Tafel plot and good durability are also observed. Our findings provide a new strategy for the fabrication of an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for OER and ORR.									9	0	0	0	3	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000637698600002

Whereas, the universality of the deficient or excessive effects and their resulting improving mechanisms on ABO(3) perovskite are still ambiguous and need to be clarified. In this work, the simplest Mn-based perovskite (LaMnO3) is selected to elucidate the deficient/excessive effects and improving mechanisms on both ORR and OER. We find that A-site deficient stoichiometry is favor to the catalytic activity and stability of LaMnO3 toward both ORR and OER, whereas A-site excessive stoichiometry is deleterious to the oxygen catalytic activity and stability of LaMnO3. The high oxygen catalytic activity of La0.9MnO3 (La90) with A-site deficiency toward ORR and OER can be related to its proper Mn cation valence, large amount of oxygen vacancies, upper shift of d-band center and strong adsorption capacity to oxygenated species. The results of this work highlight the A-site deficient Mn-based perovskite as the high efficient and commercially viable bifunctional catalyst for aqueous and solid-state flexible zinc-air battery (ZAB) applications.

This study reports an in-situ phase composition modulation approach to fabricate boride/borate-based catalysts.Metal borides/borates have been considered promising as oxygen evolution reaction catalysts; however, to date, there is a dearth of evidence of long-term stability at practical current densities. Here we report a phase composition modulation approach to fabricate effective borides/borates-based catalysts. We find that metal borides in-situ formed metal borates are responsible for their high activity. This knowledge prompts us to synthesize NiFe-Boride, and to use it as a templating precursor to form an active NiFe-Borate catalyst. This boride-derived oxide catalyzes oxygen evolution with an overpotential of 167 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) in 1 M KOH electrolyte and requires a record-low overpotential of 460 mV to maintain water splitting performance for over 400 h at current density of 1 A/cm(2). We couple the catalyst with CO reduction in an alkaline membrane electrode assembly electrolyser, reporting stable C2H4 electrosynthesis at current density 200 mA/cm(2) for over 80 h.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12				2041-1723		WOS:000709050300006	34667176

Herein, we report the design of significant surface hydrophilicity based on cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) nanosheets to greatly improve the surface hydroxyl species adsorption and reaction kinetics at the Helmholtz double layer for high-efficiency water oxidation activity: The as-designed CoOOH-graphene nanosheets achieve a small surface water contact angle of similar to 23 degrees and a large double-layer capacitance (C-dl) of 8.44 mF/cm(2) and thus could evidently strengthen surface species adsorption and trigger electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under a quite low onset potential of 200 mV with an excellent Tafel slope of 32 mV/ dec. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and first-principles calculations demonstrate that the strong interface electron coupling between CoOOH and graphene extracts partial electrons from the active sties and increases the electron state density around the Fermi level and effectively promotes the surface intermediates formation for efficient OER.									41	1	0	0	0	0	41			1944-8244			WOS:000408178400024	28759715

Herein, we couple NiFe sulfide (NiFeS2) with S-doped graphene oxide (S-GO) via a simultaneous sulfurization strategy to significantly improve the OER and ORR activities. The NiFeS2/S-GO on glassy carbon yields an OER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.47 V and an ORR half-wave potential at 0.74 V (vs. RHE), giving an overvoltage difference as low as 0.73 V. When assembled in a rechargeable Zn-air battery, the battery with NiFeS2/S-GO air electrode exhibits a steady charging potential (1.98 V) with very little decay in discharging potential (from 1.20 to 1.17 V) for 180 charging-discharging cycles at 10 mA cm(-2). Our study provides new insights for the design of efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for high-performance energy conversion and storage devices.									30	0	0	0	0	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451600200063

Herein, we report a three-dimensional ordered macroporous titanium oxynitride (3DOM TiOxNy)-supported bifunctional catalyst, in which active N- and S-codoped carbon and ultrafine cobalt (Co-NSC) were embedded. The 3DOM structured TiOxNy support not only enhances the surface area and electrical conductivity of the catalyst, but it also ensures satisfactory structural stability and efficient mass transportation at the solid-gas-liquid three-phase interface during the oxygen electrocatalysis process. Experimental and density functional theory calculations revealed that the ORR performance was promoted by the Co-NSC sites in this 3DOM Co-NSC@TiOxNy electrocatalyst. In situ Raman spectroscopy revealed that during the OER reaction, there was a transition of Co metal into cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH), which is responsible for catalyzing the OER reaction. The 3DOM Co-NSC@TiOxNy catalyst exhibited impressive ORR activity, comparable with that of Pt/C, and satisfactory OER activity. The zinc-air battery delivered excellent performance with a power density of 123 mW cm(-2) and satisfactory cycling stability over 300 h at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This work highlights the importance of designing metal oxide-supported bifunctional catalysts for the development of efficient and stable electrochemical energy conversion devices.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000714701900001

Here, a bimetallic cobalt-nickel-based catalyst is introduced by metal loading over hydroxyapatite multiwalled carbon nanotube substrate (Co-Ni/HA-MWCNTs). The proposed catalyst is promising and inexpensive and could be favorably applied in water electrolyzing systems. The HA-MWCNTs substrate was produced via the solid-state approach and the loading of Ni and Co species was achieved via the simple impregnation process. Structural characterization of the catalyst was achieved using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Electrochemical efficiency of the catalyst for the OER was concluded from low onset potential at 1.50 V (vs RHE) with Tafel slope of 41.8 mV dec(-1). In comparison with the HA-free catalyst (Co-Ni/MWCNTs), the Co-Ni/HA-MWCNTs catalyst exhibits an excellent long-term stability up to 10,000 s to bear the current density of 10.0 mA cm(-2).Graphical									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000515006200011

Although the industrial production of these chemicals started over 100 years ago, there are still factors that limit the energy efficiencies of the processes. This review focuses on the unwanted production of oxygen gas, which decreases the charge yield by up to 5%. Understanding the factors that control the rate of oxygen production requires understanding of both chemical reactions occurring in the electrolyte, as well as surface reactions occurring on the anodes. The dominant anode material used in chlorate and chlor-alkali production is the dimensionally stable anode (DSA), Ti coated by a mixed oxide of RuO2 and TiO2. Although the selectivity for chlorine evolution on DSA is high, the fundamental reasons for this high selectivity are just now becoming elucidated. This review summarizes the research, since the early 1900s until today, concerning the selectivity between chlorine and oxygen evolution in chlorate and chlor-alkali production. It covers experimental as well as theoretical studies and highlights the relationships between process conditions, electrolyte composition, the material properties of the anode, and the selectivity for oxygen formation.									248	8	0	0	30	0	253			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000371947300005	26879761

Despite the low cost and large abundance, copper-based OER catalysts have been less frequently studied, mainly owing to the low electrical conductivity of copper oxides that results in large overpotential and sluggish kinetics for oxygen evolution. We report here the insitu fabrication of semi-metallic Cu3P nanorod arrays on commercial copper foam via a template approach; the resulting self-supported core-shell Cu-Cu3P/CuO electrode has the merits of high electrical conductivity, large active area, and short diffusion paths for electrolyte and evolved oxygen, exhibiting a low overpotential of 315mV and high durability over 50h at a current density of 10mAcm(-2) for OER in 1.0 M KOH. The remarkable OER performance reported here is not only superior to that of analogous Cu-CuO foam electrode, but also outperforms those of copper-based OER electrocatalysts in the literature.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2196-0216			WOS:000440546600003

Here, we develop a simple and cost-effective corrosion method to in situ fabricate the amorphous FeNi (oxy)hydroxides with an optimal Fe/Ni atomic ratio as highly efficient OER electrocatalysts. The corrosion process took place in a HCl solution at room temperature, which simultaneously changed the chemistry and morphology of the FeNi (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalysts. The as-fabricated amorphous FeNi (oxy)hydroxide nanosheets exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic performance in the alkaline OER process with a low overpotential of 231 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 62.9 mV dec(-1), and long-term (more than 60 h) durability, which is superior to most electrocatalysts reported and the commercial catalyst IrO2.

In this communication, we report the synthesis of cobalt boride incorporated within porous carbon using a metal-organic framework (MOF) as a precursor. The high catalytic activity of Co-B and the high conductivity of carbon both contribute to the OER catalytic activity of Co-B/C. When used as an OER catalyst, this material shows high catalytic activity, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 320 mV, as well as outstanding long-term electrochemical durability. This finding is of fundamental and practical importance as it not only extends the application of MOFs, but also introduces a new method for synthesizing highly efficient OER electrocatalysts.									61	4	0	0	1	0	62			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000419834400031

Carbon materials with good electrical conductivity and large surface area have been used as efficient electrocatalyst supports for a wide range of etectrocatalyses. Recently, it has been realized that carbons themselves are also promising nonmetal electrocatalysts. In this regard, the electrocatalytic activities of carbons can be tailored by surface modification or building in particular dopants/defects. In the accumulation of the profound knowledge of the electrocatalytic nature and the technological advances, there is increasing interest in developing carbon-based catalysts for various applications. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in the rational design and preparation of graphitic carbon-based materials for advanced electrocatalysis including oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction, to provide deep insights into the electrocatalysis for advanced energy conversion and storage.									64	8	0	0	0	0	66			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000378583200001

It is highly desired to develop high performance OER catalysts in near-neutral operating environments because of mild corrosion and pollution. This review summarized the recent development of heterogeneous catalysts containing transition metals (TM) for the OER at near-neutral pH. Specifically, we focus on some effective strategies to achieve a high OER performance for TM (e.g., Co, Mn, Ni, Cu, Fe, and binary TM)-based catalysts in near-neutral media.

The size (less than 3 nm) and distribution of Co clusters were controlled by a subsequent acid treatment. Because of the nanofluidic channels, efficient charge transfer, and enhanced light harvesting ability, optimized Co/g-C3N4 nanoarchitectonics by acid treatment revealed excellent photocatalytic activities. The visible-light photocatalytic H2 generation, H2O2 evolution and NO removal rate of the nanoarchitectonics were 82, 4, and 2 times of those of g-C3N4 nanosheets, respectively, suggesting that integrating transition metal clusters on g-C3N4 nanosheets is a novel strategy for NO removal and water splitting. Interestingly, Co/g-C3N4 nanoarchitectonics were further heat-treated at high temperature to create Co clusters decorated N-doped carbon nanosheets, in which ideal performance in hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline solution were observed. This result supplied an efficient route to construct non-noble metal multifunctional catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000874637000003

However, this method always suffers from complex and harsh preparative conditions, such as high pyrolysis temperature, protective gas environment, and long synthesis period. Herein, a laser engraving method is introduced for preparation of porous nitrogen-doped graphene layer-enclosed FeNi nanoparticles (FeNi/PNGs), starting with metal organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursors. All the steps were quickly achieved at room temperature and in air environment. Another attractive feature of this method is that FeNi/PNG supported on polyamide (PI) film could directly act as electrocatalytic electrode for hydrogen (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) without the involvement of dispersion and drop-casting of electrocatalyst ink. The FeNi/PNG shows overpotentials of 132 and 353 mV with Tafel slope of 94 and 80 mV dec(-1) for HER and OER catalyses, respectively.

For hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction, the NiMoSe/NF-2 exhibited an overpotential of 91 mV (10 mA cm(-2)) and 307 mV (100 mA cm(-2)) with the Tafel slope of 48.1 mV dec(-1) and 30.9 mV dec(-1), respectively, superior to NiMoSe/NF-1. Mean-while, much higher stability with 10 and 14 h tests was also respectively achieved for HER and OER. Using the NiMoSe/NF-2 as anode and cathode, the electrolyzer showed a long-time stability up to 14 h with the current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at the potential of 1.91 V for overall water splitting. The density functional theory calculation validates that the crystalline/amorphous hetero-phase structure remarkably reduces the Gibbs free energy difference for both HER/OER and the increased occupation densities of electronic states near Fermi level accelerated charge transfer rate during electrocatalytic process. The hydrogen and oxygen intermediates desorption are facilitated by the downshift of Ni d-band center. The proposed crystalline/amorphous hetero-phase structure is prospective for designing bifunctional catalysts for water splitting. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Nanostructural La0.5Ca0.5CoO3-delta particles, which are synthesized by a modified amorphous citrate precursor method in advance, are anchored homogeneously on the surface of reduced graphene oxide sheets through a simple chemical reduction process at ambient temperature. Although reduced graphene oxide or La0.5Ca0.5CoO3-delta alone possesses some catalytic activity, their hybrid presents a remarkable oxygen reduction catalytic activity, which is on a par with that of the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. This La0.5Ca0.5CoO3-delta/ reduced graphene oxide hybrid also exhibits outstanding activity for oxygen evolution reaction which surpassed that of IrO2, allowing it to become a highly active non-noble metal bi-catalyst for both oxygen reduction and evolution reaction. More importantly, the same hybrid displays extremely excellent catalytic durability and superior cycling stability to the commercial Pt/C + IrO2 catalyst in the rechargeable zinc-air batteries, becoming one of the most promising bi-catalysts with low-cost. The unexpected bifunctional catalytic activities and surprisingly cycling life arise from synergetic effects between La0.5Ca0.5CoO3-delta and graphene. The rechargeable Zn-air battery with the hybrid as catalyst delivered a large peak power density of 223.6 mW cm(-2) along with ultrastbale cyclability over 10,100 min at 5 mA cm(-2).

Iron-based OER catalysts are potential candidates due to their abundance but suffer from poor activity. Here we demonstrate that a single-atom iron catalyst with in-situ generated Fe4+ centers is highly active toward OER. Only an overpotential of 320 mV was needed to reach 10 mA cm(-2). The catalyst exhibited an ultrahigh turnover frequency of 0.62 s(-1) at an overpotential of 0.35 V, which is comparable to currently reported transitional-metal based OER catalysts. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the valence state of the metal center transferred from Fe3+ to highly active Fe4+ prior to the OER process. This transformation was originated from the strong interaction between atomic Fe and carbon support via C-O-Fe bonding, leading to a lower energy barrier of the rate-limiting *OOH formation.									17	2	0	0	0	0	17			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000662078500037	34018755

In this work, we report a mild, atmospheric pressure-based chemical method for the synthesis of NiFe-containing layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheet arrays on a carbon fiber cloth (CC). The obtained NiFe-LDH/CC composites with various Ni/Fe ratios show good performance for OER in alkaline aqueous solutions. Among them, the sample with a Ni/Fe ratio of 6:4 exhibits the best OER activity with overpotential values of only 226 mV in water and 238 mV in seawater at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which are much lower than those of the benchmarking RuO2 catalyst. The catalytic activity can be maintained for at least 450 h for OER in fresh water and 165 h in seawater at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

By in situ reduction of metal precursors, compositionally controlled three-dimensional NixFey nanofoams (NFs) are synthesized with high surface area and uniformly distributed bimetallic networks. The resultant ultrafine and highly disordered amorphous Ni2Fe1 NFs exhibit extraordinary electrocatalytic performance toward OER and overall water splitting in alkaline media. At a potential as low as 1.42 V (vs. RHE), Ni2Fe1 NFs can deliver a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and show negligible activity loss after 12 h stability test. Even at large current flux of 100 mA/cm(2), an ultralow overpotential of 0.27 V is achieved, which is about 0.18 V more negative than benchmark RuO2. Both ex-situ M.ssbauer spectroscopy and X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy reveal a phase separation and transformation for the Ni2Fe1 catalyst during OER process. The evolution of oxidation state and disordered structure of Ni2Fe1 might be a key to the high catalytic performance for OER.									90	3	0	0	5	0	91			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000419833900037

This work reports a facile and economically efficient method to convert spent cathode material, LiFePO4, into a high-performance NiFe oxy/hydroxide catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, Ni-LiFePO4 is synthesized via the wetness impregnation method and further evolves into defect-rich NiFe oxy/hydroxide nanosheets during the OER. The introduction of the Ni promoter together with in situ evolution strengthens the electronic interactions among the metal sites and creates an abundance of defects. Experimentally, the evolved Ni-LiFePO4 delivers a low overpotential of 285 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1), outperforming pristine LiFePO4 and is even superior to the benchmark catalyst RuO2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the introduction of Ni effectively activates Fe sites by optimizing the free energy of the *OOH intermediate and that the abundance of oxygen defects facilitates the oxygen desorption step, synergistically enhancing the OER performance of LiFePO4. As a green and versatile method, this is a new opportunity for the scalable fabrication of excellent electrocatalysts based on spent cathode materials.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000657589000001

Designing low cost, easily synthesizable catalysts with less overpotential and high intrinsic activity towards OER is of prime importance. The present work utilizes an organic macrocycle to decrease the overpotential for oxygen evolution reaction. The cobalt phthalocyanine polymer is synthesized via azo linkage by a diazotization method. The synthesized cobalt phthalocyanine is characterized by spectroscopic and analytical techniques. The cobalt phthalocyanine polymer-coated Ni foam is used as an OER catalyst that exhibits a lesser overpotential of 370 mV (+/- 2 mV) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Surprisingly, the mixing of synthesized cobalt phthalocyanine polymer with the benchmark catalyst IrO2 results in an excellent OER activity with a decrease in overpotential up to 304 mV (+/- 1 mV). To the best of our knowledge, it is the best value reported so far for organic macrocyclebased OER catalysts. In addition, at the current density of 50 mA cm(-2), the overpotential for OER at MPc-modified Ni electrode was 450 mV (+/- 2 mV). The performance of the macrocycle-modified electrode is comparable with some of the advanced OER catalysts reported previously.									28	0	0	0	3	0	28			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000510947000052

Our strategy involves a simple poly(vinylpyrolidone) (PVP) assisted hydrothermal route and subsequent thermal treatment to produce flowerlike CaCo2O4 nanostructures with a size of similar to 500 nm, which is constructed by some neighboring vertical nanoplates. Whereas, the absence of PVP results in the formation of CaCo2O4 microspheres, further indicating the vital role of PVP in favor of the oriented crystal growth of Co-based oxides. Benefited from the unique structural features, the resultant CaCo2O4 nanoflower presents excellent cycling stability (similar to 560 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 50 mA g(-1)) and remarkable rate capability. Apart from superior lithium storage properties, more strikingly, CaCo2O4 nanoflower demonstrates a promising candidate as a noble metal-free electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction, which will spur us to find more novel functional nanomaterials for wide applications.

In this study, a onepot synthesis of boron-doped carbon-enclosed Ni3Fe nanoparticles with bifunctional activity for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions is reported. The as-fabricated Ni3Fe@BC displays higher OER and HER electrochemical activities in an alkaline media, thereby suggesting a synergy between the Fe and Ni components. Ni3Fe@BC that was carbonized at 500 degrees C shows relatively small overpotentials of 280 mV and 0.33 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively. Chronoamperometric testing of the nanoparticles for both OER and HER activity revealed promising stability for 20 h. The catalytic performance of Ni3Fe@BC-500 degrees C is attributed to the doping outcome of boron (B) and the synergistically bonded metal ions of interest (Fe + Ni), which may have enhanced the catalytic sites. The one-pot fabrication from cheap component sources renders the as-fabricated Ni3Fe@BC highly promising for OER and HER electrocatalysis applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are ideal self-sacrificial templates, and their derived electrocatalysts are promising for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, Fe-based MOFs with well-aligned morphologies have been synthesized by elaborately tuning the competitive coordinated cations from diverse metal sources and solvent systems through a one-step solvothermal method. In this process, the competitive coordination with the metal sites between the ligands and the solvent molecules allows the feasibility to regulate the morphologies of these MOF precursors. After pyrolysis, the resulting Fe2O3 compounds not only inherit the morphologies of the precursors, but also expose different active lattice planes, producing disparate intrinsic active sites. Particularly, the concave octahedral (CO)-Fe2O3 with higher active facets and more accessible surface-active sites exhibits a superior electrocatalytic activity and stability for ORR, OER and HER compared with other morphologies and structures. This competitive coordination strategy paves an innovative and feasible pathway for morphology- and structure-controlled MOFs derivatives with tailored catalytic centers toward electrochemical energy storage and convention.									17	2	0	0	0	0	17			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000634237200002

In this work, we try to electronically tailor 3D nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) using alumina (Al), and obtain the flower-like structure with a high Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) surface area and abundant active sites, as a result, pure cobalt nanoparticles are easily confined. Physical characterizations confirm that this natural tuning of graphene by Al causes the increasing of surface defects, as a result, the physicochemical stability of Al and graphene is improved, and vice versa, consequently, the co-modification of Al and Co induce outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance including distinct onset potential, large diffusion limiting current density, kinetic current density and good stability, which are comparable with those of 20 wt% Pt/C in both alkaline and acidic media; in addition, the fabricated composite also delivers prior oxygen evolution reaction activity, superior to the benchmark RuO2.

However, the kinetic sluggishness of the oxygen redox reactions and heavy reliance on noble-metal-based electrocatalysts strongly limit the energy efficiency of the related devices. Developing high-performance noble-metal-free bifunctional ORR and OER electrocatalysts has gained worldwide attention, where much important progress has been made during the last decade. This review systematically addresses the design principles to obtain high-performance noble-metal-free bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts by emphasizing strategies of both intrinsic activity regulation and active site integration. A statistical analysis of the reported bifunctional electrocatalysts is further carried out to reveal the composition-performance relationship and guide further exploration of emerging candidates. Finally, perspectives for developing advanced bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts and aqueous rechargeable metal-air batteries are proposed.									108	6	0	0	1	0	109			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000652514400001	34017967

Nitromethane decomposes on the surface with 0.66 ML of O-occupying both twofold and quasi-threefold coordinated sites-below 300 K via dissociation of N-O bonds to form methylimido, CH3N(a). The oxygen is deposited on the surface populating terminal sites while the methylimido yields gas-phase HCN, H2O, and methyl radical between similar to550 and 800 K. In addition, some methylimido decomposes nonselectively to adsorbed N and C. The reaction on the 0.40 ML surface (containing only twofold coordinated oxygen) also affords HCN, H2O, .CH3, and adsorbed O, N, and C. The product distribution is different when the initial oxygen coverage is 0.4 ML-the amount of HCN and H2O is similar to10% greater, the yield of .CH3 is similar to10% less, and the amount of adsorbed C and O is substantially increased. In addition, the desorption temperature of the C-H bond scission products is similar to20 K lower on the 0.4 ML oxygen surface than on the saturated surface. The reactions on the chemisorbed oxygen overlayers are compared to those of CH3NO2 on a thin film oxide of Mo(1 1 0). The observed differences in reactivity as a function of oxygen coverage and as a function of the presence of subsurface oxygen are discussed in terms of surface preparations which favor either C-H bond scission or oxygenate evolution.

Herein, we report a facile solvothermal strategy to fabricate a binder-free electrode of Fe-S-NiMoO4/ MoO3 with nanorods array uniformly grown on a nickel-foam (NF). The Anderson-type polyoxometalate (NH4)3[FeMo6O24H6].7H2O as the precursor has enabled an accurate and controllable Fe-doping in transition metal oxides (TMO). The combination of experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Fe-doping is conductive to regulate the crystal plane of MoO3, modulate the electronic structure and improve the conductivity. Consequently, the Fe-S-NiMoO4/MoO3@NF electrode can yield 500 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of 271 mV and work steadily over 100 h under 50 degrees C that can meet the requirements of the industrial water electrolysis. This study provides a practical approach to design electrocatalysts for future industrial applications.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000696913200003

Herein we report a two-step strategy based on the use of a room-temperature- and atmospheric-pressure active iodine DBD plasma and an anion exchange reaction for the in situ generation of 3D Cu2S nanosheet arrays on Cu foam (Cu2S/CF). Owing to the advantages of this plasma-based approach, and the extremely rapid anion exchange reaction between the generated CuI and S2-, synthesis of the Cu2S/CF OER catalyst can be accomplished within 6 min. The porous 3D catalyst exhibited prominent electrocatalytic activity and persistent stability (>10 h) for OER with an overpotential of 336 mV to drive a geometrical current density of 20 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, comparable to the performance of a noble-metal IrO2/CF electrode.									101	3	0	0	2	0	102			2155-5435			WOS:000431727300016

Here, we develop an in situ semi-sacrificial template-assisted strategy to grow ultrathin BMOFNs on NiCo-LDH to construct non-noble metal electrocatalysts that are both active and stable. The optimized NiCo-LDH@MOFs heterostructure exhibits a superior electrocatalytic activity with accelerated electronic transfer and significantly enhanced durability of over 300 h. An advanced AFM-IR technology is introduced for the first time to investigate the formation of the 2D-2D heterogeneous structure in NiCo-LDH@MOFs, providing insights into the morphology-structure-composition evolution of the electrocatalyst at a nanoscale. This work demonstrates an in-situ growth strategy to achieve high-performance ultrathin MOF-based electrocatalysts, and provides advanced combinatorial characterization techniques to monitor the material growth process.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729148300002

Herein, we report a NiCo sulfide-NiCo oxide heterointerface (NCS-NCO) with a unique cellular network of porous nanosheets supported on functionalized graphite paper (FGP) with oxygen-containing functional groups. We use a simple electrochemical method to prepare the FGP support electrode, and regulate the content of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of FGP to determine the optimum morphology, and thereby improve the OER/HER dynamics for NCS-NCO/FGP. This innovative electrode exhibits extremely high electrocatalytic activity with an ultra-low potential of only 1.481 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting, even better than a RuO2/FGP||Pt/C/FGP electrode (1.583 V). The results demonstrate that metal cations (Ni and Co) can be quickly anchored, regulated, and grown on FGP. The optimum chemical composition allows the catalyst to have a unique cellular network with large numbers of active sites for fast mass transfer. Moreover, the close-contact heterointerface of NCS-NCO promotes the electron transfer among NCS, NCO, and FGP. This work provides a new method for constructing efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for overall water splitting for industrial applications.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000530288800028

As a promising family of electrocatalysts, many perovskite oxides have demonstrated remarkable activities for both OER and HER under various conditions. Here we report an alternative strategy to dramatically enhance the catalytic activity of La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.69Ni0.31O3-delta(LSCN) for overall water electrolysis by surface modification and interface engineering. Exsolution of discrete Ni2P nanoparticles from LSCN, induced by a partial reduction and subsequent phosphidization, creates a unique surface with LSCN/Ni2P interfaces, which enhanced the intrinsic OER activity by similar to 6.2 times and mass activity by similar to 10.2 times. The HER activity and durability are simultaneously enhanced as well. When used as the electrocatalyst in a symmetrical two-electrode water electrolyzer, a constant cell voltage of similar to 1.70 V (vs. Reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) is observed to sustain a water splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for a continuous operation of 14 h, achieving much better performance than a state-of-the-art Pt/C(-)//IrO2(+) electrolyzer. The bifunctional electrocatalyst has potential to be a cost-effective alternative to precious metal-based electrocatalysts in commercial water splitting systems. Further, the protocol developed in this work provides a new strategy to optimize bifunctional OER and HER activities of perovskite oxides, and broadens our horizons in rational design of heterogeneous electrocatalysts for other applications.

Herein, ultrathin Ni-Fe layered-double-hydroxides (LDH) with inherent oxygen vacancies (VO) are successfully fabricated via coprecipitation under a controlled manner, which accomplish a quite low overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH and perform among the best of recently reported nonprecious electrocatalysts. During the OER, inherent VO is experimentally and theoretically evidenced to boost surface reconstruction and the operando formation of p-n interfaces (i.e., gamma-Ni-Fe LDH/alpha-Ni-Fe LDH) via deprotonation. On such reconstructed interfaces, the VO in both surface gamma-Ni-Fe LDH and bulk alpha-Ni-Fe LDH can alter the electron densities of metal sites and subsequently optimize the free energies of a multistep OER pathway, which accounts for the boosted OER activity and, more importantly, identifies the correlation of electrocatalysis with both the catalyst surface and bulk.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2168-0485			WOS:000658365200022

The CER over the fully O-covered RuO2(110) surface, the stable surface configuration under CER conditions, is shown to proceed via the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism, i.e., the adsorption and discharge of the chloride ion are followed by the direct recombination of this surface species with a chloride ion from the electrolyte solution. The weak adsorption of the chloride ion on the fully O-covered RuO2(110) surface constitutes the elementary reaction step with highest Gibbs energy loss which has its origin in a too strong ruthenium-oxygen bond. Therefore, the activity of the model catalyst RuO2(110) can be enhanced by weakening the surface metal-oxygen bond such as realized with a monolayer of PtO2 coated on RuO2(110).									22	2	0	0	2	0	24			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000351309400005

Herein, a two-dimensional heterostructure of S/N co-doped carbon nanosheets decorated with ultrafine Ni3S2 quantum dots (Ni3S2-QDs/SNC) is designed and fabricated via a facile hydrothermal and high-temperature pyrolysis procedures. The heterostructure of Ni3S2-QDs/SNC is in situ formed from the Ni3S2 QDs without sulfidation. Meanwhile, the S/N co-doped carbon carrier dramatically enhances the electrical conductivity and creates more effective active sites for ORR and OER. As a result, the Ni3S2-QDs/SNC affords a half-wave potential of 0.864 V for ORR and an overpotential of 0.310 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, outperforming the benchmark of Pt/C and RuO2. Moreover, the assembled Zn-air battery with Ni3S2-QDs/ SNC air cathode exhibits a high power density (212 mW cm(-2)), energy density (962 Wh kg(Zn)(-1)), and satisfactory stability (more than 200 h), which are superior than those of Pt/C-based Zn-air battery. Density functional theory calculations further illustrate that the interfacial Ni site of Ni3S2-QDs/SNC exhibits enhanced capacities for both the ORR and OER. This approach provides a novel strategy for the exploration of high-performance bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for energy-related applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773543300001

However, Fe-and Ni-based catalysts corrode in alkaline solutions, which makes it unclear whether the catalytic surface components are the pristine catalysts or their transformation products. Further, corrosion limits the catalyst service life. An understanding of this corrosion process is essential to accurately assess the active catalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and to design novel catalysts. This paper reviews the corrosion of five types of monometallic Fe-and Ni-based OER catalysts: pure metals, oxides, (oxy)hydroxides, phosphides, and sulfides. A protocol for a rigorous corrosion characterization method is proposed to avoid misleading results during the design of novel catalysts. In light of the corrosion evolution of these catalysts, several key points are also suggested for consideration during the design of novel monometallic Fe-and Ni-based catalysts with high stability and electroconductivity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000696954300004

Herein, nickel iron oxyphosphide (NiFeOP) with an amorphous structure is constructed synchronously via a facile phosphidation treatment on NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoflakes. The incorporated P heteroatoms greatly alter the surface atom composition and configuration, thus resulting in an amorphous structure containing abundant defects and active states. Consequently, the as-obtained NiFeOP manifests prominent electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under the alkaline condition with a small Tafel slope (43.10 mV dec(-1)) and a low overpotential (310 mV) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, NiFeOP is also active for the hydrogen evolution reaction and therefore shows the enhanced full water splitting activity in comparison with pristine NiFe LDH. Operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and activation energy measurements demonstrate that amorphous NiFeOP undergoes fast charge-transfer kinetics and decreased activation energy, leading to superior OER activity. This study provides a novel strategy for the rational engineering of promising amorphous NiFebased electrocatalysts toward water electrolysis applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2168-0485			WOS:000675465900031

Herein, Fe2O3@CuO core-shell nanotube heterostructure in situ grown from copper foam (denoted as Fe2O3@CuO NTs/CF) was first synthesized as an efficient OER electrocatalyst. It has been demonstrated that the unique nanotube morphology provided large electrochemical surface area. Moreover, the electron transfer between Fe2O3 and CuO (electronic interaction) within the heterojunction tuned the electronic structure of Cu and Fe sites which not only improved the electron transfer efficiency but also changed the rate-determining step of OER compared with Fe2O3 or CuO, leading to an enhanced OER kinetics (Tafel slope of 41.07 mV dec(-1)). Benefiting from the structure engineering and electronic modulation, Fe2O3@CuO NTs/CF exhibits an improved activity with 398 mV overpotential at 100 mA cm(-2). This work supplies an efficient strategy for fabricating heterostructure catalyst with tubular morphology and modified electronic structure for OER and other electrochemical applications.									35	3	0	0	3	0	35			2574-0962			WOS:000510104700074

Electrodeposition of Ni on a glassy carbon electrode support has been carried out at constant potential and the charge of electrodeposited Ni controlled so as to investigate the effect of precursor Ni layer thickness on the electrocatalytic activity of the corresponding IrO2/Ir(Ni)/GC electrodes for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). After their preparation, these electrodes were characterized by microscopic (SEM) and spectroscopic (EDS, XPS) techniques, revealing the formation of Ir deposits on the Ni support and a thin IrO2 layer on their surfaces. To determine the electroactive surface area of the IrO2 coatings, cyclic voltammograms were recorded in the potential range between hydrogen and oxygen evolution and the charge under the anodic part of the curves, corresponding to Ir surface oxide formation, served as an indicator of the quantity of active IrO2 in the film. The electrocatalytic activity of the coatings for OER was investigated by current-potential curves under steady state conditions, revealing that the catalysts prepared from thinner Ni films exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic performance.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10				1420-3049		WOS:000472631000068	31159428

The composite nanofibers of polyacrylonitrile-cobalt acetate are firstly prepared by the electrostatic spinning and then immersed into 2-methylimidazole ethanol solution for the growth of restricted ZIF-67. The hybrid is further annealed and phosphided to obtain the ultra-small CoP nanoparticles incorporated into nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (CoP/NC). The degree of carbonization and retention of the nanoflber topology structure are determined by the annealing temperature. Excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis performance is observed on CoP/NC and the performance improvement can be attributed to the more active site exposure, good conductivity and co-action of CoP and N-doped carbon nanofiber. An overpotential of 290 mV is required to drive 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction, and an onset potential of 0.90 V and half-wave potential of 0.78 V are obtained for the oxygen reduction reaction in the alkaline electrolyte. A strong application in Zn-air battery is also demonstrated compared with the device configured by Pt/C catalyst. The current work demonstrates a significant technique to boost the catalytic performance of MOF derived catalysts for energy-relevant catalytic reactions.									53	4	0	0	6	0	53			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000521510900009

Herein, a Co-Fe layered double hydroxide (Co-Fe LDH) and a metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived cobalt phosphide (CoP) are combined to fabricate a catalyst without any binders on a conductive carbon cloth (CC) that has abundant surface area and flexibility. The prepared electrode is then applied to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH electrolyte and the overpotentials necessary to reach 10 mA/cm(2) are 172 and 270 mV, respectively. Moreover, the Tafel slopes are 39 and 79 mV(-1) for OER and HER, respectively, thereby outperforming Co-Fe LDH and CoP individually. The potential needed to reach 10 mA/cm(2) is 1.66 V in overall water splitting using the two-electrode configuration. Notably, the catalytic activity is not degraded even after 50 hours of operation. Characterizations demonstrate that the combination of Co-Fe LDH and CoP based on the catalyst and the strong coupling effect among the Co, Fe, and P active sites account for the excellent HER and OER performances. Our suggested in situ method represents a novel route for the preparation of hierarchical MOF-derived CoP@Co-Fe LDH (hierarchical CoP@Co-Fe LDH) composite on conductive CC-based high-performance electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000849542900001

However, the mechanisms of heterogeneous CO2 evolution during oxidation of aromatic carbon-based materials are not known in detail. Using density functional theory, a new oxidation mechanism of aromatic hydrocarbons with atomic oxygen was suggested to consist of four main steps, namely, (1) adsorption of oxygen atom, (2) insertion of O atom into the ring, (3) rearrangement to form a five-membered ring and four-membered ring lactone group, and (4) desorption of CO2, Using naphthoxy radical as a model system, the proposed reaction pathway can explain how some of the experimentally observed CO2 is formed.									28	0	0	0	3	1	29			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000268139400035	19569663

Herein, a ligand-assisted synthetic strategy to fabricate perovskite oxides LaCo1-xFexO3 with yolk-shell nanostructures is developed. Benefiting from the unique structural and compositional merits, LaCo0.75Fe0.25O3 exhibits an overpotential of 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability of 100 h for the oxygen evolution reaction. In situ Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that Fe substitution facilitates the pre-oxidation of Co sites and induces the surface reconstruction into active Co oxyhydroxides at a relatively lower applied potential, guaranteeing excellent catalytic performances. Density functional theory calculations unravel that the appropriate introduction of Fe into perovskite LaCoO3 leads to the improved electroactivity and durability of the catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Fe-3d orbitals show a pinning effect on Co-3d orbitals to maintain the stable valence state of Co sites at the low overpotential of the OER. Furthermore, Zn-air batteries (ZABs) assembled with LaCo0.75Fe0.25O3 display a high open circuit potential of 1.47 V, superior energy density of 905 Wh kg(-1) (Zn), and excellent stability in a large temperature range. This work supplies novel insights into the future developments of perovskite-based electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	3			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000805378800001	35618483

The structurally and electronically beneficial properties of the tetragonal CoSn2 exhibit a considerably low overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and Ni foam (NF). Loss of Sn from the crystal lattices and oxidation of Co under strongly alkaline conditions furnishes highly disordered amorphous active CoOx(H), the catalytically active structure for OER. The Co-0 atoms in the CoSn2 act as active sites for HER and the presence of Sn provides efficient electrical conductivity. This intermetallic phase is a novel type of cost-effective and competitive bifunctional electrocatalysts and predestinated for overall water-splitting devices: A two-electrode electrolyzer with CoSn2 on NF delivers a cell voltage of merely 1.55 V at 10 mAcm(-2) maintaining long-term stability.									77	2	0	0	4	0	77			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000452396800046	30248219

Herein, Ni rectangular nitrogen doped carbon nanorods@Fe-Co nanocubes (Ni-CNRs@Fe-Co cubes) were fabricated via a facile template-free method. This simple strategy not only realizes the structure tailoring, but also achieves high-quality nitrogen-doping. Specifically, nickel dimethylglyoxime [Ni(dmg)(2)] with rectangular rodlike structure was firstly synthesized by solution method, then metal-organic frameworks Fe-Co nanocube with different contents were loaded on rectangular carbon nanorods with polydopamine as the locating and the connecting agent, and finally NiCNRs@xFe-Co cubes were obtained by a one-step calcination. A series of electrochemical tests were researched on materials with different metal contents in the 1 M KOH solution. The Ni-CNRs@Fe-Co cubes show excellent electrocatalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). For HER and OER, the Tafel slopes were 83.3 mV dec(-1) and 71 mV dec(-1), the onset potential were-167 mV and 1.62 V, and reached the current densities of 10 mA cm(-2,) the overpotential just needed 196 mV and 433 mV, respectively. This novel synthetic strategy will provide a template-free way for cheap electrocatalysts of non-precious metal for OER and HER. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Biological slices confirm that Ru ions can penetrate the cell walls of saccharomycete, which facilitates the adsorption of Ru ions. Herein, based on a green synthesis process by saccharomycete cells as the carbon template and nitrogen/phosphorus (N/P) sources, novel Janus-like ruthenium-ruthenium phosphide nanoparticles embedded into a N/P dual-doped carbon matrix (Ru-Ru2P Phi NPC) electrocatalyst for HER are synthesized. Electrochemical tests reveal that Ru-Ru2P Phi NPC displays remarkable performance with a low overpotential of 42 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and demonstrates superior stability at a high current density in 0.5 m H2SO4. Furthermore, ruthenium oxide nanoparticles coated N/P dual-doped carbon (NPC@RuO2) are also synthesized with a yolk-shell structure using saccharomycete cells as the core template and RuO2 as a shell to isolate saccharomycete cells from the oxidation reaction during calcination in air. The NPC@RuO2 as oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst possesses a low overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Finally, the Ru-Ru2P Phi NPC is integrated as a cathode and NPC@RuO2 is integrated as an anode to construct a two-electrode electrolyzer to enable an excellent performance for overall water splitting with a cell voltage of 1.50 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 m H2SO4.									90	21	0	0	7	0	92			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000476566300022

However, the design still faces many challenges for practical use including the decomposition of cathodes, which are typically composed of carbon-based materials. In this study, a carbon-free and two-dimensional cathode structure based on silicene is first proposed for Li -O-2 batteries using density functional theory calculations. In contrast to graphene, oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) can occur on the pristine form of silicene without any defect sites. In addition, it was found that reactions on silicene strongly correlate with strong adsorptions of the ORR intermediates, which are caused not only by ionic bonding between the oxygen atoms in the ORR intermediates and silicene but also by the structural stabilization of silicene. Theoretical observations demonstrate the great potential of silicene as a carbon-free cathode structure for Li -O-2 batteries and provide further insights for designing a new cathode material architecture based on twO-dimensional structured materials.

Different mechanisms were applied to evaluate the oxygen reduction reaction performance of cobalt(II) oxide structures in terms of the Gibbs free energy and density of states. A variety of intermediate structures based on associative and dissociative mechanisms were constructed and optimized. As a result, we estimated the catalytic activity by calculating the free energy of the intermediates and constructing free energy diagrams, which suggested that the oxygen reduction reaction Gibbs free energy on cobalt(II) oxide (111) and (100) surfaces based on the associative mechanism is smaller than that based on the dissociative mechanism, demonstrating that the associative mechanism should be more likely to be the oxygen reduction reaction pathway. Moreover, the theoretical oxygen reduction reaction activity on the cobalt(II) oxide (111) surface was found to be higher than that on the cobalt(II) oxide (100) surface. These results shed light on the rational design of high-performance cobalt(II) oxide oxygen reduction reaction catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1468-6783	1471-406X		WOS:000478961100003

In this article, both gamma-MnS and alpha-MnS are successfully synthesized and their performance is comparatively investigated when employed as cathode catalyst of Li-O-2 batteries. It reveals that both MnS materials are capable of catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction as well as oxygen evolution reaction, but alpha-MnS demonstrates higher activity and better reversibility. The batteries fabricated with alpha-MnS deliver higher discharge capacity, lower charge voltage, improved high-rate discharge ability and superior cycling performance. These results are discussed and analyzed with help of various physicochemical techniques and compared with the performance of other reported TMSs and a widely studied oxide counterpart (MnO2) of MnS.

Ni-based compounds have received attention as the most promising earth-abundant electrocatalysts for OER and UOR, whereas some compounds in this main group, e.g., nickel selenides and tellurides, have received little attention. Herein, we demonstrate the interfacial engineered Ni0.85Se/NiTe array on Ni foam as a highly efficient catalyst for the OER, which exhibits an overpotential of 200 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solutions. Meanwhile, it exhibits a low potential of 1.301 V for the UOR at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). In particular, it even has the potential to be used in methanol oxidation reaction and ethanol oxidation reaction. The vertical NiTe array not only serves as the conductive substrate for highly improving the mass loading of Ni0.85Se, but also triggers the strong electron interaction between two components, leading to increased adsorption sites available for the intermediates formed in the OER and UOR on the Ni0.85Se surface. This study provides a broad avenue to construct hierarchical nanostructures as outstanding electrocatalysts for efficient OER and UOR. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Hydrogen is an ideal energy material for the future, and water splitting using solar/electrical energy is one way to generate hydrogen. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous materials with unique properties that have received rapidly growing attention in recent years for applications in water splitting due to their remarkable design flexibility, ultra-large surface-to-volume ratios and tunable pore channels. This review focuses on recent progress in the application of MOFs in electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen generation, including both oxygen and hydrogen evolution. It starts with the fundamentals of electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting and the related factors to determine the catalytic activity. The recent progress in the exploitation of MOFs for water splitting is then summarized, and strategies for designing MOF-based catalysts for electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting are presented. Finally, major challenges in the field of water splitting are highlighted, and some perspectives of MOF-based catalysts for water splitting are proposed.									444	24	0	0	24	0	448				2198-3844		WOS:000399725700003	28435777

Herein, a monometallic NiO-Ni3S2 heteronanosheets supported on Ni foam are rationally constructed as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. On account of the unique electronic property of the abundant interface and its 3D interconnected integration structure, NiO-Ni3S2 heteronanosheets exhibit high electrocatalytic activity toward both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Utilizing NiO-Ni3S2/NF as both the anode and the cathode for overall water splitting, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is achieved at a cell voltage of as low as 1.57 V with excellent stability, exceeding that of the integrated performance of Pt/C and RuO2. DFT calculations further reveal that key role of the established interfaces between Ni3S2 and NiO in modulating the chemisorption of hydrogen and oxygen containing intermediates, and consequently improving the overall electrochemical water-splitting activity.

However, their electrocatalytic efficiency is still insufficient mainly due to their poor electrical conductivity and slow reaction kinetics. Herein, a non-Pt electrocatalyst AgNi0.8Co0.2O2 with a delafossite structure is facilely constructed via a cation-exchange strategy for the methanol oxidation reaction in alkaline media. The introduction of Co atoms is favorable to crystallization for boosting the synthesis procedure. Meanwhile, the uniform distribution of Co and Ni in the structure brings about additional oxygen vacancies in the materials, thereby improving the intrinsic methanol oxidation reaction activity of the catalysts, and the introduced Co atoms can help to oxidize intermediates such as formaldehyde. Therefore, the electrocatalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance (77.6 mA cm-2, 220 mA mg-1) and high selectivity, and it can effectively inhibit the oxygen evolution reaction (310 mV difference from the oxygen evolution reaction potential at 10 mA cm-2). This work not only provides a material system using cheap and effective non-Pt catalysts based on Ag-based delafossite oxides but also sheds light on the engineering of oxygen vacancies of electrocatalysts for developing highperformance direct methanol fuel cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000866369200001

The microstructure of the heterointerface could be adjusted by changing the molar ratio of S/P. Electrochemical investigation revealed that the disordered structures at the heterointerface could influence the catalytic behavior of active sites. Rationally engineering the disordered structure could improve the electrocatalytic activity for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER/HER).

Here we report an effective boronization strategy for the value-added transformation of inexpensive, commercially available metal sheets (Ni, Co, Fe, NiFe alloys and steel sheets) into highly active and stable, corrosion resistant oxygen evolution electrodes. The boronized metal sheets exhibit OER activities that are an order of magnitude higher than those of the corresponding metal sheets, and show significantly improved catalytic stability and corrosion resistance in the operating environment. The in situ formed, ultrathin (2-5 nm), metaborate-containing oxyhydroxide thin films on metal boride surfaces are identified as a self-functionalized, highly active catalytic phase for the OER. In particular, a boronized NiFe alloy sheet is demonstrated to exhibit intrinsic catalytic activity higher than those of the state-of-the-art materials in 1 M KOH, while retaining such catalytic activity for over 3000 hours. Additionally, the boronized NiFe alloy and steel sheets are also demonstrated to have good catalytic activity as well as excellent catalytic stability and corrosion resistance in 30% KOH solution, a widely-adopted electrolyte in commercial water-alkali electrolyzers.									120	13	0	0	3	0	123			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000459741700017

Here we report for the first time the application of two-dimensional (2D) oxygen terminated BiXenes as a new family of electrocatalysts for the HER in terms of the following electrochemical descriptors: Gibbs free energy of H adsorption (Delta G(H)), exchange current density and the required potential to achieve a 10 mA/cm(2) current density (polarization curve). The results reveal that oxygen terminated BiXenes have a high density of catalytically active sites, excellent electric conductivity, and maintain a high HER activity over a wide range of hydrogen coverages. Among these systems, Mo2CO2 are identified as exceptional HER catalyst in virtue of the comparable overpotential (107 mV) to that of Pt (58 mV). Most importantly, on the basis of a concept of "electron donation", depositing single transition metals (TM) on the surface of oxygen-terminated BiXenes to form single atom catalysts (SACs) and strain engineering, both of which are demonstrated to efficiently weaken the H bonding strength, are promising routes to enhance the HER activity of oxygen-terminated BiXenes. Our work is the first report of oxygen-terminated BiXenes, offering cost-effective alternatives to traditional Pt-based catalysts for advancing sustainable hydrogen evolution. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Nickel-molybdenum (NiMo) electrodes are among the best performing non-noble metal-based electrodes for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline media (alkaline HER). Albeit exhibiting stable performance in electrolysis at a constant power supply (i.e., constant electrolysis), NiMo electrodes suffer from performance degradation in electrolysis at an intermittent power supply (i.e., intermittent electrolysis), which is emblematic of electrolysis powered directly by renewable energy (such as wind and solar power sources). Here we reveal that NiMo electrodes were oxidized by dissolved oxygen during power interruption, leading to vanishing of metallic Ni active sites and loss of conductivity in MoOx substrate. Based on the understanding of the degradation mechanism, chromium (Cr) coating was successfully applied as a protective layer to inhibit oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and significantly enhance the stability of NiMo electrodes in intermittent electrolysis. Further, combining experimental and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we demonstrate that the Cr coating served as a physical barrier inhibiting diffusion of oxygen, while still allowing other species to pass through. Our work offers insights into electrode behavior in intermittent electrolysis, as well as provides Cr coating as a valid method and corresponding deep understanding of the factors for stability enhancement, paving the way for the successful application of lab-scale electrodes in industrial electrolysis powered directly by renewable energy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000849832900001	36036714

Herein, we firstly embed NiFe LDHs quantum dots (QDs) into expanded graphite (NiFe LDHs/EG) via in-situ confined formation process. The interlayer spacing of EG layers acts as nanoreactors for spatially confined formation of NiFe LDHs QDs. The QDs supply huge catalytic sites for OER. The in-situ decoration endows the strong affinity between QDs with EG, thus inducing fast charge transfer. Based on the aforementioned benefits, the designed catalyst exhibits outstanding OER properties, in terms of small overpotential (220 mV required to generate 10 mA cm(-2)), low Tafel slope, and good durable stability, making it a promising candidate for inexpensive OER catalyst.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000431387500024

Photosynthesis arose early in Earth's history, and the earliest forms of photosynthetic life were almost certainly anoxygenic (non-oxygen evolving). The invention of oxygenic photosynthesis and the subsequent rise of atmospheric oxygen approximately 2.4 billion years ago revolutionized the energetic and enzymatic fundamentals of life. The repercussions of this revolution are manifested in novel biosynthetic pathways of photosynthetic cofactors and the modification of electron carriers, pigments, and existing and alternative modes of photosynthetic carbon fixation. The evolutionary history of photosynthetic organisms is further complicated by lateral gene transfer that involved photosynthetic components as well as by endosymbiotic events. An expanding wealth of genetic information, together with biochemical, biophysical, and physiological data, reveals a mosaic of photosynthetic features. In combination, these data provide an increasingly robust framework to formulate and evaluate hypotheses concerning the origin and evolution of photosynthesis.									407	10	4	0	307	0	421			1543-5008	1545-2123	978-0-8243-0662-5	WOS:000292009300021	21438681

Here, we demonstrate a novel multifunctional electrocatalyst constructed by pyrolysis of the complex of polyaniline (PANI) and metal organic framework [Co-based MOF; zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67)]. The resultant PANI/ZIF-67 complex unveiled excellent electrocatalytic activities towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline medium. It was found that the catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 complex towards ORR, OER and HER could be tuned by simple changing the weight ratio of PANI to the MOF. Further, we tested the material as an air electrode for a primary zinc-air battery, demonstrating an open-circuit potential of 1.42 V and a peak power density of similar to 45 mW cm(-2) both are superior to those of its counterpart of the Pt/C air-electrode. The excellent multifunctional catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 are mainly attributed to the synergistic combination of cobalt nanoparticles, Co3O4, and nitrogen doped carbon from the PANI/ZIF-67 complex after pyrolysis.									125	8	0	0	7	0	126			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000425396400016

In the present work, we have systematically investigated the photochemical performance of the 2D beta-antimonene (beta-Sb) monolayer. From density functional theory investigations, beta-Sb with single-atom doping possesses a trifunctional photocatalyst with high energetics and thermal stabilities. In particular, it is predicted that the performance of the HER activity of beta-Sb will be superior to most of the 2D materials. Specifically, beta-Sb with single atom replacement has even superior that the reference catalysts IrO2(110) and Pt(111) with relatively low overpotential values for ORR and OER mechanisms. The superior catalytic performance of beta-Sb has been described by its electronic structures, charge transfer mechanism, and suitable valence and conduction band edge positions versus normal hydrogen electrode. Meanwhile, the low overpotential of multifunctional photocatalysts of the Bi@beta-Sb monolayer makes them show a remarkable performance in overall water splitting (0.06 V for HER, 0.25 V for OER, and 0.31 V for ORR). In general, the Bi@beta-Sb monolayer may be an excellent trifunctional catalyst that exhibits high activity toward all electrode reactions of hydrogen and oxygen.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000751894800044	34783528

The current systems use extremely expensive iridium oxide catalysts. Identifying Ir-free or less-Ir containing catalysts has been suggested as the goal, but no systematic strategy to discover such catalysts has been reported. In this work, we perform first-principles-based high-throughput catalyst screening to discover OER-active and acid-stable catalysts focusing on equimolar bimetallic oxides with space groups derived from those of IrOx. We develop an approach to evaluate acid-stability under the reaction condition by utilizing the Materials Project database and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. For acid-stable materials, we further investigate their OER catalytic activities and identify promising OER catalysts that satisfy all the desired properties: Co-Ir, Fe-Ir, and Mo-Ir bimetallic oxides.

Besides the need of a high quality homogenous catalyst thin film, a good electrode wettability with aqueous electrolytes is highly desired for reliable activity evaluation of electrocatalysts yet experimentally remains a non-trivial task, showing the feasible formation of visible or invisible bubbles at the electrode-electrolyte interface. In this work, we report a robust and facile approach to eliminate these bubbles and thus improve the wettability of thin-filmed catalyst electrodes. This was achieved by triggering oxygen reduction at the catalyst-electrolyte-bubble triple phase boundaries at a constant reductive potential for a while, leading to oxygen depletion in the bubbles and thereby vanishing the bubbles. We also show that, insufficient wettability of catalyst electrodes due to visible or even invisible bubbles can lead to under-estimated activity for oxygen evolution reaction as well as inaccurate oxygen reduction reaction measurement. Once eliminating these bubbles at constant reductive potentials, the RDE tests can be repeatable and more reliable for activity assessment of electrocatalysts. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

The decoupled electrolysis system exhibits high efficiency and good stability for multiple oxygen and hydrogen evolution cycles, and the O-2 and H-2 evolution proceeds in the near-stoichiometric ratio (1:2) at separate times. IR, P-31 NMR, and MS results further reveal that phosphomolybdic acid has excellent reversibility for alkaline water electrolysis. Moreover, phosphomolybdic acid can display a notable 6e-redox activity, which helps improve the energy and capacity density of the present system.

Here, Ni-Mo nanostars were created by electrochemical deposition process at different morphologies and their electrocatalytic behavior was studied for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in 1.0 M KOH solution. Increased electrochemically active surface area due to the nanostars formation, improved intrinsic electrocatalytic activity, increased surface wettability, as well as being binder-free during electrode production, resulted in excellent electrocatalytic behavior. For optimized condition, 60 mV and 225 mV overpotential are needed for generating the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2 )in HER and OER process respectively in the alkaline medium. The lower slope of the electrode compared to the other electrodes also indicated that the kinetics of HER on the surface of the electrode was better. Also, there was very little change in the potential during the stability test, indicating the excellent electrocatalytic stability of the synthesized electrode. The present study introduces a rational, cost-effective and binder-free method for the synthesis of high performance electrocatalysts. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, low conductivity and limited active sites on the surfaces hinder the practical applications of NiCo2O4 in water splitting. Herein, small sized NiCo2O4 nanoparticles rich in oxygen vacancies were prepared by a simple salt-assisted method. Under the assistance of KCl, the formed NiCo2O4 nanoparticles have abundant oxygen vacancies, which can increase surface active sites and improve charge transfer efficiency. In addition, KCl can effectively limit the growth of NiCo2O4, and thus reduces its size. In comparison with NiCo2O4 without the assistance of KCl, both the richer oxygen vacancies and the reduced nanoparticle sizes are favorable for the optimal NiCo2O4-2KCl to expose more active sites and increase electrochemical active surface area. As a result, it needs only the overpotentials of 129 and 304 mV to drive hydrogen and oxygen evolution at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, respectively. When NiCo2O4-2KCl is applied in a symmetrical water splitting cell, a voltage of similar to 1.66 V is only required to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This work shows that the salt-assisted method is an efficient method of developing highly active catalysts toward water splitting to hydrogen.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-2646			WOS:000862313300001	36186598

Herein, we demonstrate the combination of interfacial manipulation with nanoarchitectonics by elaborately designing Janus-structured NiS/NiO nanoparticles in-situ encapsulated within N-doped carbon nanotube "branches"/nanofiber "trunk"-typed superstructures (abbreviated as NiS/NiO@N-C NT/NFs hereafter) to effectively regulate the electronic configuration for expediating the OER process. The simultaneous realization of interfacial engineering and nanoarchitectonics renders the resultant NiS/NiO@N-C NT/NFs with optimized electronic configuration, increased oxygen vacancies, promoted mass diffusion channels and remarkable structural robustness. Therefore, the NiS/NiO@N-C NT/NFs exhibit outstanding OER activity with a small overpotential of 269 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and impressive long-term stability in alkaline electrolyte, representing an economical and competetive electrocatalyst for a number of sustainable energy devices. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations further validate that the formation of NiS/NiO heterojunction effectively tailors the chemisorption energies of the oxygen-related intermediates and reduces the reaction barrier, drastically accelating the OER kinetics. These findings demonstrating the significance of interface manipulation and hybridization with nanocarbon may offer a novel perspective for rational design of high-performance electrocatalysts towards the energy storage and conversion.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000724701100001

Our STM observations show that the reconstructed Cu(110)-c(6 x 2)-O surface undergoes a phase transition to the (2 x 1)-O reconstruction in the course of oxygen loss induced by the reaction with H-2 gas. Using DFT modeling, we find that the surface phase transition is initiated via the adsorption of molecular hydrogen on the chemisorbed oxygen, which results in the formation of H2O molecules that desorb spontaneously from the surface. The loss of chemisorbed oxygen induces the c(6 x 2) -> (2 x 1) transition that involves the diffusion of Cu-O-Cu chains along the <(1) over bar 10 > direction.

Here, by rational design of the electrochemical process, we were able to identify the crucial role of cations in determining the electrochemical activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The intentional addition of Fe cations leads to an increase in current density as much as 49.1% at applied potential of 2.2 V (vs RHE), while a decrease of 6.9% were observed in the presence of Cu cations. By following the valence state of surface Ni, we present direct evidence that the enhanced electrochemical activity originating from the addition of cations is independent of oxidation potential of surface Ni. Further investigation suggests that the cations additions mainly affect the charge and electrically active species transfer on the interface of electrocatalysts and electrolyte, thus contributing the variation in reaction paths and the activation of the typical less accessible sites. With the assistant of the trace Fe cations (smaller than 4 x 10(-5) mol/L), the similar OER activity can be achieved even using 50% concentration of original electrolyte. The present study provides insight into cations effect and can serve as guidance for advanced energy-related device design.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773002700005

Nevertheless, replacing sluggish oxygen evolution by ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR), urea oxidation reaction (UOR), hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR)) of low theoretical potential is an energy-saving approach. In this paper, a new bifunctional catalyst of N doped NiZnCu-layered double hydroxides with reduced graphene oxide on nickel foam (N-NiZnCu LDH/rGO) is synthesized. To validate its electrochemical performance and stability, a two-electrode electrolyzer is constructed (N-NiZnCu LDH/rGO parallel to N-NiZnCu LDH/rGO). Experiments show that at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the voltages of AOR, UOR, and HzOR are 0.489 V, 1.305 V, and 0.010 V with a high stability (over 3000 CV cycles), which are much better than those of Pt/C parallel to IrO2. This study demonstrates N-NiZnCu LDH/rGO can replace precious metals for commercial hydrogen energy production in the hybrid-water electrolysis, and can be employed for treatment of industrial wastewater.									39	0	0	0	2	0	38			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000523641800028

However, the instability of both electrolyte and carbon-based oxygen electrode related to the nucleophilic attack of reduced oxygen species during oxygen reduction reaction and the electrochemical oxidation during oxygen evolution reaction are recognized as the major challenges in this field. Here we report the application of boron carbide (B4C) as the non-carbon based oxygen electrode material for aprotic Li-O-2 batteries. B4C has high resistance to chemical attack, good conductivity, excellent catalytic activity and low density that are suitable for battery applications. The electrochemical activity and chemical stability of B4C are systematically investigated in an aprotic electrolyte. Li-O-2 cells using B4C-based air electrodes exhibit better cycling stability than those using carbon nanotube-and titanium carbide-based air electrodes in the electrolyte of 1 M lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate in tetraglyme. The performance degradation of B4C-based electrode is mainly due to the loss of active sites on B4C electrode during cycles as identified by the structure and composition characterizations. These results clearly demonstrate that B4C is a very promising alternative oxygen electrode material for aprotic Li-O-2 batteries. It can also be used as a standard electrode to investigate the stability of electrolytes.									54	3	0	0	2	0	54			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000397314200021

Here, we synthesized cobalt pyrophosphate (Co2P2O7) nanosheets with different thickness by a simple and efficient one-step hydrothermal process. The catalytic performance of the obtained Co2P2O7 was investigated via diverse electrochemical measurement. Due to the unique 2D structure and the flexible coordination of pyrophosphate group, the as-prepared Co2P2O7 catalyst had excellent electrocatalytic performance and good stability, which could rank among the most active nonprecious metal catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction. In addition, the ultrathin Co2P2O7 nanosheets exhibited good performance as the air cathode catalyst for zinc air batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We revise He-burning stellar models, with particular attention to core convection and to its connection with the nuclear reactions powering energy generation and chemical evolution. Theoretical results are compared to the available measurements for the variable white dwarf GD 358, which indicate a rather large abundance of central oxygen (Metcalfe and coworkers). We show that the attempt to constrain the relevant nuclear reaction rate by means of the white dwarf composition is faced with a large degree of uncertainty related to evaluating the efficiency of convection-induced mixing. By combining the uncertainty of the convection theory with the error on the relevant reaction rate, we derive that the present theoretical prediction for the central oxygen mass fraction in white dwarfs varies between 0.3 and 0.9. Unlike previous claims, we find that models taking into account semiconvection and a moderate C-12(alpha,gamma)O-16 reaction rate are able to account for a high central oxygen abundance. The rate of the C-12(alpha,gamma)O-16 used in these models agrees with the one recently obtained in laboratory experiments by Kunz and coworkers. On the other hand, when semiconvection is inhibited, as in the case of classical models (bare Schwarzschild criterion) or in models with mechanical overshoot, an extremely high rate of the C-12(alpha,gamma)O-16 reaction is needed to account for a large oxygen production. Finally, we show that the apparent discrepancy between our result and those reported in previous studies depends on the method used to avoid the convective runaways (the so-called breathing pulses) that are usually encountered in modeling late stage of core He-burning phase.									113	1	0	0	1	0	113			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000180636300034

Nevertheless, the over-doping of S and the agglomeration of active sites still hinder the improvement of the performance of these catalysts. The S/O ratio regulation can optimize the electronic structure effectively so as to improve the OER performance of the catalysts, but few studies have focused on this study. Here, we find a facile room-temperature method to synthesize the unique 3D ultra-thin FeNiOS nanosheets with an adjustable S/O ratio for OER. The FeNiOS-NS catalysts exhibit excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 235 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 64.2 mV dec(-1) in 0.1 M KOH, which originated from the sufficient exposure of the active Fe-Ni component and the optimized electronic structure due to the tunable S/O ratio. This study demonstrates a novel strategy to optimize the OER performance of Ni-based catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000825863000001	35245913

Among the numerous hydrogen production techniques, sustainable and high purity of hydrogen can be achieved by water electrolysis. Therefore, developing electrocatalysts for water electrolysis is an emerging field with great importance to the scientific community. On one hand, precious metals are typically used to study the two-half cell reactions, i.e., hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, precious metals (i.e., Pt, Au, Ru, Ag, etc.) as electrocatalysts are expensive and with low availability, which inhibits their practical application. Non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts on the other hand are abundant with low-cost and eco-friendliness and exhibit high electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic performance equivalent to those for noble metals. Thus, these electrocatalysts can replace precious materials in the water electrolysis process. However, considerable research effort must be devoted to the development of these costeffective and efficient non-precious electrocatalysts. In this review article, we provide key fundamental knowledge of water electrolysis, progress, and challenges of the development of most-studied electrocatalysts in the most desirable electrolytic solutions: alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), solid-oxide electrolysis (SOE), and proton exchange membrane electrolysis (PEME). Lastly, we discuss remaining grand challenges, prospect, and future work with key recommendations that must be done prior to the full commercialization of water electrolysis systems.

Herein, Rh2S3/N-doped carbon hybrids (Rh2S3/NC) are first reported as novel and efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrazine-assisted hydrogen generation over a wide pH range. Specifically, Rh2S3/NC exhibits low overpotentials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline (38 mV), neutral (46 mV), and acidic (21 mV) electrolytes, to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and maintains the activities over 70 h. Meanwhile, Rh2S3/NC also displays competitive HzOR performance at all-pH electrolytes. Thus, serving as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both HER and HzOR, Rh2S3/NC shows overwhelming-Pt/C performance in three electrolytes, and can save over 93.3%, 85.2%, and 78.3% energy consumption compared to the corresponding OWS system. Moreover, theoretical calculations confirm that Rh2S3/NC owns low free-energy changes of the H adsorption and the dehydrogenation of adsorbed NHNH both of which are beneficial to enhance catalytic activity. This work develops a novel bifunctional electrocatalyst with free pH-dependent condition for the hydrazine-assisted electrolysis system to furtherly reduce the cost of massive industrial H-2 production.									33	2	0	0	2	0	33			2366-9608			WOS:000535016300001

The electroactive oxide was formed by thermal decomposition of corresponding metal salt solutions on a titanium substrate. The surface of NixCo1-x-oxide coatings was found to be composed of crystalline NiO, Co3O4 and CoO, and the surface morphology/roughness was found to be composition-dependant. The electrocatalytic activity of the oxides in the OER was determined to be highly dependent on their relative metal ratio in the oxide, with Ni0.4Co0.6-oxide offering the highest intrinsic activity and good stability. Although still inferior to state-of-the-art IrO2, Ni0.4Co0.6-oxide was deemed as a potentially good replacement anode material in the acidic medium due to its significantly lower cost.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000468252700012

Despite conspicuous discoveries, enhancing electrocatalysts is still a feat rather than a routine task. This could be due to the fact that computational materials design is often guided by heuristic rules. Here we outline a systematic procedure for the optimization of electrocatalysts using two independent parameters: delta, which is restricted by adsorption-energy scaling relations, and epsilon, which is scaling-free. Taking the prototypical oxygen evolution reaction as a case study, we mathematically show that, contrary to the widespread idea, stabilizing *OOH with respect to *OH is not a universal principle to go beyond the top of the activity volcano. Conversely, the delta-epsilon optimization lowers the calculated overpotentials in nearly all analyzed cases, suggesting that "electrocatalytic symmetry" is the only general thermodynamic recipe for optimal electrocatalysis. Using delta-epsilon analyses, screening studies can identify (1) the most promising materials, (2) the problematic reaction intermediates, and (3) the materials' ease of optimization.									50	0	0	0	2	0	50			2155-5435			WOS:000467335600046

However, the associated high cost and low abundance of noble metals limit their practical application. Non-noble metal catalysts, aside from being inexpensive, highly abundant and environmental friendly, can possess high electrical conductivity, good structural tunability and comparable electrocatalytic performances to state-of-the-art noble metals, particularly in alkaline media, making them desirable candidates to reduce or replace noble metals as promising electrocatalysts for water electrolysis. This article will review and provide an overview of the fundamental knowledge related to water electrolysis with a focus on the development and progress of non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts in alkaline, polymer exchange membrane and solid oxide electrolysis. A critical analysis of the various catalysts currently available is also provided with discussions on current challenges and future perspectives. In addition, to facilitate future research and development, several possible research directions to overcome these challenges are provided in this article.Graphical Abstract									165	8	0	0	3	0	168			2520-8489	2520-8136		WOS:000606748800002

A novel parameter y, defined as fractional current applied to effective oxidation was proposed to describe the relation between the oxygen evolution and anodic oxidation of organic compounds. Then, step-reaction kinetics was achieved via Faraday's law by introducing the parameter y. Phenol electro-oxidation experiment was carried out at different applied current densities and flow rates. The results show that the main content of the coating material on Titanium (Ti) is beta-PbO2 with average crystal size is about 50.23 nm, and these grains can effectively grow to form aggregate with particle size of 5 mum to 10 mum even dispersed on the Ti plate. The oxygen evolution potential of the prepared PbO2/Ti anode is 1.78 V or so, and phenol can decrease oxygen evolution rate by increasing the resistance of water decomposition to 195.9 Omega, which is much higher than that in Na2SO4 solution (148.3 Omega). The regressive analysis and F-test results confirm that the model prediction can satisfactorily match the experimental data.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1672-7207			INSPEC:18070304

So finding a suitable electrocatalyst for the respective OER and HER activity is highly essential. The best OER and HER electrocatalyst demands enhanced kinetics with increased surface area, active sites, and lower charge transfer resistances at the interfaces. Hence, improving the efficiency of an electrocatalyst for bifunctional activity would be advantageous for OWS. Here, we have reported nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)(2)), manganese dioxide (MnO2), and cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)(2)) self-supported transition metal oxide/hydroxides grown nickel foam (NF) substrate by simple hydrothermal method for overall water splitting (OWS) in alkaline medium. The Co (OH)(2)/NF show a low overpotential of 230 mV for OER, whereas MnO2/NF exhibits low overpotential of 150 mV for HER to accomplish a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Though, MnO2 exhibits low overpotential for HER, the current density is lower compared to Co(OH)(2)& nbsp;due to lower surface area and conductivity. The full electrolyzer constructed from Co(OH)(2)||Co(OH)(2) show a lowest cell voltage of 1.61 V and with an anion exchange membrane H-cell delivers a cell voltage of 1.68 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1M KOH. A long-term stability studies (80 hours) on Co (OH)(2)||Co(OH)(2) demonstrate robustness of the prepared electrodes and confirms the superior bifunctional electrocatalytic activity to replace the expensive noble metals.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000778888200003

However, the atomic-level control of active sites is essential for electrocatalytic materials in alkaline electrolyte. Moreover, well-defined surface structures lead to in-depth understanding of catalytic mechanisms. Herein, we report a single-atomic-site ruthenium stabilized on defective nickel-iron layered double hydroxide nanosheets (Ru-1/D-NiFe LDH). Under precise regulation of local coordination environments of catalytically active sites and the existence of the defects, Ru-1/D-NiFe LDH delivers an ultralow overpotential of 18mV at 10mAcm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction, surpassing the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Ru-1/D-NiFe LDH optimizes the adsorption energies of intermediates for hydrogen evolution reaction and promotes the O-O coupling at a Ru-O active site for oxygen evolution reaction. The Ru-1/D-NiFe LDH as an ideal model reveals superior water splitting performance with potential for the development of promising water-alkali electrocatalysts. Rational design of single atom catalyst is critical for efficient sustainable energy conversion. Single-atomic-site ruthenium stabilized on defective nickel-iron layered double hydroxide nanosheets achieve superior HER and OER performance in alkaline media.									128	4	0	0	7	0	128			2041-1723			WOS:000680875400015	34321467

A high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst composed of 3D ordered microporous carbon and a MoO2 skeleton modified by cobalt oxide nanoparticles (MoO2-CoO-Carbon) is produced through a template method. This unique 3DOM structure finely combines the larger surface area of the 3D carbon skeleton and MoO2 as well as stablizes anchoring sites for CoO nanocrystals on the skeleton. The synergistic effect between the catalytic activity between MoO2 and CoO as well as the enhanced electron transport arising from the carbon skeleton contributed to superior electrocatalytic OER properties of MoO2-CoO-Carbon. The M200-C-Carbon hybrid with an overpotential as low as 0.24 V is among the best reported Mo-based OER catalysts. Moreover, the turnover frequency at an overpotential of 0.35 V is 6 times as high as that of commercial RuO2.									45	1	0	0	2	0	45			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000362662100021	26399728

A Li-O-2 battery with mesoporous amorphous binary Ru-Ti oxides exhibited a remarkably high capacity of 27100 mAh g(-1) as well as a reduced overpotential. A GITT analysis suggested that the introduction of amorphous TiO2 to amorphous RuO2 was responsible for the enhanced kinetics toward both the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Excellent cyclic stability up to 230 cycles was achieved, confirming the applicability of the new bifunctional catalyst in non-aqueous Li-O-2 batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000401966900001	28273053

However, oxidative damage mechanism in PSII-OEC is still unclear. Here, we investigated photosynthetic performance of PSII, oxidative stress and antioxidant reaction induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a unicellular green alga Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris) under the stress of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC). From the changes of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and PSII activity, it was proved that the electron transport, which occurred initially at the electron donor side of OEC, was disturbed by CTAC. Moreover, a significant decrease of the oxygen evolution rate in OEC (40.95%) while an increase of ROS (50.50%) was obtained after the exposure to 0.6 mg/L CTAC compared to the control (without CTAC), confirming that more oxygen transferred to ROS under the stress. Furthermore, the increased ROS in chloroplast and the structural destruction in thylakoid membrane were observed, respectively. These results proved that oxidative damage mechanism in PSII-OEC is mainly through the reduction of oxygen evolution and the production of excessive ROS, thus leading to the destruction of OEC performance and chloroplast structure.

Additionally, space charge layers through band bending at the interface to the electrolyte may affect the electron transfer into the electrode, complicating the analysis and identification of true OER activity descriptors. Here, we separate the influence of covalency and band bending in hybrid epitaxial bilayer structures of highly OER-active La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 and undoped and less-active LaCoO3. Ultrathin LaCoO3 capping layers of 2-8 unit cells on La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 show intermediate OER activity between La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 and LaCoO3 evidently caused by the increased surface Co-O covalency compared to single LaCoO3 as detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A Mott-Schottkyanalysis revealed low flat band potentials for different LaCoO3 capping layer thicknesses, indicating that no limiting extended space charge layer exists under OER conditions as all catalyst bilayer films exhibited hole accumulation at the surface. The combined X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Mott-Schottky analysis thus enables us to differentiate between the influence of the covalency and intrinsic space charge layers, which are indistinguishable in a single physical or electrochemical characterization. Our results emphasize the prominent role of transition metal oxygen covalency in perovskite electrocatalysts and introduce a bilayer approach to fine-tune the surface electronic structure.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000787374700013	35293734

Transmission electron microscopic and X-ray diffraction results reveals that these nanorings mostly consist of beta-Co(OH)(2) with well crystalline hexagonal brucite like structure. The inert gas sorption-desorption measurements represents the mesoporous nature of the NPs. The Brunauer Emmett Teller surface area and average pore size of the as synthesized nanoparticles were about 210 m(2)/g and 5 nm. The especial mesoporous structures with excellent specific area are the reason for the good electrochemical capacitance performance and superior cyclic stability (only about 1% decay) in supercapacitor application. The as prepared nanoparticles have been used for oxygen evolution reaction. The oxygen evolution reaction performance is related to the active surface area of the nanoparticles due to the formation of mesoporous structure within the cobalt hydroxide nanoparticles. Furthermore, the presented facile synthetic process, which does not need any surfactant or template, could be extended to the preparation of other nanomaterials with excellent morphologies for supercapacitor and oxygen evolution reaction applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1387-1811	1873-3093		WOS:000469893200050

Here, Ce-doped CoP was prepared through synthesizing a Ce-ZIF-67 precursor coupled with a phosphorization process. The introduction of Ce into CoP can lead to electronic modulation of Co, thus lowering the energy barrier for both to deliver better activity. The CoP with an optimized Ce-doping level exhibits high HER and OER performance and can be used as a highly efficient catalyst for water splitting. Here, Ce doping can introduce electronic modulation, optimizing the adsorption of H on CoP to promote HER performance as well as reduce the energy barrier of the potential-limiting step by facilitating electron transfer from Ce to Co. This work provides new insights into the development of a high-performance water-splitting electrocatalyst.									51	1	0	0	4	0	51			2168-0485			WOS:000551360900008

However, the sluggish kinetics, high operating potential, and corrosive acidic environment during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) require the use of scarce and costly Ir-based oxides, tremendously hampering its large-scale commercialization: Hence, developing active and stable anode catalysts with reduced precious-metal usage is desperately essential. For the first time, we report a group of Y2-xBaxRu2O7 pyrochlore oxides and employ them in acid OER and PEM electrolyzers. We reveal the mechanism for the promoted OER performance of Ba-doped Y2Ru2O7 in which partially replacing Y3+ by Ba2+ in Y2Ru2O7 greatly facilitates the hole-doping effect, which generates massive oxygen vacancy and multivalence of Ru5+/Ru4+, thus boosting the OER performance of Y2-xBaxRu2O7.

Developing low-cost and highly efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a key half-reaction of water splitting, is critical. Herein, we designed Cu(OH)(2)@NiCo layered double hydroxide core-shell nanoarray supported on copper foam (CF) with different La doping amount (abbreviated as Cu(OH)(2)@NiCoLa LDH/CF) via the facile electrodeposition method. Owing to the synergistic effect between La and NiCo LDH by electronic structure tuning, Cu(OH)(2)@NiCoLa LDH/CF shows excellent OER performance with the lowest overpotential of 254 mV to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and outstanding long-term durability for 24 h. The idea of doping rare-earth metal into non-noble NiCo-based LDHs core-shell nanoarray structure in this work can inspire the design of other efficient electrocatalysts.

Increasing the catalytic active sites in MoS2 monolayer is critical for further improvement of catalytic behaviour. In this paper, the effects of oxygen (O) doping on the HER of MoS2 monolayer were investigated by using the density functional theory. The results showed that the O-doping assists in the formation of S and Mo vacancies. The hydrogen adsorption free energy is greatly reduced from 2.18 eV on pristine MoS2 monolayer to -0.01 eV on MoS1.96O0.04 and MoS1.88O0.12 monolayers with S vacancies. The Gibbs free energies for hydrogen adsorption on MoS1.92O0.08 and MoS1.84O0.16 monolayers with Mo vacancies are 0.02 and -0.02 eV, respectively.

Here we report a highly active Cu doped NiFe nanosheets hydroxide electrode with rich oxygen vacancies (OVs) (denoted as H-NiFeCuO/NF) prepared by in situ anodic electrodeposition on the three-dimensional macroporous nickel foam (NF) substrate followed by heat treatment with H-2. The as-prepared H-NiFeCuO/NF electrode showed the initial potential of 1.44 V (versus RHE) for OER and 980 F g(-1) specific capacity as supercapacitor in 1 M KOH. Further investigation suggested that the tuning of composition and structure by doping copper ions and creating OVs helped accelerate the electrochemical reactions. This practice provides an efficient approach for the fabrication of heteromultimetallic hydroxide monolithic electrode with high performance in OER or supercapacitor application.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000620493800001	33508815

Herein, we report a novel and high-efficiency OER catalyst by simply interface engineering of CoP nanosheets and CeO2 nanoparticles. Such interface-regulated strategy triggers the generation of abundant oxygen vacancies and more catalytically active sites on the surface of CoP/CeO2 heterostructure; while regulates the electronic structure of CoP and CeO2 resulting in fast charge-transfer capacity. For the OER, the CoP/CeO2 heterostructure exhibits an extremely low overpotential of about 224 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to that of CoP (380 mV), CeO2 (628 mV) and RuO2 (355 mV) counterparts. Furthermore, a high-power rechargeable Zn-air battery with impressive long-life cycling stability (over 500 cycles) is demonstrated based on CoP/CeO2+ Pt/C as the air-cathode. The present findings not only place CoP/CeO2 heterostructure as an outstanding electrocatalyst for the OER, but also offer a promising interface-regulated strategy for the development of high-performance electrocatalyts.									107	4	0	0	11	0	108			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000537152400004

Herein, we report a synthetic method with a simple two-step room-temperature immersion, which offers MnFeNi hydroxide catalysts with an underbrush-like structure on nickel foam (NF). This synthesis on Ni foam can be accomplished in minutes, while the prepared catalyst has shown an ultralong lifetime of over 1500 h for catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Specifically, the MnFeNi hydroxide catalyst requires the overpotential of only 230 and 250 mV at the current density of 100 and 500 mA.cm(-2) for OER, respectively.

The effect of the loading amount on the morphology and microstructure of Co3O4 was investigated and it was found that lower Co3O4 content in the composite materials results in smaller crystallite size, which in turn leads to significantly enhanced oxygen evolution activity. Furthermore, owing to the monodispersity of the spheres and good accessibility of active species offered by the fibrous pore structure, the material shows a clear advantage over nonsupported Co3O4 nanoparticles and the commonly used ordered mesoporous silica supports such as KIT-6 and SBA-15.									12	3	0	0	1	0	14			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000416248600013

The development of an efficient, long-lived and low-cost anode for OER is of increasingly significance for metal electrowinning. IrO2-RuO2-SiO2 ternary oxide film coated on titanium substrate was prepared using sol-gel route, followed by thermal decomposition method. The effects of precursor concentration on the surface morphology and electrocatalytic properties of Ti/IrO2-RuO2-SiO2 anode were investigated by physical characterization and electrochemical measurements. It was found that the crystallinity of the oxide coating decreased with increasing precursor concentration. Increasing precursor concentration increased the amount of cracks of the oxide coating. The electrocatalytic activity of the prepared anode improved, while the electrocatalytic stability decreased with the increase in precursor concentration. Considering the electrocatalytic activity and stability, precursor concentration of 0.2-0.3 mol L-1 is most suitable for the preparation of the Ti/IrO2-RuO2-SiO2 anode.

J	Li, Shuke; Wang, Ran; Xie, Meng; Xu, Yanchao; Chen, Jianrong; Jiao, Yang								Construction of trifunctional electrode material based on Pt-Coordinated Ce-Based metal organic framework								JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE				622				378	389		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.04.131				SEP 15 2022	2022	The main challenge hindering the use of Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) for electrochemical applications is their high cost and agglomeration. Herein, a trifunctional electrode material based on a two-dimensional cer-ium-based metal organic framework (2D Ce-MOF) decorated with Pt NPs is constructed. The large specific surface area of the 2D Ce-MOF can effectively prevent the phenomenon of Pt NPs reaction. The strong synergy between Pt NPs and the 2D Ce-MOF not only significantly enhances electron transport efficiency, but also increases the number of electrochemically reaction reactive sites. As a result, the Ce-MOF@Pt presents excellent performance in the HER (Hydrogen Evolution Reaction), OER (Oxygen Evolution Reaction) and supercapacitor reactions. The Tafel slopes of OER and HER are 47.9 and 188.1 mV dec(-1), respectively. Meanwhile, Ce-MOF@Pt-0.05 shows a specific capacity of 1894F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1) and remains at 111.5% of the initial capacitance after 3000 cycles. In general, this study high-lights the importance of Pt NPs in promoting the electrochemical performance of MOFs and reveals a new way to reduce electrocatalyst prices. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we report a general approach for fabricating FeNi3Cx-Pd-y (x represents the indeterminate amount of carbon, y denotes the initial Pd mass loading percentage) nanorods using bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as sacrificial precursor. Among the series, FeNi3Cx-Pd-7% demonstrates the best performance as bifunctional oxygen catalyst. It exhibits a high electrocatalytic activity with an unexpectedly low overpotential of 288 mV for OER at 50 mA cm(-2), which is far superior than the state-of-art RuO(2 )catalyst, and its performance for ORR also approximates to the benchmark Pt/C catalyst. When incorporated as air-cathode catalyst in a self-assembled RZAB, FeNi3Cx-Pd-7% exhibits a high power density of 234 mW cm(-2), a large energy density of similar to 967 W h kg(-1), as well as a huge specific capacity of 772 mA h g(-1) outperforming the noble-metal-based Pt/C + RuO2 catalyst. Additionally, FeNi3Cx-Pd-7% enables RZAB to obtain a long cycling life (over 900 cycles) with high efficiency and an overall overpotential of only 720 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), presenting great potential for the commercial applications of RZABs.

Here, we prepared a CoN nanosheet catalyst with rich nitrogen defects (CoN-Nd) through solvothermal and low-temperature nitridation. Notably, the study finds for the first time that only Co LDH materials can be mostly converted to CoN-Nd under the same nitriding conditions relative to different Co-based precursors. Experiments indicate that the constructed CoN-Nd catalyst exhibits preeminent electrocatalytic activities for both oxygen evolution reaction (g10 = 243 mV) and oxygen reduction reaction (JL = 5.2 mA cm-2). Moreover, the CoN-Nd-based Zincair battery showed a large power density of 120 mW cm-2 and robust stability over 260 cycles, superior to the state-of-art Pt/C + RuO2. The superior performance is attributed to a large number of defects formed by the disordered arrangement of local atoms on the catalyst that facilitate the formation of more active sites, and alternate array-like structures thereof improving electrolyte diffusion and gas emission.

In this study, a highly efficient, durable and stable amine functionalized MOF based bi-functional electrocatalyst CuO@NH2-UiO-66 has been facilely synthesized via in-situ incorporation of pre-synthesized CuO nanoparticles into amine functionalized Zr-MOF NH2-UiO-66. It is observed that CuO@NH2-UiO-66 exhibits excellent bi-functional electrocatalytic activity towards HER as well as OER and delivers the benchmark of 10 mA cm(-2) current density at just 166 and 283 mV overpotential, respectively, which is better than several previously, reported Cu-based, different transition metals and MOF based HER and OER catalysts. It also exhibits lower Tafel slope value 87 and 113 mV dec(-1) towards HER and OER, respectively which indicates faster and better charge transfer during catalytic activity. CuO@NH2-UiO-66 exhibits significant stability and generates constant current density upto 6000 s during water electrolysis experiments. Furthermore, SEM and P-XRD techniques are used to investigate the stability of working electrode after the electrocatalytic studies and it is observed that CuO@NH2-UiO-66 maintains its integrity and chemical structure, after many hours of electrocatalytic activity. This study encourages the development of more earth abundant transition metals and MOFs based electrocatalysts for efficient electrochemical studies.

Herein, Ni-Fe layered double oxides enriched with cationic nickel vacancies (Ni-Fe LDO-V-Ni) are first designed and studied as the electrocatalysts for LOBs. Based on the density functional theory calculation, the existence of nickel vacancy in Ni-Fe LDO-V-Ni significantly improves its intrinsic affinity toward intermediates, thereby fundamentally optimizing the formation and decomposition pathway of Li2O2. In addition, the number of e(g) electrons on each nickel site is 1.19 for Ni-Fe LDO-V-Ni, which is much closer to 1 than 1.49 for Ni-Fe LDO. The near-unity occupation of e(g) orbital enhances the covalency of transition metal-oxygen bonds and thus improves the electrocatalytic activity of Ni-Fe LDO-V-Ni toward oxygen electrode reactions. The experimental results show that the LOBs with Ni-Fe LDO-V-Ni electrode deliver low overpotentials of 0.11/0.29 V during the oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, large specific capacities of 13 933 mA h g(-1) and superior cycling stability of over 826 h. This study provides a novel approach to optimize the electrocatalytic activity of LDO through reasonable defect engineering.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000712099700001	34713590

Calcination of H-RuO2 at 350 degrees C resulted in the crystalline rutile RuO2 nanoparticles (C-RuO2). Treatment of H-RuO2 with 20 vol% ammonium hydroxide solution under microwave irradiation and calcination at 350 degrees C resulted in a highly electrocatalytic active crystalline RuO2 nanoparticles (A-C-RuO2). Electrocatalytic performances of H-RuO2, C-RuO2 and A-C-RuO2 for the oxygen evolution reaction in 0.50 mol L-1 H2SO4 medium are evaluated and compared. Improved performances towards the oxygen evolution reaction are observed for A-C-RuO2 when compared to C-RuO2. Based on XRD, TEM, XPS and Raman characterizations performed on all the specimens, it is deduced that the physicochemical properties (crystallinity, mean crystallite size, level of hydrous rutile content) are varied for A-C-RuO2 when compared to C-RuO2. Structure-property correlation has been established to describe the higher electrocatalytic activity of A-C-RuO2.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2296-598X			WOS:000588020900001

This article describes a one-step solvothermal synthesis of Co2(OH)3Cl by surfactant free method. The catalyst is further modified with a conducting polymer poly (3-bromothiophene) (PTBr) via in-situ reaction and shows excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Electrochemical performance of the catalyst reveals a significant decrease of overpotential in case of Co2(OH)3Cl@PTBr composite compared to polymer unsupported Co2(OH)3Cl for OER reaction at 10 mA cm-2 current density. All the materials including polymer was characterized thoroughly using XRD, TGA, HRTEM, EDX-mapping, IR spectroscopy, XPS and BET to realize the structure-property relationship. The superior catalytic activity of the composite is an indication of synergistic effect and has a close correlation with the effective matrix support of conducting polymer which in-turn helps to uplift the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the material (97.28 m2 g-1) and thus allows more active sites available for carrying out electrochemical reaction with improved efficiency.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000804546600008

In this paper, we report a facile approach for the synthesis of Pd nanoparticle assemblies (NPAs) with porous structure as catalysts for both the HER and the ORR with desirable electrocatalytic activities and long-term stability. For the HER, the porous Pd NPAs exhibit a low onset potential, a small Tafel slope of 30 mV dec(-1), and an exceptionally low overpotential of about 80 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), and these porous Pd NPAs maintain their catalytic activity for at least 1000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles of durability in 0.5 M H2SO4. As for the ORR, the porous Pd NPAs offer a remarkable catalytic activity with a diffusion-limiting current density of 3.85 mA cm(-2), a half-potential of 0.837 V, and an onset potential of 0.926 V at 1600 rpm with a scan rate of 5 mV s(-1).

Remarkably, the tri-component NiCoFeOx/Ni foam (NF) electrode delivers a high current density of 100mAcm(-2) at an overpotential of only approximate to 383mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with prolonged electrochemical stability. The improved OER activity of NiCoFeOx/NF can be ascribed to the simultaneous incorporation of Ni and Co into FeOx/NF, boosting the intrinsic catalytic activities by altering the crystal and electronic structures. With electron redistribution happening in the tri-component NiCoFeOx/NF, the electron transfer from Co to Ni through the Fe acting as the electron transfer bridge renders Co more acidic (Lewis acid) to activate H2O (Lewis base) molecules through Lewis acid-base interaction. By identifying the interactions of Fe, Co, and Ni and electron redistribution in the tri-component TMOs, this study provides new insights into the crystal and electronic structure evolution of tri-component NiCoFeOx catalysts for active electrocatalysis.									10	2	0	0	0	0	10				2567-3173		WOS:000682527000001

In this work, a hybrid shell/core Co-P/CuO nanowire array was fabricated by Co-P film electrodeposition on a CuO nanowire array. Because of the synergy between Co-P and CuO nanowire arrays, Co-P/CuO shows remarkable activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

The high activity is attributed to an unusually short O-O separation that favors formation of peroxide ions by O--O- interactions followed by O-2 evolution in preference to the conventional route through surface O-OH- species. The dependence of the onset potential on the pH of the alkaline solution was found to be consistent with the loss of H+ ions from the surface oxygen to provide surface O- that may either be attacked by solution OH- or react with another O-; a short O-O separation favors the latter route. The role of a strong hybridization of the O-2p and low-spin Co-III/Co-IV pi-bonding d states is also important; the OER on other Co-III/Co-IV oxides is compared with that on Na0.67CoO2 as well as that on IrO2.									35	1	0	0	2	0	35			0027-8424			WOS:000498683000022	31685612

Herein a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) strategy is proposed to mass produce 2D cobalt-fluoride-oxide phase electrocatalysts in air at 400 degrees C (CFO-RH400) from crystalline fluoride hydrates, with critical steps including the thermal expansion of the water molecule, the exfoliation of CoF2 nanosheets, and the subsequent oxidation. The regulated electronic structure of the active cobalt oxide phase by sufficient fluoride anions leads to a closer O p-band center relative to the Fermi level based on our theoretical simulations. Therefore, the as-prepared 2D CFO-RH400 exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity and durability toward the oxygen evolution reaction.									38	3	0	0	1	0	39			2168-0485			WOS:000535188400001

Herein, we have synthesized urchin-like Co3O4, Co3O4 nanosheets, Co3O4 nanoparticles and Co3O4 nanospheres. These Co3O4 materials with different morphologies are applied as the electrocatalysts for OER, and their OER performances are also compared with related literature results.

The catalytic mechanism of the urchin-like Co3O4 for OER is explored by electrochemical oxidation of H2O2.

Herein, we proposed a "model-etching" strategy to investigate chemical etching of Co3O4. The cubic Co3O4 nanocrystals enclosed by well-defined facets are synthesized as model crystals, whose uniform surface structures allow us to study the etching mechanism at atomic level. Etching kinetics study together with DFT calculations discloses that {111} facets, the highly active facets for OER, serve as etch-stop facets in the etching reaction and H2SO4 molecules play a special role in creating surface Co2+, the active center of OER. These results direct us to rationally optimize the surface structures of Co3O4 to develop highly active OER electrocatalysts. The favorable performance of overpotential (q) and the Tafel slope decrease even to 268 mV@10 mA-cm(-2) and 74 mV.dec(-1), respectively. In general, our study shows that chemical etching of model crystals could help us rationally construct high-efficiency electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000857926300001

Cobalt-based (oxy)hydroxides are promising electrocatalysts, but their performance is still under the expected goal due to the restricted active sites and intrinsic activity. Herein, Co80Fe20(OH)(OCH3) (CoFeMe) is synthesized with intercalation and rich vacancies by a cation exsolution process in a one-step solve-thermal reaction. With the help of the Fe incorporation, the specific surface area of CoFeMe increases to 101.6 m(2) g(-1), which is six times that of Co(OH)(OCH3) (CoMe) (16.5 m(2) g(-1)). Also, the induced rich vacancies are traced in the X-ray absorption spectra of CoFeMe. Because of the synergistic effect between the intercalation, Fe incorporation and vacancies, the overpotential of CoFeMe is only 240 mV to drive the current density to 10 mA cm(-2), which is reduced 110 mV compared with that of pristine CoMe (350 mV).									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000614697500001

The performance of the calculated Pourbaix diagram using the SCAN functional is validated with comparison to the experimental and the MP PBE Pourbaix diagrams for representative examples.

Here, we first report the synthesis of NiFe-bimetal two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) nanosheets (NiFe-UMNs) with a uniform thickness of similar to 10 nm, which show excellent catalytic activity for OER in alkaline conditions. The as-repared NiFe-UMNs can deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 260 mV. Moreover, NiFe-UMNs possess by far the lowest Tafel slope of 30 mV dec(-1) for OER. The high-performance activity is the result of abundant surface coordinatively unsaturated metal atoms, as well as the addition of Fe that is also crucial to enhance the activity.									196	14	0	0	13	0	201			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000419833900040

In this work, we successfully synthesize a Cr doped CoFe layered double hydroxides (LDH) nanosheets array with uniform growth on a nickel-foam (NF). The partially oxidized Cr6+ during the process of oxidation could adjust the electronic structure and stabilize the high-valence active sites by virtue of its strong electron-withdrawing ability. The calculation of density functional theory (DFT) shows that the incorporation of Cr into CoFe LDH could obviously overcome the step of H2O adsorption during the OER progress. Therefore, the CoFeCr LDH/NF electrode exhibits superior OER performance. Furthermore, when acted as a UOR electrode, its performance is also satisfying. The design of the CoFeCr LDH/NF would hew out a brand-new route to construct more bifunctional electrodes for electrocatalytic water splitting in an alkaline solution with or without urea.									110	6	0	0	8	0	113			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000533148700010

In this work, a unique N, S co-doped 3D hierarchically porous carbon (P33DTNSC) with high microporosity is synthesized via an "one-pot" tactic without template and further activation. The as-prepared P33DT-NSC electrocatalyst derived from highly crosslinked all-thiophene-based conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) exhibits an enticing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.9 V (versus RHE) and a Tafel slope of 49 mV dec-1 in alkali medium, which are superior to those of commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). Meanwhile, the ORR performance of P33DT-NSC in acidic electrolyte is also comparable to the Pt/C benchmark. Moreover, the P33DT-NSC sample processes good hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities and kinetics in both alkaline and acidic media. This study provides a fundamental guidance and seminal strategy for the rational design and facile synthesis of nanostructured carbon-based catalysts for highrate electrocatalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000727808100001

In this paper, a free-standing serrated Ni-WO3 electrode for OER was synthesized by a simple in-situ etching method using (NH4)(2)SO4 as etchant. The effect of etchant on structures of Ni-WO3 were studied carefully, indicating that the NH4+ and SO42-have a synergistic effect on the unique structure. The serrated Ni-WO3-3 (where 3 is the mass of (NH4)(2)SO4) dramatically enhance OER performance, an over-potential of only 265 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) as compared with that 365 mV of serrated-free Ni-WO3. Interestingly, the structure and composition of the serrated Ni-WO3 electrode undergoes a self-reconstruction process during OER, the finally catalyst is interconnected by low crystallinity nickel oxy-hydroxide nanoparticles. This work mainly explores the influence of etching agent type, usage and reaction time on the morphology and properties of materials, and the reconstruction phenomenon in OER pre-catalyst was confirmed.

However, the reported transition metal-based electrocatalysts usually exhibit far lower activity, compared with precious metals. In this work, we report the excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of MoxC-FeNi@ NC (NC, nitrogen-doped carbon) by a simple pyrolytic method. To reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), MoxC-FeNi@NC only needs a low overpotential of 306 mV. Surprisingly, the MoxC-FeNi@NC even showed lower overpotential than those of noble metal oxides, e.g. RuO2 (similar to 320 mV), IrO2/C (360 mV). The excellent OER activity is mainly ascribed to the unique FeNi electron configuration, efficient electron transfer and higher surface area. Compared with FeCo and CoNi, FeNi alloy possesses half-filling *pi 3d electron configuration, leading to suitable adsorption for OH-; and MoxC has effectively improved electrical conductance of MoxC-FeNi@NC, thus greatly improving the OER reaction kinetics. This work provides an earth-abundant, efficient electrocatalyst for water oxidation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000567084700010

Herein, a novel structure of biomass-derived nitrogen-doped porous carbon supported yolk-shell Co-CoO nanoparticles (yolk-shell Co-CoO/BC) was successfully prepared via a facile impregnation strategy. The pyrolysis temperature and heating rate of Co2+/BC composite are two key factors in the formation of the yolk-shell structure. The synthesized yolk-shell Co-CoO/BC exhibits excellent electrochemical activity and stability as multifunctional electrocatalysts. The yolk-shell Co-CoO/C with a positive onset potential (0.91 V vs. RHE) and half-wave potential (0.82 V vs. RHE) exhibits an effective 4-electron transfer path and excellent methanol tolerance in alkaline electrolyte for ORR. Moreover, a low cell potential (eta(10) = 1.77 V vs. RHE at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) for overall water splitting can be reached. The synergistic catalytic effects between BC support and yolk-shell Co-CoO nanoparticles should be responsible for the excellent performance for ORR, OER and HER.

Then, the latest advances in the rational design of the related OER electrocatalysts and the modulation of the electronic structure of active sites are comprehensively summarized. Specifically, various strategies (including element doping, defect engineering, and fabrication of binderless catalysts) used to improve the OER performance are detailedly discussed, emphasizing the structure-function relationships.

Thesefindings canprovide guidance for the facile optimal design of state-of-the-art wateroxidation catalysts by using LDHs for large-scale practical applications.

Combining the excellent metal-like feature of induced OER activity of nitrides and oxidation resistance performance of oxides, the obtained FeNi oxynitride delivers an outstanding OER performance. The synergistic interplay between Fe, Ni components creates a favorable local coordination environment for OER and decreased sizes enables more active sites exposure.

The proposed NiCoO2-carbon composite exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity and outstanding long-term stability in 1.0 M KOH. The onset overpotentials for about 28 and 273 mV were observed for HER and OER, respectively. Also, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was delivered at a low HER and OER overpotentials for about 51 and 295 mV, respectively.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000528112700001

Herein, we design and construct a composite architecture that is composed of nitrogen-doped carbon encapsulating cobalt and molybdenum carbide nanoparticles (CoxMoy@NC). Benefiting from synergistic cooperation between each component, the CoxMoy@NC presents excellent performance towards both HER and OER catalysis in alkaline medium. The optimized electrocatalyst is found to be Co4Mo2@NC, which only requires relatively low overpotentials of similar to 0.218 V and similar to 0.33 V to produce a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the electrocatalytic HER and OER, respectively. Such performance compares favorably to those of most previously reported Co, Mo-based electrocatalysts for water splitting. The present finding would enrich our knowledge to design and develop catalytically active molybdenum carbide-based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									211	11	0	0	8	0	212			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000407641200050

The ruthenate nanosheets exhibit the best OER activity of all solution-processed acid medium electrocatalysts reported to date, reaching 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of only approximate to 255 mV. The nanosheets also demonstrate robustness under harsh oxidizing conditions. Theoretical calculations give insights into the OER mechanism and reveal that the edges are the origin of the high OER activity of the nanosheets. Moreover, the post OER analyses indicate, apart from coarsening, no observable change in the morphology of the nanosheets or oxidation states of ruthenium during the electrocatalytic process. Therefore, the present investigation suggests that ruthenate nanosheets are a promising acid medium OER catalyst with application potential in proton exchange membrane electrolyzers and beyond.									117	2	0	0	2	0	117			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000465464500007

Herein, electrocatalytically active, bifunctional, and durable electrodes, are reported where NiCo2S4 nanosheets deposited onto nitrogen-incorporated reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) are assembled onto 3D Ni foam. These freestanding binder-free electrodes exhibit excellent bifunctional catalytic activity for both hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline condition, as well as overall water splitting reaction measured in a two-electrode configuration. The cell voltage is as low as 1.63 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and this value is well preserved with negligible overpotential for more than 50 h. The results open a door to design bifunctional durable electrode based on non-noble metals for practical alkaline water electrolyzers.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2196-7350			WOS:000532290500010

ZnO microspheres are applied as a sacrificial template, followed by alkaline etching and aluminum reduction to construct Ni/Co3O4 microcubes. The porous hybrid microcubes show stirring performance in both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). For HER, it exhibits comparable overpotential of 145 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) as Pt/C (101 mV) and desirable stability. For OER, it outperforms RuO2 with lower overpotential when the current exceeds 17.8 mA cm(-2) and much smaller Tafel slope of 34 mV dec(-1) versus RuO2 (72 mV dec(-1)). The potential activity is assigned to the charge transfer at the heterointerfaces, and the synergic effects of the Ni/Co3O4 phases, which possibly will cast light on the design of microscale bifunctional electrocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000510064600001

Herein, we report a general and robust approach for the controlled synthesis of a class of NiM (M = Fe, Co, Mn) hydroxide nanosheets (HNSs) that have ultrathin thicknesses of around 2 nm. Such unique structures enable the HNSs to have promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performances, with the NiFe HNSs being the best candidate. Given the well-defined electrochemical bifunctionality, a full alkaline electrolyzer was constructed using NiFe HNSs as both the cathodic and the anodic catalysts. It can realize overall water splitting with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.67 V and has remarkable durability for 12 h. This work opens a new avenue to approach water splitting catalysis using efficient low-cost Ni-based HNSs.									77	3	0	0	1	0	79			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000400553700012

J	Wincencjusz, H; Yocum, CF; van Gorkom, HJ								Activating anions that replace Cl- in the O-2-evolving complex of photosystem II slow the kinetics of the terminal step in water oxidation and destabilize the S-2 and S-3 states								BIOCHEMISTRY				38	12			3719	3725		10.1021/bi982295n				MAR 23 1999	1999	Photosystem II, the multisubunit protein complex that oxidizes water to O-2, requires the inorganic cofactors Ca2+ and Cl- to exhibit optimal activity. Chloride can be replaced functionally by a small number of anionic cofactors (Br-, NO3-, NO2-, I-), but among these anions, only Br- is capable of restoring rates of oxygen evolution comparable to those observed with Cl-. UV absorption difference spectroscopy was utilized in the experiments described here as a probe to monitor donor side reactions in photosystem II in the presence of Cl- or surrogate anions. The rate of the final step of the water oxidation cycle was found to depend on the activating anion bound at the Cl- site, but the kinetics of this step did not limit the light-saturated rate of oxygen evolution. Instead, the lower oxygen evolution rates supported by surrogate anions appeared to be correlated with an instability of the higher oxidation states of the oxygen-evolving complex that was induced by addition of these anions. Reduction of these states takes place not only with I- but also with NO2- and to a lesser extent even with NO3- and Br- and is not related to the ability of these anions to bind at the Cl- binding site. Rather, it appears that these anions can attack higher oxidation states of the oxygen evolving complex from a second site that is not shielded by the extrinsic 17 and 23 kDa polypeptides and cause a one-electron reduction. The decrease of the oxygen evolution rate may result from accumulated damage to the reaction center protein by the one-electron oxidation product of the anion.									74	3	0	0	58	0	75			0006-2960			WOS:000079510700030	10090760

However, combining three active composites into a single foldable electrode is still a challenge. Thereby, this work successfully fabricates a flexible trifunctional electrode based on self-supported N, Co co-doped carbon nanotubes (N, Co- CNTs). The obtained N, Co-CNTs possess favorable component-structure features, including heteroatom-doped structure and rich N content, which can simultaneously boost three crucial reactions. According to acid-washed experiment, the metallic cobalt cores are not directly attributed to catalytic activity. Moreover, As-assembled flexible zinc-air battery (ZAB) provides a high peak power density (114 mW cm(-2)) and long-term durability. Specially, this flexible ZAB reliably operates under external mechanical changes and an as-constructed water electrolyzer can be powered by two flexible ZABs in series.									37	2	0	0	0	0	38			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000600017600007

In alkaline electrolytes, it shows an ultralow overpotential of 10 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), almost 100% Faradaic yield for hydrogen production, and continuous discharge stability for more than 10 h. At the same time, in acidic and neutral electrolytes, its overpotentials at the same current density are as low as 15 and 32 mV, respectively. Interestingly, linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) data present that, under alkaline conditions, IrP2@PC also possesses a half-wave potential of 0.81 V, extremely close to commercial Pt/C catalysts, indicating that the catalyst also possesses outstanding ORR performance.

A higher level of understanding in terms of the catalyst nanomateriats, their synthesis, and electrochemical kinetics at nanoscale has been accomplishcd. In this context, the most challenging electrochemical reactions, the reaction mechanisms on the catalyst surfaces, and the recent approaches related to different types of catalytically active nanomaterials are discussed. The emphasis is given on three electrochemical reactions namely: Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR), Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), and Methanol Oxidation Reaction (MOR).

Herein, we report a facile method for the in situ growth of vertical nanoarray vanadium nitride and carbon nanotube hybrid materials on iron foam (labeled as VN/CNT/IF). The obtained catalyst exhibits good electrocatalytic activity and stability toward OER in alkaline media, with a low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1). Meanwhile, the obtained materials can deliver a large current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of only 410 mV for OER in 30 wt % KOH, an electrolyte widely used in commercial aqueous alkaline electrolyzers. The experimental results indicate that the vertical nanoarray structure offers a high specific surface area and exposes abundant active sites. In addition, the vanadium nitride and carbon nanotube hybrid can strongly decrease the charge transfer resistance, further facilitating the water-splitting reaction kinetics.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2574-0970		WOS:000818552000001

Thus, the understanding of the factors controlling the reactivity of these materials is mandatory. In this contribution, DFT (PBE-D2) periodic calculations are performed to analyze the catalytic activities of the main ((11 0), (011), (100) and (001)) IrO2 surfaces. Results show that the reaction only occurs if the Ir=O species on the surfaces exhibit an oxyl character. The water nucleophilic attack mechanism is the most favorable pathway on the (110), (100) and (001) surfaces. In contrast, for the (011) facet the oxo-coupling is preferred. The required overpotentials for the four IrO2 surfaces depend on the feasibility to oxidize the Ir-OH to Ir-O species and this is tuned by the coordination of the unsaturated iridium sites: the (100) and (001) surfaces appear to be more active than the (110) and (011).

APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL				518				213	220		10.1016/j.apcata.2015.10.023				MAY 25 2016	2016	Metal co-catalysts are essential for enhancing photocatalytic performance, especially in reduction reactions using semiconductor photocatalyst materials as a consequence of the reduced recombination kinetics of charge carriers by spatial charge separation. Generally Au, Pd, Pt, and their alloys are more promising candidates than Ag for photocatalytic H-2 evolution experiments, although Ag can trap more electrons having more negative reduction potential than that of Au, Pd, and Pt. Here we have synthesized and examined well-defined Au, Ag, and core-shell structured Au-Ag nanoparticles as co-catalysts for TiO2 in photocatalytic H-2 evolution. By varying the dissolved oxygen in the reaction suspension, we found that selective photocatalytic reduction can be achieved by fine tuning the co-catalyst materials. Whilst Au NPs are superior for proton reduction, Ag NPs exhibits excellent performance for oxygen reduction. All core-shell structured Au-Ag NPs show non-selectivity in photocatalytic reduction of proton and oxygen. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here we investigate the relationship between applied stress and reaction rates for the oxygen evolution reaction on multi-layered graphene using conductive atomic force microscopy. During the reaction, oxygen groups accumulate on the surface and the oxygenation rate increases with applied load. The results also show that the rate is not uniform across the surface, where local edges and defects are more reactive than the basal plane. The results presented here are interpreted in the context of transition state theory, where applied load over the reaction coordinate linearly modifies the energy landscape. This work motivates the general efficacy of atomic force microscopy as a tool to study relationships between local mechanical surface effects and electrochemical reactivity.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000450934400051	30226252

In this study, we used a stepwise synthesis method to prepare CuO nanoflake @Co3O4 nanowire composite nano-arrays (denote as CuO/Co3O4 composite), which show an excellent electrochemical performance. In the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the CuO/Co3O4 composite shows lower overpotential of 450 mV at the current density of 50 mAcm(-2) and a smaller Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1) in KOH solution (1 M, pH = 13.7). In the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, the prepared CuO/Co3O4 composite showed better CO selectivity in KHCO3 aqueous solution (0.1M, CO2 saturated), the corresponding Faradaic efficiency of CO product reached 35.4%, and the product ratio of H-2 to CO was controlled by changing the potential values. The synthesis strategy reported here opens a way for designing high-performance electrodes for electrochemical catalysis and also provides new ideas for the construction of overall reaction (CO2 + H2O -> CO + O-2).

This perspective summarizes the most prominent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanisms mostly for Ni-based oxides as model transition metal catalysts and highlights the effect of Fe incorporation on the catalyst surface in the form of impurities originating from the electrolyte or co-precipitated in the catalyst lattice, in modulating the OER reaction kinetics, mechanism and stability.[GRAPHICS].									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000600090100001

A facile, environmentally benign and low-cost method was developed. Ethylene glycol as an inexpensive and non-toxic reducing agent was used to reduce cuprous oxide to synthesize a Cu2O-reduced graphene oxide (Cu2O-rGO) composite. This material changed the bond energy of the intermediate Cu-O of the OER under alkaline conditions, exhibiting good electrocatalytic oxygen generation performance. It is noteworthy that our research not only developed a method to prepare a Cu2O-based catalyst but also investigated the mechanism of action of the Cu2O-rGO composite. This will guide us to synthesise novel non-noble-metal catalysts develop their applications toward energy and the environment.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000707865000001

Herein, we report the synthesis of hybrid composites consisting of defective nickel quantum dots (Ni QD) encapsulated in N-doped carbon (NC) anchored on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (Ni QD@NC@rGO) through a low-temperature pyrolysis of rGO-wrapped two dimensional (2D) sheet-like nickel zeolite imidazolate framework. The as-fabricated Ni QD@NC@rGO catalysts only require overpotentials of 265 and 133 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Remarkably, an alkaline electrolyzer constructed with Ni QD@NC@rGO catalyst for both anode and cathode can drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.563 V, superior to that of the Pt@CI lIrO(2)@C couple (1.614 V). The enhanced electrocatalytic performance of Ni QD@NC@rGO can be mainly attributed to its 2D hierarchically porous structure and the synergistic effect of the highly dispersed Ni QD, in-situ coupled thin layer NC and rGO, giving rise to a large surface active sites exposure, enhanced electron/ion transfer ability and optimal Gibbs free energy of adsorption.									71	4	0	0	4	0	71			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000465051700022

Consequently, nowadays it is a widely accepted yet unverified rule of thumb that breaking such a scaling relation results in enhanced catalytic activity. In this perspective, we show that breaking the OH-OOH scaling relation does not per se lower the OER overpotential. Instead, electrocatalytic symmetry and ease of optimization are shown to be key factors when screening for enhanced OER catalysts. The essence of electrocatalytic symmetry is captured by a descriptor called the electrochemical-step symmetry index (ESSI). In turn, the ease of optimization and whether it should be scaling-based or scaling-free is provided by a procedure called delta-epsilon optimization. Finally, taking the search for bifunctional catalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis as an example, we show that the alternative analysis can be straightforwardly extended to other electrocatalytic reactions.									35	0	0	0	2	0	35			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000524512700001	32167118

In this work, we present an etch-free one-step approach to directly synthesize the ultrathin Co3O4 nanomeshes (Co-UNMs) by employing a CoCl2/K3Co(CN)(6) cyanogel as the reaction precursor. The 2D planar structural unit and solid properties of the cyanogel result in the preferential assembly of generated crystal nuclei at the solid-liquid interface (i.e., cyanogel-solution interface) in the 2D direction, which plays a key role in the formation of nanomeshes. The as-prepared Co-UNMs with 1.5 nm thickness and abundant pores have high surface area and numerous defect atoms, resulting in enhanced activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, such as a low overpotential of 307 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 76 mV dec(-1), and attractive durability in 1 M KOH electrolyte.									325	13	0	0	15	0	326			2155-5435			WOS:000426804100036

Therefore, we synthesized porous three-dimensional core-shell NiCoP@NiCoPOx nanostructures (3D CS-NiCoPpNiCoPO(x)) at room temperature via a one-step cyanogel reduction strategy, using NaBH4/NaH2PO2 as a mixed reductant. Specifically, the inner NiCoP core acts as the conductive support for the active catalytic NiCoPOx shell, facilitating the charge transport during OER. With the merits of abundant accessible active sites, fast electron transport, and gas diffusion, CS-NiCoP@NiCoPOx exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic activity and stability toward OER in 1 M KOH electrolyte (e.g., the overpotentials are only 313 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 398 mV at 100 mA cm(-2)), outperforming a homemade NiCo nanosheet (NiCo-NS) and commercially available RuO2 catalysts.

However, it is extremely difficult to directly observe the forefront of the reaction interface, i.e. the electronic double layer (EDL). Herein, electro-chemical diagnostic tools are developed to study interfacial behaviors during alkaline OER. Using the traditional linear sweep voltammetry method, we observe that increasing the potential scan rate improves the performance of amorphous Ir oxides, while, for cubic NiCo2O3 with higher mass-transport resistance, the effect of scan rate is reversed. The results further confirm that the EDL capacitive and pseudocapacitive processes have a significant impact on electrocatalytic OER. Moreover, continuous EDL reconstruction is observed from double-potential step chronoamperometry. This reconstruction, mainly caused by chemical phase modification, has a positive influence on OER performance for the Ni-Co oxide, but a negative influence for the Ir oxide. By studying EDL effects, our findings open up new strategies to design promising catalysts and elucidate OER mechanisms.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000446283800044

To date, most of the heterogeneous, synthesized MnOx catalysts still exhibit lower activities for WORs, in comparison to RuO2 and IrO2. Herein, we report a single-step and scalable synthesis method for mesoporous MnOx materials that is developed through a soft-templated method. This method allowed precise control of Mn3+-rich Mn2O3 structure as well as pore sizes and crystallinity of these mesoporous MnOx. These catalysts were investigated for both photochemical and electrochemical water oxidation, and they presented a superior activity for water oxidation. The highest turnover frequency of 1.05 x 10(-3) s(-1) was obtained, which is comparable with those for precious metal oxide based catalysts (RuO2 and IrO2).

In recent years, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been found to be promising templates for immobilizing nanoclusters (NCs) as advanced catalysts. However, their poor electrical conductivities largely limit their applications in the field of electrochemistry and electrocatalysis. In this study, electrically conductive MOF-74 is chose as template to immobilize tiny Pd NCs in the pores (Pd@MOF-74). Unlike the usually reported MOF-based electrocatalysts, without the post calcination process, the Pd@MOF-74 exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performances for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Moreover, due to the tiny size and the high dispersion of Pd clusters confined in the MOFs, the loading of noble Pd metal can be largely reduced for the catalysis. Meanwhile, the Pd clusters immobilized in the MOF-74 showed higher long-term durability in both acid and alkaline electrolytes than commercial Pt/C. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The hybrid structure shows excellent efficiency in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction with a small overpotential of about 260 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 21 mV dec(-1), superior to the prisitine components, their physical mixture and commercial RuO2. The enhancement is attributed to the intimate contact between the two components, which guarantees efficient charge transfer across the interface and exposes more active sites by preventing the LDH from aggregation.

However, studies on non-noble-metal-interface electrocatalysts with extremely high activity and superior stability at high current density still remains a great challenge. Herein, a class of Co3O4/Fe0.33Co0.66P interface nanowires is rationally designed for boosting oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis at high current density by partial chemical etching of Co(CO3)(0.5)(OH)center dot 0.11H(2)O (Co-CHH) nanowires with Fe(CN)(6)(3-), followed by low-temperature phosphorization treatment. The resulting Co3O4/Fe0.33Co0.66P interface nanowires exhibit very high OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of only 215 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 59.8 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 m KOH. In particular, Co3O4/Fe0.33Co0.66P exhibits an obvious advantage in enhancing oxygen evolution at high current density by showing an overpotential of merely 291 mV at 800 mA cm(-2), much lower than that of RuO2 (446 mV). Co3O4/Fe0.33Co0.66P is remarkably stable for the OER with negligible current loss under overpotentials of 200 and 240 mV for 150 h. Theoretical calculations reveal that Co3O4/Fe0.33Co0.66P is more favorable for the OER since the electrochemical catalytic oxygen evolution barrier is optimally lowered by the active Co- and O-sites from the Co3O4/Fe0.33Co0.66P interface.									352	44	0	0	19	0	358			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000449819500026	30252951

The as-prepared Co-N-C tetragonal microstructures exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic activities for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The synergistic effect of the chemical compositions and the robust microstructure made of the interconnected N-doped carbon nanocapsules accounts for the superior ORR and OER activity and stability to the commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst. The synthetic strategy presented in this work demonstrates a new avenue for developing highly active carbon-based electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy storage and conversion.									69	1	0	0	6	0	69			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395074300053

Unlike other transition metal phosphates, the OER is preceded by a prominent reversible redox reaction. The current study is aimed at understanding the origin of NPO-catalyzed OER, in particular the role of the pre-OER redox reaction. We detected the progressive formation of Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH on the NPO surface during potential cycling in the anodic region similar to previous observations from Ni oxides, and found that it is associated with the change in the Ni/phosphate stoichiometry from 1.5 to 1.0, resulting in the loss of phosphate to the alkaline solution. Despite the conversion, NPO still has a good and sustained OER performance due to the activity similarity between NiPO4 (and possibly NPO) and NiOOH (the activated form of Ni oxide and hydroxide catalysts). NPO is however an easier catalyst to use than Ni oxides and hydroxides, which require extensive electrode conditioning to reach a stable performance. We also mixed NPO with Fe in view of recent findings that Ni-Fe double hydroxides are more active than simple Ni oxides in oxygen catalysis. The experimental results corroborate the positive outcome of this modification.									74	1	0	0	2	0	74			2196-0216			WOS:000374263200012

Despite many efforts, the fundamental understanding concerning the correlations of structure variation and OER conditions is crucial for the identification of active site, yet remains to be explored. Here we report the electrochemical activity of phosphorus doped nickel oxyhydroxide is intrinsically determined by the low applied potential during OER. Based on electrochemical measurements, density functional theory calculations, and mechanism simulation, the descriptor for the relationship of surface structure and electrochemical behavior is established. We uncover that the discharge process will occur at low applied potential region and enable the formation of phosphorous and oxygen vacancies. These in-situ constructed vacancies can optimize the configuration of surface electron for intermediate adsorption and thus facilitate the reaction kinetics. Simultaneously, the discharge process leads to faster mass transfer and thus produces more active sites. As the results, the discharge leads to increase in current density as large as 33.7%. Our work demonstrates the important of discharge process for surface reconstruction and electrochemical performance improvement.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773522500004

Noble-metal-based electrocatalysts can decrease overpotential and accelerate kinetics dramatically, but limited by its scarcity and high cost. Transitional metal catalysts are abundant, low cost and have potential to become excellent catalyst due to unique electronic structure. Beginning from basic principle of electrocatalysis, this paper focuses on the synthesis method of transitional metal phosphide (TMP), and further discusses modification methods of TMP, including phase tuning, element doping/alloying, interfacial/structural engineering and three-dimensional architecture.

Here, we demonstrate that cobalt-iron oxyhydroxide (CoFe0.8(OH)(x)) with appropriate crystallization exhibits excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of only 246 mV, which is much lower than that achieved on amorphous one. Kinetic experiments indicate that the OER active sites should be di-mu-oxo bridged Fe-Co, on which lower energy barrier is attained than that on Fe-O and Co-O sites. Partial crystallization is beneficial to the lattice contraction, the formation of Co-O-Fe sites, and the decrease of charge transfer resistance, thus accelerating OER process.

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as an emerging class of framework materials linked by strong covalent bonds, simultaneously allow precise structure design with predictable synthesis and show advantages of large surface areas, tunable pore sizes, and unique molecular architectures. Although the research on COF-based electrocatalysts is at an early age, significant progress has been made. Herein, the recent significant progress in the design and synthesis of COFs as highly efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is summarized. Design principles for COFs as efficient electrocatalysts are discussed by considering essential factors for catalyzing the OER, ORR, and HER processes at the molecular level.

Therefore, it still exists a challenge to exploit high-performance and durable electrocatalysts for OER. Herein, a one-step hydro-thermal approach was designed to prepare Co-Ni bimetallic organic frameworks (MOFs) on nickel foam (NF) substrate as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for OER under alkaline conditions. The prepared MIL-53(Co-Ni)/NF has excellent OER catalytic activity, which requires only an overpotential of 197 mV to achieve 20 mA cm(-2.) The proposed electrocatalyst exhibits long-term durability (> 60 h) and a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.2806 mol O-2 s(-1 )at 350 mV. Systematic study revealed that the coordination between Co-Ni played a significant role to improve OER performance. The present results demonstrated that bimetallic organic frameworks could be utilized to fabricate promising water-oxidation catalysts in energy conversion.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000797734300004

In this work, we reported an interfacial engineering design of CoMoO4 nanoplate arrays wrapped with Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets supported on Ni foam for high-performance OER. Remarkably, benefiting from the hierarchical heterostructure arrays with strong interfacial interaction, enlarged surface areas, and more active sites, the optimized CoMoO4-Ni(OH)(2) electrocatalyst manifests the excellent OER catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 349 mV at the current density of 100 mA cm(-2), a long-term stability, and high (nearly 100%) Faradaic efficiency, which is superior to those of most previously reported Co-Mo-based bimetallic oxides electrocatalysts. Therefore, this interfacial engineering demonstrates an effective strategy for designing and fabricating high-performance electrocatalysts for OER reaction.									45	3	0	0	0	0	46			2168-0485			WOS:000452344900022

Nickel has also exhibited high catalytic activity for methanol oxidation, particularly when in the form of a bimetallic catalyst. In this work, bimetallic iron-nickel nanoparticles were synthesized using a multistep procedure in water under ambient conditions. When compared to monometallic iron and nickel nanoparticles, Fe-Ni nanoparticles show enhanced catalytic activity for both OER and methanol oxidation under alkaline conditions. At 1 mA/cm(2), the overpotential for monometallic iron and nickel nanoparticles was 421 and 476 mV, respectively, while the bimetallic Fe-Ni nanoparticles had a greatly reduced overpotential of 256 mV. At 10 mA/cm(2), bimetallic Fe-Ni nanoparticles had an overpotential of 311 mV.

The measurements included thin oxide films covered by a protective Nafion (TM) layer and thicker composite Nafion (TM)-oxide electrodes. The time constants for the low-frequency diffusion process were approximately the same for both types of electrodes, indicating diffusion in individual particles in the porous electrode rather than across the film. The diffusion process involves trapping of the diffusion species. The impedance data indicated that there were no significant variations in conductivity of the oxides with potential, as opposed to what appears to be the case for anodically formed iridium oxide films (AIROF). This is interpreted to reflect differences in electronic structure between NIROF and AIROF. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a heterogeneity metal-organic framework (MOF) is prepared by the assembling of metals, terephthalic (A) and 2-aminoterephthalic ligands (B), defined as A(2.7)B-MOF-FeCo1.6. More importantly, A(2.7)B-MOF-FeCo1.6 exhibits excellent OER activity with an ultralow overpotential of 288 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1). The high electrocatalytic performance for OER is attributed to the optimized electronic structure of the intrinsic catalytic center in MOFs via the engineering of the metal node and linkers. The work offers not only a benchmark for pure MOFs in electrocatalysis but also a new efficient strategy to improve electrocatalytic performance by electronic structure engineering of catalytic active centers in MOFs.									175	12	0	0	9	0	175			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000447257000006

The multielectron transfer OER process involves multiple reaction intermediates, and a high overpotential is needed to overcome the sluggish kinetics. Among the different water splitting devices, proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer offers greater advantages. However, current anode OER electrocatalysts in PEM electrolyzers are limited to precious iridium and ruthenium oxides. Developing highly active, stable, and precious-metal-free electrocatalysts for water oxidation in acidic media is attractive for the large-scale application of PEM electrolyzers. In recent years, various types of precious-metal-free catalysts such as carbon-based materials, earth-abundant transition metal oxides, and multiple metal oxide mixtures have been investigated and some of them show promising activity and stability for acidic OER. In this review, the thermodynamics of water oxidation, Pourbaix diagram of metal elements in aqueous solution, and theoretical screening and prediction of precious-metal-free electrocatalysts for acidic OER are first elaborated. The catalytic performance, reaction kinetics, and mechanisms together with future research directions regarding acidic OER are summarized and discussed.									40	1	0	0	1	0	40			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000665750800001	34169587

Transition-metal carbides (TMCs) with high catalytic activity and low cost have attracted great interests. Nevertheless, utilizing an efficient catalyst for overall water splitting is still a challenging issue for TMCs. Herein, we report the synthesis of a high-performance electrocatalyst comprising Co3ZnC and Co nanoparticles embedded in a nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube-grafted carbon polyhedral (Co3ZnC/Co-NCCP) by the pyrolysis of bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks in a reductive atmosphere of Ar/H-2. The Co3ZnC/Co-NCCP exhibits remarkable electrochemical activity in catalyzing both the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, in terms of low overpotential and excellent stability. Furthermore, the Co3ZnC/Co-NCCP catalyst leads to a highly performed overall water splitting in the 1 M KOH electrolyte, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low applied external potential of 1.65 V and shows good stability without obvious deactivation after 10 h operation. The present strategy opens a new avenue to the design of efficient electrocatalysts in electrochemical applications.									57	3	0	0	4	0	57			1944-8244			WOS:000426143900021	29376634

In each preparation, nitrates of constituent metal were taken as starting materials and egg white as gelling agent. The material, thus obtained was altered in the form of film electrode on the pre-treated Ni- support using an oxide-slurry painting technique and investigated as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction in KOH solutions. The study showed that Mn-substitution in the base oxide matrix influences the electrocatalytic activity of the material significantly and found to be greatest with 0.5 mol Mn-substitution. The reaction order has been found to be approximately unity with respect to OH- concentration. The Tafel slope values at low potential ranged between similar to 52 and similar to 65 mVdecade(-1). The thermodynamic parameters namely, standard apparent electrochemical enthalpy of activation (Delta H-el degrees(not equal)), standard enthalpy of activation (Delta H degrees(not equal)) and standard entropy of activation (Delta S degrees(not equal)) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have also been determined. It has been observed that Delta H-el degrees(not equal) and Delta H degrees(not equal) values decreased with Mn-substitution in the Fe3O4 lattice. This decrease in Delta H-el degrees(not equal) and Delta H degrees(not equal) was found to be greatest with 0.5 mol Mn.

To accelerate the reaction kinetics for the OER, it becomes important to design a hybrid interfacial material with an improved synergistic effect. In this work, Co-Fe layered double-hydroxide nanosheets are synthesized where WO3 nanoparticles (NPs) were introduced on the nanosheets using an appropriately planned hydrothermal reaction. When the molar ratio of Co : Fe : W precursors is kept at 3 : 1 : 0.1 during the synthesis of the catalyst, the activity of the catalyst synthesized was found to be the best. Herein, it was observed that the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) gets enhanced abruptly when tungsten oxide NPs were formed on the surface of the CoFeLDH nanosheet. The catalyst operates with an overpotential of 270 mV to drive a current density of 20 mA cm(-2), exhibiting a Tafel slope value of 120 mV dec(-1). The catalyst is extremely stable and has shown a long-term stability of more than 120 h at 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline medium. This work opens up a wide avenue to modify LDHs with a third metal ion, which improves the performance of the catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000847702400001

Although precious metal-based materials, such as RuO2, IrO(2)and their hybrids with other components, performed excellently as OER electrocatalysts, their high cost has limited practical applications. Consequently, earth-abundant metal components including Fe, Co, and Ni have been investigated as alternatives. In this work, the hybridization of Ni-containing species with conductive carbon-based materials was used to prevent aggregation of active species and improve electrochemical catalytic performance. A new hybrid material composed of NiO nanoparticles and N-doped carbon materials was prepared. The NiO particles with a narrow size distribution were well dispersed on the surface of carbon-based materials. The hybrid showed improved electrocatalytic performance for OER than single components of NiO and N-doped carbon materials.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1976-4251	2233-4998		WOS:000565251500003

FeTAPP-NiTCPP-POP was stable over a long period under reaction conditions. These bimetallic POPs exhibit better catalytic activity than their monometallic counterparts, due to synergetic interactions between the iron and nickel centers to facilitate the electrocatalytic process.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000613400900001

Nevertheless, the large-scale applications of water electrolysis are still intractable issues hindered by the high overpotentials and inferior reaction kinetics on the anode. Herein, a facile one-step hydrothermal method was applied to in situ growth the Fe and V co-doped Ni3S2 electrocatalyst on nickel foam substrate (Fe, V-Ni3S2/NF). In 1 M KOH electrolyte, the as-prepared Fe, V-Ni3S2/NF electrode exhibited an improved water oxidation activity with ultralow overpotentials of 253 and 370 mV to realize large current densities of 100 and 1000 mA/cm(2), respectively. More importantly, the Fe, V-Ni3S2/NF electrode existed an activation process during 100 h chronopotentiometry testing period. Detailed characterizations revealed that elements of V and S in the electrocatalyst were oxidized and dissolved into the electrolyte, making the electrocatalyst undergo surface reconstruction and resulting in a faster kinetic reaction rate, thus leading to enhanced oxygen evolution reaction activities. Collectively, the resultant Fe, V-Ni3S2/NF in this work provides new cogitation towards design and synthesis of low-cost electrocatalyst with large current densities for water oxidation.

In particular, the oxygen p-band center has been used to guide material discovery and fundamental understanding of an array of perovskite compounds for use in catalyzing the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. However, an assessment of the effectiveness of the oxygen p-band center at predicting key measures of perovskite catalytic activity has not been made and would be highly beneficial to guide future predictions and codify best practices. Here, we have used density functional theory at the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE), PBEsol, PBE + U, strongly constrained and appropriately normed functional, and Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) levels to assess the correlations of numerous measures of catalytic performance for a series of technologically relevant perovskite oxides, using the bulk oxygen p-band center as an electronic structure descriptor. We have analyzed correlations of the calculated oxygen p-band center for all considered functionals with the experimentally measured X-ray emission spectroscopy oxygen p-band center and multiple measures of catalytic activity, including high-temperature oxygen reduction surface exchange rates, aqueous oxygen evolution current densities, and binding energies of oxygen evolution intermediate species. Our results show that the best correlations for all measures of catalytic activity considered here are made with PBE-level calculations, with strong observed linear correlations with the bulk oxygen p-band center (R-2 = 0.81-0.87). This study shows that strong linear correlations between numerous important measures of catalytic activity and the oxygen p-band bulk descriptor can be obtained under a consistent computational framework, and these correlations can serve as a guide for future experiments and simulations for development of perovskite and related oxide catalysts.									62	1	0	0	4	0	62			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000458937800018

To solve this bottleneck, herein, a simple one-pot colloidal approach is reported to yield crystalline intermetallic nickel silicide (Ni2Si), which results in a promising precatalyst for anodic OER. Subsequently, an anodic-coupled electrosynthesis for the selective oxidation of organic amines (as sacrificial proton donating agents) to value-added organocyanides is established to boost the cathodic reaction. A partial transformation of the Ni2Si intermetallic precatalyst generates a porous nickel(oxy)hydroxide phase modified with oxidic silicon species as unequivocally demonstrated by a combination of quasi in situ Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopy as well as ex situ methods. The activated form of the catalyst generates a geometric current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential (eta(100)) of 348 mV displaying long-term durability over a week and high efficiency in paired electrolysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000797789900001

The onset potential, current density at 2.025 V (vs. BEE), and Tafel slope of OER in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH for MNF-Co(OH)(2)@RGONF modified glassy carbon electrode (MNF-Co(OH)(2)@RGONF/GCE) were about 1.505 mV (vs. RHE), 227 mA cm(-2) and 63 mV dec(-1), respectively. So that the current density and Tafel slope of this electrocatalyst are better than commercial IrO2. Furthermore, it was concluded that MNF-Co (OH)(2)@RGONF/GCE due to four-electron transfer mechanism, an overvoltage about 775 mV (vs. RHE), better durability and stronger resistance rather than Pt/C (20%) at 0.436 V in KOH 0.10 mol L-1 (with the addition of methanol to electrochemical cell), has a high catalytic activity for ORR.									13	1	0	0	1	0	13			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000418973200002

These Co3O4/NBGHSs are highly active for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions and can exhibit higher electrocatalytic activities and better durability than commercial Pt/C and RuO2/C, respectively, demonstrating them to be efficient bi-functional electrocatalysts. In-depth analysis shows that the coupling between Co3O4 and NBGHSs, strong interaction with adsorbed O-2, high electric conductivity, and the specific hollow structure play important roles in imparting the higher electrocatalytic activities to the Co3O4/NBGHSs. When tested as cathode catalysts for Zn-air batteries, the Co3O4/NBGHSs exhibit better performance and higher stability than the Pt/C catalyst and other catalysts reported previously. This strongly suggests that the Co3O4/NBGHSs could be used as efficient electrocatalysts for metal-air batteries with great potential to replace precious metal/carbon based materials.									137	5	0	0	5	0	137			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000374790700015

Here, it is demonstrated that the oxygen vacancy is not the key point for RP to realize high ORR and OER activity at high temperature. Instead, interstitial O2- with high concentration and fast migration, and lattice oxygen with high activity are favorable for the high-temperature catalytic activity. Aliovalent cation doping is an effective strategy to modify the catalytic activity. For the RP catalysts, low-valence ion doping does not introduce oxygen vacancies, which suppresses the activity of lattice oxygen and decreases the interstitial O2- concentration; whereas high-valence ion doping enhances the interstitial O2- concentration and the lattice oxygen activity. The evaluations of six RP series (La2NiO4, La2CoO4, La3Co2O7, La4Ni3O10, La2MnO4, and La2CuO4 based) and twenty samples as oxygen electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) demonstrate that this finding is applicable to all the selected RP series.									32	6	0	0	2	0	35			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000484274000005

However, its broad application is inhibited by the costly raw materials, noble-metal catalysts and the toxic effect of organic molecules on catalysts. Herein, we report a novel anti-poisoning MP-MOx (M = Ni, Fe and Mo) bifunctional catalyst that can combine the energy-saving H-2 production with sewage disposal simultaneously by directly electrolyzing the wastewater containing organic molecules. The MP-MOx catalyst expresses a commendable electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction and electrooxidation decomposition of small organic molecules (EDM), as well as a remarkable anti-toxicity for organic molecules and a long-term durability. As compared with traditional water electrolysis, the organic electrolytic system exhibits an excellent cell efficient with a cell voltage reducing of 120 mV and can dramatically allow electrical energy savings up to 8% at 10 mA cm(-2).									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000552015900019

Herein, we report a facile electrodeposition approach combined with subsequent thermal treatment to grow Fe-Co-P on the porous carbon membrane with Magnolia leaves as precursor (Fe-Co-P/C). The three-dimensional porous carbon frameworks as substrate provide superior electrical conductivity for Fe-Co-P/C electrodes. The strong coupling between Fe-Co-P and porous carbon framework keeps the stable electron and ion transport channels for the electrode materials in the sodium ion batteries and oxygen evolution reactions. The Fe-Co-P/C as anode materials for sodium ion batteries deliver a high discharge capacity of 464 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1). After 500 cycles at the current density of 0.5 A g(-1), the capacity of the electrode still retain 293 mAh g(-1), which is attributed to the porous carbon framework to confine the Fe-Co-P in the composites and prevent the Fe-Co-P nanoparticles from aggregating. On the other hand, the Fe-Co -P also exhibit high-efficient performance for oxygen evolution reaction with the overpotential of 151 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slope of 77.78 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH. Our research provides a unique carbon substrate material with hierarchical nanostructure and new design stagey for bimetallic phosphide based electrode for sodium ion batteries and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reactions.

Herein, PdAg bimetallic nanoparticles encapsulated in porous carbon have been prepared and utilized as effective electrocatalysts for both ORR and HER. The surface microstructure, crystal structure, as well as electronic charge states of the bimetallic particles encapsulated in porous carbon were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. In the bimetallic PdxAg100-x (x represents the initial atomic Pd ratio in PdAg alloys) series, the Pd50Ag50 sample exhibited the best performance, of which its ORR activity and long-term stability were superior to Pd/C in alkaline media along with its HER performance was comparable with Pd/C in acid solution. The study provides a reliable method for fabricating carbon substrate supported bimetallic alloys with good activity and robust stability toward ORR, HER and beyond.									8	0	0	0	0	0	7			1452-3981			WOS:000483307100036

Most DFT calculations of the OER use an acidic reaction mechanism and the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) as reference electrode. However, experimental studies are usually carried out under alkaline conditions using the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) as reference electrode. The difference between the conditions in experiment and calculations is then usually taken into account by applying a pH-dependent correction factor to the latter. As, however, the OER reaction mechanisms under acidic and under alkaline conditions are quite different, it is not clear a priori whether a simple correction factor can account for this difference. We derive in this paper step by step the theory to simulate the OER based on the alkaline reaction mechanism and explain the OER process with this mechanism and the RHE as reference electrode. We compare the mechanisms for alkaline and acidic OER catalysis and highlight the roles of the RHE and the SHE. Our detailed analysis validates current OER simulations in the literature and explains the differences in OER calculations with acidic and alkaline mechanisms.									42	1	0	0	0	0	41			2515-7655			WOS:000629535000001

On the basis of a kinetic analysis of oxygen evolution and chlorophyll a fluorescence yield, the authors showed, in 1964, that the PS II photochemical reaction involved in the formation of oxygen is not a first-order process. We concluded that excitation energy localized in a 'photosynthetic unit' including a reduced primary acceptor is transferred with a high probability to neighboring PS II units.

This study introduces a novel precious metal-free Ti0.35V0.35Sn0.25Sb0.05-oxide electrocatalyst which selectively conducts the reaction pathway towards ClER with a high faradaic current efficiency of similar to 88%. The electrocatalyst and its electrochemical activity were scrutinized by various techniques such as field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and linear scanning voltammetry (LSV). A decent overpotential difference (DE) between oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and chlorine evolution reactions (ClER) was attributed to the reasonable design of the electrocatalyst composite. Namely, the geometric structure and surface properties of the synthesized electrocatalyst, as well as the associated electrochemical selectivity was tuned by incorporation of vanadium pentoxide, antimony and tin oxide in the electrocatalyst material. In addition, the electronic properties of the synthesized electrocatalysts including band structure and the corresponding electron density were studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664182900003

Herein, we report a self-supported electrode of the monolithic copper oxides directly on Cu wires [CW@Cu(I/II)NPs, as a working electrode] for full splitting water. In alkaline solution, with the electrode, OER occurs at the potential scope of 0.00 similar to +0.21 V and HER happens at the range of + 0.85 similar to +1.25 V with rough gas releasing. The activity of the electrode can be retrieved during the interactive electrochemical processes of OER and HER, which process shows decent stability. It is possible to save energy in industrial electrolysis water with the proposed electrode. The phenomena remind us of reassessing electrocatalytic ability of copper oxides or other metal oxides and provide a new design idea for metal wire-based electrodes for water splitting with low energy consumption.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000510846500173

At a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotentials of P,N-PCCo/rGO during acidic hydrogen evolution (HER) and alkaline oxygen evolution (OER) are 89 mV and 235 mV, respectively. The performance is significantly enhanced with increasing current density, even better than commercial Pt/C and IrO2 in electrocatalytic water splitting. Besides, P,N-PCCo/rGO have a large half-wave potential (similar to 0.872 V) and kinetic current J(k) (11.76 mA cm(-2)) for oxygen evolution reaction (ORR). GO together with porous carbon constrains the growth of Co particles based on assisted synthesis. P, N co-doped Co particles cause lattice defects of carbon, which form multiple active sites and provide more reaction channels for active species, thereby improving the HER, OER and ORR performance of the P,N-PCCo/rGO trifunctional catalyst. GO-assisted preparation of ultra-thin porous P,N-PCCo/rGO samples has laid a solid foundation for designing and implementing a series of multifunctional catalysts for graphene oxide-based heteroatoms (N, P, S, etc.) doped with non-noble metal embedded porous carbon.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2199-692X			WOS:000823706500001

They operate on two underlying processes, namely, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It provides the impetus to design efficient, earth-abundant and economic bifunctional electrocatalysts vis-a-vis precious metal-based catalysts. In this perspective, a few polyanionic battery insertion materials have been reported as potential electrocatalysts. In the current work, metal fluorophosphate (Na2MPO4F, M = Fe/Co/Mn) family of sodium insertion materials have been shown as a new class of bifunctional electrocatalysts with robust structural stability. In particular, Na2CoPO4F was found to exhibit superior catalytic performance with an onset potential of 0.903 V (vs. RHE) for the ORR and an overpotential of 380 mV (vs. RHE) for the OER. The underlying mechanism and kinetics were explored using ab initio computational studies. Overall, polyanionic transition metal fluorophosphates were explored for the first time as bifunctional electrocatalysts capable of working as potential cathode materials in hybrid metal-air batteries.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000572173300051

Herein, we report a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst, mesoporous nickel-iron nitride (Ni3FeN), which was synthesized by thermal ammonalysis of hierarchal NiFe layered double hydroxide microspheres. Different from the widely studied carbon/oxide composite catalysts, this metallic nitride does not need carbon as a conducting support, thus avoiding the issue of carbon corrosion at high potentials. The catalysts provide outstanding bifunctional performance with a low overpotential (0.355 V) at 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope (70 mV dec(-1)) for OER, and a positive half-wave potential (0.78 V) for ORR under alkaline solution. More importantly, it delivers a lower voltage gap between charge and discharge and a better stability over 300 cycles compared to that of the more costly RuO2 air-cathode.									171	7	0	0	5	0	172			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000408878200009

Progress in vacancy chemistry has enabled advances in many technological applications, but creating new type of vacancies in existing material system remains a big challenge. We show here that ionized nitrogen plasma can break bonds of iron-carbon-nitrogen-nickel units in nickel-iron Prussian blue analogues, forming unconventional carbon-nitrogen vacancies. We study oxygen evolution reaction on the carbon-nitrogen vacancy-mediated Prussian blue analogues, which exhibit a low overpotential of 283 millivolts at 10 milliamperes per square centimeter in alkali, far exceeding that of original Prussian blue analogues and previously reported oxygen evolution catalysts with vacancies. We ascribe this enhancement to the in-situ generated nickel-iron oxy(hydroxide) active layer during oxygen evolution reaction, where the Fe leaching was significantly suppressed by the unconventional carbon-nitrogen vacancies. This work opens up opportunities for producing vacancy defects in nanomaterials for broad applications.									113	2	0	0	6	0	113			2041-1723			WOS:000472840400014	31243269

Such values are comparable to contemporary noble-metal catalysts and even lower than reported non-precious catalysts. Moreover, this hybrid shows high current density, lower Tafel slope, and excellent stability.

However, its ultrathin structure suffers instability because of the lone pair electrons exposed at the surface, which badly restricts durability for achieving long-term OER catalysis. Herein, a facile solvothermal reduction route is designed to fabricate Co/BP NSs hybrid electrocatalyst by in situ growth of cobalt nanoparticles on BP NSs. Notably, electronic structure engineering of Co/BP NSs catalyst is observed by electron migration from BP to Co due to the higher Fermi level of BP than that of Co. Because of the preferential migration of the active lone pairs from the defect of BP NSs, the stability and high hole mobility can be effectively retained. Consequently, Co/BP NSs electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding OER performance, with an overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and excellent stability in alkaline media, indicating the potential for the alternatives of commercial IrO2.

RuO2 shows relatively low cost but poor stability. Here, the critical role of sulfate anion doping in promoting OER activity and stability of RuO2 is reported. Coupled with the Fe cation doping, the sulfate-functionalized RuFeOx (S-RuFeOx) displays a remarkable OER performance with a low overpotential of 187 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in acid, and much enhanced stability. The excellent OER activity of S-RuFeOx is attributed to the dual positive effects that the sulfate dopants weaken the adsorption of the *OO-H intermediate, and Fe dopants promote the deprotonation of chemisorbed water molecules to form *OOH. The enhanced stability is in part due to the sulfate dopants which stabilize the lattice oxygen. These results demonstrate that the anion and cation co-doped RuO2 is a promising candidate for highly efficient OER electrocatalysts.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000656165500001

Understanding how the crystallinity and surface facets of branched nanoparticles affect their catalytic performance is vital for further catalyst development. In this work, a synthesis is developed to form highly branched ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles with control of crystallinity. It is shown that faceted Ru branched nanoparticles have improved stability and activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared with polycrystalline Ru nanoparticles. This work achieves a low 180 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) for hours, demonstrating that record-high stability for Ru nanocrystals can be achieved while retaining high activity for OER. The superior electrocatalytic performance of faceted Ru branched nanoparticles is ascribed to the lower Ru dissolution rate under OER conditions due to low-index facets on the branch surfaces.									33	1	0	0	1	0	33			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000472200400001	30913370

The NiCo2O4 powders were analyzed by TGA, XRD, BET, SEM, and EDS. And the electrocatalytic properties of NiCo2O4/Ni electrode for oxygen evolution in alkaline solution were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, roughness factor, Tafel curves and stability testing. The result shows that the preparation temperature can affect the formation, specific surface area, morphologies, and electrocatalytic properties of NiCo2O4 spinel oxide. It is also found that NiCo2O4/Ni electrode prepared at 300degreesC has better electrocatalytic properties in oxygen evolution reaction than those prepared at other temperatures.

These oxygen activities result in the oxide formation and oxygen vacancy formation that affect the nanoscale crystal phase and morphology within these materials and their subsequent bulk chemical behavior. In this study, two selected earlier transition metals manganese and cobalt as well as two selected later transition metals copper and nickel that are important to chemical looping reactions are investigated when they undergo cyclic redox reactions. We found Co microparticles exhibited increased Coo impurity presence when oxidized to Co3O4 upon cyclic oxidation; CuO redox cycles prefer to be limited to a reduced form of Cu2O and an oxidized form of CuO; Mn microparticles were oxidized to a mixed phases of MnO and Mn3O4, which causes delamination during oxidation. For Ni microparticles, a dense surface were observed during the redox reaction. The atomistic thermodynamics methods and density functional theory (OFF) calculations are carried out to elucidate the effect of oxygen dissociation and migration on the morphological evolution of nanostructures during the redox processes. Our results indicate that the earlier transition metals (Mn and Co) tend to have stronger interaction with O-2 than the later transition metals (Ni and Cu). Also, our modified Bronsted Evans Polanyi (BEP) relationship for reaction energies and total reaction barriers reveals that reactions of earlier transition metals are more exergonic and have lower oxygen dissociation barriers than those of later transition metals. In addition, it was found that for these transition metal oxides the oxygen vacancy formation energies increase with the depth. The oxide in the higher oxidation state of transition metal has lower vacancy formation energy, which can facilitate forming the defective nano structures. The fundamental understanding of these metal oxide reactions is essential to designing the metal oxide-based oxygen carriers for chemical looping applications. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

The development of efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting has drawn much attention. However, catalysts that are active for both the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions are rare. Herein, we show for the first time that nickel phosphide (Ni2P), an excellent hydrogen evolving catalyst, is also highly active for oxygen evolution. A current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is generated at an overpotential of only 290mV in 1M KOH. The high activity is attributed to the core-shell (Ni2P/NiOx) structure that the material adopts under catalytic conditions. The Ni2P nanoparticles can serve as both cathode and anode catalysts for an alkaline electrolyzer, which generates 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.63 V.									1251	67	0	0	37	0	1257			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000358730600009

Here, we report an atomic-level design and construction of a new type of organometallic Au1Nx single-site confined on organic carbon-nitride support as a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient and durable oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution reaction (OER) performance. The combination of atomic characterizations and theoretical calculations confirm that the atomically dispersed Au1+ atoms are grafted onto carbon-nitride support by covalent Au-N bonds via an amine-induced-reduction strategy, forming atomic Au1Nx single-sites with potential oxygen-related catalytic activity. Hence, this developed Au1Nx single-site electrocatalyst could exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity and durability with extraordinarily large mass activities of similar to 9000 A center dot g(Au)(-1) for ORR at the half-wave potential 0.76 V, and of similar to 1500A center dot g(Au)(-1) for OER at overpotential 0.45 V, 20-26 times higher than those of benchmarking Pt/C and RuO2 electrocatalysts.									61	7	0	0	3	0	62			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000427924000013

J	Wu, Qikang; Wang, Songrui; Guo, Jiahui; Feng, Xueqing; Li, Han; Lv, Shanshan; Zhou, Yan; Chen, Zheng								Insight into sulfur and iron effect of binary nickel-iron sulfide on oxygen evolution reaction								NANO RESEARCH				15	3			1901	1908		10.1007/s12274-021-3800-6		SEP 2021		MAR 2022	2022	Nickel-iron sulfide has shown attractive activity in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the effects of low valence sulfur (S2-) and metal species on OER in binary nickel-iron sulfide have rarely been systematically studied. Works based on post-catalysis characterization have led to the assumption that the real active species are nickel-iron oxyhydroxide, and that nickel-iron sulfide acts only as a precatalyst. Therefore, to study the role of S, Ni, and Fe for the development of nickel-iron sulfide catalyst is of self-evident importance. Herein, a facile solvothermal method is used to synthesize acetylene black coated with nickel-iron sulfide nanosheets. Electrochemical tests show that the presence of low valence S species makes the catalyst have faster OER kinetics, larger active area, and intermediate active species adsorption area. Therefore, the present study reveals the enhancing effect of low valence sulfur species (S2-) on OER in binary nickel-iron sulfide. In situ Raman spectroscopy shows that the generation of gamma-NiOOH intermediate is essential and Fe does not directly participate in the oxygen production. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that Ni-OH deprotonation is a rate-determining step for both binary nickel-iron sulfide and nickel sulfide. The addition of Fe into NiSx lightly increases the charge transfer of Ni atom to O atom, which makes deprotonation easier and thereby improves the OER performance.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000693361000004

We report herein that semimetallic Cu3P nanoarrays directly grown on 3D copper foam (CF) substrate can function as effective electrocatalysts for water oxidation. Specifically, the surface oxidation activated Cu3P only required a relatively low overpotential of 412 mV to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and displayed a small Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1) in 0.1 M KOH solution, on account of the collaborative effect of large roughness factor (RF) and semimetallic character. Following that, investigations into the mechanism revealed the formation of a unique active phase during the water oxidation process in which conductive Cu3P was the core covered with a thin copper oxide/hydroxide layer. Moreover, this Cu3P 3D electrode was also applied to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and showed good catalytic performance and stability under the same basic conditions.									125	9	0	0	6	0	128			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000382902800035	27559613

Co-Mn LDH was electrodeposited on Ni foam without gas purging. In contrast, the product grown by electrodeposition with N-2 purging changes to Co9S8/Co3O4 heterostructure with the assistance of annealing. This remarkable distinction is mainly due to the decrease of concentration of hydroxide ions (produced by the reduction of NO3-) near electrode surface where the ion transport is remarkably enhanced by N-2 purging. The heterostructure has shown superior performance for water splitting, especially for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The 250 mV overpotential (@ 10 mA . cm(-2)) and 73.54 mV . dec(-1) Tafel slope required for OER are lower than that of the state-of-the-art Co-based composites. It has also demonstrated excellent durability in alkaline media indicating its promising potential for practical application in industry.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000530698600009

Their structural flexibility enable self-adjusting of electronic structure depending on potential. The rich chemistry of borophosphate provides a huge engineering space to tune composition and structure. Herein, amorphized LiNiFe borophosphate (a-LNFBPO) for an efficient and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is first reported. Facile adsorption of oxygen intermediates on the vacancies generated by spontaneous Li dissolution during the OER and regulated electronic structure resulting from the Ni and Fe interaction can boost the OER. The amorphization of LiNiFe borophosphate modifies the electronic structure with metal-oxygen (M-O) bond contraction and the high valence state of the metal cations, which reduces the charge transfer energy between the catalyst and electrolyte. In addition, abundant defects, dangling bonds, and a disordered arrangement induced by amorphization enable an improvement in structural flexibility, facilitating a facile and entire transformation of originally inert species into the active phase during the OER process. The a-LNFBPO@Ni foam shows excellent OER properties requiring only a 215 mV overpotential for generating 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability over 300 h.									44	0	0	0	0	0	44			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000651034400001

However, their real phases during catalysis have not been comprehensively identified, leading to improper advancement in material recognition and theoretical simulation. In this work, in situ spatially coherent transmitted X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy were developed to probe Fe-doped cobalt phosphides, presenting superior catalytic activity and reaction kinetics for overall water electrolysis compared to pristine cobalt phosphides. The results showed that Fe dopants latched the crystallographic sites and stabilized the phosphide phase, which are the active species for hydrogen evolution reaction, while pristine cobalt phosphide transformed into hydroxides that impede the formation of active substances. Besides, Fe-doped cobalt phosphides swiftly converted into active-site confined oxyhydroxide for oxygen evolution reaction, achieving superb overall catalytic performance. The genuine materials unveiled during the electrocatalysis suggest that the appropriate catalytic mechanism correlates with the phase transition and crystalline transformation rate.									43	2	0	0	7	0	43			2380-8195			WOS:000503114500007

However, restricted to poor conductivity and lack of active sites, Co3O4 usually exhibits limited experimental capacitance and OER activity, barely satisfying high energy density delivering of supercapacitors and low energy input of water-splitting systems. Herein, we report O-2(2-)/O- functionalized oxygen-deficient Co3O4 nanorods for supercapacitor and water splitting dual applications. The CoC2O4 center dot 2H(2)O converted oxygen-deficient Co3O4 nanorods show enhanced electrical conductivity as confirmed by the increased carrier density. The increased number of Co2+ sites (oxygen vacancies) and CoOOH are believed to contribute to the improvement in faradaic reactions and OER activity. Additionally, surface functionalization by O-2(2-)/O- is realized in oxygen-deficient Co3O4 nanorods. On the basis of these merits, the as-synthesized Co3O4 nanorods demonstrate a significantly high specific capacitance of 739 F g(-1) and an ultralow overpotential of 275 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER with ultralong stability of over 300 h (@ 100 mA cm(-2)). Specifically, an electrolyzer for overall water splitting can be driven by asymmetric supercapacitors with the optimized cobalt oxide as both electrocatalyst and electrode material.									238	16	0	0	9	0	241			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000405202800019

The self-supported FeNiP@NFO catalyst exhibits prominent catalytic activity for a hydrogen evolution reaction with overpotentials as low as 64, 82, and 54 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) in 1.0 M PBS, 1.0 M KOH, and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively, surpassing most reported non-noble catalysts. Moreover, FeNiP@NFO requires an overpotential of 193 mV in 1.0 M KOH to drive 10 mA.cm(-2) for an oxygen evolution reaction. The overall water-splitting electrolyzer assembled with FeNiP@NFO as both the anodic and cathodic electrodes exhibits an extremely low cell voltage of 1.49 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), which is much lower than that of most alkaline electrolysis systems. The extraordinary electrocatalytic activity of FeNiP@NFO is ascribed to the synergistic effect between elements and the special network compiled by nanosheet arrays, which offers high conductivity, abundant accessible active sites, easy hydrogen release channels, and fast electron transportation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000823222400001

Herein, an efficient bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalyst of N, P co-doped hollow carbon fiber decorated with island-like Ni2P nanoparticles (Ni2P@HCF-900) is reported with PPy template. The unique fiber morphology and hollow structure, which not only facilitates the penetration-transmission of O2 and electrolyte, but also exposes more active sites, moreover, the synergistic effect between Ni2P and N, P co-doped carbon is also obtained to benefit bifunctional oxygen catalytic activities. In 0.1 M alkaline KOH solution, Ni2P@HCF-900 delivers a promising half-wave potential of 0.803 V and a quasi-four electron pathway for ORR, a low overpotential of 366 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for OER.

NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) composite, an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, suffers from slow hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics, restricting its application for overall water splitting. Herein, we construct the hierarchical MoS2/NiFe LDH nanosheets with a heterogeneous interface used for HER and OER. Benefiting the hierarchical heterogeneous interface optimized hydrogen Gibbs free energy, tens of exposed active sites, rapid mass- and charge-transfer processes, the MoS2/NiFe LDH displays a highly efficient synergistic electrocatalytic effect. The MoS2/NiFe LDH electrode in 1 mol/L KOH exhibits excellent HER activity, only 98 mV overpotential at 10 mA/cm(2). Significantly, when it assembled as anode and cathode for overall water splitting, only 1.61 V cell voltage was required to achieve 10 mA/cm(2) with excellent durability (50 h).

Herein, we reported the fabrication of a superaerophobic Ni-Fe based OER catalyst by a novel and controllable pulse electrochemical approach. Unlike a traditional pulse electrodepositon which was done either cathodically or anodically, in our method both anodic and cathodic current are alternately adopted in a single pulse. Therefore, porous Ni-Fe nanosheets were self-assembled directly onto the Ni foil substrate owing to an in-situ dissolution/re-precipitation process and gas-releasing induced effect. The as-prepared Ni-Fe based electrode exhibits excellent catalytic activity and outstanding durability towards OER. The overpotential for the OER is as low as 250 mV at 10 mA/cm(2). The catalytic reaction can last over 140 h without observable decay. The Tafel slope for the catalytic reaction is only 29.7 mV/dec. The high electrocatalytic performance is attributed to both the enhancement of its intrinsic activity and the self-optimizing microstructure of electrode. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, power density, energy density, and cycle life of these metal-air batteries can be improved further by utilizing the fast faradaic reactions of metal ions in the catalyst layer together with the oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR) for charge storage. In this work, we propose mixed metal phosphates of nickel and cobalt, NixCo3-x(PO4)(2) (x = 0,1, 1.5, 2, and 3), as multifunctional air-cathodes exhibiting bifunctional electrocatalytic activity and reversible metal redox reaction (M3+/2+, M = Ni and Co). Submicron-sized NixCo3-x(PO4)(2) particles were synthesized by a solution combustion synthesis technique with urea acting as the fuel. Electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0.1 M NaOH was systematically tuned by varying the Ni-to-Co ratio. The synthesized NixCo3-x(PO4)(2) with x = 1.5 (NCP11) showed superior bifunctional catalytic activity to other samples. Moreover, the catalyst material delivered a specific capacity of , similar to 110 mAh g(-1) by the redox reactions of its metal sites. The hybrid Na-air battery fabricated using the NCP11 catalyst-loaded aircathode exhibited low overpotential, stable cycling performance, and round-trip energy efficiency exceeding 78% in a 0.1 M NaOH aqueous electrolyte.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000487179900029	31429545

It was found that the electrocatalytic activity of iridium nanoparticles is associated to the formation of Ir 5d electron holes. Strong Ir 5d and O 2p hybridization, however, leads to a concomitant increase O 2p hole character, making oxygen electron deficient and susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. Consequently, more efficient electrocatalysts can be synthesized by increasing the number of electron-holes shared between the metal d and oxygen 2p.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			0039-6028	1879-2758		WOS:000460496100002

In order to investigate the effect of oxygen incorporation in the MoSx catalyst, oxygen-incorporated MoOxSy catalysts with various oxygen contents were prepared on carbon fiber papers (CFPs) by chemical bath deposition. The oxygen content and chemical states of MoOxSy catalysts were controlled by adjusting the reducing agent concentration of Na2S2O4 in order to reveal the relation between chemical states and HER performance. Compared to oxygen-free MoSx catalysts, the oxygen-incorporated MoOxSy catalysts exhibit more excellent activity for HER. One of the MoOxSy catalysts requires an overpotential of 164 mV to reach a cathodic current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with a Tafel slope of 43 mV/dec representing the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. The high performance is attributed to enhanced activity and/or higher electrical conductivity due to the presence of Mo5+ state in the MoOxSy catalysts.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000471996400112

Currently, it remains challenging to achieve such trifunctionality on a single catalyst, although many systems can exhibit either one or two activities. Herein, on the basis of first-principles calculations, Ni-doped Janus monolayer MoSSe with superior electrocatalytic activity toward ORR for fuel cells and OER for water splitting is proposed. Both its ORR and OER display an ultralow overpotential, and the ORR possesses a high selectivity with the Faradaic efficiency approximating 100%. Importantly, it further shows high performance of Na-O-2 batteries with a low overpotential of 0.49/0.59 V for ORR/OER, suggesting it being the excellent trifunctional catalyst. Such catalytic behaviors are largely due to the synergistic effect of the built-in electric field and heteroatom doping. These findings not only gain deeper insight into the catalytic activity of Janus monolayer MoSSe but also guide developing effective trifunctional electrocatalysts.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000537731900043	32383377

In this work, we report the fabrication of the WO3 nanoneedles/nickel-borate composite photoanodes for efficient photoelectrochemical OER, with the high-aspect-ratio nanoneedles as light-absorbing material and the nickel-borate (Ni-B-i) as oxygen-evolving catalyst. We demonstrate that the combination of Ni-B-i with WO3 nanoneedles significantly enhances the activity of the photoanode toward OER by negatively shifting the onset potential of the photocurrent and improving the photocurrent within the entire oxygen-evolving potential region. Moreover, the WO3 nanoneedles/Ni-B-i composite photoanodes exhibit superior stability to the WO3 nanoneedles photoanodes in borate buffer solution at all oxygen-evolving potentials. The present result offers promising opportunities for using Ni-B-i as an oxygen-evolving catalyst to modify semiconductor photoanode to improve solar-to-oxygen efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Electrochemical water splitting powered by renewable electricity provides a promising strategy for H-2 production, but its energy efficiency is strongly limited by the kinetically sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which consumes approximate to 90% electricity in the water-splitting process. A new strategy is urgently needed to reduce its energy consumption. Small-molecule electro-oxidation reactions that replace OER have attracted increasing attention due to the advantages of low theoretical thermodynamic potential and the benefit of producing value-added chemicals compared with OER. Hybrid electrolysis systems, by coupling cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with anodic small-molecule oxidation reactions, have been proposed, which can produce high-purity H-2 and value-added products. This review aims to systematically summarize the recent research on OER-alternative reactions at the anode for energy-efficient water splitting. The state-of-the art electrocatalysts for OER-alternative reactions are first presented. The electrolysis performance in hybrid electrolysis regarding the conversion rate, selectivity, yield, and corresponding Faraday efficiency of anodic value-added products is then evaluated. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are discussed and it is suggested to develop energy-efficient and economically viable hybrid electrolysis systems.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2699-9412			WOS:000774063500001

Developing high-efficiency and low-cost non-noble-metal oxide electrocatalysts is crucial but challenging for industrial application. Herein, superhydrophilic/superaerophobic hierarchical nanoneedle/microflower arrays of Ce-substituted Co3O4 (CexCo3-xO4) in situ grown on the nickel foam are successfully constructed. The hierarchical architecture and superhydrophilic/superaerophobic interface can be facilely regulated by controlling the introduction of Ce into Co3O4. The unique feature of hierarchical architecture and superhydrophilic/superaerophobic interface is in favor of electrolyte penetration and bubbles release. In addition, the presence of oxygen vacancy and Ce endows the catalyst with enhanced intrinsic activity. Benefiting from these advantages, the optimized Ce0.12Co2.88O4 catalyst shows electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 282 mV at 20 mA cm(-2), and a Tafel slope of 81.4 mV dec(-1). The turnover frequency of 0.0279 s(-1) for Ce0.12Co2.88O4 is 9.3 times larger than that for Co3O4 at an overpotential of 350 mV. Moreover, the optimized Ce0.12Co2.88O4 catalyst shows a robust long-term stability in alkaline media.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000697282300047	34482694

However, facile synthesis of metal-based nanomeshes still remains a great challenge. Herein, we report the cost-efficient ultrathin nickel molybdenum nanomeshes (NiMoO4) for overall water splitting. The NiMoO4 possesses outstanding oxygen evolution reaction property (239 mV@10 mA cm-2), together with an exceptional cycling stability. Notably, phosphorus (P)-doping endows the NiMoO4 nanomeshes a superior hydrogen evolution reaction property (144 mV@-10 mA cm-2). We also prepare a double electrode system with NiMoO4 and P-doped NiMoO4, and evaluate the performance of overall water splitting (1.68 V @10 mA cm-2). The key point of the processing route developed here is the synergistic effect between defect engineering and element doping, which provide a guiding insight for the development of novel catalysts for their practical applications.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000656552400003

Here, an in-depth study of the relation between lattice structure, electronic properties and catalyst performance of the perovskite Ca1-xPrxMnO3 and the first-order RP-system Ca2-xPrxMnO4 at doping levels of x = 0, 0.25 and 0.5 is presented. Lattice structure is determined by X-ray powder diffraction and Rietveld refinement. X-ray absorption spectroscopy of Mn-L and O-K edges gives access to Mn valence and covalency of the Mn-O bond. Oxygen evolution activity and stability is measured by rotating ring disc electrode studies. We demonstrate that the highest activity and stability coincidences for systems with a Mn-valence state of +3.7, though also requiring that the covalency of the Mn-O bond has a relative minimum. This observation points to an oxygen evolution mechanism with high redox activity of Mn. Covalency should be large enough for facile electron transfer from adsorbed oxygen species to the MnO6 network; however, it should not be hampered by oxidation of the lattice oxygen, which might cause a crossover to material degradation. Since valence and covalency changes are not entirely independent, the introduction of the energy position of the e(g)(up arrow) pre-edge peak in the O-K spectra as a new descriptor for oxygen evolution is suggested, leading to a volcano-like representation of the OER activity.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			1996-1944			WOS:000390114400007	28774044

In this work, we report a self-template method to synthesis MoS2/NiS2/CoS2 nanotube based on MoO3 nanorod. The interface engineering and strong electronic interaction of the heterogeneous catalyst greatly increase the electron density around the Fermi level, which could facilitate the adsorption of H and OH-containing intermediates. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurement demonstrates the enhanced electron density, and density functional theory calculation reveals the strengthened H and OH adsorption based on the Gibbs free energy. Combined with the large electrochemical surface area brought by the unique nanotube structure, the MoS2/NiS2/CoS2 displays low overpotentials of 101 and 230 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. In addition, the catalyst can stably drive overall water splitting at a cell voltage of 1.58 V, demonstrating its potential applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The electrochemical measurements revealed a significant enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt, Au and GC electrodes towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) upon the electrodeposition of manganese oxide nanoparticles (nano-MnOx), that is, the onset potentials of the OER at the modified Pt, Au and GC electrodes are more negative by about 300, 550 and 300 mV, respectively, compared with the bare (i.e., unmodified) electrodes. MnOx is electrodeposited in a porous nano-texture structure which covers the entire surface of the substrates homogeneously. The MnOx of a single crystalline manganite phase (gamma-MnOOH) plays a vital role as a catalytic mediator, which facilitates the charge transfer during the water oxidation into molecular oxygen and thus the OER is accomplished at less positive potentials.

Unfortunately, the efficiency is seriously restricted by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. In contrast to the OER, the electrooxidation of organic compounds (EOO) is more thermodynamically and kinetically favorable. Thus, the coupling of the EOO and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has emerged as an alternative route, as it can greatly improve the catalytic efficiency for the production of H-2. Simultaneously, value-added organic compounds can be generated on the anode through electrooxidation upgrading. In this Minireview, we highlight the latest progress and milestones in coupling the EOO with the HER. Emphasis is focused on the design of the anode catalyst, understanding the reaction mechanism, and the construction of the electrolyzer. Moreover, challenges and prospects are offered relating to the future development of this emerging technology.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000850485800001	35849025

During this search, it has been observed that 'hydrogen' with a specific energy density value of 142 kJ mol(-1) can play an important role. Electrocatalytic water splitting is one of the ways to generate pure hydrogen by forming water molecules as an impurity. Electrocatalytic water splitting consists of two half-cell reactions, i.e., the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. Noble metal oxides (RuO2 and IrO2) and Pt metal are considered the state-of-art electrocatalysts for the OER and HER, respectively. However, the high cost and low abundance of these noble metal-based electrocatalysts have motivated the development of alternative electrocatalysts for the practical large-scale generation of hydrogen. Recently, various derivatives of transition metals have been considered as effective and low-cost alternatives to noble metal-based electrocatalysts. However, although various transition metal-based electrocatalysts have been reported thus far to exhibit excellent OER and HER activity, their low conductivity and marginal stability under static conditions require their modification to achieve better stability. Recently, the synthesis of graphene composites with transition metal-based electrocatalysts has gain an increased attention due to their excellent conductivity and stability with excellent hydrogen generation. Here, in this review, for the first time, we have discuss the recent development of various graphene-based composites of transition metals for the water splitting reaction. In addition, the current challenges and opportunities in this field will be discussed elaborately with an extensive future outlook.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000744500600001

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have gained considerable attention in recent years because of their maximum atom utilization efficiency and tunable coordination environments. Herein, through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically explored the ORR/OER performances of nitrogencoordinated transition metal carbon materials (TM-N-x-C (TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Pd, and Pt; x = 3, 4)) through tailoring the coordination environment. Our results demonstrate that compared to conventional tetra-coordinated (TM-N-4-C) catalysts, the asymmetric tri-coordinated (TM-N-3-C) catalysts exhibit stronger adsorption capacity of catalytic intermediates. Among them, NiN3-C possesses optimal adsorption energy and the lowest overpotential of 0.29 and 0.28 V for ORR and OER, respectively, making it a highly efficient bifunctional catalyst for oxygen catalysis. Furthermore, we find this enhanced effect stems from the additional orbital interaction between newly uncoordinated d-orbitals and p-orbitals of oxygenated species, which is evidently testified via the change of d-band center and integral crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP). This work not only provides a potential bifunctional oxygen catalyst, but also enriches the knowledge of coordination engineering for tailoring the activity of SACs, which may pave the way to design and discover more promising bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen catalysis.									7	0	0	0	0	0	6			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000730891300004

Herein, we report uniformly dispersed iridium nanoclusters embedded on nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene as an efficient and robust electrocatalyst for both HER and OER at all pH conditions, reaching a current density of 10mA cm(-2) with only 300, 190 and 220mV overpotential for overall water splitting in neutral, acidic and alkaline electrolyte, respectively. Based on probing experiments, operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, we attribute the high catalytic activities to the optimum bindings to hydrogen (for HER) and oxygenated intermediate species (for OER) derived from the tunable and favorable electronic state of the iridium sites coordinated with both nitrogen and sulfur.									113	5	0	0	8	0	115			2041-1723			WOS:000567537300005	32843622

To this end, coating the photoanode semiconductors with oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs) has been one of the most popular options. The roles of OECs have been found to be multifold, as opposed to exclusively catalytic. This review aims to unravel the complexity of the interfacial processes arising from the material properties of both semiconductors and OECs, and to rationalize the variation in findings in the literature regarding the roles of OECs. Light is also shed on some of the most useful characterization techniques that probe the dynamics of photogenerated holes, to answer some of the field's most challenging mechanistic questions. Finally, some ideas and suggestions on the design principles of OECs are proposed.									24	2	0	0	0	0	24			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000618607700001

In this study, Mn-doped Ni(OH)(2) is synthesized on carbon paper as a bifunctional electrode for UOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This novel electrode delivers high activity and durability for both UOR and HER. Moreover, a positive correlation between the current density and urea concentration during the long-term operation is found for the first time, which provides theoretical support to explain the UOR current drops for long-time operation. The full electrolytic cell constructed by Mn-doped Ni(OH)(2) achieves a working potential of 1.407 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which is one of the best UOR-based water splitting systems reported so far. This study brings new knowledge in the mass-transfer controlled anodic reaction process of urea, which promotes the electrolytic systems for both clean energy generation and waste reuse.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2690-0645		WOS:000822457100001

J	Li, Shuhuan; van der Est, Art; Bunce, Nigel J.								Electrochemical oxidation of oxalate ion in the presence of fluoride ion, and radical analysis by ESR								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				54	13			3589	3593		10.1016/j.electacta.2009.01.025				MAY 1 2009	2009	The problem at hand is the electrochemical oxidation of oxalate ion, which is accelerated by fluoride ion at a platinum anode. The hypothesis that fluoride ion traps incipient hydroxyl radicals as hydroxyfluoricle radical anions was not Supported by ESR experiments in which hydroxyl radicals were generated in the presence of the spin trap alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide) N-tert-butyl-nitrone with and without the addition of fluoride ion. The electrochemical oxidation of oxalate at constant current followed current controlled kinetics both at a platinum anode, as observed previously, and at a boron-doped diamond anode, but the rate of the latter reaction was indifferent to the presence of fluoride ion. We propose that the competition of fluoride and hydroxide ions for the Pt/PtOn surface inhibits the dimerization reactions that lead to oxygen evolution; the displacement of oxygen evolution to more positive potentials overcomes the overpotential for the oxidation of oxalate at this anode. Fluoride ion has no influence on the oxidation of oxalate at BDD because oxygen evolution inherently occurs at more positive potentials at this anode. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This study reports the synthesis of high efficiency electrocatalysts based on S-doped NiFeP. MOF-derived S-doped NiFeP structure is synthesized by a one-step phosphorization process with using S-doped MOFs as the precursor, which is more convenient and environment friendly, and also helps retain the samples' framework. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of the NiFeP catalysts can be improved after partially replacing P by S due to the tunable electronic structure. The optimized CCS-NiFeP-10 reaches a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER with an overpotential of 201 mV and outperforms most NiFe-based catalysts. The S doping plays an important role in tuning the Delta G values for intermediates formation in Ni atoms to a suitable value and exhibits a pronouncedly improved the OER performance. CCS-NiFeP-20 sample presents excellent HER performance due to the d-band center downshifting from the Fermi level. When the voltage of the electrolytic cell is 1.50 V, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) can be obtained. This strategy paves the way for designing highly active none-noble metal catalysts.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000763774400001

As the first step, Ni-Mn-Sn alloy foams were prepared of sulfate bath on copper substrate. Next, after optimization of electrodeposition condition by cyclic voltammetry (CV) test, foams were electrodeposited at different current densities 100, 120, 140 and 180 mA . cm(-2). Then, they were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) along with energy disperse x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to investigate surface morphologies and chemical compositions. According to FE-SEM results, it was revealed that formation of foam like structures were due to the presence of dynamic hydrogen bubbles template (DHBT). To survey their structure, grazing incidence X-ray diffractometer (GIXRD) analysis was performed. The resulted diffraction pattern determined not only FCC nickel structure of foams, but also mixed phases composed. Following this, Ni-Mn-Sn alloy foams were placed in 0.1 M KOH and related CV tests were applied to measure their electrocatalytic activity for OER. This study demonstrated good electrocatalytic activity for Ni-Mn-Sn alloy foams by showing favorable oxygen evolution overpotenitals and Tafel slopes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0218-625X	1793-6667		WOS:000526052600012

Herein, we report a novel ` nitrogen' (N) enriched interconnected graphene quantum dots (C-GQDs) as efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalyst, a potential candidate to replace the noble metal OER electrocatalysts. Interestingly, C-GQDs deliver a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) at 350 mV, a small Tafel slope of 55 mV/dec and outstanding durability which is much superior to the state-of-the-art precious RuO2. More precisely, the unexpected behaviour of graphene quantum dots towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is attributed to the interconnection through Nrich framework (25 %) among the discrete particles. Predominantly, in the pyridine N-oxide, N acts as nucleophilic site and pyridinic N develops p-type doping, responsible for enhanced the OER electrocatalytic activity. The co-existence of both pyridinic N and pyridine N-oxide N induces charge redistribution through p-p delocalization to reduce the * OOH thermodynamic energy barrier. We hope that our study will encourage to develop more efficient electrocatalysts with more effective doping or surface functionalized structure by understanding the dopant nature.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2365-6549			WOS:000417411400009

However, several obstacles restrict its practical application. One challenge is the sluggish kinetics of oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) in the discharging and charging processes of ZABs. In addition, when using unifunctional ORR or OER electrocatalysts as air electrodes, like noble metal catalysts (Pt/C or Ru/IrO2), there are the disadvantages of high cost and poor stability. Therefore, rational design of non-noble metal bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts with high activity and stability is essential for the development of ZABs. In this review, we discuss the latest developments of non-noble metal bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts for ZABs. Firstly, the related reaction mechanisms of ORR and OER are introduced. Then, the latest developments of bifunctional ORR/OER materials for ZABs are discussed in detail from three aspects: (i) MOF-based catalysts, including pristine MOFs and their derivatives; (ii) metal-free-based carbon catalysts, including heteroatom-doped carbon and defective carbon; (iii) metal-based catalysts, including metal-nitrogen-carbon materials (such as metals/alloys, single-atom) and metal compound materials. Finally, some challenges and outlooks for the optimal design of bifunctional air electrodes for rechargeable ZABs with high activity and ultra-long lifetime are put forward.									105	5	0	0	2	0	106			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000527730400002

The oxide is grown using a repetitive potential multi-cycling technique, and the mechanism of the latter hydrous oxide formation process has been discussed. A duplex layer model of the oxide/solution interphase region is proposed. The acid/base behaviour of the hydrous oxide and the microdispersed nature of the latter material has been emphasized. The hydrous oxide is considered as a porous assembly of interlinked octahedrally coordinated anionic metal oxyhydroxide surfaquo complexes which form an open network structure. The latter contains considerable quantities of water molecules which facilitate hydroxide ion discharge at the metal site during active oxygen evolution, and also charge compensating cations. The dynamics of redox switching has been quantified in terms of a diffusive frequency via analysis of the cyclic voltammetry response as a function of potential sweep rate using the Laviron-Aoki electron hopping diffusion model by analogy with redox polymer modified electrodes. Potential step chronoamperometry applied to hydrous oxide coated Ni surfaces has indicated that the Ni(II)/Ni(III) redox switching reaction is quite complex. Steady state Tafel plot analysis has been used to elucidate the kinetics and mechanism of oxygen evolution. Tafel slope values of ca. 60 mVdec-1 and ca. 120 mVdec-1 are found at low and high overpotentials respectively, whereas the reaction order with respect to hydroxide ion activity remains invariant at ca. 1.0 as the potential is increased. These observations are rationalized in terms of a kinetic scheme involving Langmuir adsorption and the formation of a physisorbed hydrogen peroxide intermediate on the oxide surface. The dual Tafel slope behaviour is ascribed to the changeover in rate determining step from the second chemical hydroxide ion reorganization step to the first initial discharge step as the potential is increased, which is in contrast to the potential dependence of the surface coverage of adsorbed intermediates which holds for hydrous iron oxide electrodes in base.									42	0	0	0	1	0	42			1452-3981			WOS:000304413000001

Herein, a versatile molten salt-assisted pyrolysis strategy was developed to construct ultrathin, porous carbon nanosheets supported Co SACs. Molten salts are capable of inducing the formation of a Co single-atom and porous graphene-like carbon, which facilitates full exposure of the active center and simultaneously endows the Co SACs with abundant defective Co-N-4 configurations. The reported Co SACs deliver an excellent bifunctional activity and good stability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Moreover, metal-air batteries (MABs) assembled with the Co SACs as air electrode also deliver excellent performance with high power densities of 160 mW.cm(-2), large capacities of 760 mAh.g(-1 ) and superior long-term charge/discharge stability, outperforming those of commercial Pt/C+RuO2. DFT theoretical calculation results show that the defects in the second coordination shell (CS) of Co SACs promote desorption of the OH* intermediate for the ORR and facilitate deprotonation of OH* for the OER, which can serve as the favorable active site for oxygen bifunctional catalysts. Our work provides an efficient strategy for the preparation of SACs with fully exposed active centers and optimized electronic structures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000834182500001	35880812

While noble-metal-based materials represent a high-performance benchmark with superb activities for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, their high cost, poor scalability, and scarcity are major impediments to achieve widespread commercialization. Herein, a flexible freestanding Fe-based metallic glass (MG) with an atomic composition of Fe50Ni30P13C7 was prepared by a large-scale metallurgical technique that can be employed directly as a bifunctional electrode for water splitting. The surface hydroxylation process created unique structural and chemical heterogeneities in the presence of amorphous FeOOH and Ni2P as well as nanocrystalline Ni2P that offered various active sites to optimize each rate-determining step for water oxidation. The achieved overpotentials for the oxygen evolution reaction were 327 and 382 mV at high current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media, respectively, and a cell voltage of 1.59 V was obtained when using the MG as both the anode and the cathode for overall water splitting at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Theoretical calculations unveiled that amorphous FeOOH makes a significant contribution to water molecule adsorption and oxygen evolution processes, while the amorphous and nanocrystalline Ni2P stabilize the free energy of hydrogen protons (Delta G(H*)) in the hydrogen evolution process. This MG alloy design concept is expected to stimulate the discovery of many more high-performance catalytic materials that can be produced at an industrial scale with customized properties in the near future.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000778608900028	35175044

CoSe2 nanoboxes (NBs) were synthesized successfully using Co-Prussian blue analogue (PBA) metal organic framework (MOF) as a template. Co-PBA NBs were obtained by etching the cube-shaped crystals of Co-PBA with ammonia. Subsequent selenization of Co-PBA NBs afforded CoSe2 NBs. Due to the hollow and conductive nature, the CoSe2 NBs provided excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In 1 M KOH aqueous solution, CoSe2 NBs delivered overpotential of 335 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slop of 54.2 mV dec(-1), and good cycling stability, suggesting possibility of being used as a electrochemical catalyst for alkaline fuel cells.

The surface morphologies of electrodes containing CB and Ni were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).The current densities for both ORR and OER were changed by the addition of CB. The conductive additive changed physical properties of bifunctional electrodes such as the sheet conductance, gas permeability and contact angle. It was observed that the air permeability of electrode was most effective to enhance the currents for ORR and OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1738-7264			KJD:ART002124284

The first type of nickel coating was deposited from "ordinary" aqueous chloride nickel plating bath. The second type of nickel coating was deposited from an electrolyte based on ethaline (a eutectic mixture of choline chloride and ethylene glycol), which is a typical representative of the so-called deep eutectic solvents (a new generation of room-temperature ionic liquids). The electrocatalytic activity of Ni coatings towards the oxygen evolution reaction was evaluated by linear voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Under conditions of moderate polarization, the rate-determining step at both types of electrodes is the transfer of the second electron. As the polarization increases, the transfer of the first electron becomes the rate-controlling step. Ni coating electrodeposited from an ethaline-based electrolyte exhibits higher electrocatalytic activity than the coating obtained from an aqueous electrolyte, which is confirmed by higher exchange current densities and lower polarization resistances. The observed effects are due to the manifestation of "true" electrocatalytic activity, rather than a consequence of an increase in the surface area available for the electrochemical process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2663-2934	2663-2942		WOS:000798363800003

Despite a lot of literature reports, the complexity of catalytic systems and scarce in situ and operando surface sensitive spectroscopic tools render the detection of active sites and the understanding of reaction mechanisms challenging. Here, we carried out and compared in situ and ex situ ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments on a La0.2Sr0.8CoO3-delta perovskite OER catalyst. The experimental results show that segregated surface strontium, which is present in the as prepared sample, is leached into the electrolyte after immersion, leading to surface cobalt active site enrichment. Such a cobalt-enriched oxide surface evolves into a new phase, whose spectral feature is detected in situ and after the OER. With the help of theoretical simulations, such a species is assigned to cobalt oxyhydroxide, providing direct evidence of its formation and surface segregation during the oxygen evolution reaction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000714157700001

AbstractDeveloping Earth-abundant, highly efficient, and anti-corrosion electrocatalysts to boost the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for the Zn-air battery (ZAB) and for overall water splitting is imperative. In this study, a novel process starting with Cu2O cubes was developed to fabricate hollow NixCo1-xSe nanocages as trifunctional electrocatalysts for the OER, ORR, and HER and a reasonable formation mechanism was proposed. The Ni0.2Co0.8Se nanocages exhibited higher OER activity than its counterparts with the low overpotential of 280mV at 10mAcm(-2). It also outperformed the other samples in the HER test with a low overpotential of 73mV at 10mAcm(-2). As an air-cathode of a self-assembled rechargeable ZAB, it exhibited good performance, such as an ultralong cycling lifetime of>50h, a high round-trip efficiency of 60.86%, and a high power density of 223.5mWcm(-2). For the application in self-made all-solid-state ZAB, it also demonstrated excellent performance with a power density of 41.03mWcm(-2) and an open-circuit voltage of 1.428V. In addition, Ni0.2Co0.8Se nanocages had superior performance in a practical overall water splitting, in which only 1.592V was needed to achieve a current density of 10mAcm(-2). These results show that hollow NixCo1-xSe nanocages with an optimized Ni-to-Co ratio are a promising cost-effective and high-efficiency electrocatalyst forZABs and overall water splitting in alkaline solutions.									52	4	0	0	3	0	52			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000462985200001	34137966

Here, we enable a ubiquitous carbon material as an efficient acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst, synthesized via a facile and controllable "amino-assisted polymerization and carbonization" strategy. This as-developed metal-free amino-rich hierarchical-network carbon (amino-HNC) framework directly supported on carbon paper can catalyze OER at a quite low overpotential of 281 mV and a small Tafel slope of 96 mV dec(-1) in an acid solution, and maintain similar to 98% of its initial catalytic activity after 100 h oxygen evolution operation. By using the operando synchrotron infrared spectroscopy, a crucial structurally evolved H2N-(*O-C)-C, formed by adsorbing the *O intermediate on the active H2N-C=C moiety, is observed on amino-HNC electrocatalysts during the OER process in the acid medium. Furthermore, theoretical calculations reveal that the optimization of the sp(2) electronic structure of C=C by amino radicals could effectively lower the kinetic formation barrier of the *O intermediate on the H2N-C=C moiety, contributing to a prominent acidic oxygen-involved catalysis.									25	3	0	0	2	0	26			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000488322900029	31476275

Herein, controllable large-scale synthesis of sulfur-doped CaMnO3 nanotubes is demonstrated via an electrospinning technique followed by calcination and sulfurization treatment. The sulfur doping can not only replace oxygen atoms to increase intrinsic electrical conductivity but also introduce abundant oxygen vacancies to provide enough catalytically active sites, which is further demonstrated by density functional theory calculation. The resulting sulfur-modified CaMnO3 (CMO/S) exhibits better electrocatalytic activity for ORR and OER in alkaline solution with higher stability performance than the pristine CMO. These results highlight the importance of sulfur treatment as a facile yet effective strategy to improve the ORR and OER catalytic activity of the pristine CaMnO3. As a proof-of-concept, a rechargeable Zn-air battery using the bifunctional catalyst exhibits a small charge-discharge voltage polarization, and long cycling life. Furthermore, a solid-state flexible and rechargeable Zn-air battery gives superior discharge-charge performance and remarkable stability. Therefore, the CMO/S nanotubes might be a promising replacement to the Pt-based electrocatalysts for metal-air batteries and fuel cells.									171	12	0	0	7	0	174			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000440805400020

(1) Oxygen evolution and the PSII photochemical reaction were the most sensitive sites and started to be inactivated at temperatures slightly higher than the cultivating temperature. (2) The decrease in the fluorescence F-v value reflected the inactivation of the charge separation reaction of PSII as well as that of the oxygen evolution reaction. (3) The dark fluorescence level, F-o, showed an increase at around 70 degrees C, which was partially reversed by further incubation at 50 degrees C. This increase reflected the inactivation of PSII reaction centers and probably dissociation of phycobilisomes from the PSII reaction center complexes. (4) At higher temperatures, phycobiliproteins disassembled and denatured in a pa-dependent manner, causing a large F-o decrease, (5) Cell membranes became leaky to low-molecular-weight substances at around 72 degrees C. (6) Inhibition of growth of the cells was recognized when the cells were pretreated at temperatures higher than 72 degrees C, Reversibility of the high-temperature effects and relationship between viability of the cells and the degradation of the cell membranes are discussed.									38	1	0	0	35	0	41			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000086596500017	10845466

Herein, with the introduction of CdS and ferrocene, a metalorganic framework (MOF)-induced strategy is reported to synthesize a hierarchical trifunctional electrocatalyst based on Co/CoS nanoparticles and metal (Co, Fe)-N-C species in a hairy S, N-codoped mesoporous carbon polyhedron interwoven with carbon nanotubes (Co/CoS/Fe-HSNC). The specific roles of Co, CoS and (Co, Fe)-N-C active species in Co/CoS/Fe-HSNC catalyst for ORR, OER and HER are also well recognized. Besides, CdS nanoparticles is demonstrated to act as a pore former and S sources both for reaction and doping, and ferrocene is employed to initiate the in-situ growth of carbon nanotubes and Fe-N-C active sites which both contribute to superior multifunctional activities. Benefitting from the rationally designed nanostructures, the ORR half-potential of the Co/CoS/Fe-HSNC electrocatalyst reaches 0.906 V in 0.1 M KOH, about 65 mV larger than commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst, and a low overpotential of 250 mV is achieved for OER and 138 mV for HER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Constructed with the Co/CoS/Fe-HSNC catalyst, a Zn-air battery exhibits a high power density of 213 mW cm(-2) and a small charge/discharge voltage gap of 0.79 V at 2.0 mA cm(-2). The presented strategy provides new insight into the construction of MOF-derived hierarchical multifunctional catalysts for Zn-air batteries and water electrolysis.									79	6	0	0	3	0	79			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000645429700001

Herein, we obtained an integrated catalytic electrode, NiFe nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) directly grown on the carbon cloth (designated as Ni3Fe2@NC/CC), by pyrolysis of bimetallic NiFe metal-organic framework (MOF) precursor. There is a synergistic effect between nickel and iron component, which enhances the bifunctional catalytic activity. In addition, the underlying carbon cloth is conducive to the efficient electron transfer and also benefits the uniform loading of catalytically active materials. Thus, the integrated electrode shows good OER/ORR dual-functional catalytic performance, and the OER overpotential is much lower than that of the traditional drop-coating electrode and precious metal catalyst (IrO2). Moreover, the Ni3Fe2@NC/CC integrated electrode used in zinc-air batteries shows good flexibility and cycle stability. Our findings provide a new avenue for the development of efficient and stable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2296-2646			WOS:000591308100001	33304881

The obtained AuPtPd NDs displayed greatly enlarged electrochemically active surface area (27.65 m(2) g(metal)(-1)) relative to home-made AuPt nanocrystals (NCs, 21,76 m(2) g(metal)(-1)), AuPd NCs (3.91 m(2) g(metal)(-1)), Pt black (20.88 m(2) g(metal)(-1)) and Pd black (8.30 m(2) g(metal)(-1)). For hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions, AuPtPd NDs showed excellent catalytic performances relative to the referenced catalysts.

The urchin-like structure grants large electrochemically active area, good electron and mass transfer capability, as well as excellent structural stability. Nitrogen, sulfur co-doped carbon can synergistically enhance the catalytic activity of cobalt sulfide sites, and also contribute to the exposure of heteroatom-induced active sites, such as, pyridinic N, graphitic N, and C-S-C. Hence, benefiting from the unique architecture and efficient catalytic sites, the resulting catalysts demonstrate excellent bifunctional catalytic activities with a positive half-wave potential of 0.860 V vs. RHE for oxygen reduction reaction and low overpotential of similar to 390 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline medium, which can rank them among one of the most promising cobalt-based bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts reported previously.

High oxidation-state metal species are required as the favorable active sites in OER. Here, amorphous Cox-Fe-B (x is the molar ratio of Co/Fe), Co-B, and Fe-B compounds were successfully synthesized as the oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. The calculation of turnover frequency (TOF) indicates that both the Co and Fe sites are active for OER. Cyclic voltammetry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and long-term stability curves were used to demonstrate that Fe can stabilize Co in a higher oxidation level and meanwhile promote the generation of OOH-like species (the key intermediates for OER). The reduced impedance for Co2-Fe-B (compared with that for Fe-B and Co-B) obtained from the electrochemical impedance spectra confirms the enhanced conductivity for the Co2-Fe-B. This optimal sample on Cu substrate shows a low overpotential of 0.298 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a decreased overpotential of 42 mV compared to that of Co-B. The Co2-Fe-B catalyst also exhibits a small Tafel slope of 62.6 mV/dec and good stability. The enhanced performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the increased population of high-oxidation-state metal-OOH species and the promoted conductivity of the catalyst. A solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of 4.2% and a Faradaic efficiency of 97.2% can be achieved by connecting the HER and as-prepared OER electrodes to a crystalline silicon solar cell.									107	9	0	0	4	0	112			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000416614600051	29111638

Particularly, the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction kinetics limit the overall efficiency of water-splitting catalysis. Although, precious metal-based catalysts can reduce the energy barrier and drive the reaction at low overpotentials, their scarcity and high cost limit the commercialization. In order to address the aforementioned issues, we present a metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived CoFe2O4/CoO heterostructure-embedded carbon nanotubes (CNT)-network with exceptional water-splitting performance. Due to the collective advantages related to MOF-derived porous carbon with abundant oxygen-vacancies, CoFe2O4/CoO heterostructure-embedded CNT-networks with largely exposed catalytic sites, and their synergistic interactions, the hybrid catalyst (CoFe/C-650) delivers superior performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water-splitting: it requires a low overpotential of 246 mV (for OER) and 164 mV (for HER) at 10 mA/cm(2) (eta(10)) with low Tafel slopes of 45.27 and 86.38 mV/dec, respectively. Interestingly, it requires an overpotential of 1.614 V (eta(10)) for full water-splitting catalysis, which is comparable to that of benchmark Pt/C (Cathode) and RuO2 (Anode) combination. This work presents a novel approach towards nanostructure design and facile production of transition metal-based oxide heterostructures to achieve the superior bifunctional activity.

Herein, we demonstrated the Fe-doped CoF2 as a novel and efficient catalyst for OER via facile structural transformation derived from the CoFe layered double hydroxide. The crystal structure and surface chemical state analysis indicated the successful structural transformation from CoFe layered double hydroxide to the bulk crystal of CoF2 doped by Fe. The obtained Fe-CoF2 nanoflakes largely improved the utilization of active sites and effectively promoted mass transfer. The Fe-CoF2-300 showed a low overpotential of 230 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) when loaded on an inert glass carbon electrode, which is about 60 mV less than that of the pristine CoFe layered double hydroxide catalyst. It also exhibited a small Tafel slope of 41.9 mV dec(-1) and super catalytic stability. High valence state change from the M F bond to the M O bond driven by the OER process was indicated after the long-term stability test indicating the facile active phase formation. This works provides an effective doping strategy to design novel catalysts for decreasing the overpotential and accelerating the kinetics of OER.									43	2	0	0	8	0	43			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000707126000142

Hence, the production of N-doped carbon materials from cheap and earth-abundant precursor resources such as biomass materials has great potential in the application of these fields. Among various biomass precursors, silk, a N-rich protein, is an ideal candidate for the synthesis of N-doped carbon. Meanwhile, without addition of chemical N-rich precursors during preparation, N-doped carbon derived from silk is clean and easy to synthesize but possesses superb performance. Silk derived catalysts can exhibit overpotential of 61 mV @ 10 mA/cm(2) (49 mV @ 10 mA/cm(2) of commercial 20%Pt/C for comparison) and Tafel slope of 89 mV/dec towards hydrogen evolution reaction. To date, great progress has been made in the application of silk-derived catalysts to electrocatalysts, but there exists few summary work. Herein, we summarized recent progress on silk-derived electrocatalysts, focusing on their preparation process and their application on water electrolysis and oxygen reduction reactions. This review provides consolidated accounts of silk-derived catalysts and highlights ideas of their preparation and their performance. (c) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The resulting DFRT plots contain three peaks that vary with the overpotential. This discloses the presence of various electrochemical phenomena at different relaxation times in the catalyst. The effective resistance to charge transfer during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is small at low overpotential but becomes dominant at high overpotential. Moreover, we can track the change in each peak after a stability test: the resistance to both the production rate of intermediates and charge transfer show an increase while the solution resistance is almost constant. Hence, ISGP opens a new avenue for analyzing catalysts and providing detailed information about the resistance contributed by various phenomena.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000510855700025

The as-prepared heterostructures exhibit remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and excellent stability, surpassing the pristine cobalt oxide and the state-of-art RuO2. Further DFT calculations and experimental results indicate that the improved OER performance of CoO-CeO2 heterostructures originates from the hierarchically porous structure, large surface area and high electron density around Co sites. The armouphous phase is formed during OER test due to surface Ce leaching, which can further promoted the performance of the hybrids.

Great efforts have been devoted to the control in either composition or mesoscale structure of the nanocatalysts for accelerating the OER performance. However, the interface between the nanocatalysts and current collector, the third aspect to be considered for the design of an OER dyadic electrode, has been less touched till now. As a proof-of-concept study here, we described the importance of constructing an Ohmic contact at the interface of the cobalt selenide nanostructures (as the active components) and the Ti mesh (as the current collector) to significantly promote the OER performance in neutral electrolyte. The cobalt selenide/Ti mesh hybrid electrode could provide a current density of 29.6 mA cm(-2) at an OER overpotential of 570 mV and high durability in neutral medium.									27	1	0	0	0	0	27			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000408878200033

Here the authors report their method for the measurements of carbon to oxygen ratio and cross-section of the reaction-capture of helium-4 by carbon-12, to produce oxygen-16.The carbon/oxygen (C/O) ratio at the end of stellar helium burning is the single most important nuclear input to stellar evolution theory. However, it is not known with sufficient accuracy, due to large uncertainties in the cross-section for the fusion of helium with C-12 to form O-16, denoted as C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16. Here we present results based on a method that is significantly different from the experimental efforts of the past four decades. With data measured inside one detector and with vanishingly small background, angular distributions of the C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction were obtained by measuring the inverse O-16(gamma, alpha)C-12 reaction with gamma-beams and a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) detector. We agree with current world data for the total reaction cross-section and further evidence the strength of our method with accurate angular distributions measured over the 1(-) resonance at E-cm similar to 2.4 MeV. Our technique promises to yield results that will surpass the quality of the currently available data.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2041-1723		WOS:000706146500009	34635664

The IrO2 catalyst was composed of heterogeneous particles with particle sizes ranging from 20 to 70 nm, having a specific surface area of 3.8 m(2) g(-1). The anode catalyst layer of about 5 mu m thickness was coated on the membrane (Nafion 117) for the MEA by the decal method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) confirmed strong adhesion at the interface between the membrane and the catalyst electrode. Although the loading of the IrO2 catalyst was as low as 1.1-1.7 mg cm(2), the SPE cell delivered a voltage of 1.88-1.93 V at a current density of 1 A cm(-2) and operating temperature of 80 degrees C. That is, it was observed that the over-potential of the cell for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) decreased with increasing IrO2 catalyst loading. The electrochemical stability of the MEA was investigated in the electrolysis of water at a current density of 1 A cm(-2) for a short time. A voltage of similar to 2.0 V was maintained without any remarkable deterioration of the MEA characteristics.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2093-8551			WOS:000466874500003

These well-supported and low-Pt-content nanostructures show superior electrocatalytic activities to oxygen reduction reaction. Especially, the supported Co@Pt core-shell electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction shows a high activity with the maximal Pt-mass activity of 465 mA mg(-1) Pt at 0.9 V (vs. RHE).

However, current Li-O-2 batteries are suffering from severe barriers, such as sluggish reaction kinetics and undesired parasitic reactions. Recently, molecular catalysts, i.e. redox mediators (RMs), have been explored to catalyse the oxygen electrochemistry in Li-O-2 batteries and are regarded as an advanced solution. To fully unlock the capability of Li-O-2 batteries, an in-depth understanding of the catalytic mechanisms of RMs is necessary. In this review, we summarize the working principles of RMs and their selection criteria, highlight the recent significant progress of RMs and discuss the critical scientific and technical challenges on the design of efficient RMs for next-generation Li-O-2 batteries.This review provides the operation and design principles, latest development, and future challenges and perspectives of redox mediators, which demonstrate a promising strategy to solve the issues in Li-O-2 batteries.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2095-5138	2053-714X		WOS:000792434200001	35548381

DFT calculations are associated with inherent uncertainty, which limits the ability to delineate materials (distinguishability) that possess high activity. Development of error-estimation capabilities in DFT has enabled uncertainty propagation through activity-prediction models. In this work, we demonstrate an approach to propagating uncertainty through thermodynamic activity models leading to a probability distribution of the computed activity and thereby its expectation value. A new metric, prediction efficiency, is defined, which provides a quantitative measure of the ability to distinguish activity of materials and can be used to identify the optimal descriptor(s) Delta G(opt). We demonstrate the framework for four important electrochemical reactions: hydrogen evolution, chlorine evolution, oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution. Future studies could utilize expected activity and prediction efficiency to significantly improve the prediction accuracy of highly active material candidates.									38	0	0	0	0	0	38			1948-7185			WOS:000424315900023	29316792

A Z-scheme photocatalytic system could effectively promote the separation of photogenerated carriers and keep strong redox ability. However, to date, research on Z-scheme heterojunction materials for the photocatalytic oxygen evolution half reaction has been very limited, and the mechanism of enhancing oxygen evolution activity has never been studied in detail. In this work, for the first time a CdS/PDI Z-scheme heterojunction system with high activity for O-2 evolution was constructed. The electron transfer pathway and photoinduced carrier separation mechanism were deeply studied. Based on experimental and calculation results, the Fermi energy level of CdS was higher than that of the PDI polymer and a strong built-in electric field was formed. The direction of the built-in electric field is from CdS to PDI. Meanwhile under visible light illumination, the photogenerated electrons transferred along the Z-scheme transfer pathway, which not only significantly increased the separation efficiency of electrons/holes but also retained the stronger oxidability of holes in PDI, thus dramatically enhancing the oxygen evolution activity of PDI. The highest O-2 evolution rate on 15%CdS/PDI was 1392.29 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), and it was 2.0 times higher than that of pristine PDI under visible light illumination. Theoretical calculation results indicated that the formation of the intermediate state of OOH* was the rate determining step for PDI in the photocatalytic water oxidation reaction, and the CdS/PDI Z-scheme heterojunction could greatly reduce the energy barrier of the rate determining step, which is also a crucial factor for the enhancement of the photocatalytic oxygen evolution activity of the CdS/PDI Z-scheme heterostructure.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000817641400001

In this study, novel hybrid materials consisting of molecularly dispersed Ni-based species on a graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) framework are prepared, and their excellent electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is discussed. Extensive chemical and structural characterizations confirm that the Ni-based species are attached and well-dispersed on the C3N4 network without agglomeration. In addition, results obtained from electrochemical characterization suggest that Ni-containing molecular entities dispersed on the C3N4 network are active species for the OER. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The as-prepared deposits are able to produce well-defined steady-state voltammograms for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, where the equivalent radius (r(d)) is estimated by the limiting current of hydroxide oxidation in accordance with the electrocatalytic amplification model. The size of isolated clusters obtained from the femtomolar Co2+ solution through an atom-by-atom technique can reach as small as 0.21 nm (r(d)) which is approximately the length of Co-O bond in cobalt oxide. Therefore, the deposit was close to that of a Co1Ox single molecule with only one cobalt ion, the minimum unit of the cobalt-based oxygen-evolving catalyst. Additionally, the size-dependent catalysis of the OER on ConOy deposits shows a faster relative rate on the smaller cluster in terms of the potential at a given current density, implying the single molecular catalyst shows a superior OER activity.									35	0	0	0	1	1	35			0027-8424			WOS:000545947700031	32457135

Herein, we prepared FeNi3/C nanorods with largely improved catalytic OER activity by combining hydrothermal reaction and thermal annealing treatment. The temperature effect on the crystal structure and chemical composition of the FeNi3/C nanorods was revealed, and the enhanced catalytic performance of FeNi3/C with an annealing temperature of 400 degrees C was confirmed by several electrochemical tests. The outstanding catalytic performance was assigned to the formation of bimetallic alloys/carbon composites. The FeNi3/C nanorods showed an overpotential of 250 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 84.9 mV dec(-1), which were both smaller than the other control samples and commercial IrO2 catalysts. The fast kinetics and high catalytic stability were also verified by electrochemical impendence spectroscopy and chronoamperometry for 15 h. This study is favorable for the design and construction of bimetallic alloy-based materials as efficient catalysts for the OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000839727300001	35893493

The results showed that the synthesized perovskite BSCF exhibits activities for both ORR and OER, especially for OER. Cell tests demonstrated that the synthesized material reaches an ORR activity of 83 mAcm(-2) at a potential of 0.9 V and an OER activity of 117 mAcm(-2) at a potential of 2.2 V at about the 100th cycle.

This work describes a self-assembly technique combined with subsequent calcination to prepare a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst of graphite nanoarrays-confined Fe and Co single-atoms within graphene sponges (FeCo-NGS). Specifically, graphene sponges overspread with graphite nanoarrays as a structure regulation, which can prevent the metal single-atoms from aggregating and accelerate the mass/electron transfer, provides a guarantee for the long-term operation. Furthermore, M-N-4 (M = Fe/Co) as the intrinsic activity regulation can effectively drive the heterogeneous oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic processes. Thanks to the rationally designed regulations, FeCo-NGS shows both extraordinary electrocatalytic activity for ORR and OER, even outperforming commercial Pt/C and IrO2. Remarkably, ZABs with FeCo-NGS air cathode demonstrate a record-breaking cycle lifetime of more than 1500 h (over 9000 cycles) at 10 mA cm(-2) with a small charge-discharge gap.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000571433500046	32809790

Owing to the slow kinetics mainly brought from multiple proton-coupled electron transfer steps, the design and exploit low-cost, highly active, durable OER electrocatalysts are of significant importance. Although the black phosphorus (BP) shows good electrocatalytic OER performance, it still faces the problems of poor intrinsic activity and low stability due to its instability under ambient conditions. The NiFe-LDH was assembled onto the surfaces of exfoliated BP (EBP) nanoflakes to realize the interfacial coupling between them, achieving an effective improvement in electrocatalytic activity and stability. Benefitting from the interfacial P-O bonding, the NiFe-LDH@EBP hybrid shows high OER activity with a low overpotential of similar to 240 mV@10 mA cm(-2) toward OER under alkaline conditions, as well as the good stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations proved that the interface-coupling of NiFe-LDH on BP promotes charge transfer kinetics and balances the adsorption/desorption of reaction intermediates, ultimately imparting excellent OER electrocatalytic activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-2646			WOS:000829667900001	35873053

Te doping introduced lattice distortion and resulted in smaller size of Te-Co3O4 NPs with enlarged surface area for more accessible active sites. Oxygen vacancies were created to modify the electronic structure, improve the active sites density, and decrease the kinetic energy barriers of XTe-Co3O4. The electronic conductivity of 6%Te-Co3O4 was improved to accelerate the charge transfer efficiency.

As a hi-functional catalyst, CO3O4 nanodisks are active towards both the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. The electrocatalytic activity is evaluated by preparing air electrodes for rechargeable zinc-air batteries utilizing ambient air to emphasize practicality. The galvanodynamic charge and discharge behaviors are far superior than Co3O4 nanoparticle counterparts particularly at high applied current densities. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals that Co3O4 nanodisk electrode results in significantly less internal, solid-electrolyte interface, and charge transfer resistances which lead to highly efficient electrochemical reactions. Superior rechargeability has also been confirmed where virtually no voltage drops are observed over 60 pulse cycles. The practicality of Co3O4 nanodisks is highlighted by demonstrating comparable discharge voltages and greatly outperforming charge voltages with excellent electrochemical stability than commercial Pt/C catalyst.

Electrocatalytic activities drive the functionality of these technologies. The full commercialization of sustainable energy conversion technologies thrives on developing low-cost and highly efficient electrocatalysts. In recent years, it has been a run to develop single-atom catalysts (SACs). These atomic level electrocatalysts dispersed on a substrate enable high metal utilization, a road to low-cost catalyst engineering coupled with high catalytic activity. This possibility necessitates the elucidation of the correlation between the atomic structure, properties, and mechanistic perception of the innovative synthesis notion. Thus, these SACs possess the ability to bridge the gap between homo- and heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we give a brief introduction to SACs, followed by a readable account of the synthetic routes and SACs classification and a summary of clean energy catalytic reactions: Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), Water splitting {Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and Oxygen evolution reaction (OER)}, Carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), Nitrogen reduction reaction (N2RR), Methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), and Ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). We present a concise summary fostered with futuristic perceptions. Finally, we hope to provide more insights on the advancement in SACs development for electrochemical energy conversion.

Herein, NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) hollow microsphere (HMS) was designed and synthesized via a one-step in situ growth method by using SiO2 as a sacrificial template. Benefiting from the unique architecture, NiFe-LDH HMS shows highly efficient OER electrocatalytic activity with a preferable current density (71.69 mA cm(-2) at eta = 300 mV) and a small onset overpotential (239 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), which outperforms the 20 wt % commercial Ir/C catalyst. Moreover, it exhibits a remarkably low Tafel slope (53 mV dec(-1)) as well as a satisfactory long-time stability. Electrochemical studies reveal that this hierarchical structure facilitates a full exposure of active sites and facile ion transport kinetics, accounting for the excellent performance. It is expected that the NiFe-LDH microsphere material can serve as a promising non-noble-metal-based electrocatalyst toward water oxidation reaction.									146	10	0	0	5	0	146			1944-8244			WOS:000389963300041	27960375

The exorbitant prices and scarcity of the precious metals have stimulated scale exploration of alternative non-precious metal catalysts with low-cost and high performance. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are a promising precursor to prepare cost-effective and high-performance catalysts because they possess abundant micropores and nitrogen self-doping after pyrolysis, which can accelerate the electron transfer and serve as active sites for efficient OER. Herein, we developed a new highly active NiFeMn-layered double hydroxide (NFM LDH) based electrocatalyst for OER. Through building NFM hydroxide/oxyhydroxide heterojunction and incorporation of conductive graphene, the prepared NFM LDH-based electrocatalyst delivers a low overpotential of 338 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 67 mV dec(-1), which are superior to those of commercial RuO2 catalyst for OER. The LDH/OOH heterojunction involves strong interfacial coupling, which modulates the local electronic environment and boosts the kinetics of charge transfer. In addition, the high valence Fe3+ and Mn3+ species formed after NaOH treatment provide more active sites and promote the Ni2+ to higher oxidation states during the O-2 evolution. Moreover, graphene contributes a lot to the reduction of charge transfer resistance. The combining effects have greatly enhanced the catalytic ability for OER, demonstrating that the synthesized NFM LDH/OOH heterojunction with graphene linkage can be practically applied as a high-performance electrocatalyst for oxygen production via water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2079-4991		WOS:000824222600001	35808036

Here we show that the ORR kinetics are much faster than OER kinetics and OER occurs in two distinct stages upon Li-air battery charging. The first OER stage occurs at low overpotentials (<400 mV) with a slopping voltage profile, whose kinetics are relatively insensitive to charge rates and catalysts. This OER stage could be attributed to the delithiation of the outer part of Li2O2 forming lithium-deficient Li2-xO2,which is chemically disproportionate to evolve O-2. The second stage takes place at high overpotentials (400-1200 mV), whose kinetics are sensitive to discharge/charge rates and catalysts, which can be attributed to the oxidation of bulk Li2O2 particles. Our study provides insights into bridging current two schools of thought on the OER mechanism.									285	14	0	0	18	0	289			1948-7185			WOS:000313142000021	26291218

The formation of metallic cobalt nanoparticles and nitrogen-doping into carbon structures were simultaneously achieved by ammonia treatment. The physicochemical properties of the resulting materials and consequently their performance for the oxygen evolution were systematically altered by varying the cobalt loading (5-89 wt %), pyrolysis atmosphere (argon or ammonia), and temperature (600-800 degrees C). Thereby, up to 37 wt % of the cobalt nanoparticles were confined in the pores of the mesostructured nitrogen-doped carbon materials with a high BET surface area. At temperatures above 700 degrees C, the cobalt additionally catalyzes the graphitization of the carbon support. The catalyst with a cobalt loading of 37 wt % pyrolyzed at 700 degrees C under an ammonia atmosphere shows the highest turnover frequency (TOF) of 311 h(-1) in the oxygen evolution reaction due to the improved electronic properties of the carbon support from the incorporation of nitrogen atoms combined with a large amount of accessible cobalt sites. This class of materials shows even higher activity in comparison with ordered mesoporous Co3O4.									24	1	0	0	1	0	24			2574-0962			WOS:000487770000063

But, their poor cycle life due to sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) hinder the commercialization of this technology. Hence, fabrication of highly efficient ORR and OER catalysts is of paramount importance in order to improve the cyclic stability and longevity of this device. Herein, we discuss systematically the synthesis and electrochemical analysis of such bifunctional perovskite catalysts, namely, pristine CaMnO3 and its defect induced counterpart. When evaluated as a cathode catalyst in a Li-O-2 battery along with a redox mediator LiI, the oxygen deficient CaMnO3 gives an improved cycle life reported at a high current rate of 500 mA g(-1) with a capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) in comparison with similar catalysts reported in the literature. Introduction of defects in the pristine framework predominantly improves the catalytic activity by lowering the overpotential. The presence of" oxygen vacancies creates mixed-valence states of Mn3+/Mn4+ which modify the electronic structure, resulting in the improved catalytic activity. Comprehensive phase and compositional analysis confirm the formation of the desired defect-induced structure with improved catalytic activity toward ORR and OER which is elaborated with electrochemical analysis.									26	0	0	0	0	0	25			2574-0962			WOS:000516665300013

Herein, as an excellent OER electrocatalyst, a technique of synthesizing Fe doped CoNiSe2 nanosheet (Fe-CoNiSe2) whole series using CoFe prussian blue analog produced by CoZIF-L reaction as a template is proposed here. The introduction of iron ions promotes the redistribution of the cobalt-nickel charge density, which enhances the OER kinetics. In view of the abovementioned points, Fe-CoNiSe2/NF has excellent activity, electrocatalytic properties and excellent stability in alkaline media, which only demands a lower overpotential of 244 mV and 271 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and 50 mA cm2, respectively. The material also exhibits excellent stability for at least 24 h during the OER process. This work may provide some new insights into the assembly of advanced and highly-active materials for a variety of other energy conversion applications. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

We have successfully synthesized the earth abundant WO3 coupled with IrO2 as mixed oxide composite by a facile two-step chemical method. 50% reduction in noble metal contents (IW-50) followed by two times enhancement in activity, four-folds increase in bulk mass specific activity along with the stability of mixed oxide composite as compared to state -of -the art IrO2 catalyst are affirmed. Superior performance of mixed oxide composites are perceived due to four times increase in electrochemical surface area, reduction of Tafel slope, four-fold increase of turn over frequency, electronic distortion in Ir-4f spectrum of IW-50 along with the bridging of lattice oxygen atoms between iridium and tungsten metals. We believe that it would open up the new avenues for effective utilization of noble metal with high valence tungsten metal in corrosive environment. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In spite of this, no trifunctional electrocatalyst for HER, OER, and ORR with an acceptable performance have been reported. In response, herein, as a proof-of-concept experiment, this study first in situ couples element abundant FeM (M = Ni, Co) particles with the nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC) by a facile and scalable strategy. Unexpectedly, the resulted FeM/NPC exhibits superior trifunctional catalytic activities for HER, OER, and ORR even in the same electrolyte, which can be attributed to the synergistic advantages of FeM/NPC in terms of its good conductivity, highly porous structure, high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, nitrogen doping, and the intimate contact of FeM and NPC. Furthermore, such trifunctional catalyst makes the overall water splitting work at moderate overpotential, and endows the assembled Zn-air battery with a good performance and impressive capacity to self-power the overall water splitting, demonstrating its feasibility for practical application.									110	1	0	0	0	1	110			2366-7486			WOS:000424586600004

Here, an OCEM platform specially tailored to investigate the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at a microscopic level by introducing electrolyte convection through a microfluidic flow cell is reported. The setup is established on gold microelectrodes and later successfully applied to investigate how Ar-plasma treatment affects the ORR activities of 2H MoS2.

Two critical potentials define regions where the bimetallic particles may exist as core-shell, porous, and hollow structures, accompanied with clear variations in the dissolution rates.

In the present study, we constructed a bimetallic ZIF system with cobalt and manganese metal ions and subjected it to an electrospinning technique for feasible fiber formation. The obtained nanofibers delivered a lower overpotential value of 302 mV at a benchmarking current density of 10 mA cm-2 in an electrocatalytic OER study under alkaline conditions. The obtained Tafel slope and charge-transfer resistance values were 125 mV dec-1 and 4 omega, respectively. The kinetics of the reaction is mainly attributed from the ratio of metals (Co and Mn) present in the catalyst. Jahn-Teller distortion reveals that the electrocatalytic active center on the Mn-incorporated ZIF-67 nanofibers (Mn-ZIF-67-NFs) was found to be Mn3+ along with the Mn2+ and Co2+ ions on the octahedral and tetrahedral sites, respectively, where Co2+ ions tend to suppress the distortion, which is well supported by density functional theory analysis, molecular orbital study, and magnetic studies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000870052800001	36194123

In this work, a bifunctional catalyst, cobalt nitride nanoflakes supported on Ni foam (CoN NF/NF), was synthesized for both UOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A two-electrode electrolyzer (CoN NF/NF||CoN NF/NF) was constructed. To drive 100 mA/cm(2), the voltage of CoN NF/NF||CoN NF/NF only 1.698 V is required, which is much lower than that of Pt/C||IrO2 (1.860 V) and the current density can be maintained for 30 h.

In the present work, with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that thermally activated on-surface reactions can significantly increase the efficiency of energy conversions in electrolysis via a thermally and electrically cascaded mechanism. In the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), to be specific, the formation of high-energy *OOH on Fe can be assisted by thermally activated combination of *O and *OH on the surface of ironbenzenehexathiol coordination polymer (Fe-BHT). Such theoretical predictions are then confirmed by our experimental measurements. The OER efficiency on Fe-BHT increases with increasing temperature and outperforms the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst at around 80 degrees C. This research may shed light on an avenue for designing and preparing electrocatalysts with enhanced catalytic performance.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2380-8195			WOS:000736529500001

Herein, a facial method to prepare Co nanoparticles-embedded N, S-codoped hierarchically micro/meso/macroporous graphene sheets (Co@NSCs) via pyrolysis of the mixture of urea, L-cysteine, polyethylene glycol and cobalt (II) nitrate is reported. By controlling the pyrolysis temperature, Co@NSC-1000 obtained at 1000 degrees C performs comparable electrochemical activity on ORR and HER, with commercial Pt/C. Additionally, Co@NSC-1000 also exhibits acceptable methanol resistance on ORR and admissible long-term durability on ORR and HER after 5000 potential cycles. Synergistically, hierarchically micro/meso/macroporous nanostructure, non-precious Co nanoparticles, and N, S-codoped graphene are greatly contributed to the high electrocatalytic activity and stability. The pyrolysis temperature is the key factor for tailoring element component, nanostructure and electrochemical activities. The competitive catalytic performances on ORR and HER indicate Co@NSC-1000 is a hopeful substitute for noble benchmark Pt catalysts. Furthermore, Zn-air battery assembled with Co@NSC-1000 shows higher specific capacity, larger energy density and stronger stability than Pt/C, holding great potential in practical applications.

Here, an unusual catalyst support, laser-modified boron nitride with C, O dopants (L-BN), for the oxygen evolution reaction is reported. L-BN exhibits unique advantages for electrocatalysis, namely, high corrosion resistance under oxidizing conditions, enhanced electrical conductivity arising from interlayer B-B dipolar interaction, and strong interaction with IrOx catalyst caused by N-C(sic)N bonds.

First, a shape-controlled CoNi-X alloy (X denotes electrodeposition time) with a ridge-like morphology that in-situ deposited on titanium sheets is obtained by electrodeposition. Then, CoNi-30 with ridge-like structure is further electrooxidized to improve the electrochemical activity. After 40 h oxidation, the CoNi-OOH-30(40) oxyhydroxide with nanosheets structure is obtained, which exhibits good catalytic performance for overall water splitting than the other as-prepared catalysts. It is found that CoNi-OOH-30(40) to reach +/- 10 mA cm(-2) requires small overpotentials of -210 and 279 mV, Tafel slopes of 67 and 62 mV dec(->)1 and exhibit good stabilities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution, respectively. A water electrolyzer, using CoNi-OOH-30(40) as anode and cathode catalysts, reaches 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.76 V. Furthermore, due to the Co-Ni alloy and CoNi oxyhydroxide, CoNi-OOH-30(40) maintains 10 mA cm(-2) for 60 h in alkaline media without activity losses. It is believed that the present work provides a facile, fast and feasible strategy to fabricate cost-efficient CoNi oxyhydroxide nanosheets catalysts with high water splitting efficiency and stability in alkaline conditions.

A common strategy to realize dual active sites is the use of bimetal compound catalysts, where each metal atom contributes one active site. In this work, a new concept is presented to realize dual active sites with tunable electron densities in monometal compound catalysts. Dual Co2+ tetrahedral (Co2+(T-d)) and Co3+ octahedral (Co3+(O-h)) coordination active sites are developed and adjustable electron densities on the Co2+(T-d) and Co3+(O-h) are further achieved by phosphorus incorporation (P-Co9S8). The experimental results and density functional theory calculations show that the nonmetal P doping can systematically modulate charge density of Co2+(T-d) and Co3+(O-h) in P-Co9S8 and simultaneously improve the electrical conductivity of Co9S8, which substantially enhances oxygen evolution reaction performance of P-Co9S8.									54	4	0	0	4	0	54			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000486858100001	31532888

Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations show that the metal dopant influences the distribution of electronic charge and affects the thermodynamics and kinetics aspects of the OER when compared with undoped IrO2. Using DFT, multiple different reaction pathways were evaluated for O-O bond formation, and analysis supports the associative mechanism to be the most likely reaction pathway. Calculations showed lower activation energies for Ni and Co-doped IrO2 compared to undoped IrO2, in agreement with experimental analysis of the activation energy and OER activity. From experiments, Co-doping shows significantly improved stability compared to Ni-doping. Evaluation of the rate-determining step (rds) from calculations and experimental analysis shows apparent differences that indicate the additional factors need to be considered to enable improved correlation between theory and experiment regarding the OER rds.

Herein, the cost-efficient two dimensional (2D) phosphorus-doped CoFe oxyhydroxide nanosheets (denoted as CoFeP NSs) are successfully engineered and showing exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and chemical stability in 1 M KOH solution. This unique 2D nanosheet structure facilitates the mass transfer and electron transport, resulting in the remarkable OER activity that delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 305 mV with an ultra-small Tafel slope 49.6 mV/dec. More significantly, the doped P also plays a vital role in modulating the surface active sites, leading to the substantial enhancement of electrocatalytic performances. Our study provides a facile one-pot method for the successful fabrication of 2D P-doped CoFe NSs which display superior electrocatalytic performance, shedding great promise for environment and energy-related fields.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are widely recognized as promising catalysts in the chemical and energy industries. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to develop SACs with ideal intrinsic activity, high stability, and low cost. Compared with traditional M-N-4 active sites, metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) catalysts with asymmetric coordination structures have been rapidly developed in the field of catalysis. This could be attributed to their unique electronic and geometric structures, making asymmetric coordination a novel and attractive strategy. In this paper, several typical asymmetric M-N-C SACs are summarized, namely asymmetric M-N-x SACs, asymmetric M-N-x-O/S/P/B/Cl/I SACs and asymmetric M-M SACs. The research development and application of these advanced catalysts in electrocatalytic reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) are systematically illustrated.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000818953900001

The optimum FeOx/NF-Li electrocatalyst exhibits low overpotentials of 239 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction and 276 mV for oxygen evolution reaction at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). A two-electrode water splitting cell using FeOJNF-Li as both anode and cathode requires only 1.60 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The impressive water splitting performance of the FeOx/NF-Li electrode is revealed to be attributed to Li-induced electrochemical conversion, which alters the crystal structure, creating more active sites for electrocatalytic reactions, as well as introduces O vacancies increasing the electron density and the intrinsic conductivity. More importantly, the atomic arrangement is regulated from tetrahedral Fe(Td) to octahedral Fe(Oh) coordination, which acts as catalytically active sites with reduced Gibbs free energy for the rate-determining steps. This electrochemical conversion reaction can be extended to other TMOs (i.e., NiOx/NF and CoOx/NF) for promoted electrocatalytic water splitting performances. This study provides an in-depth understanding on the nature of atomic and electronic structure evolution to promote the electrocatalytic activity.									10	1	0	0	2	0	10			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000603397200034	33300348

The hybrid strategy is attracting increasing interest for the development of highly active OER electrocatalysts. Regarding the activity enhancement mechanism, electron coupling between two phases in hybrids has been widely reported, but the interfacial elemental redistribution is rarely investigated. Herein, we developed a CeO2/LaFeO3 hybrid electrocatalyst for enhanced OER activity. Interestingly, a selective interfacial La diffusion from LaFeO3 to CeO2 was demonstrated by the electron energy loss spectra and elemental mapping. This redistribution of cations triggers the change of the chemical environment of interface elements for charge compensation because of the electroneutrality principle, which results in increased oxygen vacancies and high-valent Fe species that promote the OER electrocatalysis. This mechanism might be extended to other hybrid systems and inspire the design of more efficient electrocatalysts.									15	0	0	0	0	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000612551400061	33412845

An important contribution to the advancement of this technology is given by the possibility to combine different materials into a single printing process or integrate diverse technologies for the fabrication of different components. Here we show how a prototype water electrolyzer can be fabricated using two different AM technologies, named selective laser melting and fused deposition modeling to produce the metallic components (electrodes) and the liquid/gas handling components (cells) of the electrolyzer, respectively. Both components are produced following a precise design which enables their perfect integration and assembly. The electrodes are produced in stainless steel which can be directly used for both the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the anodic oxygen evolution reaction. However, we propose to introduce a simple and rapid electrochemical surface modification of the steel electrodes with more efficient earth-abundant catalysts in order to enhance the overall water splitting performance. For the HER we deposited a thin film of Ni-MoS2 composite while a NiFe double hydroxide film is deposited on the anode. Scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are employed to characterize the electrode surface before and after the electrodeposition with the catalysts. Electrochemical testing is then used to optimize the composition of the catalysts by verifying the catalytic performance of the electrodes. As proof-of-concept, an electrochemical testing is performed with the 3D printed and assembled device.									44	1	0	0	3	2	44			2168-0485			WOS:000452344900109

There has been immense progress on developing new catalysts that are active for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as well as materials that are bifunctional and are active for both reactions. In this perspective I detail recent developments in tailoring highly active interfacial regions in a variety of catalysts that are suitable for these reactions. In particular the doping of metal oxides and metal-chalcogenides with a secondary metal is discussed and how this influences the activity and stability of the catalyst and how in fact simple systems such as Ni/NiO are also highly active due to the presence of a metal/metal oxide interface. Finally the future direction in characterising electrocatalysts is discussed and the important role that spatially resolved electrochemical data combined with other surface science techniques can be used to study structure-activity relationships at a localised level at such important interfaces.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2515-7655			WOS:000570183200001

Herein, for the first time, Ru-doped Cu2+1O vertically arranged nanotube arrays in situ grown on Cu foam (Ru/Cu2+1O NT/CuF) are reported and further investigated for their catalytic properties for overall water splitting. The Ru/Cu2+1O NT/CuF presents ultrahigh catalytic activities for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline conditions, and it exhibits a small overpotential of 32 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in the HER, and only needs 210 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the OER. Importantly, the alkaline electrolyzer using Ru/Cu2+1O NT/CuF as a bifunctional electrocatalyst only needs 1.53 V voltage to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than the benchmark of IrO2(+)/Pt(-) counterpart (1.64 V at 10 mA cm(-2)).

However, the typical use of strongly acidic or alkaline electrolytes necessitates the use of expensive materials, while bubbles add to capital and operational costs, due to blocking of the electrode surface and the necessary use of pumps and gas liquid separators. Here 'bubble-free' oxygen evolution at mild pH is carried out using an electrocatalyst that mimics photosystem II (PSII). The bubble-free electrode includes a gas extracting Gore-Tex (R) membrane. Edge-functionalised graphene (EFG) is included to mimic the metal-binding local protein environment, and the tyrosine residue, in the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) of PSII, while MnOx and Ca2+ are incorporated to mimic the Mn4CaO5 cluster. Interaction between EFG, MnOx, and Ca2+ results in a significant, 130 mV fall in the overpotential required to drive electrocatalytic oxygen evolution at 10 mA cm(-2), compared to the electrode without these biomimetic components.

KI-ISO4.K2SO4). The mechanism of this reaction has never been characterized, due to the fleeting nature of the intermediates. In the present study, we elucidate the underlying reaction mechanism through experimental and theoretical analyses of competitive kinetic oxygen isotope effects (KIEs) during catalytic turnover conditions. The experimental 180 KIE is a sensitive probe of the highest transition state in the O-2-evolution mechanism and provides a strict constraint for calculated mechanisms. The 180 kinetic isotope effect of 1.013 +/- 0.003 measured using natural abundance reactants is consistent with the calculated isotope effect of peroxymonosulfate binding to the complex, as described by density functional theory (DFT). This provides strong evidence for peroxymonosulfate binding being both the first irreversible and rate-determining step during turnover, in contrast to the previously held assumption that formation of a high-valent Mn-oxo/oxyl species is the highest barrier step that controls the rate of O-2 evolution by this complex. The comparison of the measured and calculated KIEs supplements previous kinetic studies, enabling us to describe the complete mechanism of O-2 evolution, starting from when the oxidant first binds to the manganese complex to when O-2 is released. The reported findings lay the groundwork for understanding O-2 evolution catalyzed by other biomimetic oxomanganese complexes, with features common to those of the O-2-evolving complex of photosystem H, providing experimental and theoretical diagnostics of oxygen isotope effects that could reveal the nature of elusive reaction intermediates.									38	0	0	0	5	0	38			2155-5435			WOS:000366153300009

By simply changing the precursor solution, the chemical composition and resulting structure can be effectively controlled to obtain desired properties toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Thanks to the beneficial structure and strong synergistic effects between the incorporated oxygen and phosphorus, the optimal O,P-MoS2 exhibit superior electrocatalytic performances compared with those of oxygen single-doped MoS2 nanosheets (O-MoS2). Specifically, a low HER onset overpotential of 150 mV with a small Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1), excellent conductivity, and long-term durability are achieved by the structural engineering of MoS2 via O and P co-doping, making it an efficient HER electrocatalyst for water electrocatalysis.

Unlike traditional nano-structuring approaches, this work focuses on the structural symmetry breaking to rearrange spin electron occupation and optimize spin-dependent orbital interaction to alter charge transfer between catalysts and reactants. Herein, we propose an atomic half-disordering strategy in multistage-hybridized BixEr2-xRu2O7 pyrochlores to reconfigure orbital degeneracy and spin-related electron occupation. This strategy involves controlling the bonding interaction of Bi-6s lone pair electrons, in which partial atom rearrangement makes the active sites transform into asymmetric high-spin states from symmetric low-spin states. As a result, the half-disordered BixEr2-xRu2O7 pyrochlores demonstrate an overpotential of -0.18 V at 10 mA cm(-2) accompanied with excellent stability of 100 h in acidic electrolyte. Our findings not only provide a strategy for designing atom-disorder-related catalysts, but also provides a deeper understanding of the spin-related acidic oxygen evolution reaction kinetics.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2041-1723		WOS:000826101400008	35840581

Herein, based on light-induced electrochemistry, a laser-assisted, continuous, solution route for the simultaneous reduction and modification of graphene oxide with catalytic nanoparticles is reported. Electrochemical graphene oxide (EGO) is used as starting material and electron-hole pair source due to its low degree of oxidation, which imparts structural integrity and an ability to withstand photodegradation. Simply illuminating a solution stream containing EGO and metal salt (e.g., H(2)PtCl(6)or RuCl3) with a 248 nm wavelength laser produces reduced EGO (rEGO, oxygen content 4.0 at%) flakes, decorated with Pt (approximate to 2.0 nm) or RuO2(approximate to 2.8 nm) nanoparticles. The RuO2-rEGO flakes exhibit superior catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction, requiring a small overpotential of 225 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The Pt-rEGO flakes (10.2 wt% of Pt) show enhanced mass activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and similar performance for oxygen reduction reaction compared to a commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. This simple production method is also used to deposit PtPd alloy and MnO(x)nanoparticles on rEGO, demonstrating its versatility in synthesizing functional nanoparticle-modified graphene materials.									16	2	0	0	0	0	16			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000542818300001

A study on dual redox reversible PEDOT:metallacarborane								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				10	30			16182	16192		10.1039/d2ta02079c		JUL 2022		AUG 4 2022	2022	Over the years, extensive research has been carried out to optimize the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by adopting different techniques as well as catalysts. Conducting organic polymers such as PEDOT have been employed to study the reaction but have failed to lower the over-potential for the reaction. Here we show electrochemically made, intimately blended, dual redox reversible materials incorporating PEDOT and metallacarboranes. The metallacarboranes act as doping agents but with tunable E-1/2 potentials. The tunability of E-1/2 allows the overlapping of the two redox potentials which subsequently leads to their synergy. The physico-chemical properties of the metallacarboranes fade and become integrated with PEDOT to form a dual redox reversible system. Therefore, the properties of the dopant are modified by the polymer. Thus, due to its high E-1/2, the Co4+/3+ couple would not be an efficient electrocatalyst for water oxidation but when it is immersed in the PEDOT matrix the Co4+/3+ potential is more accessible so that very low overpotential values are obtained, which justifies the title of the work, How to switch from a poor PEDOT:X oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to a good one. The dual redox reversible system has been extensively characterized and has been shown to be a promising candidate for the water oxidation reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000827848800001

Density functional theory calculations are therefore used in this study to investigate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over nanostructured, i.e. nanocluster and nanocavity, surfaces of hematite (Fe2O3). The calculated results demonstrate an optimum nanocluster size with respect to the OER overpotential. The presence of nanoclusters on the electrode is regarded as an attractive strategy for increasing the activity in photoelectrochemical water splitting. However, in this work, we found that the presence of a nanocavity is a more effective strategy for lowering the overpotential compared to nanoclusters. This finding of the nanocavity-favoured OER for hematite surfaces is verified by similar simulations of WO3 surfaces.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000416425400032	29148555

Here, bimetallic multi-phasic catalysts containing nickel (Ni) and iron (Fe) are synthesized using a simple but reproducible polyol method, which results in to different sponges having control over their chemical stoichiometry. The macroporous sponges thus developed contain metallic Ni, NiO, and Fe2O3, where their proportionate content can be varied with initial precursor ratio. The NiFe15 so developed is having the best oxygen evolution performance in terms of overpotential, kinetics, and charge transfer properties, and it is found to be better than the benchmarked IrO2 based catalysts. The hydrogen evolution from the other ratio, NiFe5, is found to be better than other Ni and Fe based samples, and it is found to be very close to the hydrogen evolution performance of platinum. An alkaline water electrolysis full cell is constructed, devoid of any precious metals but with NiFe5 and NiFe15, and the overall splitting potential for the benchmarked current density of 10 mAcm(-2) is found to be 1.62 V only, which is better or on par with the other singly/multi-phasic systems reported so far. Hence the work presented here shows the possibilities of futuristic electrochemical technologies with viable catalysts, and a detailed study is presented.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2365-6549			WOS:000510247300021

Currently, nonprecious metal phosphides have emerged as efficient electrocatalysts to replace noble metals for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, it is still a great challenge for fabrication of universal, efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts for these reactions via structural and component engineering. Herein, we report the design and construction of the hierarchical CoP-FeP branched heterostructures as high-performance and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution electrocatalysis in various electrolytes. In such unique heterojunction, the intimate interfacial contact could induce built-in electric field at the interface, which effectively optimizes the surface electronic states of the FeP by the CoP, thus promoting the charge transfer and enhancing the electrocatalytic activity. As a consequence, the CoP FeP heterostructures exhibit excellent performance for HER electrocatalysis, needing overpotentials as low as 30 and 71 mV to drive the 10 mA cm(-2) current densities in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH solutions, respectively, which are very close to that of Pt/C and rank it among the most HER-active electrocatalysts reported so far. Moreover, they can also behave as an efficient OER electrocatalyst with a very low overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, outperforming most of the nonprecious-metal phosphides previously reported.									104	6	0	0	3	0	107			2168-0485			WOS:000456631800056

This oxide has a porous structure and a specific surface area of 2.78 m(2) g(-1). The catalytic activity of the oxide for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.1 M KOH solution has been studied by using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. RRDE results show that the ORR mainly favors a direct four electron pathway, and a. maximum cathodic current density of 6.25 mA cm(-2) at 2500 rpm was obtained, which is close to the behavior of Pt/C (20 wt% Pt on carbon) electrocatalyst in the same testing conditions.

None of the currently available commercial electrocatalysts is low cost, and they do not possess excellent catalytic activity and durability at the same time, which is the main barrier to the broad implementation of these technologies. Herein, we design and develop a novel nanostructured trifunctional electrocatalyst that is capable of catalyzing oxygen/hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions. The combination of non-precious Co, Co9S8, and S, N co-doped graphitic carbon synergistically provides highly active sites for efficient catalytic reactions, while the unique tubular morphology and hierarchically porous microstructure not only benefit fast access to active sites but also ensure a robust composite structure for durability. When applied to zinc-air batteries and water splitting, these systems exhibit performance superior to those of commercial precious electrocatalysts (e.g., Pt/C and Ir/C).									36	5	0	0	0	0	36			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000455264600075

The oxides have been prepared in powder form via the malic acid route, involving decomposition at 650 degrees C of an amorphous malate gel. The films were characterized ex-sity by XRD and EDAX, and in-situ by AC impedance and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Electrocatalytic properties towards the OER were investigated by ordinary stationnary voltammetry. It was found that AC impedence and CV yielded similar roughness factors. The substitution of Fe, Co and Cu had practically no effect on the roughness, current densities and reaction mechanism of the OER, and only marginal effect on the electrocatalytic activity.									24	1	0	0	0	1	24			1480-2422			WOS:000085276100010

The common catalysts for HER and OER are composed of precious metals as well as their alloys and compounds, but the high cost and natural scarcity are impeding wider application. In this respect, cobalt based complexes have been investigated as homogeneous molecular catalysts for HER and OER in order to satisfy the low overpotential demand. Owing to the earth abundance and simple chemistry to form compounds with different valence states, cobalt-based compounds are promising alternatives. However, wide application of cobalt-based complexes has been hampered by synthetic issues and at the same time, the catalytic properties of common cobalt-based compounds are still not satisfactory because of the intrinsic electronic structure and limited active sites on the surface. In this review, recent strategies to enhance the catalytic properties of cobalt-based compounds for electrochemical water splitting are discussed comprehensively and the associated HER and OER mechanisms are described. Different methods to maximize the extrinsic activity and enhance the intrinsic activity are summarized and finally, the challenges and perspectives of cobalt-based electrocatalysts are discussed and suggested from the perspective of water splitting.(c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

However, the slow rate of the oxygen evolution reaction remains a key challenge that requires fundamental understanding to facilitate the design of more active and stable electrocatalysts. Here, we probe the local geometric ligand environment and electronic metal states of oxygen-coordinated iridium centres in nickel-leached IrNi@lrO(x) metal oxide core-shell nanoparticles under catalytic oxygen evolution conditions using operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy, resonant high-energy X-ray diffraction and differential atomic pair correlation analysis. Nickel leaching during catalyst activation generates lattice vacancies, which in turn produce uniquely shortened Ir-O metal ligand bonds and an unusually large number of d-band holes in the iridium oxide shell. Density functional theory calculations show that this increase in the formal iridium oxidation state drives the formation of holes on the oxygen ligands in direct proximity to lattice vacancies. We argue that their electrophilic character renders these oxygen ligands susceptible to nucleophilic acid-base-type O-O bond formation at reduced kinetic barriers, resulting in strongly enhanced reactivities.									257	11	0	0	17	0	260			2520-1158			WOS:000449799200011

As an electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), it exhibits an onset potential of 0.852 V and a half-wave potential of 0.778 VversusRHE, as well as superior durability and methanol tolerance. Meanwhile, it illustrates a high activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, which only requires an overpotential of 470 mV to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the rechargeable zinc-air battery using the CeO2/Co@NCH as the air cathode electrocatalyst indicates a high round-trip efficiency with a low overpotential after 170 hours. As for overall water splitting in alkaline solution, it needs only 1.74 V to afford a 10 mA cm(-2)current density with excellent long-term stability. Furthermore, a water splitting cell is integrated with rechargeable zinc-air batteries by taking advantage of the OER/ORR and OER/hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of the sample, and the results present its potential as a good candidate for applications in renewable and sustainable energy conversion.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2398-4902			WOS:000573449300021

Aiming at enhancing oxygen electrode kinetics and stability, composite materials consisting of antimony doped tin oxide and Cs-substituted phosphotungstate were synthesized as the support of iridium oxide and possessed functionality of mixed electronic and protonic conductivity. At 80 degrees C under dry ambient atmosphere, the materials showed an overall conductivity of 0.33 S cm(-1). The supported IrO2 catalysts were characterized in sulfuric acid electrolyte, showing significant enhancement of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Electrolyser tests of the catalysts were conducted at 80 degrees C with a Nafion membrane. At an IrO2 loading of 0.75 mg cm(-2) and a Pt loading of 0.2 mg cm(-2), the cell performance of a current density of 2 A cm(-2) at 1.66 V was achieved.

Clues from oxygen-dependent biosynthesis of nuclear receptor ligands								BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS				391	2			1158	1160		10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.11.041				JAN 8 2010	2010	It is well known that oxygen rise greatly facilitated biological evolution. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Recently, Raymond and Segre revealed that molecular oxygen allows 1000 more metabolic reactions than can occur in anoxic conditions. From the novel metabolites produced in aerobic metabolism, we serendipitously found that some of the metabolites are signaling molecules that target nuclear receptors. Since nuclear signaling systems are indispensable to superior organisms, we speculated that aerobic metabolism may facilitate biological evolution through promoting the establishment of nuclear signaling systems. This hypothesis is validated by the observation that most (97.5%) nuclear receptor ligands are produced by aerobic metabolism, which is further explained in terms of the chemical criteria (appropriate volume and rather high hydrophobicity) of nuclear receptor ligands that aerobic metabolites are more ready than anaerobic counterparts to satisfy these criteria.

The graphite felt-based GF@TiO2:H electrode is able to inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is a critical barrier for operating at high rate for long-term cycling in VRFBs. Significant improvements in charge/discharge and electron-transfer processes for the V3+/V2+ reaction on the surface of reduced TiO2 were achieved as a consequence of the formation of oxygen functional groups and oxygen vacancies in the lattice structure. Key performance indicators of VRFB have been improved, such as high capability rates and electrolyte-utilization ratios (82% at 200mAcm(-2)). Additionally, high coulombic efficiencies (ca. 100% up to the 96thcycle, afterwards >97%) were obtained, demonstrating the feasibility of achieving long-term stability.									43	6	0	0	1	0	44			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000401165900029	28247981

Here, a novel strategy to resolve this problem by interface engineering is reported, in which, Jahn-Teller distortion in MnCo(2)O(4)is significantly suppressed by in situ growth Ni2P nanosheets onto the MnCo2O4. The significance of interface engineering in suppressing Jahn-Teller distortion of Mn(3+)is further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the resulting increased catalytic activity and the effects of suppressed distortion demonstrated by density functional theory calculations. The resulting MnCo2O4@Ni2P heterostructures exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity for the both oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction with small overpotentials of 240 and 57 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, the heterogeneous composite electrode demonstrates a superior current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at a voltage of 1.63 V with excellent durability in a water splitting cell.									28	2	0	0	3	0	28			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000552285600001	32715631

Although Fe-Co-based (oxy)hydroxides show excellent catalytic activity for OER, a comprehensive understanding of the role of Fe and Co is still lacking. Here, we prepared a core-shell Co3O4@FeOx catalyst with an ultrathin FeOx (<1 nm) coating onto ultrafine Co3O4 nanoparticles (similar to 3.1 nm), which exhibit higher OER activity than Fe/Co-based mixed oxides. The enhanced OER electrocatalytic performance is attributed to the introduction of ultrathin FeOx, which can (1) combine water molecules to promote the reaction, (2) enhance the charge transfer ability of Co3O4, and (3) speed up the diffusion of the reactant water close to the active sites and the produced oxygen away from the active sites.

Hence, research on potential OER catalysts has become the focus of many studies. In this work, we investigate capable OER catalysts but focus on catalyst stability, which is, especially in this case, at least equally as important as catalyst activity. We propose a specialized setup for monitoring the corrosion profiles of metal oxide catalysts during a stability testing protocol, which is specifically designed to standardize the investigation of OER catalysts by means of differentiating between catalyst corrosion and deactivation, oxygen evolution efficiency, and catalyst activity. For this purpose, we combined an electrochemical flow cell (EFC) with an oxygen sensor and an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) system for the simultaneous investigation of catalyst deactivation, activity, and faradaic efficiency of catalysts. We tested various catalysts, with IrO2 and NiCoPO2 used as benchmark materials in acidic and alkaline environment, respectively. The scalability of our setup will allow the user to investigate catalytic materials with supports of higher surface area than those which are typical for microelectrochemical flow cells (thus, under conditions more similar to those of commercial electrolyzers).									47	1	0	0	1	0	47			2155-5435			WOS:000402851600004

Some obstacles that hinder the practical applications of Ni-based LDHs were also discussed and it was pointed out that more efforts should be given to structure rational design and the catalyst application in the real water electrolysis technique. This review can help readers understand the recent development of the Ni-based LDHs and get some insights into the rational design of Ni-based LDHs catalyst and catalytic performance improvement strategy.

Herein, an inventive approach is put forward to fabricate ternary metal sulfide hollow microcubes by a hydrothermal method between spherical porous ZnO with transition metal cations in the presence of urea followed by etching and sulfurization. The significant electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with onset potential of 1.48 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) is obsereved. The objective material shows an overpotential of 320 mV, to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and excellent robustness with slight variation in potential after long-term chronopotentiometry test for 12 h. As expected, the material also exhibits oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with a half wave potential of 0.8 V (vs RHE) and limited current density of 5.1 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, further investigations confirm the near four-electron transport pathways for ORR. Such up-bottom etching followed by sulfurization method provide a new concept for engineering porous electrocatalysts.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2366-7486			WOS:000471815400002

Using our Ni3S2 films as both the cathode and the anode, two-electrode full-cell electrolyzers were constructed, which showed stable operation for 100 h at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). The proposed ALD electrocatalysts on planar surfaces exhibited the best performance among Ni3S2 materials for overall water splitting recorded to date.									60	6	0	0	3	0	61			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000430642100073	29578327

Herein, atomically distributed Ni sites over a N-doped hollow carbon matrix are reported as a promising electrocatalyst for OER in alkaline conditions. Significantly boosted activity is observed after the decoration of the active Ni sites with well-controlled coordination geometry. Results of X-ray absorption spectroscopy investigation and density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveal that the effective electronic coupling via the Ni-N coordination can move down the Fermi level and lower the adsorption energy of intermediates, thus resulting in the facilitated OER kinetics.									172	16	0	0	11	0	175			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000490651400001	31588630

In this article, natural cattail fibers are used to fabricate porous nitrogen-doped carbon via direct chemical activation and heteroatom modification treatments. The graphene-like sheets from biomass pyrolysis are assembled into three-dimensional carbon frameworks. The chemical activation of KHCO3 generated unique porous structure and N-containing molecules pyrolysis modification provided nitrogen doping atoms. High surface area up to 2,345 m(2)center dot g(-1) with simultaneous hierarchical pores (from micro to meso and macro) with abundant edge defects are achieved for these carbon materials. These materials have a very large external surface area up to 1,773 m(2)center dot g(-1).

However, their practical applications are impeded by the low lifetimes and inferior energy conversion efficiency as a result of poor catalyst stability and sluggish oxygen reaction kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at their air cathode. Herein, a multiscale structural engineering of the novel catalyst of Fe/Co single atoms co-doped graphite nanoarrays mounted on carbon microspheres (FeCo(a)-ACM) is reported towards ORR and OER for ZABs. In micro-scale, 3D hierarchically porous carbon microspheres facilitate the mass and electron transport; in nano-scale, ordered graphite nanoarrays increase the accessible chances of the active sites; in atomic-scale, chemical doping of Fe/Co single atoms boost the intrinsic ORR and OER activity and finally enhance the performance of ZABs. The FeCo(a)-ACM exhibits excellent ORR (onset potential: 1.03 V, half-wave potential: 0.90 V) and OER (1.60 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) activity. In a practical demonstration, a low charge-discharge gap and a record rechargeable lifetime lasting 900 h at 10 mA cm(-2) are achieved by zinc-air battery with FeCo(a)-ACM within the air electrode.									28	2	0	0	2	0	28			2405-8297			WOS:000500484000041

The composition/structure complexity and adjustability endow them with a huge design space to adjust electronic structure, geometric configuration as well as catalytic activity through constructing reaction active sites with optimal binding energies of different reaction intermediates. This paper reviews the recent progress on the preparation methods, characterization techniques, electrocatalytic applications and functional mechanisms of HEAs-based electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions. The synthesis approaches for HEAs from bottom-up (high-energy ball milling, cryo-milling, melt-spinning and dealloying) to top-down strategies (carbothermal shock, sputtering deposition and solvothermal) and the corresponding materials characterizations are discussed and analyzed. By summarizing and analyzing the electrocatalytic performance of HEAs for diverse electrocatalytic reactions in water electrolysis cells, metal-air batteries and fuel cells, the basic principle of their designs and the relevant mechanisms are discussed. The technical challenges and prospects of HEAs-based electrocatalysts are also summarized with the proposed further research directions. This review can provide a beneficial theoretical reserve and experimental guidance for developing high performance electrocatalytic materials via the paradigm of high entropy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2520-8489	2520-8136		WOS:000861903500001

In this study, a composite catalyst with a unique interpenetrating network (denoted as NiCo2O4@MnO2-CNTs-3) was synthesized and exhibited better bifunctional activity (E = 0.87 V) and durability than both Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts. The improved performance arises from three factors: (i) MnO2 promotes the ORR while NiCo2O4 facilitates the OER; (ii) carbon nanotubes improve the electronic conductivity; and (iii) the highly porous structure enables the adsorption-desorption of O-2 and enhances the structural stability. As a result, the primary and rechargeable Zn-air battery affords a high power density and specific capacity (722 mA h g(-1)), an outstanding discharge stability (255 mW cm(-2) after 1000 cycles) and a high cycling stability (over 2280 cycles). Electron microscopy and electrochemical analysis revealed that the degradation of the rechargeable Zn-air battery performance resulted from the damage of the air electrode and the hydrogen evolution reaction on the zinc electrode. A flexible Zn-air battery employing a solid-state electrolyte showed an exciting stability (540 cycles) and high power density (85.9 mW cm(-2)), suggesting that the anion exchange membrane effectively prevents the migration of Zn2+ ions and the deposition of carbonates.									25	2	0	0	0	0	26			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000439319000037	29979460

Using an electrochemical multielectrode cell, we investigated the OER activity of selected compositions of seven binary alloy systems, Ru-M (M = Pd, Ir, Cu, Co, Re, Cr, Ni). Benchmarked using pure Ru electrocatalysts, Ru-Co, Ru-Ir, and Ru-Cu exhibited improved Ru mass-based catalytic activities. Structural studies of the precursor alloys indicated the presence of hexagonal and cubic mixed metal phases. We hypothesize that the secondary metal component modulates the chemisorption energy of oxygen, which was suggested to be a sensitive rate controlling parameter in the OER catalysis and favors the formation of atomic oxygen O(ad) and possibly HOO(ad) species rather than OH(ad) species on the oxide catalyst.

Herein, the construction of Cu2S/Fe2O3 heterojunction and discover that the formation of covalent S-O bonds between Cu2S and Fe2O3 can significantly improve the photoelectrochemical performance and stability for water splitting is reported. Compared with bare Fe2O3, the heterostructure of Cu2S/Fe2O3 endows the resulting electrode with enhanced charge separation and transfer, extended range for light absorption, and reduced charge recombination rate. Additionally, due to the photothermal properties of Cu2S, the heterostructure exhibits locally a higher temperature under illumination, profitable for increasing the rate of oxygen evolution reaction. Consequently, the photocurrent density of the heterostructure is enhanced by 177% to be 1.19 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. This work may provide guideline for future in the design and fabrication of highly efficient photoelectrodes for various reactions.									23	0	0	0	3	0	23			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000663862600001	34151514

The catalyst system exhibited unprecedented catalytic performance in liquid electrolyte and in single unitized reversible fuel cell tests. The distinct components, each active for either ORR or OER, are prepared and optimized independently of each other and physically mixed during electrode preparation. The new modular URFC catalyst, Cu-alpha-MnO2/XC-72R/NiFe-LDH, combined a carbon-supported, Cu-stabilized alpha-MnO2 ORR catalyst with a NiFe-LDH OER catalyst and displayed improved activity and stability under URFC cycling compared to platinum group metal references. Stepwise modular optimization of the carbon and the interlayer anions of the OER component led to a further improved derivative, Cu-alpha-MnO2/O-MINCNTs/NiFe-LDH-Cl-. This URFC catalyst outperformed all previous materials in terms of its combined overpotential .ORR-OER and performance stability in the rotating disk electrode (RDE) scale.

Ni is averagely required in efficient electrocatalysts for OER, while Mo is familiar to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we introduce Mo into electrocatalysts for OER and synthesize an echinoids-like MoS2@NiS2 electrocatalyst with unique morphology, which demonstrates rapid reaction kinetics and impressive catalysis activity. Furthermore, the electrocatalyst shows low overpotentials of 356 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) as well as a Tafel slope of 82.6 mV dec(-1) in alkaline media. Meanwhile, the electrocatalyst has a large double-layer capability (Cdl) and electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA) values. The OER performances remarkably enhanced with the help of MoS2 affiliation. Owning to the Ni compounds as the substrate, the catalyst can maintain a good stability in alkaline solution even after 10 h of chronoamperometry test at 1.51 V.

The VS4 microspheres featuring oxygen doping and abundant sulfur vacancies are synthesized by a simple solution method. The O-doping and S-vacancy offer the VS4 with a dramatically narrowed band gap and an improved intrinsic electronic conductivity, benefitting for fast charge transport during the HER process. Furthermore, the rich defects of sulfur vacancies and oxygen heteroatoms provide more active sites with high activity for catalyzing protons to hydrogen reaction. Owing to the synergistic effects of defect engineering and electronic benefits, the VS4 microspheres serve as a superior HER catalyst surpassing the 1T-VS2 microflowers with a layered structure. The VS4 microsphere catalyst exhibits prominent kinetic metrics of a low onset potential of 15 mV, a low overpotential of 48 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 44 mV dec(-1), and a stable long-term operation of 75 h.

Additionally, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves a phase transition from a liquid to a gas, and thus, the removal of the generated oxygen bubble is an important factor for improving the activity or maintaining the performance. In this study, 3D ordered nanoporous nickel electrode is synthesized with a thickness of 5 mu m by using a templating method composed of proximity field nanopatterning (PnP) and electrodeposition followed by introduction of NiFe(OH)(2) on the nickel electrode to increase the OER activity. The unique nanopore array structure of the electrode has advantages of not only an enlarged active surface area but also the fast removal of oxygen bubbles by spatial confinement effect. Consequently, the NiFe-decorated 3D ordered nanoporous nickel electrode shows a highly efficient oxygen-evolving ability with a turnover frequency of 2.9 s(-1) and an ultralong durability of 300 h.									25	3	0	0	1	0	25			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000450974700021

The topochemically transformed Co3O4-VO outperforms the as-synthesized P123-encapsulated CoOxHy nanosheets and their conventionally calcined Co3O4 counterpart for both electrochemical oxygen evolution and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), owing to their largely preserved 2D structure and elimination of P123 for abundant exposed surface active sites. More importantly, the strain-induced oxygen vacancies at grain boundaries of Co3O4 nanocrystallines are also proposed to be responsible for the improved electrooxidation performance. Furthermore, Co3O4-VO exhibits remarkable long-term stability during the chronoamperometric test in 1 M KOH.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000775634100001

Transition metal selenides exhibit optimal electronic conductivity and tunable physicochemical properties, which endow them with potential for efficient electrocatalysts to facilitate the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR and OER). Herein, hollow NixCo0.85-xSe nanospheres were synthesized using a facile polyol based solution chemical method. The NixCo0.85-xSe exhibits an onset overpotential of 0.89 V for ORR, and an overpotential of 305 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for OER. Moreover, the NixCo0.85-xSe based Zn-air battery displays remarkable specific capacity and durability. Such superior catalytic performances can be attributed to the synergistic effect, large specific surface area and enhanced electron transfer rate. This approach provides a new way to design highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy storage and utilization.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000495687500001

Herein, we report a highly efficient and robust bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting based on Co@Ir core-shell nano particles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped porous carbon derived from metal-organic frameworks. The series of Co@Ir/NC-x samples were prepared through a galvanic replacement of IrCl3 with Co/NC, which was obtained by calcination of zeolitic imidazolate framework 67 (ZIF-67). In the electrocatalytic characterizations toward OER and HER, Co@Ir/NC-10% exhibited the best performance among the series, with an overpotential of 280 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, superior to the benchmark IrO2 catalyst, and an overpotential of -121 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER in 1 M KOH. Moreover, Co@Ir/NC-10% also demonstrated markedly higher long-term stability than IrO2 for OER and superior long-term durability than Pt/C for HER. Finally, the overall water splitting catalyzed by the series of composites was explored and visually observed.									80	2	0	0	3	0	81			2168-0485			WOS:000429285800075

The potentiostatic electrodeposition of LDHs has been extensively applied in the literature as a fast and direct method to substitute classical chemical routes. However, the electrochemical approach does not usually allow for a fine control of the M-II/M-III ratio in the synthesized material. By employing a recently proposed potentiodynamic method, LDH films of controlled composition are herein prepared with good reproducibility, using different ratios of the trivalent (Fe or Al) to bivalent (Co) cations in the electrolytic solution. All the obtained materials are shown to be effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, and are thoroughly characterized by a multi-technique approach, including FE-SEM, XRD, Raman, AES and a wide range of electrochemical procedures.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000497575600001	31750577

Among them, metal oxides (e.g., perovskite and pyrochlore) are known to be promising candidates as electrocatalysts. Nevertheless, the intrinsic catalytic activities of pyrochlore oxides are still poorly understood because of the formation of undesirable phases derived from the synthesis processes. Herein, we present highly pure single crystalline pyrochlore nanoparticles with metallic conduction (Pb2Ru2O6.5) as an efficient bi-functional oxygen electrocatalyst. Notably, it has been experimentally shown that the covalency of Ru-O bonds affects the ORR and OER activities by comparing the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of the metallic Pb2Ru2O6.5 and insulating Sm2Ru2O7 for the first time. Moreover, we followed the interatomic distance changes of Ru-O bonds using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to investigate the structural stabilities of the pyrochlore catalysts during electrocatalysis. The highly efficient metallic Pb2Ru2O6.5 exhibited outstanding bi-functional catalytic activities and stabilities for both ORR and OER in aqueous Zn-air batteries.									119	8	0	0	9	0	123			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000395208000010

Here, we firstly synthesized Ru nanoparticles with abundant stacking faults (SFs) combining ultrafast heating with rapid quenching. The close-packed planes of perfect hexagonal closed-packed partially transform into face-centered cubic in the SFs region. It requires 196 mV and 35 mV to drive hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evo-lution reaction under 10 mA/cm(2) current density, prominently expedites overall water splitting with 1.51 V in acid. Theoretical calculations demonstrate the performance is originated from synergistic effect of the SFs and induced continuous strain field, among which the dominant compressive strain attenuates crystal field splitting effect of Ru sites, thus enhancing the electron transfer of Ru sites. The excellent inter-orbital p-d transfers determine strong electronic activities for boosting OER performance. This work provides insights for rational design of catalysts with defective structures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000854091700002

We report here a facile preparation of orthorhombic CoTe2 nanocrystals embedded in an N-doped graphitic carbon matrix to form a 3D architecture with a size of similar to 500 nm and abundant mesopores of similar to 4 nm for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The hybrid electrocatalyst delivers a small overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than that for pristine CoTe2 powder. After cycling for 2000 cycles or driving continual OER for 20 h, only a slight loss is observed. The mesoporous 3D architecture and the strong interaction between N-doped graphitic carbon and CoTe2 are responsible for the enhancement of the electrocatalytic performance.									51	3	0	0	1	0	52			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000413503700066	28926695

Herein, we provide the first report about a facile colloidal method to fabricate 2D ultrathin ternary FeNiS2 nanosheets (NSs). When serving as an OER catalyst under alkaline conditions, they exhibited superior electrocatalytic performance over RuO2 and achieved a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a potential of 1.54 V and a Tafel slope of 46 mV decade(-1). Meanwhile, an ORR catalytic activity was also achieved with an onset potential of 0.78 V, a Tafel slope of 107 mV decade-1, and a high selectivity with electron transfer number of 3.92 and H2O2% of 3.6% at 0.3 V under neutral conditions, which were comparable to those of the commercial Pt/C. The ternary FeNiS(2-)NSs were superior over the binary FeS NSs and Ni9S8 nanorods synthesized via the same routes. More importantly, with the resistance for the corrosion and poison from the alkaline and phosphate buffer solution, the FeNiS2 NSs exhibited superior stability without apparent OER or ORR catalytic activity loss over long-term operation. Their enhanced electrocatalytic performance compared to their binary counterparts indicate that a new strategy to prepare high performance OER and ORR catalysts was developed. In addition, the as-prepared FeNiS2 NSs could serve as a noble-metal-free catalyst for OER or ORR with good electrocatalytic activities and long-term stability for practical applications.

The anodic reactions of these devices are all oxygen evolution reactions (OER), so the development of efficient OER electrocatalysts is of great significance. At the same time, understanding the reaction mechanism of OER is conducive to the rational design of efficient OER electrocatalysts. In general, catalytic active centers play a direct role in OER performance. In this paper, a series of stable bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs, named as Fe-3-Co-n-X-2, n=2, 3 and X=F, Cl, Br) with similar structure were synthesized by changing the halogen coordinated with the cobalt metal active center, aiming to investigate the influence of halogen substitution effect on OER performance. It was found that the OER activity of Fe-3-Co-3-F-2 is much better than Fe-3-Co-2-Cl-2 and Fe-3-Co-2-Br-2, indicating that the regulation of the electronegativity change of the coordination halogen atom can regulate the coordination electron structure of the metal active center, thereby achieving effective regulation of OER performance.									19	1	0	0	2	0	19			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000496532100001	31552686

The oxygen catalysts play roles in maximizing the energy conversion efficiencies of ZABs. Herein, a strategy of electronic structure modulation is used by ruthenium doping and post-oxidation treatment in cobalt encapsulated N-doped carbon nanotubes for enhancing catalytic activities of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). First principles calculations reveal that doping Ru into Co or CoOx enhances charge transfer from Ru to carbon atoms adjacent to the doped N atom and then promotes the reversible oxygen reactions. The achieved catalysts (denoted as RuCoOx@Co/N-CNT) exhibit efficient catalytic activities driving both ORR and OER with a small overpotential gap (E-OER - E-ORR = 0.79 V). Specifically, the ZABs assembled with RuCoOx@Co/N-CNT catalysts display an open-circuit potential of 1.44 V, a specific capacity of 788 mA h g(-1), a power density of 93 mW cm(-2) and long-term discharge-charge cycling stability, even superior to those of commercial Pt/C and RuO2 electrodes. This work proves that modulating the electronic structure of active sites by doping or post oxidation treatment is an efficient way to improve the catalytic performance.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000508855700030

Herein, the corrosion layers of iron foam are tailored towards preparing self-supporting electrodes for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Corrosion reactants (Ni2+, O-2 and H2O) are adopted to regulate the structures and electrochemical performances of electrodes on account of the diverse iron corrosion behaviors. By further comparing the spontaneous iron corrosion in ZnCl2, CoCl2, NiCl2 and FeCl3 solutions, it is identified that the appropriate electrode potentials of Ni/Ni2+ and Co/Co2+ are favourable for achieving uniformly ordered corrosion layers owing to the simultaneously occurring oxygen corrosion and replacement reaction. The as-prepared electrode exhibits excellent OER performances of affording low overpotentials of 221 and 291 mV to reach 100 and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively, as well as steadily operating at 500 mA cm(-2) for 100 h. Integrating with a prominent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, an industrially required current density of 500 mA cm(-2) has been obtained at 1.81 V. Importantly, a large-area electrode (8 x 8 cm(2)) has been successfully prepared. This work establishes potential possibilities for designing inexpensive and efficient electrocatalysts through regulated metal corrosion.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000704760100001

The increased adsorption, especially chemical adsorption capacity, of the OER intermediate *O on anode materials is one of the key factors to improve the performance of the anodic electrocatalysts. In this research, we tuned the electronegativity of anode materials to tailor their chemical adsorption capacity in OER by modulating the metal ion composition in the secondary building unit in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Nanosheet Fe(III)-MIL-88A has been prepared as a parent catalyst in this research due to its high charger transfer capability and stability. Ni2+ ions with lower electronegativity have been introduced to exchange Fe3+ sites in Fe(III)-MIL-88A, which would lead to decrease of the overall electronegativity of the MOF anode, accompanied by the electron density shift from Ni2+ to Fe3+ via bridge oxygen. Porous MOFs with lower overall electronegativity significantly improved their adsorption capacity for *O intermediate, thereby accelerating the OER performance during operation. Our research hints at the potential that the electronegativity of porous anodes could be fine-tuned to optimize their adsorption capability for the high-efficient hydrogen production during electrocatalytic water splitting.									8	1	0	0	0	0	9				2574-0970		WOS:000624546800106

The PtCo/NCNF hybrid consists of PtCo alloy nanoparticles surrounded by a few of N-doped carbon layers, demonstrating a typical core-shell structures. The PtCo/NCNF hybrid can both served as electrode materials for electrocatalytic water splitting including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). For the HER performance, the PtCo/NCNF exhibits very small onset potential of 20 mV, an overpotential of 50 mV at a j (vs RHE) = 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 30 mV dec(-1). The PtCo/NCNF hybrid also exhibits high OER activity with an onset potential of 310 mV, an overpotential of 400 mV at a j of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 76 mV dec-1. The high catalytic activities of PtCo alloy for HER and OER originate from the 3D hierarchical structures, well-dispersed PtCo alloy, high conductivity of NCNF, protection from the carbon-encapsulated structure, and the introduction of nitrogen.

In this work, catalytically active gamma-nickel oxyhydroxide (gamma-NiOOH) was obtained from a two-dimensional (2D) nickel(II) dithiooxamide Ni(dto) chelate polymer via in situ electrochemical transformation in an acetylene black matrix. The transformation was carried out on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode in 1 M KOH solution, in which the nickel(II) centers of the chelate polymer were transformed into nano-sized gamma-NiOOH crystallites dispersed in the carbon matrix. The resultant nanostructured catalyst exhibits OER overpotential of 390 mV (at 12 mA/cm(2)) and a Tafel slope of 328 mV/dec in 1 M KOH solution. The OER overpotential of the catalyst is lower than that of IrO2/C electrode, with the same material loading. The oxygen evolution is initiated by adsorption of hydroxide ions at the Ni metal sites of the layered gamma-NiOOH, with a subsequent release of oxygen molecules. This study unfolds the potential of in situ electrochemical transformation of 3d transition metal 2D chelate polymers to fabricate active electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000810407700002

Here we report a simple one-step fabrication method of catalytic electrode using ultra-fast laser scanning. SEM results demonstrate that the samples have a regular porous array microstructure; XRD shows that Cu2O was formed on the surface of Cu substrate, which is in agreement with the large amount of Cu+ detected from XPS. The as-prepared Cu2O-Cu catalyst exhibits excellent OER activity in 1 M NaOH with an over-potential of 384 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (without iR compensation). During this process, thin Cu(OH)(2) passivation layer could be formed with weak crystallinity, which could be easily removed by reduction reactions using cyclic voltammetry and it has minimum side effect on the OER performance of the sample. This approach is ultra-fast, simple, and environmentally friendly, and thus holds great potential in large-scale practical applications of electrocatalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Till now, it is still challenging to achieve both efficient activities on a single commercial noble-metal catalyst. Recently, N, P co-doped graphene has shown good bifunctional evidence. However, the atomic-scale understanding of the bifunctional mechanism is still lacking. Here, we show that the N and P atoms prefer to bond with each other, forming embedded N-P clusters in graphene. The catalytic performances of the N-P clusters are sensitive to their geometries, especially the N:P ratios. The N:P ratio of similar to 2 is optimal for OER, while similar to 3 is optimal for ORR. Through evaluating the ORR/OER potential gaps, we found that the N-P cluster designated as (NCPC1)-P-2 shows both the high performances of ORR and OER, responsible for the unique bifunctionality in the N, P co-doped graphene.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000461371300023	30876366

A systematic substitution of cobalt with redox-active iron and redox-inactive magnesium and aluminum in a cobalt spinel with anisotropic particle morphology with a preferred 111 surface termination is presented, resulting in a substitution series including Co3O4, MgCo2O4, Co2FeO4, Co2AlO4 and CoFe2O4. The role of redox pairs in the spinels is investigated in chemical water oxidation by using ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN test), electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and H2O2 decomposition. Studying the effect of dominant surface termination, isotropic Co3O4 and CoFe2O4 catalysts with more or less spherical particles are compared to their anisotropic analogues. For CAN-test and OER, Co3+ plays the major role for high activity. In H2O2 decomposition, Co2+ reveals itself to be of major importance. Redox active cations in the structure enhance the catalytic activity in all reactions. A benefit of a predominant 111 surface termination depends on the cobalt oxidation state in the as-prepared catalysts and the investigated reaction.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000709862600001	34596277	
J	Si Liu; Han Cheng; Kun Xu; Hui Ding; Jingyi Zhou; Bojun Liu; Wangsheng Chu; Changzheng Wu; Yi Xie								Dual modulation via electrochemical reduction activation on electrocatalysts for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction								ACS Energy Letters				4	2			423	9		10.1021/acsenergylett.8b01974				8 Feb. 2019	2019	Cobalt-based spinels are promising candidates for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, these electrocatalysts usually suffer from the lack of active species transformation during OER due to the high stability and reversibility of the spinel structure. Herein, we highlight that electrochemical reduction could serve as a general activation process with dual modulation on spinels and enhance the catalytic activity. Taking Co3O4 as an example, both rock salt generation and increased surface roughness could be realized. Moreover, because of the synergistic effect of dual modulations, surface rock salt could be massively generated, which breaks the scale limitation of chemical reduction. With optimal modulation, electrochemically reduced Co3O4 showed lower overpotential and enhanced OER activity. Furthermore, electrochemical reduction activation could be extended to other spinel oxides. We anticipate that electrochemical reduction activation will be a facile route to realize efficient electrocatalytic performance, offering new insights toward the correlation among processing methods, active sites, and catalytic performance. copy 2018 American Chemical Society.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2380-8195			INSPEC:19445049

With great interest in the study of mono- or few-layered TMDs, we seek to fundamentally explore the effects of doping on bulk TMDs, particularly MoS2 and WS2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with p-dopants Nb and Ta. Despite promises reported in the computational studies of doped TMDs on the HER, our results show otherwise. Doped bulk TMDs display less catalytic activity in comparison to their undoped counterparts for the HER A similar effect is observed for ORR catalysis. Characterization was done to shed light on its surface elemental composition, properties, and morphologies. It was found that doped WS2 has a high percentage of IT phase but this does not correlate with a lower overpotential for the HER at -10 mA cm(-2), which contradicts the general consensus. We therefore show that p-dopants have a negative electrocatalytic effect on the HER. These findings are of high importance for the field of TMD electrochemistry, as they challenge the current consensus that doping always improves the electrocatalysis of TMDs.									140	8	0	0	5	0	142			2155-5435			WOS:000382714000012

Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of L2NiIV=O from L2NiIII-OH is the rate-determining step, whereas R-L2NiIII-OH is more stable than G-L2NIIII-OH, and forming L2NiIV=O from the former has a much lower barrier than from the latter.

In this work, we decide to prepare an unusual multifunctional electrocatalyst, such as icosahedral palladium nanocrystals (PdNCs) encapsulating on N-MoO2-Mo2C half-hollow nanotube (HHNT) heterointerface, using an in-situ chemical reaction and following sonic probe irradiation method. All the experiments demonstrate that special defect-enriched heterointerfaces N-MoO2-Mo2C supported Pd nanocomposite can greatly improve the ORR activity (E-onset = 1.01 V and E-1/2 = 0.90 V) with good stability, outstanding HER (eta(10) = 65 mV) and OER (eta(10) = 180 mV) performances than those of commercial precious electrocatalysts (Platinum on carbon [Pt/C] and ruthenium oxide [RuO2]). The overall water splitting electrolyzer fabricates by Pd/N-MoO2-Mo2C as both anode and cathode electrodes to achieve a current density of 10 Ma/cm(2) at a cell voltage of 1.56 V, which surpasses the most recent reported electrocatalysts.

The electrocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy/transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Their catalytic activities toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were evaluated by linear-sweep voltammetry (LSV) in an alkaline electrolyte. It is found that GO is vital for the formation of CMO/N-rGO nanocomposite during the preparation. The CMO hybrid nanoparticles can be obtained through feeding GO during the preparation, but only the single spinel oxide, i.e. MnCo2O4, is formed without adding GO, even if the feeding molar ratio of Co and Mn (Co/Mn) is higher than 2. The CMO/N-rGO nanocomposite electrocatalysts can efficiently take advantages of ORR and OER active sites from the CMO hybrid oxides and N-rGO, as well as the enhanced charge transfer from N-rGO, thus bringing about higher bifunctional activities towards ORR/OER in alkaline electrolyte, as compared with Co3O4, MnCo2O4, and N-rGO. The CMO/N-rGO nanocomposites are considered to be promising bifunctional electrocatalysts for ORR/OER.									30	2	0	0	0	0	30			2196-0216			WOS:000380043500010

Currently, OER catalysts mostly consist of noble metal (NM) catalysts, which cannot be applied in industries due to the high price. It is of great importance to developing low-cost catalysts materials as NM materials substitution. In this work, jarosite (AFe(3)(SO4)(2)(OH)(6), A = K+, Na+, NH4+, H3O+) was synthesized by a one-step method, and its OER catalytic performance was studied using catalytic slurry (the weight ratios of jarosite and conductive carbon black are 2:1, 1:1 and 1:2). Microstructures and functional groups of synthesized material were analyzed using XRD, SEM, FI-IR, etc. The OER catalytic performance of (NH4)Fe-3(SO4)(2)(OH)(6)/conductive carbon black were examined by LSV, Tafel, EIS, ECSA, etc. The study found that the OER has the best catalytic performance when the weight ratio of (NH4)Fe-3(SO4)(2)(OH)(6) to conductive carbon black is 2:1. It requires only 376 mV overpotential to generate current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope (82.42 mV dec(-1)) and large C-dl value (26.17 mF cm(-2)).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1996-1944		WOS:000771995100001	35057385

It is difficult studying high-performance non precious materials as cost-effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the OER and ORR in future practical applications. In this study, NiCo2S4 hollow spheres (NiCo2S4 HSs) were fabricated via an effective and facile one-pot "green" approach in an N,N-dimethylformamide ethylene glycol binary solution. The obtained NiCo2S4 HSs had a high specific surface area as well as numerous active sites and showed a remarkable catalytic performance and durability toward both the OER and ORR in an alkaline electrolyte. For the ORR, NiCo2S4 HSs exhibited a positive half-wave potential of 0.80 V and demonstrated outstanding stability and enhanced methanol tolerance. For the OER, NiCo2S4 HSs presented a low overpotential (400 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope, and excellent stability in 0.1 M KOH. Moreover, regarding the overall electrocatalytic activity, the potential difference of NiCo2S4 HSs was 0.83 V, surpassing that of NiCo2S4 nanoparticles, binary counterparts (CoS, NiS), and most highly active bifunctional catalysts described in the literature. The superior catalytic performance of NiCo2S4 HSs is mainly ascribed to its unique hollow structure, which increases molecular diffusion and adsorption, as well as the synergistic effect of Ni and Co, which offers richer redox reaction sites. Importantly, this strategy may facilitate the design and preparation of excellent bifunctional nonprecious metal electrocatalysts in various domains.									80	1	0	0	2	0	80			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000444355700033	30102862

Herein, by means of comprehensive experimental and theoretical studies, we carefully examine the effects of component dopants on the catalytic performance of graphitic C3N4 (g-C3N4)-based electrocatalysts. The g-C3N4 monoliths with three types of dopant elements (B, P, and S) embedded in different sites (either C or N) of the C-N skeleton are rationally designed and synthesized. The kinetics, intrinsic activity, charge transfer process, and intermediate adsorption/desorption free energy of the selected catalysts in oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction are investigated both experimentally and theoretically. We demonstrate that the component aspect within the g-C3N4 motifs has distinct and substantial effects on the corresponding electroactivities, and proper component element engineering can be a viable yet efficient protocol to render the metal-free composites as competent catalysts rivaling the metallic counterparts. We hope that this study may shed light on the empirical trial-and-error exploration in design and development of g-C3N4-based materials as well as other metal-free catalysts for energy-related electrocatalytic reactions.									115	3	0	0	10	0	115			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000404808000080	28605179

These types of anodes have a small overpotential toward the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) in impressed-current cathodic protection (ICCP) systems and vigorously evolve chlorine (Cl-2) in electrolytes containing Cl-, such as seawater. Cl-2 has a negative impact on the ecosystem because of its intrinsic toxicity and corrosivity. We present herein a thin film coating that can effectively suppress the CER without prevention of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the underlying iridium oxide (IrO2) layer coated on a titanium substrate in 0.5M NaCl solution. The thin film consists of buserite-type layered manganese dioxide (MnO2), the interlayer of which accommodates Mg2+ cations and two layers of H2O molecules, and is uniformly deposited via an electrochemical route and subsequent ion-exchange. The CER efficiency of the electrode modified with the Mg-buserite layer was as small as 11% at +1.7V vs. Ag/AgCl.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000459893000007

The Co3O4@SiO2 was obtained by calcining Co(OH)(2)@SiO2 under atmospheric air for 3 h and then immersing in sodium hydroxide to yield Co(3)O(4)NFs. The Ni-deposited Co3O4 NFs (Ni@Co3O4-NFs) were synthesized by chemical deposition of nickel nanoparticles onto Co3O4-NF by a reducing agent, NaBH 4 . The physical characterization of Co3O4-NFs and Ni@Co3O4-NFs was performed by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The electrochemical properties of Co3O4-NFs and Ni@Co3O4-NFs for the oxygen reduction and evolution reaction were determined in an 8 M KOH solution. Ni@Co3O4-NF showed a better cell performance than that of Co3O4-NF. Moreover, Ni@Co3O4-NF exhibited a higher stability and longer life cycles at 20 mA cm(-2) at a 2 h charging and discharging rate as compared to Co3O4-NF. Therefore, Co3O4-NF and Ni@Co3O4-NF could be used as a cathode material for Zn-air rechargeable batteries.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1387-7003	1879-0259		WOS:000517349100020

Herein, using various operando characterizations, we identify the origin of a 12-time enhancement of OER activity over pure cobalt oxyhydroxide achieved by confining high-valance chromium into its lattice. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals in-situ generation of high-valence Cr state with shortened Cr-O bond relative to original state, indicating potential-dependent formation of OER intermediates on Cr sites. Operando electrochemical impedance and infrared spectroscopy provide direct spectroscopic evidence of OOH* on Cr site. Combined with theoretical calculations, the confined Cr is identified as the active site with improved bonding strength with O*, exhibiting a lower overpotential than that on Co site. This study elucidates the dynamic behaviour of active sites and provides guiding for improving OER catalysts via introducing high-valance metals.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000827133600003

It is reported that magnetic field can improve OER activity, but it is not clear how the AC magnetic field affects OER. Here, a series of NiCoFe-MOF-74 are reported, and it is found AC magnetic field can signifi-cantly enhance the alkaline OER activity at low current densities, but reduce the alkaline OER activity at high current densities, due to spin conservation, MHD effect, and induced electric field induced by AC magnetic field. In particular, when an AC magnetic field of 5.184 mT is applied, the overpotential at 10 mA cm-2 of NiCoFe-MOF-74 and carbon paper was reduced by 36.7% and 17.6%, respectively, but the overpotential at 40 mA cm(-2) increased by 27.8% and 39.9%, respectively. This discovery provides a promising strategy for introducing an AC magnetic field to adjust the process of electrocatalytic reactions.									11	0	0	0	0	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000711904400005

Interface engineering is one of the most effective strategies for modulating the local electronic structure of active sites to enhance catalytic activity. Herein, NiFe2O4-x nanoparticles were integrated to NiMoO4 nanowires (NiFe2O4-x/NMO) grown on nickel foam to construct an extended interface with strong electronic interactions. The NiFe2O4-x/NMO demonstrates high OER activities as manifested by a low overpotential of 326 mV at a high current density of 600 mA cm(-2) and good long-term stability. The intimate interface between NiFe2O4-x and NiMoO4 is responsible for the Fe-facilitated phase transition to active gamma-NiOOH phase as revealed by in situ Raman spectmelectrochemical studies. This study outlines how the interface design of integrated nanostructures can optimize the formation of active phase for enhanced catalytic activity.									69	1	0	0	3	0	69			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000621624500003

These FeNiGly samples bear unique structures of hierarchical microspheres assembled by the interlaced ultrathin nanosheets or loosely aggregated nanoparticles, which ensure the electrocatalytic systems more efficient and accessible for the OER process. The FeNiGly exhibits an excellent OER activity with quite low overpotential of similar to 320 and similar to 380 mV to achieve the current density of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solutions, respectively. Moreover, the FeNiGly also presents a good durability in alkaline electrolytes.

Herein, we report a galvanic replacement-mediated method for in-situ growth of iron-nickel nitride on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a powdery catalyst for OER. This in-situ grown structure creates intimate interaction between the active substance of Fe2Ni2N and CNTs so as to accelerate charge transfer in the catalytical interface. First-principles calculations reveal that the Fe2Ni2N is intrinsically metallic, and the contribution mainly derives from the Fe atoms at corner sites of crystal structures. A good synergistic effect between metallic Fe2Ni2N with excellent intrinsic activity and conductive CNTs lead to outstanding electrochemical performance with a low overpotential (eta(10) (mAcm-2) = 282 mV) and Tafel slope (38 mV dec(-1)), as well as good long-term stability.

The obtained Ni3FeN/SG electrode shows the excellent catalytic activity and the durability for OER in alkaline solution, owing to iron incorporation, high electrical conductivity and 3D network-like structure of strutted graphene.

Herein, a novel metal-free electrocatalyst consisting of a oxygen-functionalized electrochemically exfoliated graphene (OEEG) nanosheets array is reported. Benefitting from a vertically aligned arrays structure and introducing oxygen functional groups, the metal-free OEEG nanosheets array exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity and stability toward OER with a low overpotential of 334 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)in acidic electrolyte. Such a high OER performance is thus far the best among all previously reported metal-free carbon-based materials, and even superior to commercial Ir/C catalysts (420 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) in acid. Characterization results and electrochemical measurements identify the COOH species in the OEEG acting as active sites for acidic OER, which is further supported by atomic-scale scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the reaction pathway of dual sites that is mixed by zigzag and armchair edges (COOH-zig-corner) is better than the pathway of single site.									46	4	0	0	2	0	46			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000541505300001

However, the electrochemically active anions in seawater can cause the corrosion of electrodes or undesirable side reactions during the anodic reaction at the anode, thus degrading the overall system efficiency. Hence, it is imperative to develop highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for efficient seawater electrolysis. In this study, carbon-coated sodium cobalt-iron pyrophosphate (Na2Co1-xFexP2O7/C, 0 <= x <= 1) nanoparticles (NCFPO/C NPs) and NCFPO/C NPs loaded on a carbon cloth (NCFPO/C@CC) are fabricated as a promising OER electrocatalyst for alkaline seawater electrolysis. The electrocatalytic OER performance of the NCFPO/C NPs is optimized by controlling their Co/Fe ratio. NCFPO/C@CC acts as an efficient OER electrocatalyst during the OER test in an alkaline saline solution without corroding the electrode and generating reactive chloride species. It also exhibits long-term stability and durability with continuous oxygen generation. In addition, NCFPO/C@CC shows the electrocatalytic OER activity in alkaline seawater, demonstrating that NCFPO/C is a promising candidate as an OER electrocatalyst for realistic alkaline seawater electrolysis.									66	7	0	0	2	0	71			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100075

Herein, a bifunctional NiSe2 nanoparticles/carbon fiber paper (NSN/CFP) electrode is fabricated by the pyrolysis of Ni(NO3)(2) on CFP, followed by a selenization step. The as-prepared electrocatalysts exhibit superior overall water splitting behavior in 1 M KOH with low overpotentials of 145 mV and 280 mV at current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) respectively, comparable to the performance of 20% Pt/C and RuO2. Detailed compositional and morphological studies reveal that the NiSe2 gradually transforms into an amorphous Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH heterojunction during both HER and OER in alkaline medium. Based on these experimental results, an oxidation-induced self-reconstruction mechanism is proposed. Owing to the highly-oxidized Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH active species, the self-reconstructed structure enhances the water splitting under fixed potentials for a prolonged time of 96 h with negligible current degradation. This work not only provides a facile route to fabricate efficient and stable electrocatalysts for large-scale water splitting but also reveals an underlying structural evolution mechanism, which guides the rational design of heterogeneous catalysts.

Hydrogen is considered among the most promising clean energy sources for the future. Recently, electrochemical water splitting has been considered as one of the most efficient approaches to harvest hydrogen energy, which generates only non-pollutant water on combustion. However, the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction significantly restricts the efficiency of water splitting and requires a relatively high cell voltage to drive the electrolysis. Therefore, seeking a thermodynamically favorable anodic reaction to replace the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction by utilizing highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts for the anodic reaction and hydrogen evolution are crucial for achieving energy-efficient hydrogen production for industrial applications. Nevertheless, it is known that the oxygen evolution reaction can be replaced with other useful and thermodynamically favorable reactions to reduce the electrolysis voltage for realizing energy-efficient hydrogen production. Therefore, in this study, we present a bifunctional nickel nanoparticle-embedded carbon (Ni@C) prism-like microrod electrocatalyst synthesized via a two-step method involving the synthesis of a precursor metal-organic framework-74 and subsequent carbonization treatment for methanol oxidation and hydrogen evolution. The interfacial structure consisting of a nickel and carbon skeleton was realized via in situ carbonization. However, the dispersed nickel nanoparticles do not easily aggregate owing to the partition by the surrounding carbon as it would sufficiently expose the active Ni sites to the electrolytes, ensuring fast charge transfer between the catalyst and electrolytes by accelerating the electrochemical kinetics. In the anodic methanol oxidation, the products were detected as carbon dioxide and formate with faradaic efficiencies of 36.2% and 62.5%, respectively, at an applied potential of 1.55 V. Meanwhile, the Ni@C microrod catalyst demonstrated high activity and durability (2.7% current decay after 12 h of continuous operation) toward methanol oxidation, which demonstrates that methanol oxidation precedes oxidation under voltage forces. Notably, the bifunctional catalyst not only exhibits excellent performance toward methanol oxidation but also yields a low overpotential of 155 mV to drive 10 mA.cm(-2) toward hydrogen evolution in 1.0 mol.L-1 KOH aqueous solution with 0.5 mol.L(-1 )methanol at room temperature, which guarantees the hydrogen production efficiency. More importantly, the constructed two-electrode electrolyzer produced a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.6 V, which decreased by 240 mV after replacing the oxygen evolution reaction with methanol oxidation.									7	2	0	0	0	0	7			1000-6818			WOS:000616616500007

The metal size and metal-support interaction can significantly affect the electrocatalytic activity and stability. As a novel two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotrope comprising sp- and sp(2)-hybridized carbon atoms, graphdiyne (GDY) possesses uniformly distributed pores, naturally created anchoring sites, high electrical conductivity, and good stability, making it as an attractive matrix for supporting metal catalysts. Herein, this review will present a systematical summary on the synthesis of size-controlled metal catalysts from nanoparticles to single atoms anchored on GDY and their applications in energy related electrocatalysis, in which the size effect and confinement effect on electrocatalytic performance will be revealed. We first briefly introduce the emerging synthetic methods for GDY, laying a foundation for the subsequent fabrication of nano-scale GDY-supported metal catalysts. Then the corresponding electrocatalytic applications including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) are elaborately discussed. This review will be helpful for understanding the effect of support-metal interaction on electrocatalytic performance and thereby designing ideal supported-metal catalysts on atomic scale.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000783453600001

In this work, the dual control strategy of doping and vacancy creation was used to improve the electrocatalytic performance of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for the design of a multifunctional catalyst. A series of M-doped-Ni5P4/M-doped Ni(OH)(2) (M = Fe, Co, Cu, Cr) hierarchical materials with abundant oxygen vacancies was constructed for the first time by hydrothermal and partial phosphating methods. The Co-doped-Ni5P4/Co-doped-Ni(OH)(2) (Co-Ni5P4-NiCoOH) exhibited superior performance in HER, OER and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Moreover, the electrode couple is fitted with two Co-Ni5P4-NiCoOH (C-NP-NCOH) electrodes to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2); the necessary cell voltage was 1.57 V in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea for urea electrolysis and water electrolysis required a 1.6 V cell voltage in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, which is one of the best catalytic activities reported so far. The experimental results suggest that the co-action of Co-doping and oxygen vacancies increases the specific surface area of the material, enhances the electronic conductivity and promotes the exposure of more active sites, thus improving the water splitting and urea electrolysis performances of the catalyst. Density functional theory analysis suggests that Co-Ni5P4-NiCoOH displays optimal adsorption energy of water and electrical conductivity, thus optimizing the adsorption/desorption of intermediates.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000854207900001	36111629

In this work, we report a cheap and simple route for the synthesis of nickel-iron LDH (Ni-Fe LDH) using an iron-based metal-organic framework, Fe MIL-88 as a template. The prepared Ni-Fe LDH is characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron micro-scopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. Ni-Fe LDH is found to be highly active and stable for water oxidation in alkaline solution as compared to commercial Pt/C. The concept of using a metal-organic framework as a structure-directing agent to synthesize Ni-Fe LDH and the use of the material for the oxygen evolution reaction is explored for the first time.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2196-0216			WOS:000419269000015

The rendering unique chemical and physical properties of these precisely engineered colloidal NCs make them superior to their bulk counterparts in many applications, especially for electrochemical reduction reactions that are currently extensively investigated to resolve global energy and environmental issues. Herein we present the recent progress of colloidal NCs and their roles in electrochemical reduction reactions, such as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). In this feature article, we first introduce the colloidal NCs on the synthesis of colloidal NCs with controlled size, shape, composition and structure. We then focus on the emerging concept in colloidal NCs synthesis, as well as the self-assembly of colloidal NCs to superlattice structures. Afterwards, we discuss the fundamentals and representative strategies in designing colloidal NC structures for superior catalytic performance in ORR, HER and CO2RR. In the end, we provide a perspective on the future opportunities of colloidal NCs in electrochemical reduction reaction applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Crystalline or amorphous CoP particles were attained depending on the preparation route. Notably, the amorphous CoP displayed higher activity compared to the crystalline CoP on nickel foam (NF) and fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) substrates due to its unique electronic properties and surface characteristics. During the OER, severe oxidation to Co-oxy(hydroxides)/oxides by the loss of P was found to be crucial to increase the concentration of CoOx active sites. Interestingly, complete leaching of surface P from CoP and surface Co enrichment occurred during the HER. Finally, an OWS device was fabricated where the amorphous CoP outperformed the crystalline CoP with respect to low OWS cell voltage (with a difference of 130 mV) and enhanced stability for 5 days.									69	4	0	0	2	0	70			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000474271200024

Herein, the authors develop a cation-doping and oxygenvacancy engineering strategy to fabricate Ru/Rh-doped FeOOH nanoarrays with abundant oxygen-vacancies in situ grown on Ti3C2Tx MXene (Ru/Rh-FeOOH@Ti3C2Tx) as highly-efficient OER electrocatalysts. Benefiting from Ru/Rh-cation regulation, oxygenvacancy engineering, and heterojunction synergy between MXene and modulated FeOOH, the optimized Rh/Ru-FeOOH@Ti3C2Tx electrocatalysts exhibit excellent OER activities and remarkable stabilities with 100 h. Particularly, 3%Rh-FeOOH@Ti3C2Tx electrocatalyst only needs a 223 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) and 306 mV to reach 100 mA cm(-2), which is superior to commercial IrO2 catalyst and most reported oxyhydroxide-based electrocatalysts. Further, systematically theoretical caculation, kinetics, thermodynamics, and microstructural analysis verify that the integration of Ru/Rh-cation doping and oxygen vacancy obviously enhances the intrinsic conductivity and lattice defects of FeOOH and expose more active sites, thereby decreasing the adsorption/desorption energy barrier and activation energy, and improving the specific activity and catalytic kinetics of electrocatalysts, whereas in situ hybridization with MXene strengthens the structural stability. This work clearly confirms that cationdoping and oxygen-vacancy engineering offers a joint strategy for the electronic structure modulation and design of highly-efficient inexpensive OER electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000795013300001	35567328

The electrocatalysts with x < 0.2 conform to a single phase nano-crystalline materials. On the local level the Co forms clusters dispersed in the original rutile-like matrix. The local environment of the Co conforms to a rutile model which preserves the cationic arrangement but suppresses the probability of the Ru-Ru and Co-Co neighbors along the shortest metal-metal bonds. The electrocatalytic activity of the synthesized Ru1-xCoxO2-y materials in oxygen evolution is comparable with that of the non-doped ruthenium dioxide and little depends on the actual Co content. In presence of chlorides the Co doped materials are more selective towards oxygen evolution compared with the non doped ruthenia. The enhanced oxygen evolution in the case of Co doped electrocatalysts can be attributed to a chemical recombination of surface confined oxo-species. The selectivity shift towards oxygen evolution can be linked with limited activity of the Ru1-xCoxO2-y materials in the chlorine evolution reaction which seems to be relatively weakly dependent on the chloride concentration.

The purity, size, and structure of the products were investigated by changing the calcination temperature, sonication time, and the stoichiometric ratio of the precursors. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were utilized to specify the Zn2MnO4/ZnO nanocomposites. Changing the operative preparation factor can modify the uniformity, size, shape, and structure of the samples. The optical property of nanocomposites was studied via Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), and it is shown that the bandgap is suited for catalytic activity in water-splitting reaction. So Zn2MnO4/ZnO nanocomposite was employed as a novel catalyst for the O-2 evolution reaction. It was observed that cumulative the uniformity of the catalytic agent increased the O-2 evolution reaction yield. The highest value of the oxygen evolution, TON and TOF are associated with nanorod structures, which prepared by 1-h sonication and calcined at 700 degrees C. As a result, we can recommend Zn2MnO4/ZnO nanocomposite as an operative and unique catalyst for the O-2 evolution of water-splitting reaction.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000575656500002

Electrocatalysts play key roles in the chemical processes but often limit the performance of the entire systems due to insufficient activity, lifetime, or high cost. It has been a long-standing challenge to develop efficient and durable electrocatalysts at low cost. In this Perspective, we present our recent efforts in developing strongly coupled inorganic/nanocarbon hybrid materials to improve the electrocatalytic activities and stability of inorganic metal oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, and metal-nitrogen complexes. The hybrid materials are synthesized by direct nucleation, growth, and anchoring of inorganic nanomaterials on the functional groups of oxidized nanocarbon substrates including graphene and carbon nanotubes. This approach affords strong chemical attachment and electrical coupling between the electrocatalytic nanoparticles and nanocarbon, leading to nonprecious metal-based electrocatalysts with improved activity and durability for the oxygen reduction reaction for fuel cells and chlor-alkali catalysis, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction. X-ray absorption near-edge structure and scanning transmission electron microscopy are employed to characterize the hybrids materials and reveal the coupling effects between inorganic nanomaterials and nanocarbon substrates. Z-contrast imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy at single atom level are performed to investigate the nature of catalytic sites on ultrathin graphene sheets. Nanocarbon-based hybrid materials may present new opportunities for the development of electrocatalysts meeting the requirements of activity, durability, and cost for large-scale electrochemical applications.									809	48	0	0	43	1	816			0002-7863			WOS:000315080100001	23339685

In the present paper, a three-dimensional Fe2TiO5/nitrogen-doped graphene (3D FTO/NG) nanocomposite is prepared using a simple, cheap and fast method, called chemical bath deposition (CBD). Structural and physical characterizations of the prepared electrocatalysts are performed by different methods such as Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Fourier Transform InfraRed spectra (FT-IR), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The fabricated binder-free 3D FTO/NG, 3D NG and 3D G on nickel foam (NF) electrodes, were applied to study oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. Among these electrodes, the 3D FTO/NG electrocatalyst, has an overpotential of 264.15 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and its Tafel slope was 35 (mV/dec). Its long-term stability and excellent performance are due to the simultaneous effect of nitrogen doping and presence of metal oxide nanoparticles, which helped to increase the number of active sites for reaction, adsorption of hydroxide ions and electrode conductivity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000737257500018

Thus, materials enabling efficient and sustainable energy conversion and storage need to be developed. Iridium is still the only material used in proton exchange membrane electrolyzers that efficiently catalyze hydrogen evolution counter-reaction, namely, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for electrochemical water splitting in acidic media. With no practical alternatives that can sustain the harsh reaction conditions, new approaches need to be developed to increase the utilization of this scarce metal. Hereby, a carbon-ceramic nanocomposite material is investigated, where Ir nanoparticles and nanoflakes of titanium oxynitride (TiONx) are deposited on the surface of reduced graphene oxide nanoribbons (rGONRs). OER performance is shown to be dependent on the mutual distribution of the Ir-TiONx-rGONR phases and in the best case leads up to 30 times higher activity relative to the commercial IrO2 benchmark. Adjusting the domains of different chemical nature within the same hybrid nanocomposite material through the formation of heterojunctions is shown to boost OER performance. This work demonstrates how fine-tuning of morphology, composition, and particle distribution of the carbon-ceramic catalytic material can introduce a strong synergistic effect on OER activity and stability of iridium.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2196-7350			WOS:000685682300001

A hexagonal lattice containing six adsorption sites per unit cell represents the Pt(1 1 1) surface. The temperature is increased linearly with time, starting with an empty initial surface. Temperature effects on the rate of molecular oxygen adsorption are incorporated through the temperature dependence of the O-2 sticking coefficient and that of the flux of molecules impinging the surface at a given pressure. The results illustrate the mechanisms by which molecular oxygen cannot be adsorbed at temperatures above 155 K. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Metallic phosphides as promising bifunctional catalysts for water splitting tend to aggregate during the preparation and application. Thus, constructing metal phosphide-based composites with well-exposed active sites and stable structure is essential. Here, bi-metallic iron nickel phosphide nanoparticles (NPs) loaded on three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon (denoted as FexNi2-xP (0 < x < 2)) is synthesized through a facile co-deposition method followed by in situ phosphidation. The interconnected porous carbon with large specific area, abundant microporous and oxygen-containing functional groups contribute to the generation of ultra-small Fe-Ni-P NPs by confining growth of Fe-Ni layered double hydroxide (Fe-Ni-LDH) precursor. The ultra-small FexNi2-xP NPs loaded on 3D interconnected porous carbon with large active surface area and high conductivity can offer abundant catalytic active sites, facilitate mass transport and optimize electronic configuration, thereby promoting the reaction kinetics and accelerating catalytic performance. By tailoring the Ni/Fe ratios, the optimal bimetallic phosphide exhibits a small overpotential of 210 inV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction. When applying for water splitting as cathode and anode materials in an alkaline electrolyzer, the potential of 1.63 V is required to reach 10 mA cm(-2). The catalyst obtained from this strategy is a promising bi-functional catalyst for water splitting. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.									37	2	0	0	4	0	37			2214-9937			WOS:000494035800007

We have examined cathode performance towards hydrogen evolution reaction by tailoring material wettability, conductivity yielded by plasma treatment, and the catalyst loading. We discuss that nucleation of particles is facilitated by the appearance of carboxylic and hydroxyl groups triggered by oxygen plasma action. The best performance is associated with samples containing RuO(x)particles of 4-5 nm, which show hydrogen evolution onset potential to be about -5 mV (vs. RHE) in 0.5 M H(2)SO(4)measured at a current density of -1 mA cm(-2)and Tafel slope of 47.5 mV/dec.

To improve the activities and stabilities of electrocatalysts for the critical oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER, respectively), a greater understanding is needed of the catalyst/carbon interactions and carbon stability. Herein, we report how LaNiO3 (LNO) supported on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNT) made from a high-yield synthesis lowers the overpotential for both the OER and ORR markedly to enable a low bifunctional window of 0.81 V at only a 51 mu g cm(-2) mass loading. Furthermore, the addition of LNO to the N-CNTs improves the galvanostatic stability for the OER by almost 2 orders of magnitude. The nanoscale geometries of the perovskites and the CNTs enhance the number of metal-support and charge transfer interactions and thus the activity. We use rotating ring disk electrodes (RRDEs) combined with Tafel slope analysis and ICP-OES to quantitatively separate current contributions from the OER, carbon oxidation, and even anodic iron leaching from carbon nanotubes.									32	0	0	0	2	0	32			2574-0962			WOS:000458705400020

Herein, we successfully synthesized hollow porous La-doped Co3O4 dodecahedral nanoparticles (LaxCoyO4@NC) through using ZIF-67 as precursor. Wherein, La could regulate electronic structure of Co3O4 and thus promotes the OER performance efficiently. La doped Co3O4 displays enhanced OER activity than pure Co3O4, as confirmed by experience results and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Due to La doping, the ratio of Co2+ and Co3+ would increase obviously and generate new electronic states near the Fermi level. The La0.17Co2.83O4@NC exhibites excellent OER performance and high durability, which only requires an overpotential of 363 mV at the current density of 10 mA center dot cm-2 in alkaline medium and markedly outperforms Co3O4@NC (414 mV). These findings might provide a new strategy for controllable synthesis of transition metal nanocatalysts for high-performance OER electrocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000817831400007

In view of this, a novel approach is applied to design a self-supported Cu-Ni-Se nanostuctures on carbon cloth (CC) derived from Cu-Ni-MOF nanorectangles for OER (Cu-Ni-Se@CC). The self-supported Cu-Ni-Se@CC renders an overpotential as low as 270 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 for OER in KOH (1 M) alkaline solution with high stability. The outstanding OER electrocatalytic activity of Cu-Ni-Se@CC can be originated from its unique properties such as high active sites exposure, high surface areas, and effective mass transport channels. This work provides new insights for the rational engineering of advanced composite nanostructures based on noble-metal-free OER electrocatalyst with high efficient and low-cost features.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000748641300002

Redefinition of the Active Species and the Mechanism of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction on Gold Oxide								ACS CATALYSIS				10	21			12582	12589		10.1021/acscatal.0c03548				NOV 6 2020	2020	Accurately identifying the active species of catalytic materials and understanding how they catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are critical for the development of energy storage technologies. In this contribution, we identify two pH-dependent active oxides by mapping the reduction behavior of gold oxide and by in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. It was found that alpha-oxide is preferentially formed in an acidic solution, whereas beta-oxide, Au(OH)(3), is preferably formed in an alkaline solution. In line with the presence of two different surface structures on gold, there are two OER mechanisms: one mechanism wherein water splitting occurs via proton-coupled electron-transfer steps mediated by alpha-oxide and the other mechanism wherein electron transfer and proton transfer are decoupled and mediated by a deprotonated form of Au(OH)(3). This identification of pH-dependent oxides offers a different perspective in our understanding of the OER mechanism on metal oxides in a full pH scale range.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900021

Here we designed a novel inorganic/polymer composited hollow nanospindles consist of polypyrrole (PPy) and Fe-Ni (oxy)hydroxides (FeNi-PPy HNSs) by in-situ polymerization on MIL-88(FeNi) because of the strong oxidation of Fe3+. FeNi-PPy HNSs could be used as electrocatalyst for OER directly, and high temperature sintering is not necessary. To achieve 10 and 100 mA.cm(-2), the FeNi-PPy HNSs only need low overpotential of 227 and 273 mV, respectively. As shown in results of DFT, profiting from the in-situ polymerization, the metal-N coordinate bonds could enhance the performance for OER by reducing the dissociation energy of OH- and promoting the adsorption of OH- in (oxy) hydroxide. This in-situ polymerization method on MOFs to fabricate hollow nanostructures would be a potential pathway to construct highly efficient electrocatalysts.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000541147500019

The prepared electrocatalyst, denoted hereafter as GF-Co-P, showed an onset overpotential at 370 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is superior to that of the standard reference material RuO2; and a Tafel slope of 133 mV dec(-1) in a pH-neutral phosphate buffer solution (PBS). In addition, it exhibited excellent catalytic stability over extended run times. We revealed that surface phosphorylation greatly enhances the exposure of active cobalt sites at catalyst surfaces, and therefore promotes the charge transfer process for OER in neutral solution.

Finding and fine-tuning of the inherent electrocatalytic properties of 3D nonprecious metal hydroxides and oxides by a foreign element doping is an attractive domain in the electrocatalysis of water oxidation. This report reveals such an effect of Mn doping on the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of Co3O4 nanosheet arrays grown on nickel foam (NF) by the ammonia evaporation technique. The Mn doping induces the in situ conversion of Co(OH)(2) into Co3O4 during deposition. The strain generation during doping and the presence of metallic Mn are important factors for enhanced OER performance. Such a unique way of doping as well as in situ conversion of hydroxides into oxides offer an excellent electrocatalyst with superior performance compared to pristine Co3O4 or Co(OH)(2) nanoflakes.									30	3	0	0	1	0	30			2168-0485			WOS:000469304900068

In this work, hierarchical multimetal layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoflakes based on earth abundant metals (Ni, Fe, and Co) have been fabricated through chemical and structural transformations of a starting solid precursor alpha-Co(OH)(2). Herein, the surfactant sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) adsorbed on the alpha-Co(OH)(2) serves as both a protector to avoid the hydrolysis of hydroxide and an exfoliant to reconstruct the original alpha-Co(OH)(2) platelets into much thinner nanoflakes. Furthermore, the derived spinel oxide sheets from the hierarchical CoNiFe-LDH can be endowed with numerous mesopores which improve the exposure of catalytic active sites and enhance mass transports of reactants and products of electrochemical processes.

Specifically, for perovskite oxides, Shao-Horn and co-workers have reported a correlation between the oxygen evolution reaction activity and the e(g) orbital occupation of transition-metal ions, which provides guidelines for the design of highly active catalysts. Here we demonstrate a facile method to engineer the e(g) filling of perovskite cobaltite LaCoO3 for improving the oxygen evolution reaction activity. By reducing the particle size to similar to 80 nm, the e(g) filling of cobalt ions is successfully increased from unity to near the optimal configuration of 1.2 expected by Shao-Horn's principle. Consequently, the activity is significantly enhanced, comparable to those of recently reported cobalt oxides with e(g) similar to 1.2 configurations. This enhancement is ascribed to the emergence of spin-state transition from low-spin to high-spin states for cobalt ions at the surface of the nanoparticles, leading to more active sites with increased reactivity.									227	11	0	0	22	0	227			2041-1723			WOS:000375930600001	27187067

This paper focuses on the understanding and evaluation of light activated covalent adaptable networks formed by radical polymerization reactions, which have potential applications as novel actuators, surface patterning, and light-induced bending and folding. In these polymer networks, free radicals are generated upon light irradiation and lead to evolution of the polymer network structure through bond exchange reactions. It is well known that oxygen is an important inhibitor in radical-based chemistry as oxygen reacts with free radicals and renders them as inactive species towards further propagation and reaction. However, it is unclear how radical depletion by oxygen may affect the light-induced actuation. This paper studies the effects of oxygen on both stress relaxation and bending actuation. Light induced stress relaxation experiments are conducted in an environmental chamber where the concentration of oxygen is controlled by the nitrogen flow. A constitutive model that considers oxygen diffusion, radical termination due to oxygen, and the polymer network evolution is developed and used to study the stress relaxation and bending, and the model predictions agree well with experiments. Parametric studies are conducted to identify the situations where the effects of oxygen are negligible and other conditions where they must be considered.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1744-683X	1744-6848		WOS:000358350700017	26138805

In these regards, catalysts based on 3d transition metals have recently attracted much attention, yet further development is required. Here, we present a new type of heterostructure catalyst in which CoO nanowire arrays are hybridized with tungsten nanoparticles (W-CoO), and are self-supported on conductive carbon cloth (CC). Electronic coupling effects at the W-CoO heterointerface promote electron transfer and OER kinetics to expedite the formation of oxyhydrox-ide species, which are the active sites for OER processes. A variety of in situ and ex situ characterization methods are employed to reveal deep insights into surface transformations and investigate the relation-ship between the conversion to oxyhydroxide moieties and OER performance. This report presents new understanding of the rational design and synthesis of catalysts that exhibit outstanding performance as electrochemical water splitting electrode for OER.

Herein, we have grown Co(OH)(2) nanoarrays in situ on Mn-doped NiFe LDH nanosheets to construct Mn-doped NiFe LDH@Co(OH)(2)/NF (MNF@Co(OH)(2)/NF) with core-shell structure. Due to the optimized electronic structure by manganese ion doping and the high density exposure of active sites induced by cobalt hydroxide coating, the MNF@Co(OH)(2)/NF exhibits excellent OER performances, which possesses ultralow overpotentials of 193 and 244 mV at the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) separately, and possesses a small Tafel slope of 48.4 mV dec(-1). This work offers a new perspective for the rational construction of efficient OER electrocatalysts with multi-dimensional nanostructures to improve the catalytic activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000682639500004

For this purpose, an approach that combines detailed experimental characterization with quantum mechanical calculations based on density functional theory was employed. A series of (100)-oriented Ir1-xMxO2 thin films, with M = Ni, Cr, Mo, W, Sn, Pt, Rh, Ru, V, and Mn, was prepared with a one-step synthesis approach based on pulsed laser deposition, and the electrocatalytic activity of these films for the OER was measured. Matching material compositions and structures were generated in silico for DFT-based calculations of their electronic structure and OER pathway. A comparison of the experimental and theoretical results revealed the viable activity descriptor, paving the way for a systematic search to find the most active Ir-based OER catalyst.									9	1	0	0	2	0	9			2574-0962			WOS:000543715100018

Currently, the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) hinders the efficient running of electrolyzer devices which convert water into molecular H-2. This H-2 can subsequently be used in a H-2/O-2 fuel cell for the renewable generation of electricity with only H2O as a by-product. However, this fuel cell process is not economy feasible due to the sluggish kinetics of the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) at the device cathode, even with expensive state-of-the-art electrocatalytic materials. As of late, the amount of interest in the OER and ORR, from research laboratories from all over the globe, has risen rapidly in order to find cheap and efficient catalysts to replace the expensive platinum based catalysts currently used in the two aforementioned energy conversion/generation technologies. Layered transition metal oxides, based on the cheap transition metal oxides Mn, Co, Ni and Fe have been reported as viable catalysts for the OER and ORR. Layered structures have an added advantage over non-layered materials as the surface area can be increase by means of exfoliation, with potential for tailoring electrocatalytic activity. It has been shown that the fabrication process and post-synthetic treatments, e.g. anion exchange or exfoliation, of these materials can alter the catalytic activity of these materials. Here we summarise various fabrication methods and modifications utilised in literature to tailor the performance of layered transition metal and hydroxide based catalysts for the ORR and OER toward that of the state-of-the-art materials for these technologies.									216	7	0	0	16	0	217			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000457194500004

Herein, a MOF-on-MOF (MOF = metal-organic framework) strategy is developed to obtain trimetal-based nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes arrays loaded on nickel foams (denoted as FeNiCo@NC/NF). Benefiting from the superior compositional and structural feature, FeNiCo@NC/NF self-supported electrodes exhibit excellent bifunctional HER and OER activity with a low overpotential of 145 and 245 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). When simultaneously used as cathode and anode for water splitting, it only requires 1.61 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) and even outperforms the benchmark electrode couple of Pt/C parallel to RuO2 at higher current densities. Studies discover that trimetallic FeNiCo nanoparticles can provide more synergetic metal active sites, interconnected N-doped carbon nanotubes arrays can offer more effective electron transports channels, and conductive Ni foam substrate can reduce the internal impedance of the material. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations also demonstrate that FeNiCo@NC/NF electrode possesses a favorable Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (Delta GH*) value of -0.13 eV, which is benefit for its superior HER activity. Overall, our work reports an efficient self-supported electrode for hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions and water splitting.									26	2	0	0	2	0	26			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000593858000003

The p-n heterojunction can induce the charge redistribution in the heterogeneous interface to reach Fermi level alignment, thus modifying the adsorption free energy of *OOH and improving the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. As a result, NiFe-LDH/Co3O4/NF exhibits outstanding OER performance with a low overpotential of 274 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and long-time stability over 90 h. Moreover, NF can serve as a magnetic core that induces the exchange bias effect between the magnetic substrate and the active species under the action of the magnetic field, resulting in decreased magnetoresistance and weakened scattering of spin electrons, which further lowers the OER overpotential by 25 mV @ 50 mA cm(-2) under a 10 000 G magnetic field. This work provides a new perspective on the design of p-n heterojunction catalysts and a deeper understanding of the magnetic field-enhanced electrocatalytic reactions.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2366-9608			WOS:000785969700001	35460208

Herein, we propose a useful strategy of integrating a bimetallic nanoparticle into the N-doped porous carbon to synthesize highly active bifunctional oxygen catalyst (CoNi/NG). The bimetallic CoNi/NG catalyst exhibits a positive half-wave potential of 0.85 V (versus, RHE) for ORR, and a low operating potential of 1.6 V (versus, RHE) to achieve a 10 mA cm(-2) current density for OER. The excellent bifunctional properties of CoNi/NG are attributed to the various active sites (i.e., Co-N-C, Ni-N-C moieties and N-C sites) and its 2D graphene-like ultrathin structure, as well as synergistic effect of CoNi alloys. Importantly, the liquid Zn-air battery with CoNi/NG as oxygen electrode presents not only excellent charging and discharging curves and maximal power density of 130.5 mW cm(-2), but also robust durability with only 50 mV increase in the voltage gap (the voltage difference between the charging and discharging) after continuous 110 h cycle tests. This work provides a general design principle for development of bifunctional catalysts by integrating different bimetals responsible for different electrochemical reactions into the N-doped graphitic carbons.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the photo- and electric field induced water splitting limits the development of other reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Fe, Ni and NiFe (hydro) oxide-based catalysts are generally acknowledged among the best candidates of OER catalysts for water splitting. Herein, we developed a one-pot simple hydrothermal process to assemble NiFe2O4 nanoparticles onto the alpha-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets. The first formed NiFe2O4 under high temperature and pressure environment induces and assists the alpha-Ni(OH)(2) formation without any further additives, because the distance between the neighboring Ni atoms in the cubic NiFe2O4 is similar to that in the alpha-Ni(OH)(2) {003} facets. We have synthesized a series of NiFe2O4/alpha-Ni(OH)(2) compounds and find that the overpotential decreases with the increase of Ni(OH)(2) content while the OER kinetics stays unchanged, suggesting that Ni(OH)(2) plays a major role in overpotential while NiFe2O4 mainly affects the OER kinetics. The obtained NiFe2O4/alpha-Ni(OH)(2) compounds is also found to be a promising co-catalyst for the photocatalytic water oxidation. In fact, it is even more active than the noble PtOx with acceptable stability for the oxygen generation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we report the successful template-assisted printing-based assembly of platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) into striped-pattern (SP) superlattices to produce H-2. In comparison to drop-casting flat Pt NPs films, SP superlattices lead to higher mass transference and smaller bubble stretch force, representing a general strategy to improve the efficiency and durability of pre-existed Pt catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as well as higher current densities than commercial Pt/C, Pt NP films, and many of the other Pt-based or non-Pt-based HER catalysts reported in the literature. The generic nature of template-assisted printing leads to flexibility in the composition, size, and shape of the constituent NPs or molecules, and thus extends such an accelerated technique for producing the oxygen evolution reaction and electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO.									43	5	0	0	4	0	44			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000510531900032	31868361

The phosphosulfurization is conducted on nickel cobalt carbonate hydroxide in the presence of P2S5. The P-NiCo2S4 nanoneedles on the nickel foam generate a synergistic effect that provides effective mass and electron transfer pathways, endows the electrocatalyst with a moderate electronic structure, and facilitates gas diffusion to enhance the electrocatalytic performance. The catalysts yield a small overpotential of 300 mV to reach a current density of 50 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope as low as 70 mV dec(-1), and long-term stability over 100 h.

In this work, we present the controlled synthesis of ZIF-based carbon hybrid arrays using selfsupporting NiCo2S4 nanotube arrays as self-sacrificing templates. Different from other reported carbon coated NiCo2S4 arrays with solid surfaces, the obtained NiCo2S4@NiCo/N-doped porous carbon array (NiCo2S4@NiCoNC/CC) have well-developed porous hollow structure and ultrafine NiCo nannoparticles deposited on the surface, which can provide facilitated channels and sufficient active sites for water electrolysis. The NiCo2S4@NiCoNC/CC exhibits superior catalytic performance for both hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with high efficiency in alkaline solution, achieving small overpotentials of 81 and 280 mV at the current density of 10mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, the NiCo2S4@NiCoNC/CC electrode shows excellent stability over 16 h of operation due to the robust structure of the electrode.

However, it is controversial whether the metal Xides host the real active sites since these metal Xides are thermodynamically unstable under a harsh OER environment-it has been reported that the initial metal Xides can be electrochemically oxidized and transformed into corresponding oxides and (oxy)hydroxides. Therefore, the metal Xides are argued as "pre-catalysts"; the electrochemically formed oxides and (oxy)hydroxides are believed as the real active moieties for OER. Herein, the recent advances in understanding the transformation behavior of metal Xides during OER are re-looked; importantly, hypotheses are provided to understand why the electrochemically formed oxides and (oxy)hydroxides catalysts derived from metal Xides are superior for OER to the as-prepared metal oxides and (oxy)hydroxides catalysts.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000666869800001

In this work, an integrated electrocatalyst consisting of Co(OH),/CoPt/N-CN was developed to enable both ORR and OER reactions for Zn-air batteries. The hierarchical Co(OH)(2)/CoPt/N-CN electrocatalyst has desirable electrochemical properties, with comparable activity and better durability than commercial Pt/C for ORR and improved activity and long-term stability than commercial IrO2 catalyst for OER. When implemented as air-cathode for rechargeable Zn-air batteries, Co(OH)(2)/CoPt/N-CN exhibited a high power-density of 171 mW cm(-2), a specific capacity of 812 mA h g(-1), and a robust cycling life. Interestingly, the hierarchical structure remained intact upon charge and discharge tests, suggesting potential long-term use in the Zn-air battery technology.

Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculation results forecast that the defect-rich RuO2 and TiO2 nano-heterostructures can effectively adjust the electron structure of RuO2, and accelerate the water electrocatalysis, consequently reinforcing the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Experimentally, to form an integrated nano-heterostructure, a facile approach is designed for in situ fabrication of TiO2 on Ti mesh (TM), simultaneously combined with defective RuO2 (D-RuO2) nanoparticles. Benefiting from the rich active sites, the D-RuO2/TiO2/TM nano-heterostructure formed provides current den -sities of 50 mA/cm2 at 71 mV for HER and 10 mA/cm(2) at 296 mV for OER in alkaline media. For overall water splitting, the electrolyzer assembled with D-RuO2/TiO2/TM electrode can reach 10 mA/cm(2) with a voltage of only 1.59 V. Moreover, under a fixed current density, such an electrolyzer also achieves an outstanding stability.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000784248500004

In this work, NiCo2O4 is modified by the introduction of borate and phosphate ions for high-efficiency water splitting performance. The modified NiCo2O4 shows excellent performance towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the small overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) of 130 mV and 240 mV, respectively, served as the anode and cathode, which requires a cell voltage of 1.65 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The excellent electrocatalytic performance is mainly attributed to surface modification, rational adjustment of the electronic structure of active sites to increase the intrinsic activity of NiCo2O4. Owing to its excellent performance, the modified NiCo2O4 can be a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, the surface-modified method is also a promising technology to modify more electrocatalyst surface for excellent electrochemistry performance.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000621173200002

In this work, a vertically aligned FeOOH/NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) nanosheets supported on Ni foam (VA FeOOH/NiFe LDHs-NF) is prepared as a highly effective OER electrode in alkaline electrolyte. The VA FeOOH/NiFe LDHs-NF represents nanosheet arrays on nickel foam with some interspace among them. The vertically aligned and interlayer-structured architecture is binder-free and contributes to facile strain relaxation, relieving the exfoliation of the catalysts layer caused by the oxygen evolution process. The as-prepared electrode shows current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 208 and 288 mV, and good stability in a half-cell electrolyzer. Besides, the alkaline polymer electrolyte water electrolyzer (APE:WE) with this electrode showed 1.71 V at 200 mA cm(-2), and 2.041 V at 500 mA cm(-2), exhibiting the corresponding energy efficiency of 86.0% and 72. lower heating value of hydrogen), which is better than the typical commercial alkaline water electrolyzer.									139	12	0	0	7	0	142			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000392037400056	27966878

Proper control on the relative proportion of Co2+/Co3+ in cobalt oxide can greatly tune the electronic structure and further optimize its catalytic performance. Herein, a hybrid coupling Co3O4 with black phosphorus (Co3O4@BP) is designed as an efficient catalyst for OER. Electron migration from BP to Co3O4 is achieved in Co3O4@BP, owing to the higher Fermi level of BP than that of Co3O4. Efficient electron transfer can not only create massive active sites with abundant Co2+ but also remarkably suppress the deterioration of BP. Particularly, the Co3O4@BP catalyst outperforms the pristine Co3O4 by over four times and is even 20 times higher than that of bare BP at a potential of 1.65 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Our finding provides insightful understanding for electronic engineering in Co3O4@BP by balancing advantages and utilizing drawbacks of Co3O4 and BP.									64	2	0	0	6	0	64			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000468364500037	31021071

These electrochemical technologies include important electrode reactions, such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the slow kinetics of OER has become a bottleneck restricting the overall efficiency of water splitting. The state-of-the-art OER catalysts are mainly based on Pt, Ir, and Ru in commercial applications today, which are expensive and lack of reserves. Therefore, researchers are working hard to develop highly active and stable non-noble metal compounds as alternatives. In this work, we constructed a novel hybrid nanostructure with ultra-small cobalt nickel sulfide nanoparticles decorated on PVP-modified solvent-free fullerene nanorod (sf-FNR-PVP/CoNi2S4). Benefiting from the efficient charge transfer from CoNi2S4 to FNR matrix, the hybrid material exhibited enhanced OER activity during the electrocatalytic reaction. Impressively, the Tafel slope of sf-FNR-PVP/CoNi2S4 was 82 mV dec(-1), and the charge transfer resistance is 74.2 omega, much better than that of CoNi2S4. Besides, the sf-FNR-PVP/CoNi2S4 exhibited robust electrocatalytic durability. This work provides new opportunity for fullerenes in the field of energy conversion and storage.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1536-383X	1536-4046		WOS:000731234000001

Electrocatalyst activity and durability are commonly assessed using rotating disk electrodes (RDEs) or membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs). RDEs provide a quick and widely accessible testing tool, whereas MEA testing is more complex but closely resembles the actual application. Although both experimental set-ups allow investigation of the same reactions, there are scientific questions that cannot be answered by the RDE technique. In this Perspective, we scrutinize protocols widely used to determine the activity and durability of electrocatalysts, and highlight discrepancies in the results obtained using RDEs and MEAs. We discuss where the use of RDEs is appropriate and, conversely, where it leads to erroneous interpretations. Ultimately, we show that many of the current challenges for hydrogen and oxygen electrocatalysts require MEA testing and advocate for its greater adoption in the early stages of electrocatalyst development.									12	0	0	0	0	0	11			2520-1158			WOS:000800962800001

To develop alternative materials, we focused on zirconium oxide because of its high chemical stability, and investigated its catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on zirconium oxides on a zirconium plate fabricated by both air oxidation (ZrO2/Zr) and arc-plasma deposition (ZrO2/Zr_APD). From cross-sectional observations and electrochemical results, the mixed tetragonal and monoclinic structure of ZrO2 was related to its catalytic activity for the OER. ZrO2/Zr_APD showed obviously a higher activity than ZrO2/Zr. The reason for this is that the particles are better dispersed in ZrO2/Zr_APD than in ZrO2/Zr, so the electrochemical surface area of ZrO2/Zr_APD seems to be larger than that of ZrO2/Zr.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0921-5107	1873-4944		WOS:000639328200024

Comparing the charges of the hydrogen underpotential deposition region, and the corresponding oxide reduction regions, it is concluded that a platinum overlayer on gold forms 3D islands, while gold on platinum forms 2D islands. Foreign metals present in an amount of Lip to one monolayer exert all influence on the change ill reaction rate with respect to both hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen reduction (ORR) reactions. A platinum overlayer on a gold substrate increases the activity for HER and for ORR, compared with pure gold. These results can be understood in terms of a simple model, in which the change in the H and OH binding energies are directly proportional to the shift of the d-bond center of the overlayer. Oil the contrary, a gold layer on platinum slightly decreases the activity for both reactions compared with pure platinum.									28	0	0	0	4	0	28			0352-5139			WOS:000228072300010

The product obtained after calcination at 600 degrees C was amorphous, porous, and retains the original sheet-like structure of the two-dimensional cobalt phosphonate organic frameworks. The amorphous cobalt phosphate exhibited excellent reactivity in the oxygen evolution reaction. At 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotential was only 278 mV, and the Tafel slope was 80 mV dec(-1). The porous structure makes the amorphous cobalt phosphate have a large free space, increases the distribution of the active center, and facilitates the diffusion of hydroxide. The two-dimensional nanosheet structure has a high proportion of exposed metal atoms on the surface, and these coordinated unsaturated metal centers are important for electrocatalysis.

However, how the interaction between different ECs affects the performance is less explored. In the model system of the Si-based photoanode paired with different transition-metal-based EC dual layers, the oxygen evolution reaction with high efficiency and stability is obtained at low cost via synergetic effects of dual ECs. The spontaneous mutual doping between the EC dual layers greatly increases the conductivity of the electrode, thus facilitating the interfacial charge transfer, and the EC interlayer with high hole-accumulation ability can dramatically improve the hole collection capacity of the EC overlayer. In addition, the dynamic cycle of dissolution, diffusion, and deposition of a tiny amount of metal species between the EC dual layers favors the electrode stability. This work provides insightful guidance to interface design of high-performance devices for solar energy conversion.									4	1	0	0	1	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000502688800033

Despite the recent progress in bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts, their unbalanced and insufficient OER and ORR activities has continued to pose challenges for the practical application of such energy devices. The design of highly integrated, high-performance, bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts composed of highly graphitic nanoshells embedded in mesoporous carbon (GNS/MC) is reported. The GNS/MC exhibits very high oxygen electrode activity, which is one of the best performances among nonprecious metal bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts, and substantially outperforms Ir-and Pt-based catalysts. Moreover, the GNS/MC shows excellent durability for both OER and ORR. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and square wave voltammetry reveal the roles of residual Ni and Fe entities in enhancing OER and ORR activities. Raman spectra indicate highly graphitic, defect-rich nature of the GNS/MC, which can contribute to the enhanced OER activity and to high stability for the OER and ORR. In aqueous Na-air battery tests, the GNS/MC air cathode-based cell exhibits superior performance to Ir/C- and Pt/C-based batteries. Significantly, the GNS/MC-based cell demonstrates the first example of rechargeable aqueous Na-air battery.									114	4	0	0	5	0	114			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000374704200001

Herein, perovskite fluoride KMF3 (M = Co/Fe) was synthesized in a nonaqueous system composed of oleic acid, n-hexanol, and KOH, which improved the OER performance. The synthesized sample possesses a controllable morphology, small particles, high efficiency, and synergy of multiple active sites. By successfully incorporating iron into the M site, a strong interaction between cobalt and iron was formed. The interaction of cobalt and a small amount of iron at the M-site makes this catalyst highly active for the OER reaction. Electrochemical tests show that KCo0.80Fe0.20F3 catalyst has a low overpotential of 254 mV and a Tafel slope value of 37.5 mV dec(-1), which make it superior to many catalysts. The results of this paper provide a new concept of perovskite fluoride as an OER catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000861211800003

One of the remaining limitations of the low-temperature electrolyzers is the large amounts of highly scarce and expensive iridium used as the OER electrocatalysts. This could be solved by applying much smaller amounts of iridium on efficient and stable support. Here we present a very promising functionality of titanium oxynitride (TiONx) high-surface-area support that effectively disperses the iridium nanoparticles, exhibits good intrinsic electrical conductivity and stability and thus promises efficient reduction of the noble-metal loading in electrolyzers gas diffusion electrodes. The new nanocomposite made of approximately 3 nm-sized iridium nanoparticles finely dispersed on TiONx support is produced using a novel synthetic route. Extensive characterization shows that the new composites exhibit an electronic interaction with the support and, ultimately, a high OER performance in acidic media.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000488628200001

Herein, Mn2O3 nanotube arrays (Mn2O3 NAs) have been synthesized by controllably annealing the Mn-MOFs precursors. The hollow Mn2O3 NAs exhibit high electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), accompanied by a low overpotential of 270 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution. The corresponding Tafel slope is only 85 mV dec(-1) and the Faradaic efficiency is nearly 100%. Besides the excellent OER performance, Mn2O3 NAs also exhibit enhanced specific capacitance of 677 F g(-1) at 1 mA cm(-2), which is preferable to most Mn2O3 materials. The electrocatalytic results strongly demonstrate that the three-dimensional skeleton structure and microstructure of hollow nanotube arrays in Mn2O3 NAs are the intrinsical factors for the enhanced OER performance and high specific capacitance.									33	0	0	0	3	0	33			2574-0970			WOS:000469409900015

In this work, the nanoporous catalyst with a sandwich structure, constructed of amorphous alloy matrix and porous layers, was fabricated by one-step dealloying of Ni25Y60Al15 metallic glass for 15 min in citric acid solution. This catalyst, consisting of the hybrid of NiY and NiO, exhibited a uniform three-dimension porous structure with a pore size of about 5-20 nm. The electrochemical measurements indicated that the nanoporous hybrid possesses excellent catalytic performances toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. The overpotentials at 50 mA/cm(2) are about 0.45 V and 0.52 V for HER and OER, respectively, with low Tafel slopes of 43.9 mV/dec and 116.8 mV/dec. The enhanced electro-catalysis mainly contributed to its large electrochemically active surface area and low interfacial charge transfer resistance. As such, this high-performance, low-cost, and bifunctional nanoporous catalyst has broad application prospects in electrocatalytic water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000740403500001

O-2 molecule has a great potential to accept electrons from the components of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain (PETC) (so-called the Mehler reaction). Here we overview the Mehler reaction mechanisms, specifying the changes in the structure of the PETC of oxygenic phototrophs that probably had occurred as the result of evolutionary pressure to minimize the electron flow to O-2. These changes are warranted by the fact that the efficient electron flow to O-2 would decrease the quantum yield of photosynthesis. Moreover, the reduction of O-2 leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), namely, the superoxide anion radical and hydrogen peroxide, which cause oxidative stress to plant cells if they are accumulated at a significant amount. From another side, hydrogen peroxide acts as a signaling molecule. We particularly zoom in into the role of photosystem I (PSI) and the plastoquinone (PQ) pool in the Mehler reaction.									11	0	0	0	11	0	11			1664-462X			WOS:000526528000001	32231675

This study emphasizes a MOF-based self-templating approach to synthesize NiSe2-FeSe double-shelled hollow polyhedrons (DHPs) for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solutions. Starting from MIL-88A, this study demonstrates a self-templating approach followed by etching, coprecipitation, and selenization treatments to construct NiSe2-FeSe DHPs. Due to the doubleshelled hollow structure and compositional merits, the resulting NiSe2-FeSe DHPs exhibit excellent OER performance with a small overpotential of 280 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1), and outstanding stability (over 88% current retention for at least 24 h), which significantly outperforms the benchmark RuO2 catalyst. The notable improvement in efficiency along with stability is attributed to abundant electrocatalytic active sites, large surface area, and the synergistic effect of heterostructure interfaces.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2574-0962			WOS:000771424800005

Electron microscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy were used to investigate the morphology and composition of the electrodeposits. Iron content in the deposits increased with increasing Fe concentration in the electrolyte and Fe segregated to the particle surfaces. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that the deposit Co/Fe ratio influences OER activity by altering the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and charge transfer resistance. The OER activity increased with increasing Fe content up to similar to 65 at% Fe, with a minimum overpotential of 0.33 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. The fabricated OER catalysts were assembled into a Zn-air battery for discharge-charge cycling tests and showed lower charge potentials compared with bare carbon paper. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We report advanced and highly efficient electrocatalysis of oxygen evolution reaction using the cobalt sulfide (Co9S8) nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen, sulfur co-doped graphene (Co9S8/NSG) hybrid materials, which are obtained by coating Co-based metal-organic frameworks. The frameworks are grown in situ on graphene oxide using a facile pyrolysis method, with polydiaminothiazole, which serves as both a nitrogen and a sulfur source in the system. The prominent synergistic effect of the S, N-co-doped graphene helps to enhance the conductivity of the hybrid, and the Co9S8 provides abundant catalytic active sites as well as mesoporous structure. As a result, the Co9S8/NSG hybrid materials exhibit outstanding performance in the oxygen evolution reaction and superior stability in alkaline electrolytes. For example, the hybrid materials have a small overpotential of 0.26 V with a Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and they show long-term stability in 1 M KOH. This work provides a general and promising method for the design and synthesis of inexpensive and efficient OER electrocatalysts.									42	1	0	0	2	0	42			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000461408300011

Experimentally, a close coupling between OER and catalyst dissolution on metal oxides is reported. In this work, it is analysed how the microkinetic network structure of a generic electrocatalytic cycle, in which a common intermediate causes catalyst dissolution, governs the interplay between electrocatalytic activity and stability. Model discrimination is possible based on the analysis of incorporated microkinetic network structures and the comparison to experimental data. The derived concept is used to analyse the coupling of OER and catalyst dissolution on rutile and reactively sputtered Iridium oxides. For rutile Iridium oxide, the characteristic activity and stability behaviour can be well described by a mono-nuclear, adsorbate evolution mechanism and the chemical type of both competing dissolution and rate-determining OER-step. For the reactively sputtered Iridium oxide surface, experimentally observed characteristics can be captured by the assumption of an additional path via a low oxidation state intermediate, which explains the observed characteristic increase in OER over dissolution selectivity with potential by the competition between electrochemical re-oxidation and chemical dissolution.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2045-2322			WOS:000568844500001	32839461

Lowering the high overpotential of the OER of transition metal oxides (TMOs), which are used as conventional OER electrocatalysts, has been the focus of many studies. The OER activity of TMOs can be tuned via the strategic formation of a heterostructure with another TMO substrate. We screened 11 rutile-type TMOs (i.e., MO2; M = V, Cr, Mn, Nb, Ru, Rh, Sn, Ta, Os, Ir, and Pt) on a rutile (110) substrate using density functional theory calculations to determine their OER activities. The conventional volcano approach based on simple binding energies of reaction intermediates was implemented; in addition, the electrochemical-step symmetry index was employed to screen heterostructures for use as electrode materials. The results show that RuO2 and IrO2 are the most promising catalysts among all candidates. The scaling results provide insights into the intrinsic properties of the heterostructure as well as materials that can be used to lower the overpotential of the OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2296-598X			WOS:000621465200001

Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate the rational control growth of amorphous NiCoFeOx NPs on either lateral or basal of amorphous NiCoFeOx NSs by hydrothermal method. Owing to the lateral growth of amorphous NiCoFeOx NPs on the amorphous NiCoFeOx NSs, this unique architecture exhibits more electrocatalytic active sites and better stability due to higher In-plane conductivity than interlayer conductivity. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that due to the presence of low coordinated oxygen, it decreased the energy barrier of intermediates and enhanced the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. While, NiCoFe oxide NHS with lateral growth of NiCoFeOx NPs lead to superior electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a low overpotential of 232 mV to reach a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) , due to the amorphous nature of NHS, synergistic effect, conductive support (like Nickel Foam) with metal oxide substrate. Furthermore, employing Lateral growth NHS as an anode and cathode for water splitting electrolyzer able to reach 10 mAcm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.49 V with robust durability. This work will provide a new dimension for the construction of other site selective 2D NHS with unique properties especially for OER. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Recently, CoNi bimetallic MOFs have attracted attention for hydrogen production in alkaline water electrolysis devices. Unfortunately, the most common studies have focused on the control of the morphology and structure of the MOF itself, while ignoring the effects of the synergy between the MOF and the carrier or other conductive agents. In this work, a multi-walled carbon nanotube-coupled CoNi MOF composite (CoNi MOFs-mCNTs) was synthesized via a solvothermal method using multi-walled carbon nanotubes (mCNTs) as a shape-directing agent and its application was explored for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution. The electrochemical test results demonstrate that, compared with commercial RuO2 (CM-RuO2) and a CoNi MOF without mCNTs, the CoNi MOFs-mCNTs with optimal mCNTs content show improved OER activity and durability. Physical characterization indicates that the structure and electronic properties of the CoNi MOFs-mCNTs are primarily influenced by the mCNTs, which conveys that CoNi MOFs-mCNTs with a high specific surface area exhibit improved OER activity in alkaline solution.									4	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000753568500001

The synthesis of high-surface-area catalysts with high intrinsic activity remains challenging. In this work, in-situ surface selective removal method by electrochemical oxidation is used to synthesize nickel (oxy)hydroxide covered Ni3Sn2 supported on carbon nanotubes (Ni3Sn2@NiOxHy/CNT), which exhibits 10, 100, 200 and 300 mA cm(-2) at over-potential of 250, 317, 329 and 335 mV in OER, respectively. In-situ surface selective removal of Sn from the crystal lattices and oxidation of Ni under anodic oxidation provide highly active amorphous NiOxHy with abundant surface defects, leading to the high apparent activity (current density) and intrinsic activity (TOF) of the Ni3Sn2@NiOxHy/CNT. This work develops a general method to synthesize high-surface-area water oxidation catalysts, which can be used to prepare a series of catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction in the near future.

However, how to properly facilitate surface reconstruction to overcome large overpotential that stimulate the surface reconstruction has remained elusive. Herein, we adopt a facile approach to activate surface reconstruction on Ni(OH)(2) by incorporating F anions to achieve electro-derived structural oxidation process and further boost its oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Ex situ Raman and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy studies indicate that F ions incorporation facilitated surface reconstruction and promotes the original Ni(OH)(2) transformed into a mesoporous and amorphous F-NiOOH layer during the electrochemical process. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that this self-reconstructed NiOOH induces a space-charge effect on the p-n junction interface, which not only promotes the absorption of intermediates species (*OH, *O, and *OOH) and charge-transfer process during catalysis, but also leads to a strong interaction of the p-n junction interface to stabilize the materials. This work opens up a new possibility to regulate the electronic structure of active sites and promote their catalytic activities.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000729361200004

In this paper, a bionic sunflower-like NiFe-polydopamine film was prepared via self-polymerization of dopamine-Ni2+/Fe3+ followed by partial pyrolysis process. In the films, NiO quantum dots are embedded in Fe-coupled polydopamine due to the space-confined effect of PDA. The selfactivation process effect led to in-situ reconstruction of the generation of NiOOH and the migration of Fe sites to NiOOH surface. Abundant Fe sites on the NiOOH surface facilitated formation of stable O* intermediate.

The catalytic activity of the electrode materials is expected to be governed by the d electrons of the transition metals; the electrical conductivity is provided by TiP even under highly acidic conditions. The OER activity followed a "volcano plot" as the TM was changed from Cr to Ni and assumed the maximum value for the composition cobalt titanium phosphide (CoTiP). The CoTiP electrode also exhibited excellent corrosion resistance and metallic conductivity (on the order of 10(-6) Omega m) over the pH range 0-14. The OER activity of CoTiP was comparable to that of Pt but inferior to that of state-of-the-art IrO2 and RuO2.									9	0	0	0	0	0	10			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000371526600001

Water electrolysis combined with renewable energy is regarded as the best way for hydrogen production, which will become the foundation of future hydrogen economy. For the past few years, many efforts have been employed to develop the cheap and high-performance catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. However, the coupled hydrogen and oxygen evolution and the use of the expensive membrane have greatly restricted the flexibility of the conventional water electrolysis, and hindered the utilization of renewable energy. Recently, our group has introduced the battery- electrode as a solid-state redox mediator to separate the hydrogen and oxygen productions during water electrolysis in space and time, providing a flexible and membrane-free architecture for water splitting. This decoupled architecture also facilitates the conversion of renewable energy to hydrogen. This review highlights the research progresses, and analyzes the advantages and challenges to this new architecture.			可再生能源与电解水制氢技术的结合是实现可持续制氢的最佳途径.然而,传统电解水技术中解决氢-氧同时、同步、同地产生的问题必须依赖于膜分离技术,大幅限制了氢-氧分离和氢气异地运输的灵活性,并阻碍了可再生能源(如风能、太阳能)与电解水技术的直接结合.针对上述问题,作者课题组在近期提出了基于电池电极反应的分步法电解水制氢技术,即通过电池电极的可逆电化学反应将现有电解水过程拆分为制氢和制氧分立步骤,实现在无膜条件下氢气和氧气的分时、分地交替制备,提升了电解水制氢的灵活性,促进了可再生能源向氢能的直接转化.本文将介绍这一新技术的研究进展,并分析这一技术的优点和面临的挑战.						0	2	0	0	0	0	2			1006-3471			CSCD:6368176

However, due to the large overpotential required for the OER reaction during the water-splitting reaction, the modification of electrocatalysts is a vital strategy to address the slow kinetics of the OER reaction. In this paper, a simple and rapid two-step hydrothermal sulfidation method was used to prepare S-modified Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets electrocatalysts at 120 degrees C. At the same time, the well-designed nanostructured catalyst on the nickel foam substrate exposes a large number of active sites, and the simultaneously generated oxygen vacancies are beneficial to the penetration of the electrolyte and release of O-2, thus significantly improving the OER performance. In 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, Ni9S8/Ni(OH)(2)/NF exhibits excellent catalytic activity for OER. The catalyst requires only 430 mV overpotential at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). In addition, Ni9S8/Ni(OH)(2)/NF also has excellent long-term stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0974-3626	0973-7103		WOS:000824591500001

However, this process is quite thermodynamically uphill, and thus needs to be mediated simultaneously by efficient hydrogen evolving and oxygen evolving catalysts to get any feasible output from it. Herein, we report the synthesis of such a catalyst comprising ultrasmall NixCo3-xS4-decorated Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays supported on nickel foam (NF) via a partial cation exchange reaction between NF-supported Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays and cobalt(II) ions. We show that the as-prepared material, denoted as NixCo3-xS4/Ni3S2/NF, can serve as a self-standing, noble metal-free, highly active and stable, bifunctional electrocatalyst for the two half reactions involved in the overall water splitting: the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Furthermore, we demonstrate that a high-performance electrolyzer for the overall water splitting reaction can be assembled by using NixCo3-xS4/Ni3S2/NF as the electrocatalyst at both the cathode and the anode sides of the electrolyzer. This electrolyzer delivers water-splitting current densities of 10 and 100 mA/cm(2) at applied potentials of 1.53 and 1.80 V, respectively, with remarkable stability for >200 h in both cases. The electrolyzer's performance is much better than the performances of electrolyzers assembled from many types of other bifunctional electrocatalysts as catalyst couple. Moreover, the overall performance of the electrolyzer is comparable with the performances of electrolyzers containing two different, benchmark, monofunctional HER and OER electrocatalyst couple (i.e., Pt/C-IrO2).									285	16	0	0	13	0	288			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000400647900019

Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite oxides offer an attractive platform for studying this role due to dimensional flexibility. The effects of dimensionality on physical properties in those oxides have been widely reported. However, the study of dimensional dependence on the chemical properties is still lacking. Here, we synthesized a series of Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite nickelates LanSrNinO3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, and infinity) to explore the role of dimensionality on E- iR (V vs RHE) oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) performance. As the dimensionality increased with n, the nickelates exhibited an enhanced OER activity. We found that the weakening of electron correlations among Ni 3d electrons by increasing the dimensionality induced an insulator-to-metal transition and a strengthened Ni-O hybridization, both of which accelerated the OER kinetics. This work sets up a bridge between the dimensionality and electrocatalysis, which provides guidance for designing highly efficient oxygen-evolving catalysts.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000526413400081	32207976

In this study, a series of anion-regulated sub-2 nm ultrathin thiophosphate nanosheets (NiPS3-xSex NSs) is rationally designed and synthesized as bifunctional oxygen evolution/reduction reaction (OER/ORR) electrocatalysts for Zn-air batteries. The increase of nominal Se dopants (0 <= x <= 0.5) leads to the expansion of (001) crystal plane spacing and partially disordered structure generation after the incorporation of Se to pristine NiPS3. More importantly, electronic structures of active sites can be reasonably regulated via coordination of the interaction between anions and cations. Density functional theory calculations reveal that such tailored electronic structures reduce the overpotential of the thermodynamic barriers step for both OER and ORR as well as shorten energy bandgap, which can accelerate reaction kinetics in electrocatalytic processes and enhance electrical conductivity. Consequently, the obtained NiPS3-xSex NSs exhibit low OER overpotential (250 mV) and positive ORR onset potential (0.94 V), large power density (152 mW cm(-2)), and robust stability (96 h cycle) for Zn-air devices, far exceeding that of precious metal catalysts. This study provides a novel tactic to design earth-abundant and highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for metal-air battery technologies.									78	2	0	0	6	0	77			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000625041500001

Herein, a phase-transited lysozyme (PTL) is employed as the platform to synthesize nitrogen-doped Co3O4@C nanomesh with rich oxygen vacancies supported on the nickel foam (N-Co3O4@C@NF). This PTL-driven N-Co3O4@C@NF integrates the advantages of porous structure, high exposure of surface atoms, strong synergetic effect between the components and unique 3D electrode configuration, imparting exceptional activity in catalyzing both HER and OER. Remarkably, an alkaline electrolyzer assembled by N-Co3O4@C@NF as both cathode and anode delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an ultralow cell voltage of 1.40 V, which is not only much lower than that of the commercially noble Pt/C and IrO2/C catalyst couple (approximate to 1.61 V) but also a new record for the overall water splitting. The finding may open new possibilities for the design of bifunctional electrocatalysts for application in practical water electrolysis.									69	4	0	0	5	0	69				2198-3844		WOS:000470189500018	31179228

Though SMAS with designed coordinate structures achieved maximal atom utilization, superior catalytic activity, and excellent selectivity, challenges remain in anchoring SMAS with high density to achieve more efficient catalytic activity and avoid the aggregation of metal centers for long-term practical applications. To target these challenges, we herein review the recent progress in developing effective strategies via coordination anchoring to synthesize high-density SMAS and their applications in electrocatalysis. The molecular, matrix, and surface coordination anchoring strategies for building abundant coordination anchoring sites are firstly summarized and discussed in detail for constructing high-density SMAS and regulating coordinate structures of SMAS. Then we further summarized the electrocatalytic performance of these coordination anchored high-density SMAS involving hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, and CO2 reduction reaction for understanding the structure-activity relationship of SMAS in depth. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for the future development of high-density SMAS are featured and outlooked. This review seeks to provide insights and guidelines into developing single-atom electrocatalysis. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, high -performance NiFe-based layered double hydroxides (LDH), phosphide and sulfide OER pre-catalysts were fabricated and their distinct activity was unveiled. The as-prepared NixFe1-xS exhibits ultralow OER overpotential of 122 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. The alkali-electrolyzer using NixFe1-xS electrodes achieve superior performance exhibiting a voltage of 1.46 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Experimental analysis reveals that, during OER, Fe dissolution into electrolyte occurs for NiFe LDH and NixFe1-xP, which were both converted into NiOOH, well explaining their similar activity. Interestingly, Fe dissolution is significantly mitigated in NixFe1-xS, forming partially oxidized Fe2O3/FeOOH species. Theoretical calculations confirmed that Fe2O3/FeOOH is responsible for the enhanced OER energetics of NixFe1-xS. These observations provide new insights on the distinct activity of NiFe-based electrocatalysts, guiding their rational design as well.									13	0	0	0	0	0	12			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000788058900005

Ni foam and stainless -steel mesh (SS mesh) were investigated systematically for OER in alkaline seawater electrolysis in this work. The overpotentials and Tafel slopes with SS meshes are smaller than Ni foams, and it also exhibits excellent stability. Interestingly, the performance of the SS mesh even outperforms various non-noble metal electrocatalysts and is comparable to commercial RuO2 and IrO2. The corrosion conditions of Ni foam and SS mesh electrodes were studied and revealed. Furthermore, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of Ni foam is 12 times higher than SS mesh in the same geometric area, indicating the electrochemical activity of SS mesh is much superior to Ni foam. This work expands on promising substrates for alkaline seawater electrolysis, with cost and performance advantages.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000861209000001

However, the semiconductor properties limited its electrocatalytic activity. Herein, a two-dimensional (2D) few-layered graphdiyne/graphene (GDY/G) heterostructure was employed to anchor NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This heterostructure not only exhibits excellent conductivity for charge transfer due to the graphene layer, but also significantly regulates the electronic structure of NiFe-LDH for enhanced intrinsic activity on account of the strong covalent bond between the Ni/Fe active site and GDY. Remarkably, the NiFe-LDH/GDY/G catalyst achieved a competitive low overpotential of 215 mV @ 10 mA cm-2 as well as a small Tafel slope of 22 mV decxfffd; 1. The improved OER kinetics could be attributed to the unique few-layered GDY/G heterostructure with a larger electrochemical active surface area, faster charge transfer kinetics, and higher intrinsic activity.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000745078000003

Transition metal (hydr)oxides have been intensively investigated as OER catalysts. Promoting transition metal (hydr)oxides with heteroatoms or using carbon materials as additives can increase the electric conductivity and tailor the nature of active sites to enhance OER activity. We developed a scalable one-step wet chemical method to prepare sulfur-containing transition metal (manganese, iron, cobalt, and nickel) (hydr)oxides coupled with carbon nanotubes as additives to tailor OER performance. Facilitated OER kinetics, enhanced intrinsic activity, and high electrochemically active surface area derived from sulfur promotion with/without carbon nanotubes addition together with the nanostructure of the materials led to decent OER performance. Sulfur-containing cobalt (hydr)oxide achieved a low overpotential of 0.38 V at 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 66 mV dec(-1), and good stability.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000503332000001

Traditional preparation of alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets often leads to a packing morphology after synthesis or post electrode fabrication, which severely limits the exposure of surface active sites. In this work, we report the synthesis of a self-supported 3D flower-like structure consisting of 2D alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets through a metal-organic-framework (MOF)-mediated synthetic method. We found that the formation of MOF intermediates can produce dispersive alpha-Co(OH) 2 nanosheets with a stable 3D hierarchical structure which can effectively avoid the packing of individual nanosheets. The developed alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets exhibit an obviously enhanced OER activity in comparison with the nanosheets prepared with traditional method. The prepared alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets have been well characterized and their formation mechanism is proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, cost-effective OER catalyst composing of nickel-iron Prussian blue analogue and iron oxyhydroxide (NiFePBA-FeOOH) was successfully prepared by facile hydrothermal method. Designed NiFePBA-FeOOH catalyst exhibits superior OER performance with low overpotential, small Tafel slope and stable durability. Systematic investigations with in-situ Raman and Transmission electron microscope reveal that the as-prepared catalyst has undergone in-situ electrochemical transformation to generate real catalytic active species of nickel and iron oxyhydroxides. Particularly, the assembled zinc-air battery with NiFePBA-FeOOH catalyst also displays a long-term lifetime of 165 h only presenting a slight increase in voltage gap. Additionally, the successful exploration of cobalt-iron PBAs with iron oxyhydroxides further demonstrates the universality of PBAs-oxyhydroxides composites for energy storage and conversion applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2365-6549			WOS:000656871700009

In general, the performance of PEM water electrolysis is dominantly affected by the specific surface area and the porous structure of the IrO2 catalyst. Thus, in this study, IrO2 and antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO) nanostructures with high specific surface areas were synthesized through the Adams fusion method. The as-prepared samples showed well-defined porous high-crystalline nanostructures. The ATO nanoparticles as a support were surrounded by IrO2 nanoparticles as a catalyst without serious agglomeration, indicating that the IrO2 catalyst was uniformly distributed on the ATO support. Compared to pure IrO2, the IrO2/ATO mixture electrodes showed superior OER properties because of their increased electrochemical active sites. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

We report evidence for different types of Fe species within Ni(Fe)OxHy- those that are rapidly incorporated into the Ni oxyhydroxide from Fe cations in solution (and that are likely at edges or defects) and are responsible for the enhanced OER activity, and those substituting for bulk Ni that modulate the observed Ni voltammetry. These results suggest that the exceptional OER activity of Ni(Fe)OxHy does not depend on Fe in the bulk or on average electrochemical properties of the Ni cations measured by voltammetry, and instead emphasize the role of the local structure.									378	16	0	0	21	0	382			0002-7863			WOS:000408519600014	28789520

Anisotropy of the nickel cobaltite nanorods was retained after calcination of nickel cobalt oxalate precursors. A high aspect ratio (similar to 12) of the NiCo2O4 nanorods was obtained by using a cationic surfactant (CTAB) while a non-ionic surfactant (Tergitol) led to the formation of a much lower aspect ratio (similar to 5) of the nanorods. These nanorods could potentially be used as anodic electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. Due to having a high surface roughness, nanorods assembled with the smallest particles, similar to 5-10 nm in diameter (surface area similar to 158 m(2) g(-1)), show a high current density of similar to 140 mA cm(-2) with a low onset potential of similar to 0.31 V (at 0.9 V) towards the oxygen evolution reaction and the values of current density is significantly higher than earlier reports.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18				2046-2069		WOS:000326745100063

Here we report a series of novel amorphous high-entropy borophosphate catalysts FeCoNiMBPOx (M = Mg, Al, Cr, Mn) prepared by a low-temperature reduction method. The leaching of boron and phosphorus accelerates the surface self-reconstruction of FeCoNiMnBPOx, and the subsequently formed high-oxidation-state metal-OOH species is beneficial to improve the catalyst performance. Moreover, the unique amorphous structure with abundant defects provides more active sites for OER. As a return, all the samples exhibit excellent OER activity and stability. Among them, FeCoNiMnBPOx with the highest conductivity and the largest electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) exhibits the best electrocatalytic performance, requiring only low overpotentials of 248 mV and 294 mV to reach current densities of 10 mA cm-2 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively. This sample also shows an exceptional durability for 50 h without a significant increase in potential, which is superior to that of the benchmark RuO2 electrocatalyst. The combination of the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and the lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM) are responsible for the excellent catalyst per-formance.

In this direction, herein we elucidated the usage of N doped sp(2) hybridized carbon framework (N-CF) as a metal-free electrocatalyst for ORR and HER. This work inspects the effect of N doping that converts a hybrid structure of CF {Norbornane or bicyclo [2,2,1] heptane structure} into planar N-CF. A series of N-doped CF with different doping concentrations has been prepared using a facile and cost-effective technique. This robust electrocatalysts exhibits a promotional effect in the activity, porosity, thermal and electrochemical stability for the ORR and HER reactions. A rich delocalized electronic density of the sp(2) bounded N species helps in modulating antibonding state of molecular oxygen and facilitates the breakage of O=O bond in ORR. It also promotes proton adsorption via bonding between proton and valence electron rich catalyst surface to aid HER. The research sought to investigate the employability of N-CF for fabricating sustainable energy devices with electrocatalyst possessing multiple electrocatalytic activities for ORR and HER.

Herein, we synthesized a Co-based zeolite imidazolate framework-derived bimetallic boride electrocatalyst by a facile method without any energy loss, named ZIF@Ni-B-Co, which exhibits excellent OER activity and stability. At the current density of 10 mA cm-2, it has a low overpotential of 300 mV and a Tafel slope of 77 mV dec-1, which is better than noble metal RuO2. The superior OER performance is attributed to the formation of a metal-boron bond, the morphology of specific dodecahedron, the large surface area and the fast charge transfer rate for the ZIF@Ni-B-Co catalyst.

The key solution to unleash this constrain is to find an electrocatalyst that reduces the overpotential (eta) of OER. Among the various electrocatalysts, perovskites have attracted intense attention recently for their high OER performance and low cost. To realize the commercial potential of perovskites, understanding its surface chemistry, including leaching, reconstruction, and lattice oxygen participated OER, is crucial to develop the nextgeneration perovskite catalysts,. In this Review, the perovskite surface stability is emphasized to be closely related to the chemical component of perovskite surface, which can be well controlled by surface engineering and further improves its OER performance. A new descriptor (stability level) is proposed to highlight the relationship between OER performance and surface stability of perovskite. This descriptor will provide potential strategies to optimize OER catalytic performance by tuning surface structure of perovskite.									20	2	0	0	1	0	19				2639-4979		WOS:000661316200005

Compared with sulfides and selenides, the studies related to the interface engineering of the transition metal tellurides for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remain scarce, regardless of their higher electrical conductivity and mass transport rate. Herein, a class of NiFe LDH/NiTe composites was successfully synthesized for enhancing the OER performance by partial chemical etching of nickel foam to prepare NiTe nanoarrays, and subsequently depositing NiFe LDH with a hydrothermal process. Based on experimental and calculated results, the NiFe LDH/NiTe composite is observed with a more intensive interface rather than a simple physical mixture, leading to enhanced charge transfer and improved reaction kinetics resulting from reduced binding strength of intermediates. Therefore, the resultant NiFe LDH/NiTe exhibits outstanding OER activity in alkaline solution with an overpotential of 228 mV at the current density of 50 mA/cm(2).									93	4	0	0	2	0	94			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000536933200008

Herein, two trifunctional electrocatalysts composed of Ni-NiM2O4 (M = Mn or Fe) supported on N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) were in situ synthesized by pyrolysis of NiMn- and NiFe-based precursors, respectively, under a NH3/Ar atmosphere. The hybrids exhibit robust trifunctional catalytic performance for HER, OER and ORR in an alkaline electrolyte. Especially, NCNT/Ni-NiMn2O4 exhibits excellent performance for zinc-air batteries with a high specific capacity of 502 mA h g(-1) and a maximum power density of 105 mW cm(-2), comparable to that of the Pt/C-based zinc-air battery. This study provides a feasible strategy for preparing highly efficient trifunctional electrocatalysts by in situ coupling metal/metal spinel oxide composites with high conductivity nanocarbon.									52	1	0	0	1	0	52			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000463950800003

Herein, the OER performance of CoP nanowires was significantly enhanced by coupling with the cobaltiron layered double hydroxide (CoFe-LDH) nanosheets. The three-dimensional (3D) CoP@CoFe-LDH nanoarays heterostructure was fabricated by the sequential steps of hydrothermal process, phosphorization and electrodeposition. The as-prepared CoP@CoFe-LDH possesses well core?shell structure with a synergistic heterointerface between CoP and CoFe-LDH, in which the CoP core improves the conductivity and the CoFe-LDH shell affords abundant active sites. Furthermore, the 3D hierarchical architecture facilitates the electrolyte ions access and O2 gas liberation. Consequently, the optimized CoP@CoFe-LDH exhibits excellent OER performance with low overpotential (240 mV @ 40 mA cm-2), small Tafel slope (69.2 mV dec-1), superior intrinsic activity and high stability in 1 M KOH. This study demonstrates an efficient route to design the advanced OER catalysts by constructing the 3D core?shell heterostructure.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2452-2627			WOS:000635501100002

In this work, two Ir0.5Ni0.5Ox mixed oxide catalysts with layered and solid solution morphologies were prepared by modifying a facile hydrothermal methodology. The catalytic OER activity and stability of the Ir-Ni catalyst with a homogeneous distribution (IrNi-HD) was seriously compromised compared to pure IrOx due to the high concentration of surface nickel prone to corrosion under reaction conditions. However, the design of layered IrOx-Ni(OH)(x) (IrNi-LY) with Ir at the exposed surface allowed a 50% reduction in the molar concentration of the precious metal on the electrode compared to IrOx without impairing the catalytic activity or stability. As a result, IrNi-LY outperformed IrOx in activity when normalized to the Ir mass.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500024

Perovskite oxides have attracted great attention as potential OER electro-catalysts. Their performance, however, are strongly limited by large particle size, owing to the high synthesis temperature. Herein, we report a facile top-down strategy for fabricating perovskite oxide nanostructures with large surface area and strongly improved intrinsic OER activity. SrNb0.1Co0.7Fe0.2O3-delta (SNCF) particles with micro size are treated by (NH4)(2)-Fe(SO4)(2) saturated solution for different time length at room temperature. The obtained catalysts exhibit significantly increased surface area with nanosheet structure in the outer layer. Furthermore, cobalt on the surface are reduced from Co3+ to Co2+, suggesting oxygen vacancy formation on the surface. The defective SNCF nanostructure exhibits significantly improved OER activity and good stability. The facile methodology reported in this work can be generally applied to other oxide electrocatalysts for energy applications. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The IrO2 nanoparticles were prepared with inherent crystal lattice strain, which is derived from the Ir-O-Mn mismatch at the interface. The oxidation state of iridium is higher than Ir-IV, revealing the electron transfer to the substrate. On account of the crystal lattice distortion and electronic manipulations being favorable to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the as-synthesized composite exhibited excellent OER activity and stability. The improved catalytic nature was followed by enhancement in the electrochemical active surface area, mass specific activity, and intrinsic activity. Moreover, the Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1) reveals better reaction kinetics for IrO2/Mn-Co (2 : 1)-birnessite than many previously reported catalysts despite the low precious noble metal content in the as-synthesized composite. Conclusively, we have proven that the strain engineering holds vital importance in forming catalyst-support interaction and rational design of catalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2196-0216			WOS:000485947800031

Herein, a cheap Fe element doped flower-like nickel sulfides catalyst (Fe-NiS/NiS2) is designed and synthesized through facile electrostatic adsorption and sulfuration methods. It is investigated that the Fe doping effectively induces the lattice contraction of nickel sulfides and regulates the phase composition and heterogeneous interfaces, thus enabling high intrinsic OER activity. The Fe-NiS/NiS2 catalyst shows a high electrochemically active surface area of 150 cm(2), a small overpotential of 361 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 61.5 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, the Fe-NiS/NiS2 exhibits a very excellent structure and performance stability without current attenuation for 24 h at 1.50 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode.

Here, we designed ferrocene-based bimetallic CoFe-FcDA MOF nanosheets to realize high-efficient OER electrocatalysts. The resultant CoFe-FcDA nanosheets exhibited remarkable OER performance in an alkaline medium, OER required just a 251 mV over -potential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2, which were superior to that of the counterpart CoFe-BDC catalyst. Electrochemical results showed that the ferrocene unit acted as an effective electron transfer inter-mediate, which was in charge of the brilliant OER performances. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the overall electron transfer capability could be enhanced due to the ferrocene unit, resulting in a theoretical overpotential of 0.60 eV for CoFe-FcDA, which was lower than 0.68 eV for CoFe-BDC.

The further development of electrocatalytic water splitting can promote the development and application of next-generation sustainable energy systems. However, the lack of an in-depth understanding of the dynamic restructuring process occurring on the catalyst surface in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has limited the further development and improvement of OER-related theories. Therefore, real-time monitoring and analysis of the dynamic surface reconstruction process has a great significance for deeply understanding the intrinsic catalytic mechanism of OER. Herein, the latest progress on the in situ methods for characterizing the surface reconstruction of various transition metal-based OER electrocatalysts in recent years is summarized.

To enhance the efficiency of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at high current density, the architecture construction must be designed skillfully to prevent the surface blanketed by gas bubbles. In this work, we developed a three-level hierarchical surface with cluster-like nickel (Ni) nanowire array. The contact angle measurement indicates the surface having excellent hydrophilicity. The OER performance characterization reveals that after the surface is loaded with NiFe-based catalyst the Ni nanowire array electrode can deliver 500 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 297 mV in 1 M KOH solution and can survive for over 24 h under 500 mA cm(-2) operation. All the results demonstrate that the cluster-like nanowire array is beneficial for the spatial pathway separation for electrolyte supply and gas bubbles departure and the enhancement of OER efficiency.

Here, an atomically dispersed iridium embedded nitrogen-doped graphene electrocatalyst (Ir@NG-750) is synthesized through a simple annealing method. The atomic Ir@NG-750 catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction in both acidic and alkaline media with half-wave potentials of 0.77 V and 0.865 V, respectively, together with good durability, a four-electron pathway, and excellent resistance to carbon monoxide poisoning. It also shows outstanding electrochemical performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction, providing low overpotentials of 114 mV and 25 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)in 0.1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. Moreover, it displays superior catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction with low overpotentials of 273 mV, 340 mV, and 371 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), in 1.0 M KOH, 0.1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. Due to its excellent trifunctional properties, it can deliver an overall water splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at a cell voltage of 1.7 V. In addition, the Ir@NG-750-based Zn-air battery exhibits a peak power density of 56.8 mW cm(-2)at a voltage of 0.62 V.

However, the poor durability of electrocatalysts in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) environment hinders the large-scale application of PEMWE. Herein, a robust RuMn electrochemical catalyst with a remarkable durability within 20 000 cyclic voltammetry cycles is reported. Furthermore, RuMn is stable for 720 h at 10 mA cm(-2) current density in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution with <100 mV overpotential increase, outperforming the most electrocatalysts reported to date, by far. An amorphous RuOx shell is detected after the OER test, indicating a surface reconstruction process on the catalyst that inhibits steady-state dissolution. Further study demonstrates that the excellent durability of RuMn realized by protective RuOx can be attributed to strong bond strength of Ru, which is supported by density functional theory calculations with high dissolution voltage. Thus, improving the bond strength of Ru extends the design strategy for the Ru-based alloy catalysts with considerable stability.									3	0	0	0	0	0	2			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000794213700001

Here, we show that the layered perovskite Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) series A(n+1)B(n)O(3n+1) is an ideal material system with high tunability of the electronic structure and orbital occupancy, providing a clean system to reveal the important factors in optimizing the OER activity in transition-metal oxides. We show that the catalysis performance is significantly enhanced in the layered nickelate (Lan+1NinO3n+1) compounds with n >= 3 and peaked at the n = 5 member, which is about 4 times higher than that in the corresponding perovskite compound (LaNiO3). Our work suggests that the variation of the n value can effectively modulate the NiO2 electronic properties, and the proper combination of Op-Nid hybridization and eg occupancy can result in substantially enhanced catalytic performance in transition-metal oxides.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000734176600004

Oxygen deficient CMOs are synthesized via a two-step process: in situ reduction to achieve a large surface area of 151.3 m(2) g(-1) and thermal treatment at 400 degrees C in pure Ar. The oxygen deficient CMO electrode presents a higher initial capacity, lower overpotential, better cyclic stability, higher Coulombic efficiencies and higher rate capabilities than the as-prepared CMO electrode without heat treatment. While the CMO electrode presents an excellent catalytic behavior in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the oxygen vacancies mitigate the migration of Li+ ions and electrons and act as active sites for O-2 in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The ex situ characterization also proves a lower kinetic charge transfer resistance and higher catalytic activities of the oxygen deficient CMO electrodes in the decomposition of discharge products during the discharge/charge cycles.

In electrolysis of water, the half-reaction containing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a reaction that is kinetically sluggish, which requires higher overpotential to produce O-2, when compared to the other half-reaction, i.e. hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Many electrocatalysts are studied extensively to be used in the OER process to get an economical yield out of it. Noble metal-based catalysts are the state-of-the-art catalyst used for OER currently. But due to their high cost and scarcity, they cannot be applied in a large-scale manner to be used in the future. The non-noble metals (transition metals and perovskites) are gaining interest by exhibiting on par or better OER performance compared to the noble metal used. Due to their low cost, ample resources, and several metals available, they have opened up a variety of areas with a different combination of metals to be used as a catalyst for OER. Amongst these metals, cobalt has received massive appreciation for performing as an excellent OER catalyst. Multi metals, multimetal mixed oxides, multimetal phosphides, perovskites, and carbon-supported catalysts containing cobalt have shown low overpotential with high long-term stability. Therefore, in this review, we go through different cobalt-based electrocatalysts for OER, the general mechanism governing the OER process, the challenges that we are facing today to enhance the catalytic performance, and future aspects to overcome such challenges.									32	1	0	0	1	0	32			0020-1693	1873-3255		WOS:000553340500007

Here, a bifunctional electrocatalyst of highly crystalline Mo2C nanoparticles supported on carbon sheets (Mo2C/CS) was designed toward overall water splitting. Owing to the highly active catalytic nature of Mo2C nanoparticles, the high surface area of carbon sheets and efficient charge transfer in the strongly coupled composite, the designed catalysts show excellent bifunctional behavior with an onset potential of -60 mV for HER and an overpotential of 320 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER in 1 M KOH while maintaining robust stability. Moreover, the electrolysis cell using the catalyst only requires a low cell voltage of 1.73 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and maintains the activity for more than 100 h when employing the Mo2C/CS catalyst as both anode and cathode electrodes. Such high performance makes Mo2C/CS a promising electrocatalyst for practical hydrogen production from water splitting.									92	4	0	0	4	0	95			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000411499600004	28758343

To this end, we have investigated structure-activity relationships in Pb2Ru2O7-x having pyrochlore structure by tuning the structural oxygen vacancy (O-vac) and metal oxidation states. Increase in O-vac with temperature boosts the ORR. activity by facilitating molecular oxygen dissociation via decrease in work function. O-vac formation is accompanied by lowering of the Ru(V)/Ru(IV) ratio due to charge-compensation which leads to decreased OER activity. Air-annealing of Pb2Ru2O7-x accelerates the formation of O-vac in comparison to Ar-annealing since atmospheric oxygen facilitates the reduction and phase-segregation of Ru from Pb2Ru2O7-x as RuO2. A maximum bifunctionality index and specific bifunctionality index of 0.69 V and 274.0 mu A/cm(BET)(2), respectively, are observed for pristine Pb2Ru2O7-x However, the activity is skewed toward OER for pristine Pb2Ru2O7-x creating an asymmetric bifunctional property which is not desirable for practical applications. To reduce the asymmetric behavior, pristine and air-annealed Pb2Ru2O7-x samples at 700 degrees C are physically mixed which yields a higher symmetric OER/ORR activity (vertical bar Delta i(OER(eta = 0.2.5 V)-ORR(eta = -0.45) (specific)(V))vertical bar: pristine = 0.25 mA/cm(BET)(2) , Air-700 degrees C = 0.20 mA/cm(BET)(2), physical mixture = 0.037 mA/cm(BET)(2)). The inverse OER/ORR relationship in Pb2Ru2O7-x is attributed to the presence of an optimal ratio of 0.75 for Ru(V)/Ru(IV) and O-vac/O-lattice which provides symmetric bifunctional activity essential in electrochemical devices. An increase in Ru(V)/Ru(IV) ratio in pristine Pb2Ru2O7-x with no detectable Ru dissolution in the electrolyte observed subsequent to a 5-h OER hold-test, confirming high stability.									27	0	0	0	2	0	27			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800024

Herein, a novel hollow bimetallic carbide/nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (Co6Mo6C2@NCNT) is successfully synthesized through the simple pyrolysis of polypyrrole (PPy)-supported metal-organic framework (MOF) composite. Remarkable characteristics of the large surface area, hollow and porous structure, rich active sites and synergistic effect between Co6Mo6C2 and NCNT arouse high catalytic efficiency. Notably, the Co6Mo6C2@NCNT presents excellent ORR catalytic activity (a high half-wave potential of 0.875 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and diffusion-limited current density of 6.22 mA cm(-2)) via a fourelectron pathway, together with outstanding stability and methanol tolerance over commercial Pt/C in 0.1 M KOH solution. The composite also exhibits superior HER performance, delivering a low over-potential of 122.14 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), as well as good catalytic performance for OER in 1.0 M KOH solution. This work may provide some insight in design multifunctional electrocatalysts derived from MOF with advanced performance for sustainable energy technologies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, their practical feasibility is still hindered by structural stability due to the inevitable Sr leaching during long-term electrocatalysis. Herein, we propose a 0D/2D heterostructure involving CeO2 quantum dots decorated SrIrO3 nanosheets to achieve durable and active OER in harsh acidic environment. Theoretical calculations unveil that CeO2 coupling with electronic rearrangement not only lowers the energy barrier of OER but also mitigates Sr leaching. Benefiting from the activation and stabilization dual-effect of CeO2 coupling, the 4CeO(2)@SrIrO3 heterostructure exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 238 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a good durability for 50 h, surpassing most perovskite-related electrocatalysts in acidic media. For acidic water splitting, the water electrolyzer assembled with 4CeO(2)@SrIrO3||Pt-C coupled electrode demonstrates high activity and longlasting life. This protocol highlights an elegant approach of engineering heterostructure for robust and efficient electrocatalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000809946800004

Herein, we describe the synthesis of bimetallic Fe/Ni alloy encapsulated by amorphous carbon shells via a facile annealing strategy for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The ferric nickel tartrate annealed at 800 degrees C (Ni3Fe1Ox@C-800) exhibits a low OER overpotential of 264 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and good stability in alkaline media. Compared with monometallic counterpart, bimetallic Ni3Fe-based nanocomposites show lower OER barrier (ca. 324 kJ mol-1) due to a cooperation mechanism between Ni and Fe sites in promoting electrocatalytic water oxidation. Compared with those annealed at other temperatures, the enhanced OER performance of Ni3Fe1Ox@C-800 can be ascribed to the large electrochemical surface area for exposing more active sites, smaller charge transfer, and better intrinsic activity of Ni3Febased sites.

Herein, we demonstrated that in-situ grown Cu2O on Cu foam as a scaffold to load active ingredients could lower the interfacial contact resistance and promote the electron transfer in oxygen evolution reaction. Meanwhile, the Cu2O/Cu (CCF) facilitates to load active components due to higher surface area resulting from its irregular scattered structure.

Herein, TiN nanowire arrays are used as conductive trunks to support active Ni-doped Co3O4 (Ni0.27Co2.73O4) nanosheets to construct a binder-free three-dimensional (3D) electrode for OER. In the core@shell configuration, the TiN nanowire arrays possess a single-crystal-like structure favoring charge migration and the ultrathin Ni0.27Co2.73O4 nanosheets have a mesoporous structure providing more active sites. The hierarchically branched morphology, high conductivity and large surface area can be achieved simultaneously by the optimization in composition and nanostructure, which contributes to excellent electrochemical performances.

By changing the Cr content, we were able to modify the overall OER activity. Among the compositions investigated, Co2.25Cr0.75O4 is the most active, which achieves 10 mA cm(-2) current density per geometric area and a mass activity of 10.5 A/g at 0.35 V overpotential. We hypothesize that this enhanced OER activity is due to the increase of the adsorption energy of the intermediates (*O, *OH, and *OOH) resulting from the increased electrophilicity of Co2+ sites in the material after the introduction of the electron-deficient Cr. This systematic doping strategy enables the investigation of the correlation between the doping and OER activity and allows for the rational design of future catalysts with higher activity and efficiency.									73	0	0	0	5	0	72			2155-5435			WOS:000391783200053

Cobalt oxide, one of the most promising non-noble metal catalysts for OER, can exhibit highly enhanced catalytic OER activity when deposited on gold substrates. However, it still remains challenging to develop efficient Au/Co3O4 catalysts that can maximize the catalytic activity with the minimum use of gold. Here is reported a simple leaching derived synthesis of atomically dispersed/clustered gold on mesoporous cobalt oxides as highly efficient catalysts for OER. With greatly lowered gold contents <1 wt%, the catalyst shows twice as much current density and Au normalized activity than mesoporous cobalt oxide at 400 mV overpotential.

As one of the most important half-reactions for water splitting reactions, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a kinetically sluggish process that will greatly affect the energy conversion efficiency. Therefore, exploring a highly efficient and durable catalyst to boost the OER is of great urgency. In this work, we develop a facile strategy for the synthesis of well-defined phosphorus and fluorine co-doped Ni1.5Co1.5N hybrid nanorods (HNs) by using ionic liquids (ILs; 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate). In comparison to the IrO2 catalyst, the as-obtained PF/Ni1.5Co1.5N HNs manifests a low overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mAcm(-2), Tafel slope of 66.1 mVdec (1), and excellent durability in 1.0 M KOH solution. Furthermore, the iR-corrected electrochemical results indicate it could achieve a current density of 100 mAcm(-2) at an overpotential of 350 mV. The combination of cobalt and nickel elements, 1D mesoporous nanostructure, heteroatom incorporation, and ionic liquid- assisted nitridation, which result in faster charge transfer capability and more active surface sites, can facilitate the release of oxygen bubbles from the catalyst surface. Our findings confirm that surface heteroatom doping in bimetallic nitrides could serve as a new class of OER catalyst with excellent catalytic activity.									34	2	0	0	1	0	34			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000416549200024	28906036

NCS@CFM-LDH/NF also shows an ultra-long-term stability at 1000 mA cm(-2 )over 100 h. Its remarkable performance is ascribed to the synergic effect of multi-component and hierarchical structure. Additionally, Theoretical calculations disclose that the doping of molybdenum is beneficial to the adsorption of the *O intermediate, thus promotes OER activity. This study provides an attractive approach to design highly active and durable OER catalysts for industrial application in electrolysis of water.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000861078900004

Herein, we present a simple room-temperature stirring method for the manufacture of FeCoNi layered double hydroxide (FeCoNi-LDH) nanomaterials by utilizing a homemade metal-organic framework (CoNi-glycerate solid spheres) as a precursor. The FeCoNi-LDHs exhibit a hierarchical yolk-shell structure, with numerous ultra-thin hydroxide nanosheets forming the walls. Because of its unique structure and composition, FeCoNi-LDH-5 only requires an overpotential of 252 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)and exhibits excellent electrochemical stability. Enhanced activity can be explained by the high electrochemical surface area and low transfer resistance obtained. This work provides a feasible tactic to engineer LDHs as high-efficiency and promising OER electrocatalysts for advanced metal-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-5235	1543-186X		WOS:000830276600001

Herein, we prepared Fe and B codoped NiZn layered double hydroxides (LDHs) nanosheets via in situ growth on nickel foam by an ion etching strategy. Moreover, the representative NiZnFeB-LDH nanosheets presented a superior electrocatalytic performance for OER with a low 280 mV overpotential at 100 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 48.4 mV dec(-1), outperforming most Ni-based materials reported up until now. In addition, the NiZnFeB-LDH can maintain stable electrocatalytic activity for as long as 120 h (100 mA cm(-2)). The codoping of Fe and B modulated the intrinsic electronic properties of NiZn-LDH, and even the synergetic effects among these metal centers with the nonmetallic element accelerated the transfer ability of charges, thus achieving excellent performance. This work can supply a new perspective for designing remarkable electrocatalysts.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2168-0485			WOS:000516665500037

Herein, an effective approach is described for enhancing the dispersibility of graphene in aqueous solutions at different pH levels via non-covalent zwitterion functionalization. The results show that a surfactant with electron-deficient carbon atoms in its backbone structure and large pi-pi interactive area enables strong interactions with graphene, and the zwitterionic side terminal groups of the molecule support the dispersibility of graphene in various pH conditions. Experimental and computational studies confirm that perylene diimide amino N-oxide (PDI-NO) allows efficient functionalization and pH-independent dispersion of graphene enabled by hydration repulsion effects induced by PDI-NO. The PDI-NO functionalized graphene is successfully used in the oxygen evolution reaction as an electron mediator for boosting the electrocatalytic activity of a Ru-based polyoxometalate catalyst in an acidic medium. The proposed strategy is expected to bring significant advances in producing highly dispersible graphene in aqueous medium with pH-independent stability, thus broadening the application range of graphene.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000514181900001	32072771

Tantalum dioxyfluoride, TaO2F, as very stable compound, supported on graphitized carbon (C-g) has been synthesized using a simple ion adsorbed methodology and used as an electrocatalyst for the OER in alkaline medium. The TaO2F/C-g electrocatalyst exhibited efficient catalytic activity with a lower onset potential of 1.48 V vs. RHE for the OER and an overpotential of only 360 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2).

Water Electrolysis Anode Based on 430 Stainless Steel Coated with Cobalt Recycled from Li-Ion Batteries								RECYCLING				3	3					42	10.3390/recycling3030042				SEP 2018	2018	In this paper, a new environmentally-friendly anode for hydrogen production was developed based on 430 stainless steel with an electrodeposited cobalt layer. The novelty of this work is the cobalt source once the electrodeposition bath was obtained from acid dissolution of a spent Li-ion battery cathode. The oxygen evolution reaction on electrodeposited cobalt in 1 M KOH is compatible with the E. Kobussen mechanism. The water discharge is related with reaction determinant step in low overpotential. The cobalt electrodeposition (3 Ccm(-2)) promotes a significant improvement of 430 stainless steel anodic properties for oxygen evolution reaction. When the overpotential reaches 370 mV, the density current for 430 stainless steel with electrodeposit cobalt is 19 mA.cm(-2) against 0.80 mA.cm(-2) for 430 stainless steel without cobalt. Thus, the anode construction described in this paper is an excellent option for Li-ion battery recycling.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2313-4321		WOS:000816794700001

The effect of MnO2 content of the composite anodes on the physical and electrochemical properties of the samples were investigated and compared with those of the pure pressed Pb and a commercial Pb-Sn-Ca electrowinning anode. Surface morphology of the fabricated samples was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cyclic voltammetry and potentiodynamic polarization experiments were performed in 180 g/l sulphuric acid solution at 37 +/- 0.5 degrees C to study the surface reactions of the anodes and their performance in terms of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) rate and potential. The results indicated that the addition of MnO2 improved the electrocatalytic activity of the lead anode for oxygen evolution. Oxidation of lead was also influenced by MnO2 particles. The effects of manganese ions in the electrolyte on the electrochemical performance of the composite anodes were also studied. Results showed that manganese ions, depending on concentration, can have both promoting and suppressive effects on the OER on the composite anodes. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

Thus, stable electrocatalysts with high oxygen electrocatalytic activity are in highly demand. Low-cost and metal-free carbon-based bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts are regarded as promising alternatives to the commercially used noble metals which suffer from multiple drawbacks, including poor stability, high cost and susceptibility to methanol. Here, a facile and scalable strategy was introduced to fabricate porous carbon matrix doped with high content of active nitrogen species as efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for superior Zn-air battery. Notably, the obtained electrocatalysts exhibit an ultrahigh surface area of 1200.3 m(2) g(-1) and abundant defects, both of which are capable to facilitate the accessibility and formation of catalytic sites. The as-fabricated Zn-air batteries achieve significantly large peak power density of similar to 160 mW cm(-3) and excellent cycling performance (nearly 1000 cycles) with small voltage gap of 0.97 V. This research opens novel avenue for the design and fabrication of affordable high-performance oxygen electrocatalyst and durable energy storage systems.									51	2	0	0	2	0	52			2405-8297			WOS:000521992800052

Herein, we synthesized trimetallic hollow microspheres composed with FeNi nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped carbon-based Ni2Mo3N (NiMoFe@NC700) using a "PBA@POMOF" strategy. In order to synthesize the precursor with ideal morphology and structure in the least steps, a polyoxometalate based metal-organic framework (POMOF) is used as a substrate to grow a Ni-Fe-based Prussian blue analogue (NiFePBA) on it. Benefiting from the hollow sphere structure formed by stacking flakes, better charge transfer performance and the synergistic effect between Ni2Mo3N and Fe0.64Ni0.36, the final product, NiMoFe@NC700, exhibits low overpotentials of 288 and 360 mV to achieve current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) for OER in 1 M KOH, respectively, which is superior to the benchmark IrO2 catalyst. This work proposes a facile and effective strategy to synthetize carbon-based polymetallic OER electrocatalysts based on PBA@POMOF.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-0216			WOS:000626974700001

Here, a porous and self-supported FeNi-alloy fiber paper is successfully fabricated to achieve excellent OER performance with an ultralow overpotential, as well as remarkable stability. It is demonstrated that Fe substitution into metallic nickel can enable the inactive metallic nickel to endow highly electrocatalytic activity. Therefore, Fe substitution plays a key role for the outstanding performance. Specifically, the leaching of partial Fe atoms on surface of alloy facilitates surface reconstruction to generate active FeNi-oxyhydroxides under OER conditions. Meanwhile, Fe atoms can induce the lengthening of Ni-O bonds within oxyhydroxides for promoting the decomposition of *OOH intermediate species into O-2. This work provides new insights into the underlying mechanisms of Fe substitution into metal nickel for improving OER activity, which can accelerate the exploitation of low-cost, efficient and durable electrocatalysts.									37	0	0	0	3	0	37			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000621626700003

The performance and rechargeability of these metal-air cells are highly dependent on the positive electrode material, where oxygen reduction and evolution reactions take place. Here, for the first time, we provide a detailed account of the kinetics and rechargeability of sodium-air batteries through a series of carefully designed tests on a treated commercial carbon material. Surface area and porous structure of the positive electrode material were controlled in order to gain detailed information about the reaction kinetics of sodium-air batteries. The results indicate that discharge capacity is linearly correlated with surface area while morphology of the solid discharge product is strongly dependent on specific surface area and pore size. Furthermore, it was found that the chemical composition of discharge products as well as charging overpotential is affected by discharge reaction rate.									127	3	0	0	5	0	128			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000343974700025

In this work, the superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER)-active granule networks of iron oxide have been synthesized by simple thermal oxidation with electrochemical activation on stainless-steel mesh (SSM). During the electrochemical activation process of the thermally oxidized SSM, the chromium (Cr) elements were completely leached out of the thermally oxidized SSM to generate much more OER-active sites on the surface. The 450 degrees C thermally oxidized SSM with 40 h of i-t chronoamperometry activation, named SSM-450EA, shows an overpotential of 265 mV and a Tafel slope of 44 mV/dec with a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). This work highlights the ideas on coupling both thermal and electrochemical engineering in augmenting the electroactivity of electrocatalysts as a robust substrate while providing insights into such a structure-tuning approach.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000703338600174

Ir oxide-based materials are thus of great scientific interest in current research on electrochemical energy conversion. In the present study, we applied Ir metal films as model systems for electrochemical water splitting, obtained by inductive heating in a custom-made setup using two different synthesis approaches. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) confirmed that all films were consistently metallic. The effects of reductive heating time of calcined and uncalcined Ir acetate films on OER activity were investigated using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) setup. The morphology of all films was determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The films directly reduced from the acetate precursor exhibited a strong variability of their morphology and electrochemical properties depending on heating time. The additional oxidation step prior to reductive heating accelerates the final structure formation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2571-9637		WOS:000717467600001

An inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer connected to an electrochemical flow cell is used for online detection of the metals dissolution rates. Broad potential windows starting from the hydrogen and going to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potentials are used to study the dissolution. The measured dissolution data, such as onsets of dissolution are analyzed and compared with available thermodynamic data. For most metals, at potentials, at which thermodynamics predict metal/solute or metal/oxide transitions, an initiation of the dissolution process is observed. It is suggested that dissolution during metal/oxide transitions is a purely kinetic effect that reflects the solubility of unstable transient oxides. Such oxides can also be formed during the oxygen evolution reaction. The latter fact is used to explain metals dissolution in the region of OER.									57	3	0	0	2	0	57			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000426955500004

The electrochemical activity of these nanostructures for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media was assessed in the dark and under solar light irradiation. Electrodes modified with cubic-shaped Cu2O and Cu2O-Au nanostructures revealed both enhanced electrocatalytic OER activity over the octahedral-shaped ones, for which hydroxylation of the (111) surfaces might hinder the OER as supported by numerical computations. Illumination of Cu2O nanostructures with solar light did not enhance the electrocatalytic OER. Cu2O-Au nanostructures, however, showed improved OER activity with an overpotential of 200 mV (10 mA cm(-2)) and a Tafel slope of 97 mV dec(-1).

In this paper, we design a series of C6H4NO2/g-C3N4 composites by combining a polar nitrobenzene molecule with g-C3N4 monolayer using density functional theory calculations. The electrocatalytic performances during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are substantially improved thanks to the electron redistributions of g-C3N4 substrate. One composite specimen exhibits the lowest bi-directional OER/ORR overpotentials of 0.14/0.14 V, and the most stable composite specimen has OER/ORR overpotentials of 0.27/0.39 V. The number of active electrons in active atom, as descriptor of catalytic activity, can accurately estimate the OER and ORR activity of metal-free electrocatalysts. The modification strategy would be extended to design high-efficiency metal-free electrocatalysts.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000566336000007

Our catalyst is prepared on the surface of hydroxyapatite by ion exchange reaction in Co2+ aqueous solution. The cobalt content is approximately 1 wt. % based on ICP-AES and XPS experiments. XRD, TEM, EDX experiments suggest that individual cobalt ions are adsorbed on the HAP surface in non-aggregated manner. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) of CoHAP exhibits a weak oxidation peak at 1.10 V which is comparable to CV of in-situ formed Co-Pi in previous literature. Tafel slope is approximately 80 mV/decade which is independent on the loading amount of CoHAP. The Faradaic efficiency is 94 % measured by quantitative analysis of O-2 using gas chromatography. Bulk electrolysis verifies that CoHAP can be utilized OER catalyst at neutral pH with high stability. Our preparation method using hydroxyapatite as a solid phase phosphate source offers a new strategy to fabricate the OER catalysts.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000497857800005

The double isolation of the active sites is achieved through M-N-4 (M = Co, Fe) coordinating bonds in sulfonated-substituted metalloporphyrin (MTPPS) and electrostatic interactions of MTPPS absorbed with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) networks. Subsequent "in situ copyrolysis" over the precursors ensures effective contact between p-type CoFe2O4 and n-type Fe2O3 species with n-type N,S-doping carbon support, respectively. This leads to p-n CoFe2O4-N,S-C and n-n Fe2O3-N,S-C heterojunctions. Meanwhile, CoFe2O4-N,S-C has a higher E-VB energy level (-6.22 eV) than Fe2O3-N,S-C (-6.31 eV), achieving lower energy barrier, and thus superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance with a higher half-wave potential (0.84 V) of CoFe2O4-N,S-C than Fe2O3-N,S-C (0.82 V). In addition, CoFe2O4-N,S-C also exhibits higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with 100 mV lower overpotential (0.41 V) than Fe2O3-N,S-C. The lower overpotential is a result of larger energy gap between E-CB energy level and Fermi level of CoFe2O4-N,S-C. This is the first demonstration of a novel p-n heterojunction with a special band structure that plays a key role in highly active ORR and OER bifunctional catalysis. Moreover, CoFe2O4-N,S-C displays significant photoelectrochemical enhancement upon light irradiation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2196-7350			WOS:000721462300001

Our results indicated that the adsorption energy of oxygen atom is the key factor to describe the catalytic activity. For ORR, the highest activity was achieved at the oxygen adsorption energy of 2.25 eV. M-N-4-C (M = Co, Rh and Ir) composites with appropriate oxygen adsorption strength exhibited high ORR activity. In addition, the Co-N-4-C and Rh-N-4-C composites with the oxygen adsorption strength close to 2.78 eV are also predicted to have excellent performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER).									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000435298100031

However, its poor conductivity and inherently poor electrocatalytic activity are considered to be the limiting factors inhibiting the electrocatalytic properties for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The amorphous NiFeAl-LDHs electrocatalysts were prepared by electrodeposition with nickel foam as the support, and the D-NiFeAl-LDHs electrocatalyst with defect sites was then obtained by alkali etching. The mechanism of catalysts with defect sites in OER was analyzed. The ingenious defects can selectively accelerate the adsorption of OH-, thus enhancing the electrochemical activity. The D-NiFeAl-LDHs electrocatalyst had higher OER electrocatalytic activity than NiFe-LDHs electrocatalyst: its accelerated OER kinetics were mainly due to the introduction of iron and nickel defects in NiFeAl-LDHs nanosheets, which effectively adjusted the surface electronic structure and improved OER electrocatalytic performance. There was only a low overpotential of 262 mV with the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slope was as low as 41.67 mV dec(-1). The OER electrocatalytic performance of D-NiFeAl-LDHs was even better than those of most of the reported NiFe-LDHs electrocatalysts. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, these nonoxides suffer from obvious surface transformation and poor structural stability, which must be urgently remedied. Herein, the interfacial engineering of Co4N via mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) was first carried out, in which NC can significantly suppress the oxidization of Co4N in alkaline media, ensuring the efficient interfacial charge transport between Co4N and NC. As a result, extremely low overpotentials @10 mA cm(-2) of 62 mV (hydrogen evolution reaction, HER) and 257 mV (oxygen evolution reaction, OER) and small Tafel slopes of 37 mV (HER) and 58 mV dec(-1) (OER) were achieved in alkaline media. Theoretical calculations suggest that their synergetic coupling effects can significantly facilitate the charge-transfer process and further greatly reduce the energy barrier for water splitting. This work underscores the importance of the surface engineering of nonoxides and efficient approaches for the design of stable catalysts for electrocatalysis.									68	6	0	0	4	0	69			2380-8195			WOS:000526311000001

Herein, we prepare a type of Co catalyst with single-atomic Co sites embedded in hierarchically ordered porous N-doped carbon (Co-SAS/HOPNC) through a facile dual-template cooperative pyrolysis approach. The desirable combination of highly dispersed isolated atomic Co-N-4 active sites, large surface area, high porosity, and good conductivity gives rise to an excellent catalytic performance. The catalyst exhibits outstanding performance for ORR in alkaline medium with a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.892 V, which is 53 mV more positive than that of Pt/C, as well as a high tolerance of methanol and great stability. The catalyst also shows a remarkable catalytic performance for HER with distinctly high turnover frequencies of 0.41 and 3.8 s(-1) at an overpotential of 100 and 200 mV, respectively, together with a long-term durability in acidic condition. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the atomically isolated single Co sites and the structural advantages of the unique 3D hierarchical porous architecture synergistically contribute to the high catalytic activity.									229	19	0	0	13	0	230			0027-8424			WOS:000452866000062	30487213

There are two common cobalt oxides, Co3O4 (spinel phase, stable but poor intrinsic activity) and CoO (rocksalt phase, active but easily be oxidatized). Constructing Co3O4/CoO heterophase can inherit both characteristic features of each component and form a heterophase interface facilitating charge transfer, which is believed to be an effective strategy in designing excellent electrocatalysts. Herein, an atomic arrangement engineering strategy is applied to improve electrocatalytic activity of Co3O4 for the OER. With the presence of oxygen vacancies, cobalt atoms at tetrahedral sites in Co3O4 can more easily diffuse into interstitial octahedral sites to form CoO phase structure as revealed by periodic density functional theory computations. The Co3O4/CoO spinel/rocksalt heterophase can be in situ fabricated at the atomic scale in plane. The overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) of Co3O4/CoO is 1.532 V, which is 92 mV smaller than that of Co3O4. Theoretical calculations confirm that the excellent electrochemical activity is corresponding to a decline in average p-state energy of adsorbed-O on the Co3O4/CoO heterophase interface. The reaction Gibbs energy barrier has been significantly decreased with the construction of the heterophase interface.									39	4	0	0	0	0	39			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000496521900001	31729159

Anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting is one of the biggest obstacles because of its extremely high kinetic barrier. Conventional OER catalysts are mainly noble-metal oxides represented by IrO2 and RuO2, but these compounds tend to have poor sustainability. The attention on Prussian blue (PB) and its analogs (PBA) in the field of energy conversion systems was concentrated on their open-framework structure, as well as its varied composition comprised of Earth-abundant elements. The unique electronic structure of PBA enables its promising catalytic potential, and it can also be converted into many other talented compounds or structures as a precursor. This undoubtedly provides a new approach for the design of green OER catalysts. This article reviews the recent progress of the application of PBA and its derivatives in OER based on in-depth studies of characterization techniques. The structural design, synthetic strategy, and enhanced electrochemical properties are summarized to provide an outlook for its application in the field of OER. Moreover, due to the similarity of the reaction process of photo-driven electrolysis of water and the former one, the application of PBA in photoelectrolysis is also discussed.									13	1	0	0	0	0	14				1420-3049		WOS:000539293400037	32422929

Oxygen selectivity is challenging when performing seawater electrolysis owing to competing chloride oxidation reactions. In this work we propose a design criterion based on thermodynamic and kinetic considerations that identifies alkaline conditions as preferable to obtain high selectivity for the oxygen evolution reaction. The criterion states that catalysts sustaining the desired operating current with an overpotential < 480 mV in alkaline pH possess the best chance to achieve 100% oxygen/hydrogen selectivity. NiFe layered double hydroxide is shown to satisfy this criterion at pH 13 in seawater-mimicking electrolyte. The catalyst was synthesized by a solvothermal method and the activity, surface redox chemistry, and stability were tested electrochemically in alkaline and near-neutral conditions (borate buffer at pH 9.2) and under both fresh seawater conditions. The Tafel slope at low current densities is not influenced by pH or presence of chloride. On the other hand, the addition of chloride ions has an influence in the temporal evolution of the nickel reduction peak and on both the activity and stability at high current densities at pH 9.2. Faradaic efficiency close to 100% under the operating conditions predicted by our design criteria was proven using in situ electrochemical mass spectrometry.									234	10	0	0	15	0	238			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000378634800008	27010750

Herein, a type of hierarchically ultra-fine CoP attached to CuO nanowire flowers (CuO NWF-CoP/CF) has been obtained by a simple electrodeposition method. Due to the merits of the 3D hierarchical structure with large surface areas, rich active sites, and open-channels for effective gas diffusion, as-achieved CuO NWF-CoP/CF catalysts exhibit outstanding OER activity with an overpotential of 230 mV for OER to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media.

Recent investigations reveal that bulk BP is a promising electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reactions (OER), whereas its bulk crystal structure restricts sufficient active sites for achieving highly efficient OER catalytic performances. Toward this end, few-layer BP nanosheets prepared by facile liquid exfoliation are applied as electrocatalysts and exhibit preferable electrocatalytic OER activity in association with structural robustness; subsequently, the dependence of current density and applied bias potential on the concentration of OH-has also been uncovered. Most importantly, we are aware that reduction in the thickness of BP nanosheets would generate extra active sites from the ultrathin planar structure and complimenting to the electrocatalytic activities. It is further anticipated that the current work might provide further implementation about the OER performance of BP nanosheets, thereby, offering extendable availabilities for BP-based electrocatalysts in constructing high-performance OER devices.									267	25	0	0	11	0	269			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000414918700010

Despite its self-repairing mechanism in neutral electrolytes, Co-Pi is mostly used as a co-catalyst for the fabrication of composite electrodes as charge collectors. In this work, the limits of Co-Pi were assessed under various operating conditions, such as those of the cationic concentration, phosphate buffering pH, concentration, and duration of the deposition. Contrasting results were observed for Co-Pi films with varied thicknesses based on the available phosphate moieties on the surfaces of the electrodes. Likewise, a highly alkaline electrolyte medium was found to provide better charge densities, at the expense of the phosphate (PO43- ) species on the surface. Mechanistic details are proposed, based on the observed elemental oxidative domains, to explain both the decline in PO43content and the formation of an active hydrous oxide passivated layer, as an alternative mechanism in nonneutral environments.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663218500004

Thus, we report on the nanoporous IrNi thin film that reveals a markedly enhanced OER activity, which is attained through a selective etching of Os from the IrNiOs alloy thin film. Interestingly, electrochemical selective etching of Os leads to the formation of 3-dimensionally interconnected nanoporous structure providing a high electrochemical surface area (ECSA, 80.8 cm(2)), which is 90 fold higher than a bulk Ir surface (0.9 cm(2)). The overpotential at the nanoporous IrNi electrode is markedly lowered to be 289 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), compared with bulk Ir (375 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). The nanoporous IrNi prepared through the selective de-alloying of Os is promising as the anode material for a water electrolyzer.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2093-8551			WOS:000504830100007

In this work, mesoporous Co and Ni-Co sulfide nanotubes with ultrathin nanowalls are designed and fabricated by a facile and template-free solvothermal method. The obtained CoS1.097 nanotubes can be used as an OER electrocatalyst, and the incorporation of Ni into the CoS1.097 lattice could further enhance the catalytic activity of the catalysts. The best-performing Ni0.13Co0.87S1.097 nanotubes exhibit high performance for OER with a small overpotential of 316 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability, which outperform those of commercial IrO2 and most of the studied Co-based OER catalysts. Our work demonstrates a new strategy to design highly efficient non-previous-metal OER electrocatalysts with unique structures and can be extended to other transition-metal-based systems.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			2574-0962			WOS:000458705100036

The kinetics of oxygen evolution on non-traditional electrodic materials								Hydrogen Energy System								193	213						1979	1979	The oxygen evolution reaction has been studied on a new type of electrodic material based on mixed oxides of perovskite-like structure, whose general formula is NiLa2O4. On the basis of the kinetic parameters obtained in a far-from-equilibrium situation in KOH solutions (0.1-6 M), it has been possible to determine the mechanism of the reaction as being constituted by two initial electrochemical steps, the second of which rate determining. The change in the Tafel slope from low to high current densities is explained in terms of the active sites occupation on the electrode surface. The obtained results and their practical relevance are compared with recently published results on other non traditional anodic materials.

The electrocatalyst shows high and stable electrocatalytic performance, with a half-wave potential of 0.82 V for oxygen reduction reaction and an overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (0.34 V) and hydrogen evolution reaction (0.163 V), which outperform the metal-organic framework-derived transition metal sulfide catalysts reported so far. Furthermore, the Co9S8-MoS2@N-CNAs@CNFs are employed as an air cathode in a liquid-state and all-solid-state zinc-air battery, presenting high power densities of 222 and 96 mW cm(-2), respectively. Such excellent catalytic activities are mainly owing to the unique three-dimensional structure and chemical compositions, optimal electronic conductivity, adequate surface area, and the abundance of active sites. Thus, this work provides an important method for designing other metal-organic framework-derived three-dimensional structural sulfide quantum dot multifunctional electrocatalysts for wider application in highly efficient catalysis and energy storage.									42	1	0	0	0	0	43			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000518702300020	32049479

Herein, a one-pot solvothermal method was employed for scalable preparation of uniform hollow PtCu rhombic dodecahedron nanoframes (PtCu RDNFs) in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), where diglycolamine (DGA) served as the co-reductant and co-structure director. The above architectures had the larger electrochemically active surface area (ECSA, 36.85 m(2) g(Pt)(-1)) than that of commercial Pt black (15.85 m(2) g(Pt)(-1)), along with the improved catalytic characters for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acid electrolytes alternative to those of Pt black. It demonstrates great potential applications of PtCu RDNFs in fuel cells and beyond. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Efficient, stable and less-expensive catalysts are required to overcome such restrictions. Herein, we report preparation of IrRe-IrOx based catalysts with record high mass activity. The electrocatalyst was prepared by magnetron sputtering deposition of metallic Ir-Re thin film with subsequent electrooxidation. The optimal composition of as-deposited Ir-Re catalyst was defined as Ir39Re61. During electrooxidation process Re atoms are dissolved promoting metallic Ir oxidation to highly active amorphous IrOx phase with high surface area. The IrRe-IrOx catalyst exhibits low OER overpotential of 248 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) current density and mass activity of 4400 mA.mg(-1). High mass OER activity of the IrRe-IrOx catalyst is result of combination of high surface area, low catalyst loading and presence of amorphous IrOx on catalyst surface. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we introduce electrodeposited nickel-copper-phosphorous (NiCuP) as an efficient OER electrocatalyst in alkaline medium. The addition of Cu into the NiP electrocatalyst significantly enhanced the OER activity. Optimization of the electrodeposition conditions revealed that Nis(9)Cu(19)P(9) in terms of atomic percent exhibited the best activity with a reduced Tafel slope and charge transfer resistance for the OER, compared to NiP. The Ni59Cu19P9 catalyst successfully endured the OER operation at 10 mA/cm(2) for up to 30 h while maintaining a Faradaic efficiency of over 99%. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that the amount of active Ni hydroxide (NiOOH) species increased with the addition of Cu, which likely contributed to the enhanced of catalytic activity.									79	4	0	0	1	0	80			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000442973700044

Herein, a vanadium-oxide-based hybrid air electrode comprising a heterostructure of V2O3 and MnS (V2O3/MnS) is reported. The V2O3/MnS catalyst shows a decent catalytic activity that is comparable to Pt/C toward the oxygen reduction reaction and acceptable toward oxygen evolution. The extraordinary stability as well as the low cost set the V2O3/MnS among the best bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. In a demonstration of an assembled liquid-state Zn-air battery using V2O3/MnS as cathode, high power density (118 mW cm(-2)), specific capacity (808 mAh g(Zn)(-1)), and energy density (970 Wh kg(Zn)(-1)), as well as the outstanding rechargeability and durability for 4000 cycles (>1333 h, i.e., >55 days) are enabled. The V2O3/MnS is also integrated into an all-solid-state Zn-air battery to demonstrate its great potential as a flexible power source for next-generation electronics.

Low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are needed. Recently, chemical vapor deposition is used as an effective approach to gain high-quality MoS2 nanosheets (NSs), which possess excellent performance for water splitting comparable to platinum. Herein, MoS2 NSs grown vertically on FeNi substrates are obtained with in situ growth of Fe5Ni4S8 (FNS) at the interface during the synthesis of MoS2. The synthesized MoS2/FNS/FeNi foam exhibits only 120 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and exceptionally low overpotential of 204 mV to attain the same current density for OER. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the constructed coupling interface between MoS2 and FNS facilitates the absorption of H atoms and OH groups, consequently enhancing the performances of HER and OER. Such impressive performances herald that the unique structure provides an approach for designing advanced electrocatalysts.									174	6	0	0	11	0	176			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000444671900027	30084212

The electrochemical behaviour was studied by cyclic voltammetry in 5 mol dm(-3) KOH. The results showed that the presence of Rh in the spinel structure affects the surface of the coatings and the electric resistance of the substrate/coating interface. The electrodes were tested as anodes for oxygen evolution and the kinetics of the reaction was studied by means of steady-state measurements. The results revealed that the electrode performance towards the oxygen evolution reaction is enhanced by the presence of Rh due to the increasing specific surface area of the coating. Rh has no effect on the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of the coatings and only geometric effects take place in addition to the decrease in resistivity across the Ti/Co2.95Rh0.05O4 interface.

In this report, we present a cation exchange strategy, between Ni2+ and Mn3O4, to facilely synthesize spinel NiMn2O4 nanocages in combination with rGO nanosheets (NMO/rGO). When the synthesized NMO/rGO nanocages were tested as electrocatalysts for OER in water splitting, they exhibited a low overpotential of 284 mV at a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 82.2 mV dec(-1). This performance was superior to Mn3O4/rGO nanoparticles. The successful synthesis of these nanocages offer pathways for easy accessibility of highly efficient OER electrocatalyst.

Remarkably, it is discovered that the pyrolysis temperature effects the chemical composition intensively. At 800 degrees C, only graphitic-N and oxidized-N are formed for all as-prepared samples. The surface area and pores can be precisely tuned, the surface area of all Fe/N-HCS samples is more than 500 m(2) g(-1) benefiting from the porous hollow structure. Thus, the optimized Fe/N-HCS exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction performance in term of onset potential (1.00 V vs. RHE), half-wave potential (0.87 V vs. RHE), good stability as well as methanol tolerance for oxygen reduction reaction, even surpassing the Pt in alkaline condition and more competitive in acidic condition: Furthermore, the optimized Fe/N-HCS displays better hydrogen evolution reaction activity in acidic condition with onset overpotential of 40 mV and overpotential to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) at 170 mV, indicating better active. It is found that Fe/N-HCS improve the hydrogen evolution reaction activity after electrodeposition trace quantity of Pt, which shows 170 mV of overpotential to deliver 100 mA cm(-2).

The extent of cyclization reactions was calculated from the FTIR data. It was found that DMI comonomer had the ability to promote the cyclization reactions significantly at the temperature of 240 degrees C, compared to the PAN homopolymer. The results of quantitative FTIR analysis in the range of 1000-1800cm(-1) showed that the DMI comonomer not only promoted the cyclization reactions, but also facilitated the oxygen uptake reactions, especially the conjugated carbonyl group in an acridone ring in the ladder polymer chains, which proved that DMI comonomer had the potential ability to make successful thermal oxidative stabilization (TOS) process. The positive effects of DMI comonomer on TOS reactions and carbon yield were further confirmed by the dynamic thermogravimetry (TG) analysis.

Recently, layered SnS2 semiconductor nanomaterial has been re-cognized as a noteworthy electrocatalytic candidate due to its chemically stable, high effective surface area, low cost, and high stability. This review discussed how to boost hydrogen energy production using layered SnS2 nanostructure as catalysts through electrocatalytic water splitting, which essentially comprises morphological, doping, and nanocomposite/heterostructural engineering. Further, various vital parameters for evaluating the electrocatalytic properties of layered SnS2 and reaction mechanisms are broadly discussed. Finally, we also discussed the summary and the future perspectives of evolving layered SnS2 nanostructure as a superior electrode nanomaterial for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.

Herein, an optimized NiFe-based metal-organic framework is developed as highly efficient active material for OER. It just needs a low overpotential of 0.31 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a favorable Tafel slope of 43.7 mV dec(-1) in 0.1 m KOH electrolyte for the as-prepared Ni0.75Fe0.25 BDC, which is superior to RuO2. This efficient catalytic performance is due to the introduction of Fe in Ni-based MOFs could benefit the kinetics and charge transfer efficiency, resulting in the optimal activity toward OER. Besides, the obtained active material demonstrates good stability, suggesting the great potential value in sustainable electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices.									45	7	0	0	1	0	46				2575-0356		WOS:000576642500002

The reaction rate was significantly influenced not only by the oxygen partial pressure but also by the gas flow rate. Little evolution of SO2 gas was observed in the initial 10 seconds of the oxidation; however, this was followed by a period of high evolution rate of SO2 gas. The partial pressure of SO2 gas decreased with further progress of the desulfurization. The effect of the immersion depth of the submerged nozzle was neglible. The overall reaction is decomposed to two elementary reactions: the desulfurization and the dissolution rate of oxygen. The assumptions were made that these reactions are at equilibrium and that the reaction rates are controlled by mass transfer rates within and around the gas bubble. The time variations of sulfur and oxygen contents in the melt and the SO2 partial pressure in the off-gas under various bubbling conditions were well explained by the mathematical model combined with the reported thermodynamic data of these reactions. Based on the present model, it was anticipated that the oxidation rate around a single gas bubble was mainly determined by the rate of gas-phase mass transfer, but all oxygen gas blown into the melt was virtually consumed to the desulfurization and dissolution reactions before it escaped from the melt surface.									14	0	0	0	0	1	15			0360-2141			WOS:A1991EX43700001

In both technologies, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) account for the most efficiency loss because the reactions on catalytic sites are constrained by adsorption-energy scaling relations involving intermediates of *OOH, *O, and *OH (where * denotes the active site). Therefore, a novel paradigm for catalyst design is required by overcoming or circumventing the adsorption- energy scaling relations. In this Review, the fundamentals of oxygen electrocatalysis, including reaction of the mechanism and origin of the adsorption-energy scaling relationship, are first introduced. Crucial strategies to overcome the scaling relations are then summarized. Finally, future research directions in this area are proposed. This work provides guidelines for the rational design of efficient catalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis beyond the limitation posed by scaling relations.									156	10	0	0	12	0	156			2590-2393	2590-2385		WOS:000519845900012

Abundant transition metals and their sulfides are attractive electrochemical materials. Herein, we report an efficient phosphorization strategy, which improves the overall electrochemical performance of metal sulfides. In detail, CoS hexagonal bipyramids were synthesized through simple calcination combined with in situ sulfurization of a cobalt-based metal-organic framework template, and then phosphate ion-functionalized CoS (P-CoS) was prepared through a phosphorization reaction. P-CoS exhibited outstanding electrochemical activity as both supercapacitor electrode and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst. Supercapacitors based on CoS and P-CoS as the electrodes had high specific capacitances of 304 and 442 F g(-1), respectively, and remained stable for over 10 000 cycles at 5 A g(-1). For OER, P-CoS showed a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at an overpotential of 340 mV, with a small Tafel slope. In conclusion, functionalizing CoS with phosphate ions is a promising method for enhancing chemical reactivity and accelerating ion and electron transfer.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000577528200001	32476161

Herein, we develop a combined gelation/self-assemble/freeze drying process to fabricate a free-standing porous architectures through vertical anchoring two-dimensional (2D) CoMn-LDH nanosheets on three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical N,P co-doped graphene aerogels (NPGA) framework. This unique configuration endows CoMn-LDH/NPGA outstanding catalytic activity toward both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a potential difference of ca. 0.72 V between the OER potential at 10 mA cm(-2) and the ORR potential at -3 mA cm(-2), which is comparable to commercial Pt/C + IrO2 benchmarks, and therefore renders the CoMn-LDH/NPGA assembled zinc-air battery a superior rechargeable performance and cycling stability. In-depth structure-to-property correlation indicates that the prominent bifunctional activity of CoMn-LDH/NPGA are ascribed to large electrochemical active surface area, the rapid mass/charge transfers, the increased exposure and full utilization of active sites originated from the synergistic effect between the uniformly dispersed 2D CoMn-LDH nanosheets and the 3D hierarchical porous NPGA framework.

However, the current catalysts still present serious challenges due to the poor intrinsic activity and high overpotential. Herein, we report several amino induced Co-based composite catalysts.

The obtained ZnCo2S4/CoZn13 catalysts show an excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance (274 mV@50 mA cm-2) and the overpotential of 160 mV at -10 mA cm-2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For electrolysis of water, the electrocatalysts deliver a cell voltage of 1.61 V at 50 mA cm-2.

Although the description of the electrochemical reaction of water electrolysis dates back to the late 18th century, improvements in terms of efficiency and stability are foreseen for a widespread market penetration of water electrolysers. Particular advances are required for the electrode materials catalysing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode side, which has slow kinetics and thus is one of the major sources of the cell efficiency loss. In recent years, high-level theoretical tools and computational studies have led to significant progress in the atomic-level understanding of the OER and electrocatalyst behaviour. In parallel, several experimental studies have explored new catalytic materials with advanced properties and kinetics on a technical relevant level. This contribution summarises previous and the most recent theoretical predictions and experimental outcomes in the field of oxide-based catalysts for the OER, both operating in acidic and alkaline environments.									805	21	0	0	34	0	818			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000343004900005

Using knowledge from complete genomes and current databases, we have investigated the nature and composition of the extrinsic proteins forming the OECs of different organisms, with particular focus on the manganese stabilizing protein that is present in all known oxyphototrophs. This analysis traces the evolution of the extrinsic proteins from ancient cyanobacteria to higher plants and gives hints about the ancestral form of the OEC.									86	1	2	0	82	0	90			1360-1385			WOS:000188757600007	14729215

Electrochemical growth for the synthesis of the catalyst has been known to be an appealing method due to its shorter reaction time, low cost, and renewable nature. In this article, a simple electrochemical deposition method for the synthesis of hybrid nanostructures of earth-abundant transition metal selenides (Cu2Se/CoSe2) on copper foam (Cuf) has been explored the bifunctional electrochemical activity of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. The HER exhibited an overpotential of only 110 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and OER required the potential of only 1.4 V (outperforming noble metal catalyst RuO2) at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2). The electrochemical cell composed of Cuf@Cu2Se/CoSe2 catalyst in a two electrode system as an anode as well as a cathode showed high-performance overall water oxidation reaction with a very low applied potential of only 1.56 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The as-prepared electrode was proven to be superhydrophilic as well as aerophobic in nature, which enhances the stability and thus suited the best candidate for industrialization and practical applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000757901300001

Here, we report an enhanced electrocatalytic performance for water electrolysis, achieved through a progressive increase in the ordering of oxygen vacancies in the structural network of oxides. In transition from Sr2FeCoO6 & minus;delta (disordered) to CaSrFeCoO6 & minus;delta (ordered) and Ca2FeCoO6 & minus;delta (highly ordered), the change in the average ionic radius of the A-site metals leads to an increase in the concentration and ordering of oxygen vacancies, resulting in a progressive enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity for both cathodic and anodic half-reactions of water splitting, i.e., hydrogen-evolution (HER) and oxygen-evolution (OER) reactions. The OER electrocatalysis is particularly important, as it is considered the bottleneck for water electrolysis. These electrocatalysts show better activity than the precious metal catalyst RuO2. In contrast to most bifunctional catalysts reported to date, these catalysts can be used in bulk form, without the need for nanofabrication, composite formation, or any additional processing. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the vacancy order leads to a shift of the electronic bands toward the Fermi level. We propose that the ordering of oxygen vacancies can be used as a handle for the design of highly active electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000860015400001

A highly porous cobalt molybdenum sulfide (CoMoS4) electrocatalyst was fabricated using a simple chemical synthesis route. The porous CoMoS4 acts as an active electrocatalyst in alkaline medium for the oxygen evolution reaction with a low overpotential of 256 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). CoMoS4 also acts as an active catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 143 mV. An alkaline electrolyzer cell was constructed, where CoMoS4 was used as both the anode and cathode for the overall water splitting reaction with a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at a cell voltage of 1.65 V.

The catalyst was characterized using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscope, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The bifunctional catalytic activities for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were investigated using cyclic voltammetry in an alkaline electrolyte. The results indicate that nitrogen is successfully doped in the NG catalyst, and the catalyst has a loose structure that was produced during the freeze-dry process. The catalyst exhibits an excellent ORR activity with an onset potential of -0.08 V and a high OER activity with an obvious OER current at 0.7 V. The rotating-disk-electrode test results indicate that the ORR process catalyzed by the NG catalyst involves a mix of the two-electron and four-electron transfer pathways. This work preliminarily explores the bifunctional catalytic properties for the ORR and the OER of nitrogen-doped graphene materials in alkaline electrolyte.

JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				153	12					124709	10.1063/5.0014913				SEP 28 2020	2020	The effects of surface loading of iridium(II) oxide (IrO2), manganese(IV) oxide (MnO2), and cobalt(II) phosphate (CoPi) on the rate of photocatalytic oxygen evolution by anatase or rutile titania particles suspended in aqueous solutions of an electron acceptor, iodate ions, were studied by light intensity-dependence (LID) kinetic analyses. Although the role of these deposits has been reported to be a cocatalyst without showing results of any kinetic analysis, the present LID kinetic study suggested that the deposits may act as a "positive-hole capturer" for oxygen evolution, not as a cocatalyst for both metal oxides and CoPi. Further studies on the effects of loading amount, deposit types, titania crystalline type, and titania-particle size on the reaction order were also performed by LID analysis based on the proposed kinetic model. The observed LID behaviors could be interpreted consistently using a virtual parameter of "effective volume" as the target volume of photoabsorption by one positive-hole-bearing titania particle to govern the probability of two positive-hole accumulations in a titania particle.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000572638400001	33003764

A commonly applied screening tool is the rotating disk electrode setup. For powder materials, however, the measured electrocatalytic performance can be influenced by various experimental parameters. Here, a nickel cobalt mixed-oxide is investigated as a model catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media. The determined electrochemical performance upon variation of the ink composition, catalyst loading, electrolyte concentration, and gas saturation in the electrolyte is systematically evaluated. The results indicate that some parameters do not directly influence the measured performance, whereas others show a significant effect. Special attention is given to the interaction with Fe-impurities present in the electrolyte. The here presented insights into the impact of different parameters can support the interpretation of possible side effects in electrocatalyst analysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000850520800001		
J	Li, Yunfei; Gao, Yuanfeng; Liu, Meitang; Wang, Tianlei; Wang, Xu; Hu, Haisheng								One-step Hydrothermal Synthesis of Amorphous Nickel/Iron Oxide and its Application as Catalyst for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE				17	3					220338	10.20964/2022.03.29				MAR 2022	2022	It is of great significance to explore low-cost and high-efficiency oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts to meet the challenges of sustainable energy development. In this paper, amorphous nickel-iron oxide was successfully synthesized via a simple one-step hydrothermal method with the help of citric acid-sodium citrate buffer solution and template CTAB. Excellent dispersion and porous structure were found for the obtained samples, which significantly increase the exposed surface area of active sites of the catalyst. In addition, the morphology of Ni-Fe oxides could be controlled and the electronic structure of Ni could be modified by changing Ni/Fe mole ratio. When Ni/Fe mol ratio equals 3:1, this material exhibits the best catalytic activity, with an overpotential of only 197 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1). Thus, this work provides an economical way to prepare efficient electrocatalysts based on transition metal elements.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1452-3981			WOS:000770316700018

Herein, transition metal alloyed FeCo nanoparticles (NPs) embedded into N-doped honeycombed carbon (FeCo@N-HC) was efficiently prepared by a one-step carbonization method in the existence of NH4Cl and citric acid. Benefiting from the honeycomb-like architectures and the synergistic effects of the FeCo alloy with the doped-carbon matrix, the as-synthesized FeCo@N-HC exhibited outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the more positive onset potential (Eonset = 0.98 V vs. RHE) and half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.85 V vs. RHE), coupled with outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the lower overpotential (318 mV) at 10 mA cm-2. Besides, the home-made Zn-air battery has the larger power density of 144 mW cm-2 than Pt/C + RuO2 (80 mW cm-2). This research offers some valuable guidelines for constructing robust oxygen catalysts in clean energy storage and conversion technologies. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, we demonstrate a facile approach for the synthesis of bamboo-like nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube-encapsulated Co0.25Ni0.75 alloy electrocatalyst (Co0.25Ni0.75@NCNT) and its bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. The Co0.25Ni0.75 alloy wrapped with NCNT is obtained by a one-step carbothermal reduction approach using dicyandiamide and NiCo-MOF precursors. Dicyandiamide acts as a nitrogen source, and the in situ generated Co(0.2)5Ni(0.75) alloy nanoparticles catalyze the growth of bamboo-like NCNTs. The hollow NiCo-MOF plays a sacrificial role in providing a suitable environment for the controlled growth of Co0.25Ni0.75 alloy and NCNT. Co0.25Ni0.75@NCNT efficiently catalyzes both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a favorable overpotential. It shows a low potential gap (Delta E) of similar to 0.8 V between the two reactions, and it qualifies for the development of air cathode in metal-air batteries. The enhanced bifunctional activity and excellent durability stem from the chemical composition and the synergistic effect between Co0.25Ni0.75 alloy and encapsulating NCNT. The original phase and morphology of the catalyst is preserved after an extensive durability test. Aqueous rechargeable Zn-air battery (ZAB) is fabricated using a Co0.25Ni0.75@NCNT-based air cathode. The battery has high open-circuit voltage (1.53 V) and a maximum peak power density of 167 mW cm(-2) with only 1.6% loss in the voltaic efficiency after 36 h charge-discharge cycles. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, the as-fabricated ZAB is successfully used for the electrochemical water splitting in alkaline solution.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000672492800021	34157833	
J	Evdokimov, SV								Specific features of the oxygen-evolution kinetics on porous anodes								RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMISTRY				33	1			6	14						JAN 1997	1997	The kinetics of oxygen evolution on porous anodes is analyzed theoretically. It is shown that the presence of diffusion limitations on the removal of hydrogen ions from the pores can double the Tafel slope of polarization curves of oxygen evolution and substantially decrease the absolute value of the reaction order with respect to H+ ions. In this case, in the ascending curve corresponding to the dependence of the process rate on electrode thickness, a transition from the linear segment to the segment of independence of current density on thickness can be observed. The conclusions of the theory are compared with experimental data.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1023-1935			WOS:A1997WG72200002

Here, we show a dealloying strategy to synthesize free -standing 3D, oxide skinned nanoporous Ir electrocatalysts (np-Ir) with demonstrated enhanced activity and durability in comparison to more traditional IrOx nanoparticulate catalysts. The metallic core and absence of any binder/support result in low electrode and charge transfer resistance, ultimately giving rise to lower OER overpotentials and improved activity.

However, one of the major problems for these materials is limited active sites and low efficiency for OER. In this regard, a new catalyst consisting of layered serpentine Ni3Ge2O5(OH)(4) nanosheets is introduced via a controlled one-step synthetic process where the morphology, size, and layers are well tailored. The theoretical calculations indicate that decreased layers and increased exposure of (100) facets in serpentine Ni3Ge2O5(OH)(4) lead to much lower Gibbs free energy in adsorption of reactive intermediates. Experimentally, it is found that the reduction in number of layers with minimized particle size exhibits plenty of highly surface-active sites of (100) facets and demonstrates a much enhanced performance in OER than the corresponding multilayered nanosheets. Such a strategy of tailoring active sites of serpentine Ni3Ge2O5(OH)(4) nanosheets offers an effective method to design highly efficient electrocatalysts.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000451566800013	30328265

Herein, we report a highly efficient "bandgap matching and interfacial coupling" strategy to synthesize nano-assembled ultrathin layered MoS2@NiFe2O4 (MS@NiFeO) bifunctional catalyst constructed by the hydrothermal route and subsequently amine-hydrolysis. The OER performance of the prepared MS@NiFeO catalyst delivers a low overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and Tafel slope is 69.2 mV dec(-1) in an alkaline solution. In addition, the nano-assembled ultrathin layered structure of MS@NiFeO showed a highly efficient (96.37%) RhB dye degradation performance than that of MoS2 nanosheets and NiFe2O4 nanostructures. Unique nanostructure of ultrathin layered MS@NiFeO with suitable band matching, interfacial charge transfer, high surface area and more active sites favored for the enhancement of the catalytic activity.

Herein, we combined the Ru-doping of NiCo2O4 spinel (NCO) and the surface modification with Ru nanoparticles through rational design and controllable fabrication (NCRO) as a dual modification method to markedly enhance the overall water splitting. Benefiting from the structure advantages, the synergistic electronic effects and optimal binding strength of the reaction intermediates, the NCRO exhibited excellent performance for both hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media. The density functional theory calculations suggest that the dual modification could enhanced water dissociation ability, optimized the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates and altered the energy level of the d band center.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000783031100003

The obtained meso-CoP exhibits a relatively low overpotential (0.30 V at 10 mA cm(-2)), a decent Tafel slope (81 mV dec(-1)), and good long-term stability, performing better than its bulk counterpart and many state-of-the-art Co-based OER electrocatalysts. The high electrocatalytic performance of the meso-CoP toward OER is attributed to two key factors: (1) a large accessible active surface which endows the meso-CoP with numerous active sites for water oxidation; (2) a well-organized mesoporous structure which expedites the electron/ion transfer and mass transport, thereby significantly enhancing the OER kinetics. This work will provide guidance for designing inexpensive high-performance electrocatalysts with exquisite mesostructures for potential applications in commercial water-splitting technology.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000480667900015

Despite several decades pursuing, bifunctional oxygen catalysts with high catalytic performance at low-cost, especially the one that could be easily scaled up for mass production are still missing and highly desired. Herein, a hybrid catalyst with NiCo alloy nanoparticles decorated on N-doped carbon nanofibers is synthesized by a facile electrospinning method and postcalcination treatment. The hybrid catalyst NiCo@N-C2 exhibits outstanding ORR and OER catalytic performances, which is even surprisingly superior to the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts, respectively. The synergetic effects between alloy nanoparticles and the N-doped carbon fiber are considered as the main contributions for the excellent catalytic activities, which include decreasing the intrinsic and charge transfer resistances, increasing C=C, graphitic-N/pyridinic-N contents in the hybrid catalyst. This work opens up a new way to fabricate high-efficient, low-cost oxygen catalysts with high production.									310	19	0	0	9	0	314			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000426154500010

Hydrogen is a high energy density source with sanitary combustion products. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) becomes a critical process in the water decomposition reaction due to the slow kinetics of OER limiting electrochemical water splitting. In recent years, among many electrocatalysts, transition metal oxides have received extensive attention due to being inexpensive and showing remarkable activity and stability. Among them, Co3O4-based materials have become some of the best candidates for electrocatalysts dedicated to the oxidation of water to oxygen due to their excellent catalytic performance. The recent progress of Co3O4-based materials in the OER is summarized in detail, involving pure Co3O4, doped Co3O4 and Co3O4-based compound composites. Moreover, this review discusses the influence of strategies on the performance of electrocatalysts, such as morphological engineering, interface engineering, synthesis method and doping. At the end of this review, the obstacles, and feasible opinions of Co3O4-based materials in OER are put forward, and their future research prospects are also discussed.

However, its easily being oxidized nature and the bulk crystal structure restricts sufficient active sites, which severely hinders its potential applications in catalysis. Herein, BP nanosheets are prepared and deposited with Co(OH)(2) nanosheets to construct the Co(OH)(2)/BP interfaces. Owing to the high Fermi level of Co(OH)(2) than that of BP, the electrons are transferred initiatively from Co(OH)(2) to BP, affording remarkable oxygen evolution reaction performance with an overpotential of 276 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the potentiostatic tests present decent electrocatalytic stability of the synthesized Co(OH)(2)/BP nanosheets. It is further anticipated that engineering the interface towards manipulating the charge density on BP surface and/or interface by depositing other kind of catalysts could be a straightforward strategy to design outstanding hybrid electrocatalysts.

However, current precious metal-based electrocatalysts do not perform well across the full range of reactions and reported multifunctional catalysts are all complex hybrids. Here, we show that singlephase porous Co3Mo3N prepared via a facile method is an efficient and reliable electrocatalyst for three essential energy conversion reactions; oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solutions. Co3Mo3N presents outstanding OER, ORR, and HER activity with high durability, comparable with the commercial catalysts RuO2 for OER and Pt/C for ORR and HER. In practical demonstrations, Co3Mo3N gives high specific capacity (850 mA h g(Zn)(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2)) as the cathode in a zinc-air battery, and a low potential (1.63 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) used in a water-splitting electrolyzer. Availability of Co and Mo d-states appear to result in high ORR and HER performance, while the OER properties result from a cobalt oxide-rich activation surface layer. Our findings will inspire further development of bimetallic nitrides as cost-effective and versatile multifunctional catalysts that will enable scalable usage of electrochemical energy devices.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			2666-6758			WOS:000747238500025	34557748

However, the efficiency of water electrolysis is severely limited by the large anodic overpotential and sluggish reaction rate of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To overcome this issue, the development of efficient electrocatalyst materials for the OER has drawn much attention. Here, we show that organometallic Ni(II) complexes immobilized on the sidewalls of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) serve as highly active and stable OER electrocatalysts. This class of electrocatalyst materials is synthesized by covalent functionalization of the MWNTs with organometallic Ni bipyridine (bipy) complexes. The Ni-bipy-MWNT catalyst generates a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 310 and 290 mV in 0.1 and 1 M NaOH, respectively, with a low Tafel slope of similar to 35 mV dec(-1), placing the material among the most active OER electrocatalysts reported so far. Different simple analysis techniques have been developed in this study to characterize such a class of electrocatalyst materials. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations have been performed to predict the stable coordination complexes of Ni before and after OER measurements.									43	2	0	0	5	0	43			2155-5435			WOS:000417230500002

TiCP-PCP demonstrates efficient electrocatalytic activity toward HER/OER with prominent electrochemical durability in acid/basic medium. Surprisingly, TiCP-PCP requires relatively low overpotentials of 339 and 310 mV to reach a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively. Based on experimental and theoretical results, the improved electrocatalytic performances for TiCP-PCP in comparison with those of TPP and TiO2 are ascribed to efficient charge transfer and positive synergistic effect, stemming from the interactions between porphyrin units and Ti entities. This work can be readily extended to a wide range of porous coordination polymer-based electrochemical devices and catalysts design.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0143-7208	1873-3743		WOS:000549169800062

Thus far, numerous techniques to disperse additional catalysts on a perovskite host have been suggested to overcome this problem; however, cost-effectiveness and catalyst lifespan remain unsatisfactory. Herein, we present cobalt-based-nanoparticle-decorated Sr0.95Nb0.1Co0.7Fe0.2O3-delta (S0.95NCF) by a simple ex-solution method and use it as a novel air-electrode catalyst. We successfully implemented the socketed nanoparticles with various compositions at different reduction temperatures, achieving notably enhanced activity towards OER and ORR. More importantly, the newly designed catalyst exhibits record-high charge/discharge durability over 500 h (or 1500 consequent cycles) when used as the ZABs cathode. Our findings provide essential guidelines for designing heterostructured electrocatalysts for future energy devices, in which multifunctionality is desirable.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000809903300004

However, their intrinsically low electrical conductivity inhibits the fast kinetics for OER. To overcome this drawback, hollow carbon@NiCo2O4 core-shell microspheres (C@NiCo2O4 HSs) are synthesized with enhanced electrocatalytic activity and stability toward OER. The prepared C@NiCo2O4/Ni foam delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 268 mV and exhibits a low Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1). The enhanced OER performance is attributed to the enlarged specific surface area induced by the combination effect between the 1D nanosheet structure and the 3D hollow microsphere structure, and the improved electrical conductivity is ascribed to the carbon core support.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000466486200004

The as-obtained electrocatalysts are analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) to confirm the elemental, structural, morphological, and textural properties, respectively. The scheelite-type materials can easily regulate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) owing to the presence of oxygen vacancy and high conductivity. Therefore, the fabricated material is employed for electrochemical studies utilizing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), CV polarization curves, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and chronoamperometry (CA) in an alkaline medium and responds to low overpotential of 238.0 mV and small Tafel slope of 85.0 mV dec(-1) with the enduring stability of 20 h. In the current study, oxygen-deficient scheelite-type perovskites, such as ABO(4), appear to represent a novel class of high-performance electrocatalyst for processes involving active oxygen intermediates, like OER and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in future applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000834708300001

This is exemplified in a recent structure of the RC from an anoxygenic green sulfur bacterium (GsbRC) which has characteristics that may challenge the canonical view of RC classification. The GsbRC structure is analyzed and compared with other RCs, and the observations reveal important but unstudied research directions that are vital for disentangling RC evolution and diversity. Namely, (1) common themes of electron donation implicate a Ca2+ site whose role is unknown; (2) a previously unidentified lipid molecule with unclear functional significance is involved in the axial ligation of a cofactor in the electron transfer chain; (3) the GsbRC features surprising structural similarities with the distantly-related photosystem II; and (4) a structural basis for energy quenching in the GsbRC can be gleaned that exemplifies the importance of how exposure to oxygen has shaped the evolution of RCs. The analysis highlights these novel avenues of research that are critical for revealing evolutionary relationships that underpin the great diversity observed in extant RCs.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000668235600001	34173168

Therefore, designing a thermodynamically favorable oxidation reaction to replace OER and coupling with value-added product generation on the anode is of significance for boosting H-2 generation under low electrolysis voltage. Herein, cobalt hydroxide@hydroxysulfide nanosheets on carbon paper (Co(OH)(2)@HOS/CP) are synthesized as bifunctional electrocatalysts to facilitate H-2 production and convert methanol to valuable formate simultaneously. Benefiting from the influences/changes on the composition, surface properties, electronic structure, and chemistry of Co(OH)(2), the as-obtained electrodes exhibit very high selectivity for methanol to value-added formate oxidation (MFO) and boost electrocatalytic performance with low overpotential of 155 mV for MFO and 148 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the integrated two-electrode electrolyzer drives 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.497 V with united 100% Faradaic efficiency for anodic and cathodic reaction and continuous 20 h of operation without obvious decay. The electrocatalytic hydrogen production with the assistance of alternative oxidation by the robust electrocatalyst can be further used to realize the upgrading of other organic molecules with less energy consumption.									89	3	0	0	5	0	89			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000508911200001

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) determines the performance of overall water splitting owing to its sluggish kinetics with multielectron transfer processing. Polymeric photocatalysts have recently been developed for the OER, and substantial progress has been realized in this emerging research field. In this Review, the focus is on the photocatalytic technologies and materials of polymeric photocatalysts for the OER. Two practical systems, namely, particle suspension systems and film-based photoelectrochemical systems, form two main sections. The concept is reviewed in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics, and polymeric photocatalysts are discussed based on three key characteristics, namely, light absorption, charge separation and transfer, and surface oxidation reactions. A satisfactory OER performance by polymeric photocatalysts will eventually offer a platform to achieve overall water splitting and other advanced applications in a cost-effective, sustainable, and renewable manner using solar energy.									40	0	0	0	3	0	40			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000743989900001	35025505

An extraordinary recovery of the poisoned electrode was achieved in HClO4 solution by cycling the electrode potential between the onset potentials of the hydrogen and oxygen evolution. The extent of recovery was marked using the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as a probing reaction. Ammonium ion poisoning of the electrodes in H2SO4 caused a significant contribution of the two-electron reduction of O-2 to hydrogen peroxide, as indicated by the rotating ring-disk voltammetry. The Tafel slopes at the low and high current densities were also affected by the presence of ammonium ion in H2SO4 solution and an increase in the Tafel slope was recognized with increasing the concentration of ammonium ion. However, the Tafel slopes at the low and high current densities were hardly affected by the ammonium ion in HClO4 solution. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Meanwhile, metal-based electrocatalysts frequently appear in cathodic reactions due to their excellent electrical conductivity and catalytic performance. However, the susceptibility to oxidation of metals limits their application in anodic reactions. Herein, we successfully introduced cobalt (Co) metal as a host material to synthesize the MoO2/Co heterojunction for the electrocatalytic reaction, which can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at -48 mV for the HER and -73 mV for the HzOR. Moreover, the two-electrode overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) electrolyzer requires an extremely small cell voltage of 35 mV for 10 mA cm(-2). DFT calculations demonstrate that MoO2 and Co can simultaneously optimize the free energy of hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H*)) and the stepwise dehydrogenation process of N2H4 benefiting from the constructed heterojunction. This research designs an innovative method of developing metal-incorporated materials for the study of enhanced bifunctional electrocatalysts and improves an energy-efficient H-2 generating technology.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000839598900001

For the practical application of overall water splitting, easy-to-operate catalysts as well as catalysis of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in identical electrolyte are critical. Herein, we report a high-efficiency electrocatalyst with hierarchical Cu-3(PO4)(2)/copper metal-organic framework (Cu-3(PO4)(2) /Cu-BDC) nanosheets array supported by copper foam.

Subsequently, Cu-BDC nanosheets array are synthesized via self-directed growth. In each step of this reaction, copper ions are all released from the substrate, which is facile and controllable. The effect of reaction temperature and reaction time on the morphology of Cu-BDC was discussed in detail. The optimal electrocatalyst (Cu-3(PO4)(2)/Cu-BDC-150-6 foam) exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance for OER and HER in 1 M KOH, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotential of 241 mV and 145 mV, respectively. Using Cu-3(PO4)(2)/Cu-BDC-150-6 foams as both anode and cathode electrocatalyst in 1 M KOH, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was achieved at a low cell voltage of 1.56 V. In addition, the Cu-3(PO4)(2)/CuBDC foam showed excellent catalytic stability and thus will be promising for application in industrial overall water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

As a key half-reaction of electricity-driven water splitting, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a sluggish process due to the transfer of four protons and four electrons. Therefore, development of low-cost and robust OER electrocatalysts is of great importance for improving the efficiency of water splitting. Based on the merits of high surface area, rich pore structure, diverse composition and well-defined metal centers, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives have been widely exploited as OER electrocatalysts. Herein, the current progress on MOFs and their derivatives for OER electrolysis is summarized, highlighting the design principle, synthetic methods and performance for MOF-based materials. In addition, the structure-performance relationships of MOFs and their derivatives toward the OER are discussed, providing valuable insights into rationally developing OER catalysts with high efficiency. The current scientific and technological challenges and future perspectives towards the purpose of sustainable industrial applications are addressed at the end.									137	4	1	0	7	0	139			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000624298500013	33400745

Earth-abundant 3d transition metal-based catalysts have been developed for the OER and ORR; however, most of these are based on oxides, whose insulating nature strongly restricts their catalytic performance. This study describes a metallic Ni-Fe nitride/nitrogen-doped graphene hybrid in which 2D Ni-Fe nitride nanoplates are strongly coupled with the graphene support. Electronic structure of the Ni-Fe nitride is changed by hybridizing with the nitrogen-doped graphene. The unique heterostructure of this hybrid catalyst results in very high OER activity with the lowest onset overpotential (150 mV) reported, and good ORR activity comparable to that for commercial Pt/C. The high activity and durability of this bifunctional catalyst are also confirmed in rechargeable zinc-air batteries that are stable for 180 cycles with an overall overpotential of only 0.77 V at 10 mA(-2).									131	7	0	0	4	0	133			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000404553100008	28509363

Electrochemical experiments show this electrode affords 10 mA cm(-2) at HER overpotential of 96 mV and 20 mA cm(-2) at OER overpotential of 295 mV with strong durability in 1.0 M KOH. The corresponding two-electrode alkaline water electrolyzer requires a cell voltage of only 1.66 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) water-splitting current. This development provides us an attractive non-noble-metal catalyst toward overall water splitting applications.									203	7	0	0	5	0	207			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000371105800051	26824878

In this study, a FeCo alloy electrocatalyst with an amorphous and porous structure was designed and prepared. The electrochemical test results showed that the amorphous alloy product with a Co:Fe molar ratio of 2:1 showed an optimal intrinsic catalytic activity for oxygen evolution. At a current density of 10 mA cm(2), only a small overpotential of 290 mV was required in a KOH solution (1 mol L-1), which is much lower than that for the monometallic catalyst (428 mV for amorphous cobalt for the same current density). The bimetal composition of this catalyst induced a strong synergistic effect. Moreover, it exhibited an amorphous and porous structure with a large number of exposed active sites along with high conductivity. These factors contributed to the excellent catalytic performance of this catalyst. This study provides an insight into the design of advanced oxygen evolution reaction catalysts.

X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy characterizations indicate that the Pt nanoparticles (ca. 4.4 nm) are deposited on both internal and external sites of porous IrO2 nanoparticles. Electrochemical analyses show that the activity toward oxygen evolution reaction on Pt/porous-IrO2 catalyst is 28% (at 1.55 V) higher than that on Pt/commercial-IrO2 catalyst, and the activity towards oxygen reduction reaction on the former is 23 times (at 0.85 V) that on the latter.

Photocatalytic overall water splitting is projected as a potential technology for H2 production. However, its performance is still far from meeting the criteria for large-scale production. This paper argues that photocatalytic overall water splitting is theoretically and practically hard to achieve. The limiting factors, including unfavorable thermodynamics, slow kinetics, dissolved oxygen, and rapid backward reaction, are discussed. This paper is expected to give readers a better understanding of the photocatalytic overall water splitting and analyze the associated challenges in every subtle aspect.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2451-9294			WOS:000814058100008

Nevertheless, some fundamental applications are still dominated by traditional materials, and it is especially evident in the case of catalysis, and environmental-related electro-chemical reactions, where precious metals such as Pt and Ir are widely used. Several strategies are being explored for achieving competitive and feasible metal-free carbon nanomaterials, among which doping and defect engineering approaches within nanocarbons are recurrent and promising. Here, the most recent efforts regarding the control of doping and defects in carbon nanostructures for catalysis, and in particular for energy-related applications, are addressed.

Herein, CoAl layered double hydroxides (LDHs) hybridized with amorphous MoSx nanosheets (CoAl-MoSx-X, where X is the reduction reaction time) were synthesized in situ through a two-step procedure. Among these electrocatalysts, CoAl-MoSx-12 exhibited the highest OER performance with an overpotential of 330 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(-1) in alkaline solution. The underlying mechanism revealed that the density and the thickness of the MoSx nanosheets on CoAl LDHs both play key roles in the enhanced OER activity by offering more exposed active sites and accelerated electron transfer. In addition, the in situ growth provides an intimate contact between MoSx and the CoAl LDHs which is responsible for the relatively long-lasting stability of the electrocatalyst. This strategy adds to the methods available for the synthesis of LDH-supported materials as electrocatalysts with enhanced activity for renewable energy storage and conversion.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000510855700018

Herein, Fe-V co-doping Ni3S2-based oblate-nanorod arrays electrocatalysts supported by nickel foam (FV-Ni3S2/NF) have been successfully synthesized through hydrothermal technique. An increase in electrochemically active surface area and a decrease in charge-transfer resistance by the synergistic incorporation of Fe and V as well as the presence of alpha-Ni(OH)(2) and gamma-FeOOH on the surface of the catalysts effectively accelerate the OER kinetic process, and display an enhanced OER activity and stability in the alkaline media, resulting in a considerable improved overpotential of 259 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 22.38 mV dec(-1), far su-perior to pure NF, Ni3S2/NF, V-Ni3S2/NF, Fe-Ni3S2/NF and IrO2. Furthermore, i-t stability test after 50 h of FV-Ni3S2/NF indicates that the current density drop ratio is only 1.3 %, exhibiting excellent electrocatalytic stability. Thus, our studies provide a new strategy of designing cost-effective and high-performance catalysts through the introduction of double heteroatoms and interface/surface synergistic regulating engineering.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000862591700001

Recently, it was demonstrated that thiolate (SR)-protected gold clusters, Au-n(SR)(m), and their related alloy clusters can serve as model catalysts for these three reactions. However, as the previous data have been obtained under different experimental conditions, it is difficult to use them to gain a deep understanding of the means to attain higher activity in these reactions. Herein, we measured the HER, OER, and ORR activities of Aun(SR) m and alloy clusters containing different numbers of constituent atoms, ligand functional groups, and hetero-atom species under identical experimental conditions. We obtained a comprehensive set of results that illustrates the effect of each parameter on the activities of the three reactions. Comparison of the series of results revealed that decreasing the number of constituent atoms in the cluster, decreasing the thickness of the ligand layer, and substituting Au with Pd improve the activities in all reactions. Taking the stability of the cluster into consideration, [Au24Pd(PET)(18)](0) (PET = 2-phenylethanethiolate) can be considered as a metal cluster with high potential as an HER, OER, and ORR catalyst. These findings are expected to provide clear design guidelines for the development of highly active HER, OER, and ORR catalysts using Aun(SR) m and related alloy clusters, which would allow realization of an ultimate energy conversion system.									51	1	0	0	2	0	52			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000536643200050	32167113

These doped surfaces have been analysed systematically by DFT calculations, scrutinising their underlying electronic- and nuclear-structure characteristics and thermodynamic-energetics profiles, to assess their OER viability, including consideration and comparison of charge-density effects for the transition-metal dopants. In particular, all of the reaction steps for the overall OER reaction schemes have been explored on all possible surface reaction sites, and the energy profile and associated free-energy-change effects have been computed and discussed.

At the established MOR-HER co-electrolytic system, when the anode and cathode are equipped with PdIn bimetallene, the required cell voltage only is 1.26 V to achieve the current density of 100 mA cm(-2), which is 0.93 V lower than that of traditional water electrolysis. This work reports a defect-rich crimped perforated PdIn bimetallene catalyst, as an effective bifunctional catalyst that provides insight for the advancement of energy-saving and promising hydrogen production engineering.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000777587400003

In this work, the self-supported Zn-doped CoNiP (Zn-CoNiP/NF) hierarchical structure that consisted of nanothorns and radial microspheres were prepared with via a facile precursor phosphorization method. Zn-doping could tailor the initial electronic state of CoNiP to improve the hydrogen or oxygen atom binding, which effectively promoted the catalytic kinetics of water splitting. The hierarchical structure not only offered more catalytic active sites for water splitting, but also facilitated gas releasing due to the superaerophobic interface. The hierarchical Zn-CoNiP structure showed a high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiency in electrolytes with pH 0-14, which yielded low overpotentials of 73 mV in acidic solution and 34 mV in alkaline media at current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, it also had evidenced by an overpotential of 310 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the current density of 50 mA cm(-2). Note that the required cell initial voltage was 1.51 V for overall water splitting. These results were comparable or even better than many non-noble catalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Electrodes were obtained by template electrosynthesis at room temperature. The electrolyte composition was tuned in order to obtain different NiCo alloys. The chemical and morphological features of nanostructured electrodes were evaluated by EDS, XRD and SEM analyses. Results show that electrodes with different composition of Ni and Co, made of nanowires well anchored to the substrate, were obtained. For both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, electrochemical and electrocatalytic tests, performed in 30% w/w KOH aqueous solution, were carried out to establishing the best alloy composition. Mid-term tests conducted at a constant current density were also reported. Nanostructured electrodes with a Co atomic composition of 94.73% have the best performances for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. In particular, with this alloy, a potential of -0.43 V (RHE) and of 1.615 V (RHE) was measured for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction at -50 mA cm(-2) and at 50 mA cm(-2), respectively, after 6 h of electrolysis.

Nevertheless, it is actually not easy to achieve efficient non-metal doping in TMO. To address this issue, herein, we for the first time put forwards an oxygen vacancy (V-o) assisted doping strategy to achieve high non-metal atoms doping amount in TMO. Firstly, V-o is produced by simple acid etching treatment on pristine Co3O4, and then the obtained V-o decorated Co3O4 (Co3O4-V-o) is used as precursor to conduct P doping. By systematical characterizations and analysis, it is found that the as-formed V-o in Co3O4-V-o plays a role of doping sites, which bring about efficient P doping effect. Even at relatively low temperature, the as-prepared P-doped Co3O4-V-o (P-Co3O4-V-o) is evidenced to display a high P doping amount of 6.1 wt%, which is much higher than that (1.9 wt%) of directly P-doped Co3O4 (P-Co3O4). Consequently, P-doped Co3O4-V-o shows significantly enhanced activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Clearly, this work opens a new avenue to efficiently doping non-metal atoms into TMO.

In this work, a novel approach for the synthesis of self-supported carbon coated molybdenum oxide catalyst is reported. An in-situ polymerization strategy is introduced to construct the conductive polypyrrole (PPy) growing on carbon cloth (CC). Subsequently, Mo-O nanoparticles are formed and embedded into the carbon scaffold to form the self-supported oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst on CC with no binders. Further, introducing the metal Ni led to a positive synergistic effect and the Mo-Ni-based bimetallic oxide exhibited an extremely low overpotential of similar to 320 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than the values of most reported transition-metal-based electrocatalysts for OER. Such excellent OER activity is attributed to the well-dispersed and abundant Mo-Ni-O nanoparticles (NPs) on CC and synergistic contribution of Mo-Ni electron density redistribution and excellent electron transfer efficiency between active species and substrate.					18th Chinese National Congress on Catalysis-Energy Session (NCC_Energy)18th Chinese National Congress on Catalysis-Energy Session (NCC_Energy)	OCT 16-20, 2017OCT 16-20, 2017	Catalysis Soc China; Tianjin UnivCatalysis Soc China; Tianjin Univ	Tianjin, PEOPLES R CHINATianjin, PEOPLES R CHINA	8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000463476300031

However, the preparation of highly active and durable bifunctional catalysts is still challenging. Herein, an efficient catalyst is reported consisting of FeCo nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon nanotubes (FeCo NPs-N-CNTs) by an in situ catalytic strategy. Due to the encapsulation and porous structure of N-doped carbon nanotubes, the catalyst shows high activity toward ORR and excellent durability. Furthermore, to enhance the OER activity, CoFe-layer double hydroxide (CoFe-LDH) is coupled with FeCo NPs-N-CNTs by in situ reaction approach. As the air electrode for rechargeable ZABs, the cell with CoFe-LDH@FeCo NPs-N-CNTs catalyst exhibits high open-circuit potential (OCP) of 1.51 V, high power density of 116 mW cm(-2), and remarkable durability up to 100 h, demonstrating its great promise for the practical application of the rechargeable ZABs.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000697885700001	34553487

In this work, we report a facile and cost-effective method for the synthesis of 3D hierarchical structures of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT)/CuO catalyst. It is prepared by urea assisted chemical co-precipitation method. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) and Field Emission Transmission Electron Microscopy (FE-TEM) are used to analyze the morphology of MWCNT/CuO nanostructures. The elemental analyses of nanostructures are determined by FESEM-EDS, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The as-prepared MWCNT/CuO is tested as an electrocatalyst for OER. The MWCNT/CuO catalyst exhibits a lower onset potential of 1.55 V vs RHE as compared to Cu(OH)(2) (1.57 V) and MWCNT/Cu(OH)(2) (1.65 V). Moreover, the catalyst has shown the lower Tafel slope value of 59.9 mVdec(-1) in comparison with Cu(OH)(2) 78.9 mVdec(-1) and MWCNT/Cu(OH)(2) 127.9 mVdec(-1).

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), the typical non-precious metal-based catalyst, have drawn significant attentions in electrochemical OER, whereas their low catalytic performance and cumbersome synthesis route seriously prohibit the scalable applications in OER. In this study, a facile and economical strategy (namely, the simple one-step pyrolysis of Fe(C5H5)2) was dedicatedly exploited for successfully producing CNTs encapsulated with Fe3C nanoparticles (NPs). It is found that encapsulated Fe3C NPs significantly enhance the alkaline OER activity and the stability of CNTs. Our experimental investigations indicate the active sites of this Fe3C@CNTs electrocatalyst for OER are the oxygen-containing functional groups bonding to the surface of CNTs. The interaction between Fe3C NPs and CNTs boosts the OER activity and the stability of CNTs. In sum, the simple and low-cost synthetic strategy of Fe3C@CNTs combined with its excellent catalytic performances prompts it promising for future practical OER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0925-9635	1879-0062		WOS:000696986900005

Herein, nitrogen-doped carbon encapsulated CoOx-MoC heterostructures are reported for the first time as high performance oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. The composition can be tuned by the addition of a Mo source to form a nanowire-assembled hierarchically porous microstructure, which can enlarge the specific surface area, thus exposing more active sites, facilitating mass transport and charge transfer. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the formation of CoOx-MoC heterostructures and the resulting synergistic effect between MoC and Co facilitate the reaction kinetics, leading to significantly improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an onset overpotential of merely 290 mV, and a low overpotential of 330 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The well-constructed microarchitecture contributes to superior long term stability electrochemical behaviors.

Herein, a novel ternary spinel CoIn2Se4 nanomaterial, with Co2+ and In3+ occupying the tetrahedral and octahedral sites of the crystalline structure, has been fabricated using a facile and environment-friendly method. Moreover, CoIn2Se4 nanosheets outperform pristine CoSe2 and In2Se3 in catalyzing both oxygen evolution reaction (an over-potential of 315 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and oxygen reduction reaction (an onset overpotential of 0.88 V). The reduced charge resistance and increased active site exposure ratio contribute to the superior performance of CoIn2Se4. Moreover, density of theory (density functional theory-DFT) calculations suggest a significantly reduced reaction energy barrier after introducing indium into the spinel, and therefore the reaction kinetics are facilitated. Based on the advantages described above, CoIn2Se4 is used as the air cathode for a solid flexible zinc-air battery (FZAB). The system displays an efficient performance that outperforms the Pt@Ir/C catalyst: a significantly enhanced specific capacity of 733 mAh g(zn)(-1), a high energy density of 931 Wh kg(-1), and an excellent flexibility with long cycle life performance (over 400 cycles). The CoIn2Se4 basedtwo-series-connected FZABs successfully power light-emitting diode (LED) screens for over 10 h. Meanwhile, CoIn2Se4 also shows a significantly enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance than other samples. Finally, the CoIn2Se4-based electrolyzer shows an efficient overall water-splitting performance with high stability. This work demonstrates that the indium-based ternary selenides show promising applications in developing renewable energy and water-splitting devices.									24	2	0	0	0	0	24			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000515214300026	31939657

Furthermore, the FeCoNiSx/NF acted as the anode towards overall water electrolysis with acceptable results, where commercial Pt/C dropped on the NF worked as the cathode. This study provides some valuable insights for rational construction of nonprecious electrocatalysts in electrochemical energy technologies. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Here we apply a combination of low-temperature X-ray absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved in situ X-ray absorption spectroelectrochemistry to analyze the structure and electrochemical properties of a series of disordered iron-cobalt oxides. We identify a composition-dependent distribution of di-mu-oxo bridged cobalt-cobalt, di-mu-oxo bridged cobalt-iron and corner-sharing cobalt structural motifs in the composition series. Comparison of the structural model with (spectro) electrochemical data reveals relationships across the composition series that enable unprecedented assignment of voltammetric redox processes to specific structural motifs. We confirm that oxygen evolution occurs at two distinct reaction sites, di-mu-oxo bridged cobalt-cobalt and di-mu-oxo bridged iron-cobalt sites, and identify direct and indirect modesof- action for iron ions in the mixed-metal compositions.									103	3	0	0	7	0	103			2041-1723			WOS:000417467700001	29222428

Herein, we report an economical method for the synthesis of WS2/Co9S8 core-shell nanoparticles arrayed on hollow-porous carbon fiber (WxCoyS@HCF) via simple electro-spinning method and followed by calcination. The WxCoyS@HCF catalysts exhibited pronounced electrocatalytic activity and remarkable stability in electrolyte solution. The excellent electrocatalytic activities can be attributed to the best synergetic effect of appropriate molar ratio of WS2 and Co9S8 as well as the hollow-porous structure can provide more potential implantation sites.

Recently, several theories have been developed to understand the reaction mechanism for OER, though there is an uncertainty in most of the cases, due to the complex surface structures. Several key factors such as lattice oxygen, defect, electronic structure, oxidation state, hydroxyl group and conductivity were identified and shown to be important to the OER activity. The contribution of each factor to the performance however is often not well understood, limiting their impact in guiding the design of OER electrocatalysts. In this work, we showed mixed B-site pyrochlore Y2MnRuO7 catalyst exhibits 14 times higher turnover frequency (TOF) than RuO2 while maintaining a low overpotential of similar to 300 mV for the entire testing period of 24 h in acidic electrolyte. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis reveals that this B-site mixed pyrochlore Y2MnRuO7 has a higher oxidation state of Ru than those of Y2Ru2O7, which could be crucial for improving OER performance as the broadened and lowered Ru 4d band resulted from the B-site substitution by Mn is beneficial to the OER kinetics.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-5404			WOS:000797543000001	35583677

Herein, high utilization of doped atoms is successfully achieved in Fe-doped 2D amorphous Zr(HPO4)(2) nanosheets (amorphous Fe-ZrP). Due to the unique amorphous surface with a large scale of coordinated unsaturated sites, a great quantity of Fe dopants with tunable electron density can anchor on the surface of the 2D amorphous Fe-ZrP nanosheet. Benefitting from the ultrathin 2D structure and abundant Fe active sites on the amorphous surface, 2D amorphous Fe-ZrP nanosheets exhibit outstanding OER activity, which is significantly superior to most OER electrocatalysts. This work offers new insights to promote doped atom utilization via amorphous doping for superb water splitting electrocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-7350			WOS:000783667400001

Mixed transition metals could provide promising synergistic electrochemical properties and serve as bi-catalyst for overall water splitting process. In this study, a needle grass array of nanostructured nickel cobalt sulfide (NiCo2S4) was synthesized using a hydrothermal process. The synthesized NiCo2S4 electrodes showed promising electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 148 mV and 293 mV for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively. The electrolyzer cell consisting of two NiCo2S4 electrodes displayed excellent performance with high electrochemical stability and low overall cell potential of 1.61 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). Our study suggests that mixed transition metal chalcogenides such as NiCo2S4 could be used as efficient and stable electrocatalyst for overall water splitting process.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0257-8972			WOS:000447475100033

Herein, we circumvent this challenge by adopting alternative hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) as the anodic half-reaction, integrated with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for sustainable hydrogen production. To this end, we further developed a PtCo alloy nanosheets electrocatalyst that can efficiently catalyze both the HzOR and HER with ultralow potentials. Specifically, the overall hydrazine splitting driven by the PtCo alloy requires only 0.28 V at 10 mA cm(-2) along with outstanding stability of more than 3000 h. We further proposed a PEM hydrazine electrolyzer (PEMHE) design to promote the practical application. The device can not only produce hydrogen with a high yield rate of 1.87 mmol h(-1) cm(-2) at a practical current density of 100 mA cm(-2) with a long durability of 60 h, but also effectively decontaminate hydrazine sewage with the hydrazine removal efficiency up to 100%. Our work provides a new solution to simultaneous mass hydrogen fuel production and hydrazine hazard removal from acidic waste water at minimized energy consumption.

However, the oxygen reduction and evolution reaction mechanism is yet to be conclusively determined. In order to examine the part played by surface structure in sodium-oxygen electrochemistry for the development of catalytic materials and structures, a method of preparing clean, well-defined Pt electrode surfaces for adsorption studies in aprotic solvents is described. Using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and in situ electrochemical shell-isolated nanoparticle enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS), the various stages of oxygen reduction as a function of potential have been determined. It is found that on Pt{111} and Pt{110}-(1 x 1) terraces, a long lived surface sodium peroxide species is formed reversibly, whereas on Pt{100} and polycrystalline electrodes, this species is not detected.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000461509800008	30996874

However, the role of chalcogen is not fully elucidated after oxidation and severe leaching. Here we present the vital promotion of surface-adsorbed chalcogenates on the OER activity. Taking NiSe(2)as an example, in situ Raman spectroscopy revealed the oxidation of Se-Se to selenites (SeO32-) then to selenates (SeO42-). Combining the severe Se leaching and the strong signal of selenates, it is assumed that the selenates are rich on the surface and play significant roles. As expected, adding selenites to the electrolyte of Ni(OH)(2)dramatically enhance its OER activity. And sulfates also exhibit the similar effect, suggesting the promotion of surface-adsorbed chalcogenates on OER is universal. Our findings offer unique insight into the transformation mechanism of materials during electrolysis.									105	6	0	0	7	0	107			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000574847400001	32897620

A method for continuously and automatically measuring carbon dioxide evolution can be retrofitted to commercial respirometers. Continuous and automatic measurements of carbon dioxide evolution are achieved by measuring the change in electrical conductivity of barium hydroxide solution. Continuous stirring of the barium hydroxide solution was necessary to prevent the carbon dioxide absorption from controlling the oxygen uptake rate. Three separate experiments (aqueous biodegradation of phenol, soil slurry biotreatment of soil contaminated with phenol, and aqueous biodegradation of crude oil) were conducted to test the oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide evolution measurement system. The respiratory quotient, defined as the ratio of carbon dioxide evolution to oxygen uptake, is close to one until a plateau of oxygen uptake is reached, after which it is greater than one due to degradation of biomass and metabolite products. Unsteady-state simulation of CO2 evolution in batch reactors, based on the experimental data, showed that carbon dioxide exists primarily as bicarbonate in the liquid phase. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the gas phase is small mainly due to fast reaction with the stirred barium hydroxide solution.									21	0	0	0	18	1	22			1061-4303			WOS:A1997WD06900010

However, it usually suffers from sluggish kinetics, which greatly hinders its real application. Here, we demonstrate the utilization of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Au nanorods (AuNRs) to significantly improve the electroactivity of both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at Co-MOF nanosheets (Co-MOFNs) under different polarizations. Theoretical calculations suggest that the HER enhancement can be largely attributed to the injection of hot electrons from plasmonic AuNRs to Co-MOFN catalysts, which upraises the Fermi level of Co-MOFNs, increasing their reductive activity towards the HER. Regarding the promotion of the OER, it is indicated that the formed holes in Co-MOFNs should majorly locate on the surface oxygen atoms, which may also serve as active positions working jointly with neighboring Co atoms in oxidizing OH-. The plasmon enhanced HER and OER electrocatalysis could also be observed over AuNR/Ni-MOFN and AuNR/NiCo-MOFN catalysts, suggesting the generality of this strategy. This study highlights the possibility of accelerating both the HER and OER efficiency by AuNR plasmonic excitation and provides a new route towards the design of more efficient water splitting systems with the assistance of light energy.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000563481700011	32789321

In this work, non-noble-metal bifunctional catalysts with single Ni atoms, single Fe atoms, and NiFe nanoalloys supported on carbon nanotubes (NiSAFeSA-NixFe/CNT) are rationally designed and fabricated. In 1 M KOH, the optimized NiSAFeSA-Ni50Fe/CNT catalyst affords low overpotentials of 64 and 227 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for catalyzing the HER and OER, respectively. Moreover, the catalyst enables the overall water splitting at a low cell voltage of 1.49 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. At a cell voltage of 1.80 V, the current density is as high as 382 mA cm(-2), which surpasses those of most materials reported so far. After a simple two-step oxidation and rereduction procedure, the catalytic performances of the OER, HER, and overall water splitting recover completely to their original levels. This work not only provides a potential catalyst candidate for economically realizing water splitting but also shows a method for reactivatable catalyst design.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000742120900001

In this work, CoFe2O4 nanoparticles with sub-44 nm-size of a inverse spinel structure for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were synthesized by the injection of KNO3 and NaOH solution to a preheated CoSO4 and Fe(NO3)(3) solution. The synthesis time of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles was controlled to control particle and crystallite size. When the synthesis time was 6 h, CoFe2O4 nanoparticles had high conductivity and electrochemical surface area. The overpotential at current denstiy of 10 mA/cm(2) and Tafel slope of CoFe2O4 (6h) were 395 mV and 52 mV/dec, respectively.

Previous studies have suggested that the larger overpotential for MnO2 catalysts under neutral conditions may result from the instability of the Mn3+ intermediate to charge disproportionation. Here, by monitoring the surface intermediates of electrochemical OER on rutile MnO2 with different facet orientations, a correlation between the stability of the intermediate species and crystal facets is confirmed explicitly for the first time. The coverage of the Mn3+ intermediate is found to be 11-fold higher on the metastable (101) surfaces compared to (110) surfaces, leading to the superior OER activity of (101) surfaces. The difference in OER activity may result from the difference in surface electronic states of Mn3+, where interlayer charge comproportionation of Mn2+ and Mn4+ to generate two Mn3+ species is favored on (101) facets. Considering the fact that the OER enzyme accommodates Mn3+ stably during the Kok cycle, the enhanced OER activity of the rutile MnO2 catalyst with a metastable surface highlights the importance of mimicking not only the crystal structure but also the electronic structure of the targeted natural enzyme.									32	1	0	0	1	0	32			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000434946700016

In this work, a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst is prepared by depositing 3-5 nm NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanoparticles on Co,N-codoped carbon nanoframes (Co,N-CNF). The NiFe-LDH/Co,N-CNF electrocatalyst displayed an OER overpotential of 0.312 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and an ORR half-wave potential of 0.790 V. The outstanding performance of the electrocatalyst is attributable to the high electrical conductivity and excellent ORR activity of Co,N-CNF, together with the strong anchoring of 3-5 nm NiFe-LDH nanoparticles, which preserves active sites. Inspired by the excellent OER and ORR performance of NiFe-LDH/Co,N-CNF, a prototype rechargeable zinc-air battery is developed. The battery exhibited a low discharge-charge voltage gap (1.0 V at 25 mA cm(-2)) and long-term cycling durability (over 80 h), and superior overall performance to a counterpart battery constructed using a mixture of IrO2 and Pt/C as the cathode. The strategy developed here can easily be adapted to synthesize other bifunctional CNF-based hybrid electrodes for ORR and OER, providing a practical route to more efficient rechargeable zinc-air batteries.									342	26	0	0	15	0	344			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000414711100005

With Fe3+ ions as both dopant and morphology-controlling agent, Fe-doped NiS2 microcrystals with the exposed chemically stable {001} facets were synthesized hydrothermally for electrocatalytic OER. The initial electrocatalytic OER activation processes led to the conversion of iron-rich surface layers of the NiS2 microcrystals into Fe-doped Ni (oxy)hydroxide as the shell and the residual inner of the NiS2 microcrystals as the core. Such Fe-doped NiS2 microcrystals with the derived core/shell structure only required a small OER overpotential of 277 mV to reach an electrochemical current density of 10 mA/cm(2) , and showed a good stability in a more than 20 h duration test almost without overpotential increase.

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered good candidate carbon materials because their structures can be precisely controlled. However, it remains a challenge to impart bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for both the ORR and OER to COFs. Herein, a pyridine-linked triazine covalent organic framework (PTCOF) with well-defined active sites and pores is readily prepared under mild conditions, and its electronic structure is modulated by incorporating Co nanoparticles (CoNP-PTCOF) to induce bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for the ORR and OER. The CoNP-PTCOF exhibits lower overpotentials for both ORR and OER with outstanding stability. Computational simulations find that the p-band center of CoNP-PTCOF down-shifted by charge transfer, compared to pristine PTCOF, facilitate the adsorption and desorption of oxygen intermediates on the pyridinic carbon active sites during the reactions. The Zn-air battery assembled with bifunctional CoNP-PTCOF exhibits a small voltage gap of 0.83 V and superior durability for 720 cycles as compared with a battery containing commercial Pt/C and RuO2. This strategy for modulating COF electrocatalytic activities can be extended for designing diverse carbon electrocatalysts.									27	5	0	0	0	0	28			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000638677100001

The composition and structure of Ni/NiCo2O4 were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Electrocatalytic properties of the Ni/NiCo2O4 electrode in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were studied in 5 mol.L-1 KOH solution, using cyclic voltammertry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), chronoamperometry, and extended duration constant potential electrolysis. The Ni/NiCo2O4 electrode exhibited a lower OER overpotential, higher specific surface area, and better stability than a porous Ni electrode. The specific surface area of the Ni/NiCo2O4 electrode was 28.69 times greater than that of the porous Ni electrode, and its apparent activation energies decrease 166.78 and 162.15 kJ.mol(-1) at different overpotentials, respectively.									3	3	0	0	0	0	4			1000-6818			WOS:000319265500013

The electrode comprises needle shaped maghemite nanorods firmly anchored to nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes, which in turn are grown on a conducting carbon paper that acts as efficient current collector. In 0.1 M KOH this hybrid electrode reaches a current density of 1 mA/cm(2) (geometric surface) at an overpotential of 362 mV performing high chronoamperometric stability. The electrochemical attributes point toward efficient catalytic processes at the surface of the maghemite nanorods, and demonstrate a very high surface area of the 3D electrode, as well as a firm anchoring of each active component enabling an efficient charge transport from the surface of the maghemite rods to the carbon paper current collector. The latter property also explains the good stability of our hybrid electrode compared to transition metal oxides deposited on conducting support such as fluorine doped tin oxide. These results introduce maghemite as efficient, stable and earth abundant oxygen evolution reaction catalyst, and provide insight into key issues for obtaining practical electrodes for oxygen evolution reaction, which are compatible with large scale production processes.

These catalysts had a low loading of Ir (<6 wt%), while also inducing atom coordination to the Ir center. The morphology and chemical composition of these electrocatalysts were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which all showed a uniform dispersion of Ir and heteroatom-doped moieties. To assess electrocatalytic activity, we used an artificial electrolyte comprising 0.1 M HClO4+3.5 wt% NaCl, and found that these catalysts delivered a low overpotential of 243 mV, a low Tafel slope (92 mV dec(-1)), and a high exchange current density (1.4 mA cm(-2)). By using a headspace chlorine gas (Cl-2) detectorin situ, we discovered that a Cl(2)content of 27 ppm was present. When tested in synthetic seawater, the overpotential exhibited a two-fold increase, yet Cl(2)was undetected, thus indicating favorable OER kinetics. This significant finding exemplifies the need forin situCl(2)detection for seawater splitting research, since further insight can be derived to help guide the design of novel electrocatalysts.									12	1	0	0	2	0	13			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000551229000001

Direct Z-scheme photocatalysts offer competitive advantages that are superior to single-component or intensively studied heterojunction photocatalysts in photocatalytic water splitting. The development of high-performance direct Z-scheme photocatalysts is crucial to improving solar-driven water splitting efficiency. Herein, we report the fabrication of a novel g-C3N4/MoS2/Ag3PO4 ternary composite and its application in photocatalytic oxygen evolution under white light LED illumination. As-exfoliated, highly conductive two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide (2D MoS2) nanoflakes and modified graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets were employed simultaneously to couple with oxygen-evolving silver orthophosphate (Ag3PO4), forming a dual direct Z-scheme g-C3N4/MoS2/Ag3PO4 (CMA) composite photocatalytic system for highly improved oxygen evolution from water splitting. The optimal CAM-20 exhibits the fastest oxygen-producing rate of 232.1 mu mol L-1 g(-1) h(-1), which is 5 times higher than that of bulk Ag3PO4. The enhancement in the photocatalytic oxygen evolution can be ascribed to synergistic effects of improved visible light absorption, more efficient separation of photoexcited electron-hole pairs and a specific charge transfer pathway of tandem dual direct Z-scheme configuration under light illumination. This work paves the way for the construction of direct Z-scheme composite photocatalytic systems in water splitting.					3rd International Symposium on Energy and Environmental Photocatalytic Materials (EEPM3)3rd International Symposium on Energy and Environmental Photocatalytic Materials (EEPM3)	MAY 15-19, 2018MAY 15-19, 2018		Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Chem, Krakow, POLANDJagiellonian Univ, Fac Chem, Krakow, POLAND	117	9	0	0	10	0	119			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000452782100002

The resultant material maintains its inner laminate structure with increased interlayer spacing. FT-IR spectroscopic studies and powder XRD analysis revealed the successful intercalation of SDS into the interlayers of alpha-cobalt hydroxides. TEM and N(2)sorption studies further demonstrate the intercalation of organic surfactant in the interlayer spacing of CoHT. XPS studies indicated the presence of surface exposed cobalt in both Co(2+)and Co(3+)oxidation states. Furthermore, the applicability of these intercalated materials in electrocatalytic applications specifically for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium is explored. Among the various investigated materials, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) intercalated material exhibited better performance in terms of higher catalytic current at a lower overpotential value. Moreover, the kinetic parameters associated with electrocatalysis are determined, and the mechanism behind OER and ORR is elucidated. These results clearly demonstrate the potential bi-functional utility of such layered materials for electrocatalytic applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2365-6549			WOS:000563990600008

These are compared with alkaline water electrolysis as control. In black liquor electrolysis the hydrogen evolution is found to be kinetically facile with exchange current densities of 2.194 mA/cm(2), and 9.856 mA/cm(2) for wheat straw black liquor and eucalyptus black liquor, respectively, in comparison to 1.075 mA/cm(2) for alkaline water. The cathodic Tafel slopes are -112.8, -116.9, and -135.3 mV/dec for alkaline water, wheat straw black liquor, and eucalyptus black liquor, respectively. The activation overpotential for hydrogen evolution is significantly lower for black liquor electrolysis. Black liquor electrolysis shows additional anodic electroactivity in a potential window of -0.2 to 0.2 V, well shifted from the region of oxygen evolution reaction. This reaction follows a sluggish one electron oxidative charge transfer as revealed by cyclic and square wave voltammograms. The anodic charge transfer coefficient is slightly higher than 0.5. Black liquor electrolysis could produce hydrogen with a much lower inter-electrode potential with the exclusion of gaseous products being formed at the anode. This can have significant bearing on the energy efficiency of the process. (c) 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, relatively little effort has been devoted to developing a fundamental understanding of OCORs, including the detailed competition with side reactions and activity limitations, thus inhibiting the rational design of high-performance electrocatalysts. Herein, by taking the NiWO4-catalysed urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in aqueous media as an example, the competition between the OCOR and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within a wide potential range is examined. It is shown that the root of the competition can be ascribed to insufficient surface concentration of dynamic Ni3+, an active site shared by both the UOR and OER. A similar phenomenon is observed in other OCOR electrocatalysts and systems. To address the issue, a "controllable reconstruction of pseudo-crystalline bimetal oxides" design strategy is proposed to maximise the dynamic Ni3+ population and manipulate the competition between the UOR and the OER. The optimised electrocatalyst delivers best-in-class performance and an similar to 10-fold increase in current density at 1.6 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode for alkaline urea electrolysis compared to those of the pristine materials.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000777694800001

However, the present preparation methods for TMSs and TMPs are always complex and tedious. Herein, we developed a facile and effective strategy for synthesis of nitrogen (N)-doped carbon-coated TMSs or TMPs, which was realized by ball milling protic salts (p-phenylenediamine bisulfate or p-phenylenediamine biphosphate) and metal salts, followed by pyrolysis. A serious of TMSs and TMPs with well crystalline structures were obtained and witnessed by XRD analysis. Further electrocatalysis performance study in oxygen evolution reaction demonstrates that Ni-modified MoS2/NC catalyst exhibited excellent activity, showing an overpotential of 261 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slop of 53 mV dec(-1). The satisfactory performance of Ni-MoS2/NC might be derived from the synergistic effect between Ni and MoS2 that led to enhanced charge transport capability and more efficient kinetics. This work not only provides a simple and general pathway to TMSs and TMPs-based materials, but also enables excellent OER performance to be achieved.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000459333500006

Herein, a facile and efficient three-layer method is reported for the synthesis of NiCoFe-based trimetallic MOF nanosheets, which can be directly used for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline conditions. The physical characterization and morphology of trimetallic MOF nanosheets were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). By optimizing the molar ratio of Ni/Co/Fe atoms, a series of MOFs with different metal proportions were synthesized. Among them, the as-prepared (Ni(3)Co1)(3)Fe-1-MOF nanosheets can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 245 mV with a small Tafel slope of 50.9 mV dec(-1) in an alkaline electrolyte and exhibit excellent stability. More importantly, through the characterization of the intermediates in the OER process, the possible source of the catalytic active species is the electrochemically transformed metal hydroxides and oxyhydroxides.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2470-1343			WOS:000661452700001	34124419

Herein, we describe the preparation of the rod-like structure of tungsten disulphide (WS2) as efficient catalysts for OER. Exfoliated tungsten disulphide was used as a source of the rods. The reshaping process required high-temperature treatment with the assistance of hydrogen and ethylene. We propose a structure with novel morphology and promising performance as an electrocatalyst.

Defect-engineered amorphous MoO2-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanohybrid was synthesized by soft-chemical reduction of K2MoO4 in graphene oxide colloids. Mo K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy clearly demonstrates the rutile-type local atomic structure of amorphous MoO2 with significant oxygen vacancies and intimate electronic coupling with rGO. The defect-introduced MoO2-rGO nanohybrid shows excellent bifunctionality as electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction and electrode for sodium-ion batteries, which are superior to those of crystalline MoO2-rGO homologue. The beneficial effect of simultaneous defect control and rGO coupling can be ascribed to the provision of oxygen vacancies acting as active sites, the increase of electrical conductivity, and the improvement of reaction kinetics.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000707136000001	34585836

Time-resolved dissolution rates provide important insights into critical conditions for material breakdown and a fully quantitative in-situ assessment of the electrochemical stability during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions. In particular, the results demonstrate that stability and OER activity of the IrOx catalysts strongly depend on the chemical and structural nature of Ir oxide species and their synthesis conditions.

Herein, a strategy to construct bifunctional sheet-on-sheet hierarchical MoS2/NiS2 het-erostructures in-situ grown onto carbon cloth (CC) for water splitting was proposed. Benefitting from the abundant heterogeneous interfaces, rich defects, fully exposed active sites, and electronic interaction, the as-obtained optimal MoS2/NiS2/CC catalyst exhibits superior electrochemical activity and durability to-ward both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Specifically, current densities of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2) can be reached at overpotentials of 80, 142, 175 and 303, 348, 384 mV for HER and OER, respectively. More importantly, when assembled as both cathode and anode for overall water splitting, a low cell voltage of 1.63 V is required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), demonstrating that MoS2/NiS2/CC is a promising candidate for water splitting. In brief, this study provides a new approach to develop highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Excess Ni induced to form NiO and Co3O4 in La(CoNi)O3 particles. The NiO and Co3O4-doped porous La(CoNi)O3 showed high specific surface area, up to nine times of conventionally synthesized perovskite oxide, and abundant pore volume with similar structure. Extra added Ni was partially substituted for Co as B site of ABO3 perovskite structure and formed to NiO and Co3O4 which was highly dispersed in particles. Excess Ni in La(CoNi)O3 catalysts increased OER performance (259 mA/cm2 at 2.4 V) in alkaline solution, although the activities (211 mA/cm2 at 0.5 V) for ORR were not changed with the content of excess Ni. La(CoNi)O3 with excess Ni showed very stable cyclability and low capacity fading rate (0.38 & 0.07 μV/hour for ORR & OER) until 300 hours (~70 cycles) but more excess content of Ni in La(CoNi)O3 gave negative effect to cyclability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1738-7264			KJD:ART002685823

This preparation does not require energy-intensive materials preparation steps or noble metals, yet a low overpotential of 322 mV at 10.2 mA cm(-2) and a high current density of more than 300 mA cm(-2) at 1.7 V-NHE were obtained in 1 m KOH. An operando electrochemical Raman spectroscopy study confirmed the formation of cobalt oxyhydroxide species and the iron stimulated the equilibrium state between Co3+ and Co4+. The iron present in the alkali electrolyte or ink solution effectively activated the cobalt species, and most of the first row transition metals could also enhance the catalytic performance. The concept presented here is one of the simplest strategies for preparing highly active electrocatalysts and is very flexible for the replacement of cobalt by other transition metals.									43	2	0	0	7	0	43			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000460318200035	30664307

In particular, high amounts of Pr substitution of the cation ordered perovskite oxide originating from the state-of-the-art Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) electrode could be a good electrode or catalyst because of its high oxygen kinetics, electrical conductivity, oxygen capacity, and structural stability. However, even though it has many favorable intrinsic properties, the conventional high-temperature treatment for perovskite synthesis, such as solid-state reaction and combustion process, leads to the particle size increase which gives rise to the decrease in surface area and the mass activity. Therefore, we prepared mesoporous nanofibers of various cation-ordered PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2-xFexO5+delta = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2) perovskites via electrospinning. The well-controlled B-site metal ratio and large surface area (similar to 20 m(2) g(-1)) of mesoporous nanofiber result in high performance of the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction and stability in zinc-air battery.									166	8	0	0	4	0	169			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000416878100107	29049884

However, the current major barrier for their commercialization is high-cost and low durability of them at high OER potential. Here, we report a series of binder-/carbon-free and non-precious FexCo1-x/CoOOH/FeOOH (FCH-x) hybrids as a promising material to overcome these problems. On the one hand, the FexCo1-x framework can effectively enhance the electrical conductivity of FCH-x and generate fresh CoOOH/FeOOH to self-supplementary, providing an ideal platform to improve the durability of FCH-x. On the other hand, in analogy to typical alloys in OER, the composites modification and d-band tuning of FexCo1-x in this work is expected to enhance the activity of FCH-x. As a result, FCH-7 retains an excellent mass activity of similar to 11.9 A g(-1e)ven after 58 h i-t measurements. Most strikingly, compared to the pure Co, the d-band center of FCH-7 is positive shifted similar to 0.4 eV owing to the surface oxyhydroxides, which may be one reason for activity enhancement. Our demonstration of FCH-7/GC with unique properties of carbon- and binder- free, self-supplementary, self-enhancing, and d-band center balancing opens up a new avenue for developing high activity and durable OER catalysts towards practical of oxygen preparation.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000736666100005

Currently, transition metal oxides (TMOs) show huge potential as electrode materials for OER due to their low-cost, rich redox chemistry and high chemical stability. In this work, we report a facile route for uniformly coating CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) on the surface of nickel cobalt Prussian blue analogue (NiCo-PBA) derived Co3O4/NiO hollow porous nanocubes (Co3O4/ NiO HPN). The accurate control of CeO2 content on the Co3O4/ NiO HPN (Co3O4/NiO@CeO2 HPN) surface can effectively alter the surface electronic states, which tunes the ratio of Co2+/Co3+ and Ni2+/Ni3+ for creating abundant oxygen vacancies. The large surface area of hollow nanocubes derived from NiCo-PBA with porous structure offers more active sites, resulting in the great promotion of OER activity. The prepared Co3O4/ NiO@CeO2-2 HPN heterostructure exhibits remarkable OER performance with a low overpotential (290 mV at 10 mA center dot cm-2), small Tafel slope (66 mV dec-1) and excellent durability. The present method opens a new avenue to the preparation of low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts in OER.

Baring this in mind, herein, we propose a novel hierarchical nanoarchitecture of N-doped carbon nanotubes capped with carbon layer armored CoFe alloy (CoFe@NC-NT), which is facilely fabricated by spray drying and subsequent annealing process. As a bifunctional electrocatalyst, the well-designed CoFe@NC-NT shows a remarkably low overpotential of 257 mV and a half-wave potential of 0.74 V to obtain 10 mA center dot cm(-2) in OER and ORR, respectively. Meanwhile, it is also characterized by exceptional operating stability to meet practical application for Zn-air batteries. The high catalytic activity of CoFe@NC-NT is attributed to the tight contact between the highly conductive nanotubes and metal alloy nanoparticles. And the qualified stability is ascribed to the coating effect of carbon layer shell to alloy core. Given the unique structural evolution with enhanced oxygen-involved reaction activity, we believe that this work can provide an appealing innovative approach towards the directed self-assembly of functional nanostructures to realize satisfying overall performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000753898700007

Here, the effect of basal plane oxygen functional groups of GO on the adsorption of cobalt ions and their Co-N transition is investigated by tailoring the oxygen content and composition of oxygen functional groups on the basal plane of GO sheets. The tailor-made GO shows that the specific oxygen functional groups, such as hydroxyl, epoxy, and carbonyl groups, can be efficiently incorporated with formation of defected structures on the basal plane of GO sheets rather than their edge. The adsorption of cobalt ions on the GO sheets and their transition to the Co-N state are systematically investigated by XPS and XAFS analyses. Annealing temperature-controlled experiments reveal that the incorporation of nitrogen around cobalt atoms is facilitated by the increased number of oxygen functional groups on the basal plane rather than those on the edge of GO sheets, which provide energetically favorable environments for Co-N formation. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities of the resulting cobalt atom-immobilized and annealed GO (Co/GOx-T) catalysts correlate to the degree of Co-N saturation, while also demonstrating excellent HER catalytic durability.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000679291600004

Furthermore, we systematically investigate their electrocatalytic activities in overall water splitting. The SnSi monolayer can show good HER catalytic activity, while the SnGe monolayer can display remarkable OER catalytic activity. In particular, the GeSi monolayer can even exhibit excellent bifunctional HER/OER electrocatalytic activities. In addition, applying the biaxial strain or doping heteroatoms (especially P atom) can be regarded as the effective strategies to further improve the HER activities of these three 2D monolayers. The doped GeSi and SnSi systems can usually exhibit higher HER activity than the doped SnGe systems. The correlative catalytic mechanisms are also analyzed.

In this work, we have developed the MoxC-modified alloy@nitrogen-doped carbon hybrid electrocatalysts (MoxC-alloy@NC, alloy: FeCo, NiCo) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by a simple thermolysis method. Compared with FeCo@NC and NiCo@NC, the OER performances of MoxC-FeCo@NC and MoC-NiCo@NC are greatly enhanced, mainly due to the improved electrical conductivity by the introduce of MoxC. Moreover, MoxC-FeCo@NC exhibits a smaller Tafel slope (80 mV/dec) and a lower overpotential (318 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution, compared with MoC-NiCo@NC (186 mV/dec, 352 mV). In consideration of a lower BET area (6.6 m(2) g(-1)) of MoxC-FeCo@NC than those of MoC-NiCo@NC (25.4 m(2) g(-2)), the remarkable electrocatalytic activity of MoxC-FeCo@NC is mainly attributed to the presence of Mo(II) acting as the OER active species. Although Mo as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) active species is well known, Mo(II) as the OER active species has not been reported before. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Wide uncertainties exist for the earliest detection of biogenic oxygen in the geochemical record or the origin of water oxidation in ancestral lineages of the phylum Cyanobacteria. A unique trait of oxygenic photosynthesis is that the process uses a Type I reaction centre with a heterodimeric core, also known as Photosystem I, made of two distinct but homologous subunits, PsaA and PsaB. In contrast, all other known Type I reaction centres in anoxygenic phototrophs have a homodimeric core. A compelling hypothesis for the evolution of a heterodimeric Type I reaction centre is that the gene duplication that allowed the divergence of PsaA and PsaB was an adaptation to incorporate photoprotective mechanisms against the formation of reactive oxygen species, therefore occurring after the origin of water oxidation to oxygen. Here I show, using sequence comparisons and Bayesian relaxed molecular clocks that this gene duplication event may have occurred in the early Archean more than 3.4 billion years ago, long before the most recent common ancestor of crown group Cyanobacteria and the Great Oxidation Event. If the origin of water oxidation predated this gene duplication event, then that would place primordial forms of oxygenic photosynthesis at a very early stage in the evolutionary history of life.									25	0	0	0	15	0	25			2405-8440			WOS:000432033900035	29560463

Herein, we successfully lower the unoccupied d orbital energy of Ni3N to strengthen the interfacial electronic coupling by employing the strong electron pulling capability of oxygen dopants. The prepared O-Ni3N catalyst delivers an overpotential of 55 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), very close to the commercial Pt/C. Refined structural characterization indicates the oxygen incorporation can decrease the electron densities around the Ni sites. Moreover, density functional theory calculation further proves the oxygen incorporation can create more unoccupied orbitals with lower energy and superior orientation for water adsorption and dissociation. The concept of orbital-regulated interfacial electronic coupling could offer a unique approach for the rational design of hydrogen evolution catalysts and beyond.									13	4	0	0	0	0	13			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000574722300004

XPS results show that the doping of V3+ to NiCo2O4 provides an extra 16.40% percentage of oxygen vacancies (Ov) than that of V5+ doping, which can significantly modulate the OH- adsorption on NiCo2O4. EPR tests further confirm that the content of Ov in V3+ doped NiCo2O4 (V(III)-NiCo2O4) is 2.81 times higher than that in V5+ doped NiCo2O4 (V(V)-NiCo2O4). Besides, V(III)-NiCo2O4 & nbsp;shows higher molar content of Co2+ comparing to V(V)-NiCo2O4, resulting in an increased probability of forming CoOOH catalytic active sites. Electrochemical investigations show that V(III)-NiCo2O4 electrocatalyst achieves excellent OER catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 344 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and it holds superior OER stability of electrocatalysis at 100 mA cm(-2) for 50 h without significant change in electrode potential. Thus, this paper shows the importance of the valence of dopant precursor to the doped structures, and these findings pave a new sight of designing heteroatom doped electrocatalysts for OER.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The rational design of two-dimensional metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived mesoporous CoS2 nano arrays coupled with FeS2@MoS2 layers shows enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The FeS2-MoS2@CoS2-MOF nanostructure demonstrates superior electrocatalytic activity toward the HER with an overpotential of 92 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and the OER with an overpotential of 211 mV at 20 mA/cm(2). FeS2-MoS2@CoS2-MOF(+)||FeS2- MoS2@CoS2-MOF(-) delivered comparatively low cell voltages of 1.51, 1.66, and 1.78 V at current densities of 10, 50, and 100 mA/cm(2), respectively, with remarkable stability for 30 h. The prepared electrocatalyst is the most efficient compared with previously reported results owing to the abundant heterointerfaces, mesoporous nanostructures, and multimetallic active centers, and it opens up the discussion for exploring MOF-based catalysts for overall water splitting applications. This work highlights the engineering of abundant heterointerfaces for improving HER/OER performance. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Cost-effective yet efficient electrocatalysts are critical to overcome the high overpotential and sluggish kinetics of this process. The development of efficient non-precious metal catalysts is one of the crucial but very challenging steps to this end. Herein, we report a new type of non-precious metal electrocatalyst for OER by synergistically coupling layered double hydroxides (LDH) with two-dimensional (2D) MXene with high conductivity and active surface. Hierarchical FeNi-LDH/Ti3C2-MXene nanohybrids with excellent structural stability, electrical properties and interfacial junction are fabricated by ionic hetero-assembly of interconnected porous network of FeNi-LDH nanoplates on Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets. Strong interfacial interaction and electronic coupling with prominent charge-transfer between the FeNi-LDH and Ti3C2 MXene is identified, which not only improves the structural stability and electrical conductivity of the nanohybrids, but also greatly accelerates the redox process of FeNi-LDH for OER. As a result, the FeNi-LDH/Ti3C2-MXene catalyst could exhibit superior activity, reaction kinetics and durability to RuO2 and its graphene-based counterpart for OER in alkaline medium. This work may pave the way on the development of a new branch of advanced electrocatalysts for renewable energy applications.									329	38	0	0	15	0	335			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000419833900022

The fastest-known water oxidation catalyst, Ni(Fe)OxHy, usually produced through an electrochemical reconstruction of precatalysts under alkaline condition, has received substantial attention. However, the reconstruction in the reported catalysts usually leads to a limited active layer and poorly controlled Fe-activated sites. Here, we demonstrate a new electrochemistry-driven F-enabled surface-reconstruction strategy for converting the ultrathin NiFeOxFy nanosheets into an Fe-enriched Ni(Fe)OxHy phase. The activated electrocatalyst shows a low OER overpotential of 218 +/- 5 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 31 +/- 4 mV dec(-1), which is among the best for NiFe-based OER electrocatalysts. Such superior performance is caused by the effective formation of the Fe-enriched Ni(Fe)OxHy active-phase that is identified by operando Raman spectroscopy and the substantially improved surface wettability and gas-bubble-releasing behavior.									101	5	0	0	8	0	102			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000611082000066	33258608

Understanding dynamic processes at the solid-liquid interface of nickel (oxy)hydroxide is important to improve reaction kinetics and efficiencies. In this study, in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM) was used to directly investigate dynamic changes of single-layered Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets during electrochemistry measurements. Reconstruction of Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets, along with insertion of ions from the electrolyte, results in an increase of the volume by 56% and redox capacity by 300%. We also directly observe Fe cations adsorb and integrate heterogeneously into or onto the nanosheets as a function of applied potential, further increasing apparent volume. Our findings are important for the fundamental understanding of NiOxHy-based supercapacitors and oxygen-evolution catalysts, illustrating the dynamic nature of Ni-based nanostructures under electrochemical conditions.									80	2	0	0	4	0	80			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000415029000062	28991484

This discloses a dimeric structure for 1 and a polymeric infinite 1D metal-organic chain for 2. The complexes were evaluated as catalysts for the oxidation of toluene, a volatile organic compound (VOC), and for oxygen reduction and water splitting reactions. 1 exhibits a higher activity for the peroxidative conversion of toluene to oxygenated products (total yields up to 38%), whereas 2 demonstrates a superior performance for electrochemical energy conversion applications, i.e., for oxygen reduction (ORR), oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution (HER) reactions in an alkaline medium in terms of higher ORR current densities, lower Tafel slope (73 mV dec(-1)) and higher number of electrons exchanged (3.9), comparable to that of commercial Pt/C. Complex 2 also shows a better performance with lower onset potential and higher current densities for both OER and HER when studied as electrocatalyst for water splitting.

First, the term "catalyst stability" is clarified, as well as current performance targets, major catalyst degradation mechanisms, and their mitigation strategies. Suitable in situ experimental methods are then evaluated to give insight into catalyst degradation and possible pathways to tune OER catalyst stability. Finally, the importance of identifying universal figures of merit for stability is highlighted, leading to a comprehensive accelerated lifetime test that could yield comparable performance data across different laboratories and catalyst types. The aim of this Review is to help disseminate and stress the important relationships between structure, composition, and stability of OER catalysts under different operating conditions.									385	16	0	0	25	1	386			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000401326300005	27805788

Therefore, the choice of catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are critical in terms of cost when scaling up this technology. Thus, earth abundant transition metals oxides and sulfides have received significant attention as catalysts for the OER and HER, respectively. However, very few examples of actual Earth abundant materials mined from the Earth's crust have been used as electrocatalysts for these reactions. Here, we demonstrate that a raw iron ore is active for both the HER and OER under alkaline conditions, which is due to the natural abundance of the key elements of iron, nickel, and sulfur. The catalyst is stable for both reactions and can operate at 100 mA cm(-2), which is comparable to many chemically synthesised nanomaterials based on these elements. This approach may be attractive for adding value to iron ore while minimising the cost of catalyst production.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2196-0216			WOS:000477961200014

To date, limited numbers of 2D MOFs nanosheets can be obtained through top-down or bottom-up synthesis strategies. Herein, we report a 2D oxide sacrifice approach (2dOSA) to facilely synthesize ultrathin MOF-74 and BTC MOF nanosheets with a flexible combination of metal sites, which cannot be obtained through the delamination of their bulk counterparts (top-down) or the conventional solvothermal method (bottom-up). The ultrathin iron-cobalt MOF-74 nanosheets prepared are only 2.6 nm thick. The sample enriched with surface coordinatively unsaturated metal sites, exhibits a significantly higher oxygen evolution reaction reactivity than bulk FeCo MOF-74 particles and the state-of-the-art MOF catalyst. It is believed that this 2dOSA could provide a new and simple way to synthesize various ultrathin MOF nanosheets for wide applications.									135	11	0	0	10	0	136			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000480977700001	31328904

The materials were extensively characterized using a range of analytical methods; these including Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy measurements, which was accompanied by density functional theory studies, in order to elucidate the role of dopants in alpha-MnO2 structure. Electrochemical ORR and OER investigations of the as-prepared doped alpha-MnO2 nanomaterials were compared to more expensive Pt/C or RuO2 catalysts. The doped manganese oxide nanomaterials were used as bifunctional catalysts in the positive electrode of zinc air batteries (with oversized zinc metal negative electrode and limited density of discharge window) and displayed excellent performance (the overpotential was 0.77 and 0.68V for alpha-MnO2 modified with 7.6 at% Co and 9.4 at% Ru, respectively). Overall, as a result of doping, this study achieved improved bifunctional catalytic activities of metal oxide catalysts, which was comparable to more expensive alternatives.									38	0	0	0	1	0	38			2365-6549			WOS:000426765100028

In this process, a catalyst is very important to achieve a high-energy conversion efficiency for the electrolysis of water. A good catalyst for water electrolysis should exhibit high catalytic activity, good stability, low cost and good scalability. Much research has been devoted to developing efficient catalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Traditionally, it has been accepted that a material with high crystallinity is important to serve as a good catalyst for HER and/or OER. Recently, catalysts for HER and/or OER in the electrolysis of water splitting based on amorphous materials have received much interest in the scientific community owing to the abundant unsaturated active sites on the amorphous surface, which form catalytic centers for the reaction of the electrolysis of water. We summarize the recent advances of amorphous catalysts for HER, OER and overall water splitting by electrolysis and the related fundamental chemical reactions involved in the electrolysis of water. The current challenges confronting the electrolysis of water and the development of more efficient amorphous catalysts are also discussed.

Currently, the synthesis of bimetal alloy nanoparticles is an ideal strategy to improve catalytic efficiency by optimizing adsorption energy and increasing the electrical conductivity of the catalysts. In this work, we report the successful synthesis of FeNi alloy nanoparticle embedded porous nitrogen-doped carbon fibers by a facile electrospinning and carbonizing technology. The effects of different carbonization temperatures on the structure of FeNi alloy nanoparticles in carbon fibers and the electrocatalytic properties were also investigated. The as-prepared composite of carbon fibers and FeNi alloy nanoparticles exhibited a small overpotential of 317 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and low Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1) for oxygen evolution reaction, as well as good stability. The performance of the novel 1D composite material along with its low-cost and simple-preparation merits is suggestive of great potential for water splitting. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Various analysis techniques including pair distribution function and Rietveld refinement, X-ray absorption spectroscopy at synchrotron as well as advanced electron microscopy revealed that silver exists as metallic Ag particles and well-dispersed Ag2O nanoclusters within the mesostructure. The benefits of this synergy are twofold for OER: highly conductive metallic Ag improves the charge transfer ability of the electrocatalysts while ultra-small Ag2O clusters provide the centers that can uptake Fe impurities from KOH electrolyte and boost the catalytic efficiency of Co-Ag oxides. The current density of mesostructured Co(3)O(4)at 1.7 V(RHE)is increased from 102 to 211 mA cm(-2)with incorporation of silver spices. This work presents the dual role of silver moieties and demonstrates a simple method to increase the OER activity of Co3O4.									38	1	0	0	2	0	39			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000563825000001	32537829

The electrocatalysts deposited from Ni(II) and Ni(II)Fe(II) precursors had the highest activity for OER, however, their presence on the surface of the Ti doped hematite photoelectrode decreased the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the photoelectrode for water splitting in an alkaline electrolyte. In contrast, the NiFe-oxide deposited from the Ni(II)-Fe(III) precursor which had a lower OER activity was found to increase the IPCE of the photoelectrode by as much as a factor of 5.

Density Functional theory at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level was used to optimize the geometries of reactants, NO adsorption complexes, and products. Schematic energy profiles for each reaction were obtained in order to elucidate mechanisms for N2O evolution. We found that the NO molecule reacts with char-containing nitrogen to release predominantly N-2 and CO to the gas phase. For the model char structures studied, the presence of adsorbed oxygen on the char-containing nitrogen enhances the reduction of the NO molecule to N-2 as a predominant product of the reaction, but N2O can also be released as a minor nitrogen product.									62	13	0	0	2	0	74			1089-5639			WOS:000089267900011

Here, we demonstrate that metallic Ag can improve the electrocatalytic performance of Fe-Co-S/N-doped carbon composites, which was prepared by a calcination route. Ag was loaded on the composite by a simple dipping method. With appropriate amount of Ag loading, the over potential to achieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2) can make a decrease of 37 mV in 1 M KOH, while the Tafel slope almost doesn't change. It is demonstrated that loading of Ag not only improves the activity of catalytic site, but also cause a higher electrochemically-active surface area. The optimized OER catalyst was then covered on a hematite photoanode. The appropriate loading mass of the catalyst on hematite photoanode was investigated. It was found that the catalyst can improve the photocurrent density of 7 times enhancement at potential of 1.23 V vs RHE. This study demonstrates a surface decoration route to improve the catalytic activity, which would also be extended to other highly efficient catalysts for OER. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

At low temperatures, the variation of incorporated oxygen content is similar to a dissociative adsorption isotherm of O-2 on Si indicating that the surface-confined reaction of the deposited Si atoms with the adsorbed oxygen atoms is the main process. However, it shows a three-step variation with the oxygen partial pressure at high temperatures. The evolution of SiO species confirmed by the XPS indicates that an adsorption-induced surface reaction and a diffusion-induced internal reaction are the main pathways for the Si oxidation.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1098-0121			WOS:000241723600012

Herein, a sequence of bifunctional catalysts are successfully synthesized by the direct pyrolysis reaction of copper-nickel coexisting metal-organic framework precursors (CuNi-BTC, BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid). The as-obtained catalysts consisting of nitrogen-doped carbon with embedded copper-nickel alloy nanoparticles (CuNi-NC) are developed for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. We demonstrate that the introduction of nickel in appropriate proportion is in favor of improving the degree of graphitization, enlarging the electrochemical active surface area, and accelerating charge transport. As a result, the optimized CuNi-NC-2 sample exhibits an overpotential of 390 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 76 mV dec(-1) in the OER process, while all CuNi-NC samples have better performance (lower overpotential and smaller Tafel slope) compared to the Cu-NC in the HER process, and their acceptable durability is also confirmed. In view of convenient preparation, satisfactory activity, reliable durability, and low cost, such transition metal carbon-based catalysts could provide significant guidance for the rational design of bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting.									32	1	0	0	1	0	32			2052-1553			WOS:000445217200024

Using near-ambient pressure resonant photoelectron spectroscopy, we studied changes in the metal-oxygen coordination of size-selected core-shell CoOx nanoparticles induced by liquid water. In dry conditions, the nanoparticles exhibit an octahedrally coordinated Co2+ core and a tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ shell. In the presence of liquid water, we observe a reversible phase change of the nanoparticle shell into octahedrally coordinated Co2+ as well as partially oxidized octahedrally coordinated Co3+. This is in contrast to previous findings, suggesting an irreversible phase change of tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ after the oxygen evolution reaction conditioning. Our results demonstrate the appearance of water-induced structural changes different from voltage-induced changes and help us to understand the atomic scale interaction of CoOx nanoparticles with water in electrochemical processes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000595533800090	33103880

BHT exhibits a redox couple at similar to 3.0 V (vs. Li+ /Li), which is extremely close to the thermodynamic potential of a Li-O-2 battery (2.96 V). The unique chemical and electrochemical behaviors of BHT contribute to the improvement on both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction performances. These factors lead to the notable enhancement of discharge capacity (capacity increases by 72%) and the reduction of charge plateau (the plateau is 3.2 V and 4.2 V, respectively, with and without BHT) for Li-O-2 batteries. Furthermore, in-situ X-ray diffraction results confirm that the BHT-mediated formation and decomposition of Li2O2, rather than parasitic reactions, dominate the discharge and charge processes. The results provide a new approach for exploiting appropriate soluble mediators for rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000402220600016

However, due to the numerous factors affecting the activity of electrocatalysis, the understanding of their catalytic mechanism is insufficient, and challenges still exist. Herein, the organic group of the metal-organic nanosheets electrocatalyst was replaced by -NH2 to -CH3 to controllable regulate the catalytic performance of OER, corresponding to the overpotential of OER reducing from 385 mV to 318 mV at 10 mA cm(2), superior to the commercial precious metal based catalyst RuO2. Furthermore, combining the density functional theory (DFT) and electron localization function (ELF) indicates that the type of ligands group can indirectly modulate the electronic structure of metal catalytic center and the degree of electronic localization of the metal-organic nanosheets catalysts, resulting in the change in electrocatalytic activity. This simple catalytic model is more favorable to investigate the catalytic mechanism, providing a new strategy for the development of efficient electrocatalyst.

Herein, the pyrolysis of a precursor containing g-C3N4, thiourea, cobalt chloride and ferric chloride was used to fabricate S, N co-doped carbon nanotubes functionalized with Co3Fe7 alloy nanoparticles (CoFe/S-NC). The obtained CoFe/S-N-C catalyst exhibited an ORR half wave potential of 0.855 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH, outperforming a commercial Pt/C catalyst (E-1/2 = 0.844 V). The catalyst also demonstrated superior OER catalytic activity (1.588 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) relative to RuO2 in 0.1 M KOH, thus displaying outstanding bifunctional ORR and OER activity. A rechargeable Zn-air battery fabricated using CoFe/S-N-C shows good very performance (maximum power density of 120 mW cm(-2) with a specific capacity of 814 mAh g(-1)) which was superior to a Zn-air battery fabricated using Pt/C and RuO2 as ORR and OER catalysts (92 mW cm(-2) and 787 mAh g(-1), respectively). Further, the fabricated battery using CoFe/S-N-C showed good stability, offering a discharge voltage similar to 1.10 V and a recharge voltage similar to 2.15 V at 10 mA cm(-2) over 300 cycles, evidence of the durability of the CoFe/S-N-C catalyst.									28	0	0	0	1	0	28			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000727827700004

Herein, ultrafine platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) supported on N,S-codoped porous carbon nanofibers (Pt-N,S-pCNFs) hybrids were prepared through the electrospinning method coupled with hydrothermal and carbonation processes. The ultrafine Pt NPs are sufficiently dispersed and loaded on pCNFs and codoped with N and S, which can improve oxygen adsorption, afford more active sites, and greatly enhance electron mobility. The Pt-N,S-pCNFs hybrid achieves excellent activity and stability for ORR with similar to 70 mV positive shift of onset potential compared to the commercial Pt/C-20 wt% electrocatalyst. The long-term catalytic durability with 89.5% current retention after a 10 000 s test indicates its remarkable ORR behavior. Pt-N,S-pCNFs also exhibits excellent HER and OER performance, and can be used as an efficient catalyst for water splitting. In addition, Pt-N,S-pCNFs exhibits an excellent hydrogen storage capacity of 0.76 wt% at 20 degrees C and 10 MPa. This work provides novel design strategies for the development of multifunctional materials as high-performance ORR catalysts, water splitting electrocatalysts and hydrogen storage materials.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2516-0230			WOS:000762382100001	36134368

Herein, we report bimetallic iridium-iron diatomic catalysts (IrFe-N-C) derived from metal-organic frameworks in a facile wet chemical synthesis followed by postpyrolysis. We use various advanced characterization techniques to comprehensively confirm the atomic dispersion of Ir and Fe on the nitrogen-doped carbon support and the presence of atomic pairs. The as-obtained IrFe-N-C shows substantially higher electrocatalytic performance for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) when compared to the single-atom counterparts (i.e., Ir-N-C and Fe-N-C), revealing favorable bifunctionality. Consequently, IrFe-N-C is used as an air cathode in zinc-air batteries, which display much better performance than the batteries containing commercial Pt/C + RuO2 benchmark catalysts. Our synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the IrFe dual atoms presumably exist in an IrFeN6 configuration where both Ir and Fe coordinates with four N atoms and two N atoms are shared by the IrN4 and FeN4 moieties. Furthermore, the Fe site contributes mainly to the ORR, while the Ir site plays a more important role in the OER The dual-atom sites work synergistically, reducing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step and eventually boosting the reversible oxygen electrocatalysis. The IrFe-N-C catalysts hold great potential for use in various electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000838229500001

Thanks to its inherent high theoretical energy density, ZABs have become one of the excellent candidates for the new generation of electric transportations and electrical energy storage systems. Nevertheless, the most significant technical obstacle to the commercialization of ZABs is the tardy oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR and OER) kinetics of the air electrode. Hence, the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts with advanced ORR/OER catalytic activity and long-term stability is of great significance. Owing to the outstanding advantages of perovskite oxides, scientists have focused their attention on the perovskite-based catalysts. And various strategies have been applied to strengthen their ORR/OER performance, including cation doping, surface structure optimization, nanostructure construction, and composite fabrication. This article concisely outlines the research progress of perovskite-based oxides on ZABs applications. The basic principles of ZABs and the approach to increasing the OER/ORR activity of perovskite oxides as the air electrode of ZABs are illustrated. Finally, this review points out opportunities, possibilities, and future development direction of perovskite-based air electrodes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-2135	1932-2143		WOS:000788573000001

Experimental results show that F-CoMoO4 has two significant effects: 1) inducing rich oxygen vacancies, and 2) optimizing the electronic configuration of CoMoO4, which is beneficial for exposure of active sites. The as-obtained F-CoMoO4-x-2@GF electrocatalyst exhibits lower OER overpotential of 256 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 64.4 mV dec(-1) in alkaline solution, resulting in a nearly 100 mV of OER catalytic activity enhancement compared with that of pure CoMoO4. DFT results reveal that the change of Mo 4d state reduces the band-gap and increases the electrical conductivity of CoMoO4, thus optimizing its intrinsic activity. The synthesis strategy used in this work may provide some ideas for enhancing the electrical conductivity of other transition metal oxides (TMOs).									17	0	0	0	1	0	16			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000720446700001

In this context, Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) takes regained interest than the Oxygen evolution reaction. Besides the noble metals, carbon based materials are found to be effective for catalyzing these reactions. The metal encapsulated with graphitic layers shows good activities towards HER. In the present work, cuprous oxide encapsulated with graphitic carbon nitride was synthesized and further structural and morphological properties were analyzed by XRD, SEM and BET. The as synthesized Cu2O/g-C3N4 served as electrodes for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction. The synthesized Cu2O/g-C3N4 composites show better electrochemical surface area and enhanced electrocatalytic behavior (148.7 mV over-potential with an exchange current density of 12.8 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope 55 mV/dec) in alkaline medium.									25	1	0	0	2	0	25			0925-9635	1879-0062		WOS:000540199900013

Here, NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with Ni vacancies (Ni-Fe LDHs-VNi) are employed as cathode catalysts for Li-O-2 batteries. The battery with Ni-Fe LDHs-VNi cathodes implements excellent performances for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the rate determining step of OER processes of Ni-Fe LDHs-VNi is the oxidation process of lithium superoxide (LiO2), and the high adsorption strength towards LiO2 by Ni vacancies lead to a lower charge overpotential than that of pure NiFe LDHs without vacancies. This work provides a strategy to rationally design cathode catalysts with layered structures for high-performance Li-O-2 batteries.									36	0	0	0	0	0	36			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000623242000002

They find the ferromagnetic-exchange-like behaviour between the ferromagnetic catalyst and the adsorbed oxygen species.The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the bottleneck that limits the energy efficiency of water-splitting. The process involves four electrons' transfer and the generation of triplet state O-2 from singlet state species (OH- or H2O). Recently, explicit spin selection was described as a possible way to promote OER in alkaline conditions, but the specific spin-polarized kinetics remains unclear. Here, we report that by using ferromagnetic ordered catalysts as the spin polarizer for spin selection under a constant magnetic field, the OER can be enhanced. However, it does not applicable to non-ferromagnetic catalysts. We found that the spin polarization occurs at the first electron transfer step in OER, where coherent spin exchange happens between the ferromagnetic catalyst and the adsorbed oxygen species with fast kinetics, under the principle of spin angular momentum conservation. In the next three electron transfer steps, as the adsorbed O species adopt fixed spin direction, the OER electrons need to follow the Hund rule and Pauling exclusion principle, thus to carry out spin polarization spontaneously and finally lead to the generation of triplet state O-2. Here, we showcase spin-polarized kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction, which gives references in the understanding and design of spin-dependent catalysts.									43	1	0	0	2	0	42				2041-1723		WOS:000687305500019	33972558

Limited by the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), rational fabrication of efficient catalysts for the HER coupled with the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) is tremendously important for energy-saving hydrogen production. Herein, we report a facile one-step approach to in situ grow microsphere-like Ir-doped Ni/Fe-based MOF arrays on nickel foam (MIL-(IrNiFe)@NF). Benefitting from the superior transfer coefficient and hierarchical structure, the as-obtained MIL-(IrNiFe)@NF electrocatalyst shows superb electrocatalytic activity and stability toward water splitting in alkaline media and a voltage of 1.9 V to achieve 1000 mA cm(-2) is realized for overall seawater electrolysis. Moreover, combining this HER catalyst with the HzOR in seawater electrolysis, an ultralow voltage of 0.69 V is achieved at 1000 mA cm(-2) and with excellent durability, demonstrating its great potential for efficient seawater electrolysis. This work affords a cost-efficient approach toward the fabrication of metal-doped MOFs for energy-saving water/seawater electrocatalysis.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000723812000001

Here, vanadium doped Ni3S2 nanosheets array decorated on carbon fiber cloth (V-Ni3S2/CC) is successfully constructed as 3D dual-functional electrodes for efficient overall water splitting. The specific nanosheet array electrode provides structural benefits of high contact area, abundant accessible catalytic sites, shortened and accelerated charge transfer, and improved electrolyte penetration. Moreover, the vanadium dopants have a positive effect on the catalysis process, contributing to the improved intrinsic activity and accelerated catalysis reaction kinetics of Ni3S2 catalyst. Reasonably, the developed V-Ni3S2/CC electrodes exhibit robust water splitting performances, with small overpotential of 180 mV for oxygen evolution reaction and 81 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction at 10 mA cm(-2). In a V-Ni3S2/CC dual-electrodes constructed electrolyzer system, an ultralow cell potential of 1.49 V is achieved for a stable catalytic current of 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming most of the reported non-noble metals based dual-functional electrocatalysts.									33	3	0	0	1	0	33			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000474530600087

However, this process is hampered by the high cost of precious electrode and the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Thus, it is desirable for developing an efficient and low-cost OER electrocatalyst. Herein, N and Fe co-doped CoO nanoparticles (CoxFeyO-N), rich of O vacancies and the interface of CoO/CoxN, were successfully prepared via the annealing of Fe doped cobalt-based coordination polymers in an NH3 atmosphere. The ratio of Co2+ and Fe3+ was systematically varied, and Co0.89Fe0.11O-N possesses the highest OER activity in 1.0 M KOH. Furthermore, through growth of the resultant Co0.89Fe0.11O-N onto nickel foam, the corresponding OER activity can be further enhanced with the overpotential of 360 mV at current density of 50 mA cm(-2). The superior OER activity of Co-0.8,Fe11O-N originates from the presence of oxygen vacancies and CoO/CoxN interface. During the reaction, CoO-N was partially oxidized into Co3O4, which accompanies CoO to co-catalyze OER. The study provides new insights for the preparation and understanding the active sites for Co-based catalysts for OER. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Here, NiCo2O4/NiO nanosheets are successfully synthesized following a simple wet-chemical route, followed by the combustion technique. Finally, the synthesized catalyst NiCo2O4/NiO can function as an efficient catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction. Nanosheets with interconnections are very useful for better electron transportation because the pores in between the sheets are useful for the diffusion of electrolyte in electrocatalysis. In oxygen evolution reaction, these sheets can generate current densities of 10 and 20 mA/cm(2), respectively, upon application of 1.59 and 1.62 V potential versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under alkaline condition. In contrast, bare NiCo2O4 nanowire bundles can generate a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) upon application of 1.66 V versus RHE. The presence of NiO in NiCo2O4/NiO nanosheets helps to increase the conductivity, which further increases the electrocatalytic activity of NiCo2O4/NiO nanosheets.									59	2	0	0	3	0	60			2470-1343			WOS:000418744100009	31457317
