The limited light absorption and the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers are the major hurdles constraining the application of numerous photocatalysts. Herein, we report a simple and effective strategy, a multistep heat-treatment method, to synthesise a defective g-C3N4/RGO/TiO2 composite to increase its rate of activity for H-2 production. The defects, nitrogen and oxygen vacancies, are simultaneously introduced on the surface of the g-C3N4/RGO/TiO2 composite. The vacancy defects essentially endow g-C3N4/RGO/TiO2 with a boosted photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate (4760 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) under visible-light irradiation, which is higher than that of the most of g-C3N4/TiO2 composites. This is attributed to the improved visible-light absorption as well as the separation and transfer rate of photogenerated charge carriers arising from vacancy defects. This study may provide an avenue for preparing defective photocatalysts for efficient H-2 evolution.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000589051700007	33146195

Micro-particles of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), a conducting polymer, were used as the base material for the air electrode of Li-O-2 cells. The PEDOT micro-particles were treated with H2SO4 to improve their electronic conductivity, and LiBr and CsBr were used as the redox mediators to facilitate the dissociation of there action products in the electrode and reduce the over-potential of the Li-O-2 cells. The capacity of the electrode employing PEDOT micro-particles was significantly enhanced via H(2)SO(4 )treatment, which is attributed to the increased electronic conductivity. The considerable capacity enhancement and relatively low over-potential of the electrode employing H2SO4-treated PEDOT micro-particles indicate that the treated PEDOT micro-particles can act as reaction sites and provide storage space for the reaction products. The cyclic performance of the electrode employing H2SO4-treated PEDOT micro-particles was superior to that of a carbon electrode. The results of the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopic analysis showed that the accumulation of residual reaction products during cycling was significantly reduced by introducing the carbon-free electrode based on H2SO4-treated PEDOT micro-particles, compared with that of the carbon electrode. The cycle life was improved owing to the effect of the redox mediators. The refore, the use of the carbon -free electrode combined with redox mediators could realize excellent cyclic performance and low over-potential simultaneously.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2093-8551			WOS:000448343900008

However, the common problems of inefficient light harvesting, rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs, and low surface reactive reaction sites for photocatalysts urgently need to be solved. In this regard, thin-layered photocatalysts are considered to be one of the most promising candidates for addressing these issues, due to their unique surface and electronic properties. In this review, the various strategies for constructing thin-layered photocatalysts are summarized, and emphasis is given to approaches for optimizing the photocatalytic performance of the thin-layered materials, which can be classified into surface engineering and junction construction. In addition, the photocatalytic applications of thin-layered materials, i.e., water splitting, CO2 reduction, nitrogen fixation, and molecule oxygen activation, are summarized. Finally, based on current achievements in thin-layered photocatalysts, their future development and challenges are discussed.									48	1	0	0	5	0	48			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000537167400014

However, the activity and selectivity issues originating from the activation barrier of the NRR intermediates and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction result in the unsatisfactory NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency of current NRR catalysts. Atomic site catalysts (ASCs), an emerging group of heterogeneous catalysts with a high atomic utilization rate, selectivity, and stability, may provide a solution. This article undertakes an exploration and systematic review of a highly significant research area: the principles of designing ASCs for the NRR. Both the theoretical and experimental progress and state-of-the-art techniques in the rational design of ASCs for the NRR are summarized, and the topic is extended to double-atom catalysts and boron-based metal-free ASCs. This review provides guidelines for the rational design of ASCs for the optimum activity and selectivity for the electrocatalytic NRR.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2520-8489	2520-8136		WOS:000840098100001

Here, a strategy is proposed to fill Ni-vacancy (Ni-v) sites of dual-deficient NiO (D-NiO-Pt) deliberately created by Ar plasma with homogeneously distributed Pt atoms driven by oxygen vacancies (O-v). The incorporated Pt atoms filling the Ni-v reduce the formation energy to increase crystal stability, and subsequently combine with additional O-v to tune the electronic structure of the surrounding Ni sites. Thus, a more ideal hydrogen adsorption free energy (Delta G(H*)) closer to 0 of Ni sites and Pt sites can be achieved. As a result, the D-NiO-Pt electrode achieves superior mass activity of approximate to 1600 mA mg(-1) (normalized by platinum) and nearly negligible loss of activity during long-term operation, which is much better than as-prepared Pt-containing NiO catalysts without plasma treatment. A low overpotential of 20 mV is required for the D-NiO-Pt at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline HER, outperforming that of the commercial Pt/C. In addition, the universal access to the other Ni-based compounds including nickel phosphide (Ni2P), nickel sulfide (Ni0.96S), and nickel selenide (NiSe2) is also demonstrated by employing a vacancy-driven Pt filling mechanism.									17	0	0	0	0	0	16			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000785582000001

Calculations have been performed using density functional theory with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange correlation functional and dipole corrections. The presence of a single Ni atom appreciably affects the Pt surface, lowering the work function and shifting the d-band center position away from the Fermi level of Pt atoms in contact with Ni. At increasing coverage, Ni bonding strength with Pt increases and plain structures are formed on all considered surfaces, although the initial tendencies, seen for the Pt fundamental properties upon Ni adsorption, do not change. Compared to reported experimental data, results suggest that lowering of the work function, Phi, of Pt(111) upon Ni adsorption may facilitate charge transfer through the electric double layer, improving the rate of the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline media on Ni-modified Pt(111) surfaces. Hence, this rate-promoting effect would be expected to be lower for Pt(110) and (100) because of the lower impact of Ni adatoms on Phi for these two surfaces. Results of the present study improve the current understanding of adatoms' electronic effects on the substrate and contribute to the scientific basis for the systematic design and development of Pt-based catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000818007900001

In this study, a novel two-dimensional (2D) composite was successfully fabricated through the simultaneous formation of cobalt sulfide (Co9S8) nanosheets and N-, S-doped graphene (NSG). Cobalt-thiourea with graphene oxide was used as the precursor for a low-temperature and one-step pyrolysis. The optimal Co9S8/NSG-220 achieved a small onset overpotential of 147 mV, a low Tafel slope of 97 mV.dec(-1), superior long-term durability after 16 h, and high faradic efficiency (nearly 100%) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an acid electrolyte. The tightly bound sheet-on-sheet structure significantly enhanced the intrinsic catalytic activity due to the mutual activation effects between the components. Based on the experimental investigation and density functional theory calculations, the mutual activation effects induced by the electron transfer across the active interface constructed between NSG and Co9S8 was proposed as a key factor in the origin of superior catalytic activity. The HER catalytic activities were further improved by doping Mo into the composites. This design inspires new thoughts for exploring 2D composites prepared using molecular precursors with controlled compositions and morphologies as performance-enhanced electrocatalysts for future sustainable clean energy conversion.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2168-0485			WOS:000503330400014

Multi electrons and metal-based and ring-based redox processes of TiPcs indicate their possible electrocatalytic activity toward many target species. Different numbers and positions of the substituents of the complexes affect the peaks' character and assignment of the processes. The presence of O-2 in the electrolyte system influences the electrochemical and spectral responses of TiPcs. Electrochemical and in situ spectroelectrochemical analysis indicates interaction of molecular oxygen with TiPcs and these interaction mechanisms depend on both the substituent environments of the complexes and the electrolyte system. Langmuir-Blodgett films of the complexes also catalyze molecular oxygen in aqueous media, which is a desired property for their practical application.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000324412300030	23949120

The morphology and structure of the nanocomposite were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results demonstrated that rod-like hematite was modified by Mn3O4 and dispersed on the surface of r-GO. Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) showed superior interfacial contacts between alpha-Fe2O3/Mn3O4 and r-GO. Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and photoelectrochemical characterization revealed a high light-harvesting efficiency, a lowered overpotential for water oxidation and an excellent charge transfer performance of alpha-Fe2O3/Mn3O4/r-GO nanocomposite with heterostructures. The photocatalytic oxygen evolution from the optimized photocatalyst was up to 1406.2 mu mol g(-1) in 10 h of UV-vis light irradiation and the quantum yield was ca. 4.35% at 365 nm.

Recent studies of the Population III (Pop III) star formation suggested that these stars could be born with a mass scale about 100 M-circle dot and with a strong rotation. Based on stellar evolution models, these massive Pop III stars might have died as highly energetic pair-instability supernovae. We perform 2D calculations to investigate the impact of rotation on pair-instability supernovae. Our results suggest that rotation leads to an aspherical explosion due to an anisotropic collapse. If the first stars have a 50% of keplerian rotational rate of the oxygen core before their pair-instability explosions, the overall Ni-56 production can be significantly reduced by about two orders of magnitude. An extreme case of 100% keplerian rotational rate shows an interesting feature of fluid instabilities along the equatorial plane caused by non-synchronized and non-isotropic ignitions of explosions, so that the shocks run into the in-falling gas and generate the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0217-7323	1793-6632		WOS:000348140900001

The embedding of GO for improving the catalytic properties of the composites towards electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. The optimized mixed oxide-embedded GO exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity, which was attributed to the favourable surface structure and the electrochemical properties that were further confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), HRTEM, SEM-EDX, XPS analysis, and electrochemical analysis. It was found that a benchmark current density of 6.02 mA cm(-2)has been achieved at an overpotential of 104 mV dec(-1)in 1 M KOH with a low Tafel slope of 37 mV dec(-1). The prepared catalyst was economically viable and its performance was consistent over a long duration of time. The remarkable activity of the FTG-incorporated electrode can be ascribed to the synergetic effect of Ti, Ni and P elements over the reactive sites and also due to the increased electrical conductivity. The binder-free coating of active ingredients over the working electrode surface also enriches the catalytic behaviour. These findings may open a new insight into the design and construction of novel, efficient, and durable electrocatalysts for HER.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000560486100043

Replacement of Ca2+ with other redox-inactive metals results in a loss/decrease of oxygen-evolving activity. To investigate the role of Ca2+ in this catalytic reaction, we investigate artificial Mn-3[M]O-2 clusters redox-inactive metals [M] ([M] = Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Sr2+, and Y3+), which were synthesized by Tsui et al. (Nat Chem 5:293, 2013). The experimentally measured redox potentials (E-m) of these clusters are best described by the energy of their highest occupied molecular orbitals. Quantum chemical calculations showed that the valence of metals predominantly affects E-m(Mn-III/IV), whereas the ionic radius of metals affects E-m(Mn-III/IV) only slightly.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000655839100001	34047897

The vertically aligned MoS2 nanosheets with defects such as cracks, amorphousness and oxygen-incorporated disorders endow these as-synthesized catalysts with rich active sites, high conductivity and good stability. The graphene deposited on Ni foam increases its stability in acid. The optimized catalyst exhibits high activity for hydrogen evolution with a quite low overpotential of 140 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 42 mV decade(-1), and a large exchange current density of 63 mu k/cm(2), as well as excellent stability. This performance is superior to most of its analogue MoS2 and many transition metal sulfides.

J	Gattrell, M; MacDougall, B								The anodic electrochemistry of pentachlorophenol								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				146	9			3335	3348		10.1149/1.1392475				SEP 1999	1999	The aqueous-phase electrochemical oxidation of pentachlorophenol (PCP) was studied. The oxidation was carried out at pyrolytic carbon, glassy carbon, gold, and platinum anodes in pH 6-7 solutions with phosphate and in some cases acetate electrolyte. The potential range studied was from the onset of PCP oxidation to the onset of oxygen evolution. For most of the potential range the reaction was a one-electron oxidation resulting in 2,3,4,5,6-pentachloro-4-pentachlorophenoxy-2,5-cyclohexadienone. The product is essentially insoluble and precipitated on the electrode surface. Various thicknesses, crystallinities, and patterns of deposit were observed to form, giving rise to different current-time or potential-time responses depending on factors including electrode material, current density, electrolyte, PCP concentration, and reaction time. At very low over-potentials the reaction product became complex and the reaction took place with less than one electron per molecule and with the appearance of some chloride. Under these conditions the reaction is felt to be an electrochemically initiated, chain reaction polymerization. This involves the electrochemical formation of a radical which attacks the pentachlorophenoxalate substrate, forming a radical anion intermediate. This intermediate decomposes, yielding a chloride ion and reforming a neutral radical (though now of higher molecular weight), thus continuing the reaction. The application of such electrochemically initiated condensation reactions for removal of PCP and some other phenols from wastewater is discussed. (C) 1999 The Electrochemical Society.

Herein, we report the synthesis of molybdate-directed Ni3S2 heterogeneous nanorod arrays, in which the nanorods decorated with vertical nanosheets were densely and evenly covered on the surface of Ni foam. Benefiting from the abundant accessible active sites, accelerated charge transport, fast release of generated gas, and synergistic effect, the Mo doped Ni3S2 nanorod arrays exhibits excellent activity toward both OER and HER, delivering current density of 100 mA.cm(-2) at low overpotential of 350 mV for OER and 290 mV for HER, respectively. Moreover, such heterogeneous nanorods display a very low cell voltage of 1.83 V to approach 100 mA.cm(-2) along with a favorable robustness for 10 h in an alkaline electrolyzer. Different characterizations including XRD and SEM revealed the influence of Mo doping on the growth of heterogeneous nanorods. Electrochemical measurements confirmed the superior activity of Mo doped Ni3S2 originated from synergistic effect of Mo and Ni3S2. This work sheds light on the fabrication of versatile electrocatalysts for efficient energy conversion by demonstrating the novel design of heterogeneous nanorods as active catalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1452-3981			WOS:000452562400017

The microcalorimetric and DFT studies								APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL				517				196	210		10.1016/j.apcata.2016.03.004				MAY 5 2016	2016	The thermal effects and activity of silica and alumina supported bimetallic Pd-Au catalysts (of various Pd/Au ratio) in the exothermic H-2 and O-2 recombination reaction have been investigated in view of their potential use in the industrial passive autocatalytic recombiners (PAR). The catalysts were prepared by the colloid-based reverse "water-in-oil" microemulsion method which provided metal particles of size in a very narrow range (4-7 nm). In both SiO2] and Al2O3 - series catalysts the Pd-Au particles aggregated to some extent, especially strongly in alumina-series samples. The H-2 + O-2 reaction has been monitored using Microscal gas-flow through microcalorimeter at temperature of 22 degrees C and atmospheric pressure. The observed pattern of changes in both the heat evolution and the conversion of hydrogen seem to reflect the effect of water and/or other oxygen-containing surface species (like OH) on the activity/deactivation of catalysts. The nature of support and the composition of metal particles (Pd/Au ratio) played a role. Deactivation of alumina supported catalysts was stronger than silica supported counterparts. Among all studied catalysts, the best behavior was offered by low Au content-containing Pd-Au-0.1/SiO2 (Pd90Au10) catalyst. Its almost stable activity during the catalytic run may be attributed to relatively weak interactions with water molecules and/or other oxygen-containing, species (like OH), intermediates formed in the hydrogen oxidation. It may be supposed that electronic modification of palladium sites by gold assisted by the surface composition of Pd-Au particles reflecting in "surface arrangement of Pd and Au-atoms" are decisive. This experimental observation seems to correlated with the DFT calculation indicating that besides the number of Au atoms, their location with respect to the Pd, e.g "surface arrangement of Au" is more important for the energy/strength of interaction with water molecules.

Field emission scanning electron microscopes (FESEM) showed nano IrO2 poles separated out of the Ti/IrO2(X) + MnO2(1 - x) coating surfaces and formed nano IrO2 array in the local region, especially at the surface of the Ti/IrO2(0.5) + MnO2(0.5) and Ti/IrO2(0.7) + MnO2(0.3) anodes prepared at 400 degrees C. The physical phases and crystallite orientations of the IrO2(x) + MnO2(1 - x) coatings were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The resistivity of the IrO2(x) + MnO2(1 - x) coatings descended with the increase of IrO2 content in the coating. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) has been used to investigate the electrochemical behavior of the IrO2(x) + MnO2(1 - x) electrodes in acid solution. The reaction mechanism of O-2 evolution on the IrO2(x) + MnO2(1 - x) electrodes was studied by polarization curve. Tafel lines displayed two distinct linear regions with one of the slope close to 62 mV dec(-1) in the low potential region and the other close to 135 mV dec(-1) in the high potential region. The accelerated lifetime test was measured in 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions at 40 degrees C with a constant anodic current density of 2 A/cm(2). The Ti/IrO2(0.7) + MnO2(0.3) anode prepared at 400 degrees C has the highest service life of 900 h. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This reaction plays an essential role both in the interfacial transfers and transport properties and depends on relative cation concentrations and experimental conditions. In this paper we present experimental investigations aiming to determine, to compare and to control some of the surface and bulk properties of these oxides. The bulk and surface Mn4+ contents were investigated by thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) in hydrogen and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) respectively. With a finely divided La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 powder, the chemical composition in the surface layers was found to be practically independent of the conditions of a high temperature treatment in oxygen. The same is true for the mean oxidation state of manganese always close to Mn4+. With pellets of various compositions (x = 0, 0.2, 0.5 and 1), enrichment in strontium with respect to the bulk composition was detected in oxygen at high temperature and found to depend on the strontium concentration in the bulk. Moreover, for any chemical composition, deficit in manganese were systematically evidenced in the surface layers. Surface strontium concentration and mean oxidation state of manganese was correlated as expected. By comparing the results observed with very finely divided powder and pellets respectively, it was deduced that the grain boundaries have an important effect on the surface composition. Data on the structural evolution of the initial compounds during their hydrogen reduction are also presented. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this work, using density functional theory (DFT) computations, the catalytic activity for the ORR of substitutionally doped MoS2 monolayers with various transition metal (TM) atoms was systemically explored. The computations reveal that these TM atoms can strongly interact with the S-vacancy and significantly modify the electronic and magnetic properties of MoS2 monolayer. On the basis of the computed free energies, it is evident that Cu-embedded MoS2 monolayer exhibits the best ORR catalytic activity with the minimum overpotential of 0.63 V because of its optimal interaction with ORR species. Thus, this study suggests that substituted doping with a suitable transition metal is an effective method to improve the catalytic activity of MoS2 monolayer for the ORR, which could be useful in development of novel 2D ORR electrocatalysts.									61	2	0	0	5	0	61			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000401930100043

CoP/C were synthesized by electrodeposition in the presence of different sodium hypophosphite concentrations with porous carbon membranes as working electrodes. The morphology of CoP/C is strongly dependent on the concentration of sodium hypophosphite. We prepared the CoP/C with varying contents of phosphorus to investigate influence of phosphorus content on the morphology of CoP/C and the corresponding catalytic capability of water splitting in alkaline conditions. When the sodium hypophosphite in the electrodeposition electrolyte reaches to 0.6 M, the malformed octahedral CoP particles appear on nanofibers of carbon membrane coated with CoP films. The CoP/C with such hierarchical structure exhibits superior electrocatalytic activities for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the overpotential of 140 mV and 250 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively in the alkaline solution. Furthermore, the CoP/C with hierarchical structure as both anode and cathode for water splitting achieves 10 mA cm(-2) only need 1.56 V. The CoP/C with hierarchical structure keeps stable catalytic performance even after 24 h. This work provides a facile strategy for designing high-efficient phosphides based catalyst for overall water splitting. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The depth distributions of O(2), NO(3)(-), Mn(2+), C(org) and porosity at six representative sites covered with varying thicknesses of tephra are reported. The shapes of the depth profiles reveal that O(2) is totally exhausted within ash layers thicker than 3 cm, while thinner layers are penetrated by oxygen followed by linear downcore profiles with depletion between 8 and 12 cm. Hence, the zone between ash layer and total depletion of oxygen represents a zone of negligible oxygen consumption. Various multi-layer models were developed to explain the observed oxygen concentration profiles. These mathematical simulations also serve to assess both the development since the surface sediments were sealed by the ash fallout as well as the future evolution. Whereas thick tephra layers provoke a nearly stationary situation, i.e. are capable of preventing oxygen from penetrating into the underlying sediments, oxygenation of sediments below thin layers increases rapidly. In these sediments, the effect of oxygen diffusion velocity is drastically reduced by the reaction with dissolved manganese, and therefore explains the linear profiles. Besides, this study is suitable as a case study to assess the effects of human interventions in the deep-sea ecosystem, such as mining and waste dumping. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Measurements were made using metal disks as the working electrodes and the addition of Fe3+ ions to the 1 m KOH electrolyte. The surfaces of the metal disks were oxidized after the OER. Interestingly, Fe interacted synergistically with all metal oxide layers except for that of Ti, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity for the OER. At an overpotential (eta) of 400 mV, the current densities of the Ni and Ag disks in the Fe3+ ions-spiked electrolyte increased by 253 and 132 times, respectively, whereas it was only 20-30 times for the Co and Cu disks (compared with the OER in pure KOH at eta=400 mV). The Tafel slopes of the Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Ag disks in 1 m KOH+Fe3+ electrolyte were in the range of 29-42 mV dec(-1). The surface morphology and post-OER concentration of Fe in the catalysts could not be used to account for differences in the OER activities. Cyclic voltammetry showed that improvements in the OER performance were accompanied by changes in the redox features of the metal disk electrodes, which indicated the presence of electronic interactions between them and the Fe3+. Strikingly, this was not observed between Ti and the Fe3+ ions, which could explain the lack of synergy between Ti and Fe3+ towards the OER catalysis. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicated that the charge-transfer resistances of all the electrodes (except Ti) decreased after the addition of Fe3+ ions. Fe plays an important role in all these observed phenomena and we propose that the surface-adsorbed Fe species serve as the main active sites for OER in these synergistic M-Fe combinations.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000449952200014	30191682

Here we report optimization of the activity of a model perovskite system La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-delta (LSCF; x = 0.301, y = 0.298, and (delta = 0.05-0.11) toward electrochemical water oxidation (OER) by altering the calcination temperature of the nonaqueous sol-gel synthesized nanoparticles (NPs). Our results show that improved OER activity is the result of a synergism between its morphology, surface area, electrical conductivity, and spin state of the active transition metal site. With an e(g) orbital occupancy of 1.26, the interconnected similar to 90 nm LSCF NPs prepared at 975 degrees C (LSCF-975) outperforms the other distinguishable LSCF morphologies, requiring 440 mV overpotential to achieve 10 mA/cm(2), a performance comparable to the best-performing perovskite oxide electrocatalysts. While the interconnected NP morphology increases the propensity of electronic conduction across crystalline grain boundaries, the morphology-tuned high spin Co3+ ions increases the probability of binding reaction intermediates at the available surface sites. Density functional theory based work function modeling further demonstrates that LSCF-975 is the most favorable OER catalyst among others in terms of a moderate work function and Fermi energy level facilitating the adsorption and desorption of reaction intermediates.									21	1	0	0	1	0	22			2574-0962			WOS:000458706000039

J	Du, Xiaoqiang; Fu, Jianpeng; Zhang, Xiaoshuang								Controlled Synthesis of Cr-Co0.85Se Nanoarrays for Water Splitting at an Ultralow Cell Voltage of 1.43 V								CHEMISTRY-AN ASIAN JOURNAL				15	7			1110	1117		10.1002/asia.201901791		MAR 2020		APR 1 2020	2020	Water splitting has attracted more and more attention as a promising strategy for the production of clean hydrogen fuel. In this work, a new synthesis strategy was proposed, and Co0.85Se was synthesized on nickel foam as the main matrix. The doping of appropriate Cr amount into the target of Co0.85Se and the Cr-Co0.85Se resulted in an excellent electrochemical performance. The doping of Cr introduces Cr3+ ions which substitute Co2+ and Co3+ ions in Co0.85Se, so that the lattice parameters of the main matrix were changed. It is worth noting that the Cr0.15-Co0.85Se/NF material exhibits an excellent performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) test. When the current density reaches 50 mA cm(-2) for OER, the overpotential is only 240 mV. For the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) tests, the overpotential is only 117 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) of current density. Moreover, when the Cr0.15-Co0.85Se/NF material is used as a two-electrode device for whole water splitting, the required cell voltage is only 1.43 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is among the lowest values of the published catalysts up to now. In addition, the Cr0.15-Co0.85Se/NF catalyst also exhibits excellent stability during a long period of water splitting. The experimental result demonstrates that the change of the lattice structure has an obvious influence on the electrocatalytic activity of the material. When an external electric field is applied, it facilitates the rapid electron transfer rate and enhances the electrocatalytic performance and stability of the material.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000517338400001	32017420

The prepared CoCu-ZIF@GDY was further explored as electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and overall water splitting in alkaline solution. The CoCuZIF NSs were synthesized by a two-step method, including the preparation of bulk CoCu-ZIF nanoparticles and the formation of CoCu-ZIF NSs by adding excess Co2+ and Cu2+ ions. Different from routine bulk ZIF nanomaterials, the obtained CoCu-ZIF NSs exhibited an ultrathin 2D structure and comprised a large amount of CoCuO4 spinel. The GDY COF demonstrated a highly-conjugated structure, strong adsorption ability toward oxygen, nanowire shape, and a large amount of carbon dots. All of these features endowed the CoCu-ZIF NSs and GDY nanowires with excellent electrochemical conductivity, fast electron-transport ability, and high number of exposed active sites, further leading to the synergistic effect and the direct binding between CoCu-ZIF and GDY. The CoCu-ZIF@GDY nanohybrid further displayed superior OER performance over other transition-metal- and carbon-nanomaterial-based catalysts, giving an extremely low overpotential of 250 mV to acquire a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). When used as the electrolyzer catalyst for two-electrode overall water splitting, it also gave a low overpotential of 290 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and outstanding stability possibly due to the ability of the GDY network to prevent CoCu-ZIF from corroding in alkaline solution. Overall, this work provided a promising strategy for the exploration of electrocatalysts based on bimetallic MOFs and COFs for clean energy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Ultrafast dynamics of acetone photooxidation on TiO2(110)								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				151	16					161103	10.1063/1.5122269				OCT 28 2019	2019	Using light energy to drive chemical reactions on semiconductor surfaces is the basis for technological applications ranging from the removal of organic pollutants to the generation of renewable solar fuels, yet our understanding of the mechanisms has been hindered by the multistep nature of the process and the wide range of time scales over which it occurs (femtoseconds to seconds). In this work, we use ultrafast laser pump-probe techniques to follow the time evolution of substrate-induced photooxidation of acetone on a titania surface. A UV light at 260 nm initiates carrier-induced fragmentation of adsorbed acetone on a TiO2(110) surface that was pretreated with oxygen. The photoreaction results in the ejection of methyl radicals into the gas-phase that are detected by the probe pulse via resonant multiphoton ionization. The time evolution of the methyl radicals leaving the surface exhibits ultrafast rise times, 300-700 fs, followed by a more gradual rise that plateaus by 10 ps, with faster rates at a low acetone coverage. These results are interpreted in terms of a time-dependent rate expression and a mechanism in which the fragmentation of the acetone surface species is driven by interactions with nonequilibrium, "hot" holes.

In this regard, In2O3/ZnO/Co3O4 based ternary oxide nanostructures were investigated in detail for their oxygen/hydrogen evolution reaction (OER/HER) in alkaline environment. The ternary oxides were at first processed through a simple chemical route involving hydrothermal treatment. The prepared nanostructures were then investigated by using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM/HRTEM) to ascertain their morphological traits. X-ray diffraction, Raman signals and photoluminescence data demonstrated the In2O3 phase to be prevalent in the ternary mixture on par with that of ZnO and Co3O4. The valence state of various metal ions and the In-O, Zn-O and Co-O bonding was verified using XPS. The ternary oxide coated electrodes exhibited excellent overall water splitting activity. Overpotential values of 398 and 510 mV were registered for OER and HER experiments under a current density of +/- 10 mA cm(-2), demonstrating the material to be an ideal OER/HER electrocatalyst at room temperature. The exceptional long-term stability in ternary oxides and their Tafel slope (88 mV/dec for OER and 60 mV/dec for HER) further affirmed their unique anodic/cathodic characteristics for water splitting applications.

The catalytic activity of this catalyst toward H2O2 reduction reaction (HPRR) is studied by rotating disk electrode for fuel cell applications. Although the mechanism of HPRR on Fe-N-doped graphene, N-doped graphene and graphene is similar, Fe-N-doped graphene shows the highest catalytic activity toward HPRR. The exchange current density based on the active surface area (j(0A)) of Fe-N-doped graphene in Na2SO4 solution is (4.4 +/- 0.2) x 10(-8) A cm(-2), which is 5 times greater than j(0A) of the N-doped graphene. Direct reduction of H2O2, H2O2 decomposition, O-2 reduction, and O-2 desorption are predicted as the reactions involved in the HPRR while O-2 reduction and O-2 desorption are negligible at low and high overpotentials, respectively. Investigation of the effect of the electrolyte and catalyst loading reveals that HPRR on Fe-N-doped graphene suffers from kinetic limitations especially at low catalyst lodgings, fast rotation rates, and strong acidic and basic solutions.

Herein, a novel pincer complex-bridged porphyrin polymer is synthesized using Cu-porphyrin (CuPor) and Ru-N ' NN '-pincer complex (RuN3) as monomers. The resultant CuPor-RuN3 polymer delivers robust electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with outstanding durability and ultralow overpotentials of 73 and 114 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. Moreover, the CuPor-RuN3 polymer displays great potential to fabricate photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells with a BiVO4 photoanode, where the additional photoinduced electrons from CuPor-RuN3 endow the BiVO4||CuPor-RuN3 PEC cell with much better activity for overall water splitting than the BiVO4||Pt/C one, demonstrating that CuPor-RuN3 would be a promising (photo)electrocatalyst to replace the benchmark Pt/C. The experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the Cu/Ru heterobimetallic centers in the polymer not only enhance the inherent electron transfer from Cu sites to Ru ones that serve as single-atom catalytic sites (Ru-N-3), but also efficiently regulate the electronic property of the Ru-N-3 sites, and thus boosting (photo)electrocatalytic HER activity. The proposed strategy opens a new avenue to fabricate porphyrin-based polymers with heteromultimetallic centers as effective HER (photo)electrocatalysts.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000694987700001

In the present work, the steel reoxidation by two types of gunning mass (GM), viz. magnesia- and alumina-based GM, and two types of tundish slag, viz. lime-alumina-silica and lime-alumina slags, has been investigated. The evolution of the steel composition during the test was analyzed and predicted based on thermodynamic and kinetic considerations. The calculated steel composition agrees well with measured values, when assuming the mass transfer in slag phase limits the reoxidation reactions. The oxidation capacity of the gunning mass and tundish slag is quantified by calculating the oxygen amount supplied from the GM and the slag to the steel phase. It was found that compared to alumina GM, magnesia GM exhibits a stronger oxidation capacity due to its higher content of reducible oxides (10 wt pct SiO2 + 6 wt pct FeO). Compared to lime-alumina-silica tundish slag, lime-alumina slag (with more FeO + MnO contents) provides more oxygen to the molten steel in the present experimental conditions and consequently shows a stronger oxidation capacity.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000354715800016

The cathodic reaction of AZ31 Mg alloy depends on the hydrogen evolution and the oxygen reduction in nondeaerated media, while that is dominanted by the hydrogen evolution in deaerated media. In the potentiostatic measurements in deaerated media, the current density reached a peak during the initial immersion and then showed a stepwise decrease getting into the passivation state by a homogeneous distribution of the Mg(OH)(2) product with increasing polarization time. It revealed that AD I alloy has a better corrosion resistance in deaerated media after long immersion. In the 0.01 mol/L solution, passivation zone was observed in deaerated media polarization up to -1.35 V (vs. SCE) while the corrosion and passivation zones were occurred in nondeaerated media. Potentiodynamic measurements in the 0.01 mol/L NaCl solution containing various concentrations NaHCO3 showed that the corrosion behavior of AZ31 alloy depends on the NaHCO3 concentration. It means that the presence of CO2 naturally in nondeaerated media may affect the corrosion process.

The cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of composite ep-GCN-AB indicated excellent oxygen reduction reaction activity and comparable charge transfer resistance with respect to Pt-C. The absence of X-ray diffraction peak at 2 theta = 13 degrees (corresponding to stacked structure of bulk GCN) indicated reduction in thickness. Four MFCs were operated with simulated wastewater with chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 3000 mg L-1. The maximum power densities of MFC-GAB (14.74 +/- 0.17 W m(-3)), MFC-PAB (15.68 +/- 0.58 W m(-3)) and MFC-G (12.47 +/- 0.30 W m(-3)) using ep-GCN-AB, Pt-C and ep-GCN electrocatalyst, respectively, were 2.6, 2.7 and 2.2 times higher than MFC-AB operated with only acetylene black coated cathode. The investigation demonstrates that ep-GCN and its composites can be utilized as excellent cathode catalysts in MFCs at 20 folds lesser cost than Pt-C. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

N-CQD were made by hydrothermal synthesis from glucosamine hydrochloride (GAH) or glucosamine hydrochloride and N-Octylamine (GAH-Oct), and PSU were quaternized with trimethylamine (PSU-TMA). The nanocomposite electrodes were prepared on carbon paper by drop-casting. Furthermore, we succeeded in preparing PSU-TMA + PANI + GAH-Oct fibers by electrospinning. The capacitance of the electrodes was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy, which gave similar trends. The ORR was investigated by linear sweep voltammetry at rotating disk electrode speeds between 250 and 2000 rpm in an oxygen-saturated 1 M KOH solution. Koutecky-Levich plots showed that four electrons were exchanged for nanocomposite electrodes containing CQD. The highest reduction currents were measured for the electrodes containing GAH-Oct. The Tafel plots gave the lowest slope and the most positive half-wave potential for PSU-TMA + PANI + GAH-Oct fibers. The best electrocatalytic activity of this electrode could be related to the high amount of graphitic nitrogen in GAH-Oct. Long-term cycling tests showed no significant modification of the onset potential, but a change of the current in the mass transport limited region, indicated the evolution of the microstructure of the nanocomposite ORR electrode modifying the mass transport conditions during the first 400 cycles before reaching stationary conditions. FTIR spectra were used to study possible electrode degradation after the ORR in 1 M KOH: the only change was due to the reaction of PANI emeraldine salt to emeraldine base, whereas the other constituents of the multiphase electrode did not show any degradation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1420-3049		WOS:000776337400001	35335194

Uncatalyzed wet air oxidation, which is a promising technique for the treatment of phenolic effluents, has not been analyzed yet for the removal of salicylic acid. The effect of different conditions of pH (1.3-12.3), pressure (1.0-4.1 MPa), temperature (413-443 K), and initial concentrations (1.45-14.50 mM) on the wet oxidation of salicylate/salicylic acid solutions have here been investigated. The pH value of the reaction media was found to be a key parameter for the rate of the oxidation process with an optimum at pH 3.1, when the concentrations of salicylic acid and salicylate were similar. The oxidation reaction followed pseudofirst-order kinetics with respect to salicylic acid and 0.82 order with respect to dissolved oxygen. Additionally, the evolution of the color during the wet oxidation was analyzed and discussed in relation with the formation of intermediate compounds. Then, a reaction pathway for the noncatalytic wet oxidation of the salicylic acid was proposed.									39	3	0	0	19	0	39			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000284248300044	20979409

Subsequently, Co,Ni/N-doped porous carbon have been prepared by pyrolysis method using the Ni,Co-MOFs as precursor. The results show that the samples present high degree of graphitization. The Co-1-Ni-0.5/NC possesses the largest BET surface area (94.73 m(2)/g) and pore volume (0.456 cm(3)/g). The Co-1-Ni-0.5/NC presents the smallest HER overpotential (179 mV) and the best electrocatalytic activity for HER. The Co-0.5-Ni-0.5/NC and Co-1-Ni-0.5/NC have the relatively low overpotential for OER, which are about 348 mV and 383 mV, respectively. The smallest Tafel slope value indicates that Co-1-Ni-0.5/NC presents the best electrocatalytic reactive kinetics. Excellent electrocatalytic performance may be attributed to the more active sites, the higher specific surface area and mesopores as well as the lower charge-transfer resistance. The excellent HER and OER of Co-1-Ni-0.5/NC make its potential to be used on overall water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000685907600003

The TG/DTG results showed that vitrinite always had a higher volatile matter yield, larger maximum rate of weight loss, lower temperature of the maximum rate of weight loss than inertinite. Inertinite showed high response to the external hydrogen, especially at a higher temperature. The gases evolved during thermogravimetric analysis of macerals were analyzed on-line by mass spectrometer for the relative intensity of H2O, C-1-C-4, and C6H6. An obvious difference in evolution curves could be observed. The content of all gases evolved from vitrinite was higher than those from inertinite in both atmospheres. The amount of H2O and light hydrocarbons was higher in H-2 than that in Ar, indicating the hydrogenation of oxygen-containing functional groups and free radicals formed during pyrolysis. The evolution curves of H2O and CH4 had different peak distributions and evolution temperatures under H-2 and Ar, suggesting the different reaction mechanism during pyrolysis in different atmosphere. The evolution curves also revealed the different structural characteristics among vitrinite, inertinite and the parent coal.									2	1	0	0	0	0	3			1556-7036			WOS:000240235800002

Herein, 1D nanowires composed of numerous 2 nm Co0.85Se-NiSe nanograin heterojunctions as efficient precious metal-free bifunctional electrocatalyst are reported for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution with the merits of high activity, durability, and low cost. The abundant microinterface among the ultrafine nanograins and the presence of lattice distortion around nanograin interface is found to create a superhydrophilic surface of the electrocatalyst, which significantly facilitate the fast diffusion of electrolytes and the release of the formed H-2 and O-2 from the catalyst surface. Furthermore, synergic effect between Co0.85Se and NiSe grain on adjusting the electronic structure is revealed, which enhances electron mobility for fast electron transport during the HER/OER process. Owing to these merits, the rationally designed Co0.85Se-NiSe heterostructures display efficient overall water splitting behavior with a low voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and remarkable long-term durability for the investigated period of 50 h.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2366-9608			WOS:000797550700001	35587615

Restrictions have been made on the characteristics of the companion as well as on the initial orbital parameters in order to avoid the occurrence of reversal mass transfer before carbon is ignited in the core. The system undergoes three mass loss episodes. The first and second ones are a consequence of a case B Roche lobe over ow. During the third mass loss episode stellar winds may play a role comparable to, or even more important than Roche lobe over ow. In this paper, we extend the previously existing calculations of stars of intermediate mass belonging to close binary systems by following carefully the carbon burning phase of the primary component. We also propose different possible outcomes for our scenario and discuss the relevance of our findings. In particular, our main result is that the resulting white dwarf component of mass 1.1 M-circle dot more likely has a core composed of oxygen and neon, surrounded by a mantle of carbon-oxygen rich material. The average abundances of the oxygen-neon rich core are X(O-16) = 0.55, X(Ne-20) = 0.28, X(Na-23) = 0.06 and X(Mg-24) = 0.05. This result has important consequences for the Accretion Induced Collapse scenario. The average abundances of the carbon-oxygen rich mantle are X(O-16) = 0.55, and X(C-12) = 0.43. The existence of this mantle could also play a significant role in our understanding of cataclysmic variables.									45	2	0	0	0	0	45			1432-0746			WOS:000170216000013		
J	Song, Siqi; Li, Yang; Shi, Yanfeng; Xu, Yuanhong; Niu, Yusheng								Oxygen-doped MoS2 nanoflowers with sulfur vacancies as electrocatalyst for efficient hydrazine oxidation								JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				906						115986	10.1016/j.jelechem.2021.115986				FEB 1 2022	2022	Direct hydrazine fuel cells (DHFCs) fuel has drawn significant attention due to its characteristics of high energy density. Substantial effort is still needed to explore sustainable and efficient catalysts for hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Herein, inspired by reducing solvents that can protect the precursors of nanomaterials from oxidation, oxygen-doped MoS2 nanoflowers with sulfur vacancies (O-rich MoS2) were prepared via a simple synthesis method using the readily available ethanol/water as the solvent and applied as electrocatalyst for HzOR. It is found that the ratio of ethanol to water has a significant influence on the morphology of MoS2 and the catalytic performance of hydrazine oxidation. Moreover, the concept of O-doping is proposed by introducing oxygen atoms to mostly replace bulk S atoms in the oxidation process of nanomaterials. The sulfur vacancy and doping were regarded as the main active site for the HzOR. Accordingly, the onset potential of the prepared electrocatalyst is 0.5 V vs. RHE in a 1 M KOH/0.1 M hydrazine electrolyte. This doping method can provide new ideas for improving the construction of hydrazine oxidation catalysts in the future.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000819873700003

However, inorganic nanomaterials with porous hollow structures are generally synthesized under harsh conditions or through complicated procedures, which impedes large-scale applications. Herein, we describe a novel solid-state chemical strategy without using templates and surfactants to construct hollow spindle-shaped BiPO4 (BP). A porous hollow structure containing rich surface oxygen vacancies was achieved by the heat treatment of BP in air at 600 degrees C (BP-Air-600 degrees C). Benefiting from the synergistic effect, the hollow porous structure increased light-harvesting efficiency by multiple reflection and the plentiful oxygen vacancies decreased recombination rate of electron-hole pairs. BP-Air-600 degrees C displays an excellent apparent rate constant for the degradation of methylene blue, which is about 4.7 times higher than that of BP. This study presents a green approach to rational design of porous hollow structured nanomaterials which possess richer surface oxygen defects and excellent photocatalytic performance.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000443935100023

Herein, a novel low-cost difunctional cobalt-nickel sulfide (Co3S4/Ni3S2) flower-like heterostructures are purposely loaded on the surface of polypyrrole (PPy) nanosheets on nickel foam (NF) via feasible and efficient electrodeposition and hydrothermal tactics. The unique hierarchical architecture of the PPy nanosheets and strong electron interaction in the Co3S4/Ni3S2 nanohybrid effectively offer sufficient specific surface area and regulate electronic configuration for expediting the electrocatalytic process. The theoretical simulations also provide convincing proof that the interface of the Co3S4/Ni3S2 heterostructures supplies a lower energy pathway for water adsorption and dissociation, and the electrons migration that occurs when heterostructures emerge is probably the root of the result above. Consequently, the as-fabricated Co3S4/Ni3S2@PPy/NF exhibits outstanding electrochemical activity of HER and OER requiring low overpotentials of 63 mV and 207 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm-2 in the alkaline electrolyte, respectively. When equipped in a two-electrode electrolyzer, the Co3S4/Ni3S2@PPy/NF electrode couple displays a low voltage of only 1.52 Vat 10 mA cm(-2), indicating its potential application in the field of the water electrolysis.

J	Liang, Chen; Wang, Xiaofang; Lyu, Qinggang								Experimental investigation on fluidized modification in gasification of preheated coal using oxygen and steam								FUEL				304						121375	10.1016/j.fuel.2021.121375		JUL 2021		NOV 15 2021	2021	A new coal gasification technology integrating advantages of a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) preheater and an entrained bed gasifier is proposed by gasification of preheated coal. Improvements of morphological properties and gasification reactivity can be gained for coal from the fluidized modification in the CFB preheater, which enhances the gasification reaction in the gasifier. In this study, the characteristics of the fluidized modification were investigated experimentally using oxygen and steam as gasifying agent on a bench-scale test rig. Effects of the air replacement by O-2-steam in gasifying agent, modification temperature and steam to coal ratio on gas and modified char of the preheater were illustrated. Thermogravimetric analyses and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the gasification reactivity and carbon structural order of the modified char, respectively. The steam gasification reaction in the preheater is enhanced after air is replaced by O-2-steam in the gasifying agent. The enhancement contributes to the formation of active carbon sites in the modified char and improves the gasification reactivity. The steam gasification reaction is also enhanced when the modification temperature increases from 858 to 952 degrees C, but active carbon sites in the modified char are first formed and then consumed. The highest gasification reactivity of modified char is obtained at 893 degrees C. The steam gasification reaction is enhanced by the increased steam to coal ratio from 0.55 to 1.07 as well and the gasification reactivity of modified char first increases and then decreases with the highest value at the steam to coal ratio of 0.87.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000691498100007

To investigate and leverage the oxygen-scavenging properties of rare-earth dopant species on the HAMR process, Y-doped and undoped TiO2 powders were synthesized and characterized. HAMR blends incorporating the synthesized TiO2 were reduced under forming gas atmospheres. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) characterization was performed prior to and following reduction. The TiO2 powders were observed to be dense and nanocrystalline. Following reduction, more extensive development of intermediate HAMR phases was observed as a result of Y-doping. The microstructure/phase evolution of the HAMR reduction phases was observed to deviate from the expected for dense TiO2 particles. Rapid restructuring of the TiO2 particle interiors was attributed to increased bulk diffusion rates of nanocrystalline materials. Doped nanocrystalline TiO2 powders were identified as potential alternative feedstocks for HAMR experiments. The byproduct MgO phase was observed to grow as a particle agglomerating network that is dense when formed at 750 degrees C and porous when formed at 900 degrees C.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2075-4701		WOS:000774113500001

The initial oxidation rate was determined, and the activation energy was shown to be almost zero (0.049 eV). To clarify the optimum oxidation conditions, the dependence of the SiO2 film growth rate on the total photon number and the photon density was investigated. The evolution of O-3 density after UV-light irradiation was experimentally measured, and the O(D-1) density change is discussed. O(D-1) density changes are successfully explained by using a second-order reaction model, indicating that a pulse supply of oxygen atoms is essential in the initial oxidation process. The uniform oxidation of 8 in. Si wafer has been carried out using a wafer-transfer type chamber by irradiating the wafer with KrF excimer laser light expanded linearly to the wafer width by a concave lens.

The spontaneous surface deformation on DiMethylAcrylAmide (DMAA) gelation surface is controlled by temperature, initiator concentration, and ambient oxygen. The effective surface roughness is defined using 2-dimensional photo data to characterize the surface deformation. Parameter dependence of the effective surface roughness is systematically investigated. We find that decrease of ambient oxygen, increase of initiator concentration, and high temperature tend to suppress the surface deformation in almost similar manner. That trend allows us to collapse all the data to a unified master curve. As a result, we finally obtain an empirical scaling form of the effective surface roughness. This scaling is useful to control the degree of surface patterning. However, the actual dynamics of this pattern formation is not still uncovered.

The CTO parameters (oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide evolution, change of carbonyl group content, change of the weight of the layer) and the change in the values of A were found to be kinetically interrelated. The dependence of the rate of change of individual CTO parameters and the magnitude of A on the thickness of the layer being oxidized and temperature can be described by a simple equation. The analysis of constants in this equation allows one to estimate the catalytic effect of the substrate in CTO. The dependence of experimental determined A values on contact time can be satisfactorily described by a simple expression based on the assumption that the magnitudes of A are controlled by two main competitive processes: the accumulation of oxygen-containing groups and oxidative cross-linking, causing the increase of A values, and reactions of oxidative destruction causing the decrease in A.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0021-8464			WOS:A1995UV80400001

The produced materials are characterized by X -Ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cyclic voltammetry and polarization measurements on stationary and rotation disk electrodes are employed for the electrochemical investigations. It is seen that all Pt-alpha-WC/C catalysts present specific activity for the ORR similar to that of a standard carbon supported Pt catalyst (Pt/C), while for the Pt-beta-WC1-X/C composites the specific activitiy is 3.6 times higher than that of Pt/C, when a carbide-to carbon load of 40 wt% is used. These differences in reactivity for the ORR may be associated to differences in the binding energy of adsorbed oxygen on Pt, introduced by the tungsten carbide substrates. Pt XANES results for the beta-WC/C1-x materials evidence a small increase in the Pt 5d band occupancy, which may lead to a weaker Pt-OHX. interaction, increasing the ORR kinetics.

A few investigations on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyzing activity of Fe-S materials were performed. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyzing activity or overall water splitting activity of Fe-S materials has not been studied extensively till date. Another technical aspect that suppresses the activity of the electrocatalyst is related to the usage of polymeric binders for electrode fabrication. Keeping these aspects in mind, iron sulfide was directly electrodeposited on nickel foam by varying the deposition potentials and duration of deposition. Ni-doped O-incorporated iron sulfide having the FeS2 lattice domains was obtained as the deposition product. The morphology, electronic structure, and charge carrier density in the valence band of the electrodeposits changed with the change in duration of electrodeposition, which in turn modulated the electrocatalytic activity. The electrode fabricated at -0.9 V potential after 30 min was found to be superior toward HER and OER. The electrodeposit obtained after 45 min showed comparable HER catalyzing activity. An asymmetric electrolyzer constructed with these electrodes showed a comparable water splitting activity to that of the RuO2(+)parallel to Pt/C(-) electrolyzer and also surpassed its activity at higher potential.									37	3	0	0	2	0	37			2168-0485			WOS:000494894200051

However, controversial results concerning OER/ORR performance exist between different types of cobalt-based catalysts, especially for Co(OH)(2) and Co3O4. To address this issue, we develop a facile electrochemical deposition method to grow Co(OH)(2) directly on the skeleton of carbon cloth, and further Co3O4 was obtained by post thermal treatment. The entire synthesis strategy removes the use of any binders and also avoids the additional preparation process (e.g., transfer and slurry coating) of final electrodes. This leads to a true comparison of the ORR/OER catalytic performance between Co(OH)(2) and Co3O4, eliminating uncertainties arising from the electrode preparation procedures. The surface morphologies, microstructures, and electrochemical behaviors of prepared Co(OH)(2) and Co3O4 catalysts were systemically investigated by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and electrochemical characterization methods. The results revealed that the electrochemically deposited Co(OH)(2) was in the form of vertically aligned nanosheets with average thickness of about 4.5 nm. After the thermal treatment in an air atmosphere, Co(OH)(2) nanosheets were converted into mesoporous Co3O4 nanosheets with remarkably increased electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). Although the ORR/OER activity normalized by the geometric surface area of mesoporous Co3O4 nanosheets is higher than that of Co(OH)(2) nanosheets, the performance normalized by the ECSA of the former is lower than that of the latter. Considering the superior apparent overall activity and durability, the Co3O4 catalyst has been further evaluated by integrating it into a Zn-air battery prototype. The Co3O4 nanosheets in situ supported on carbon cloth cathode enable the assembled Zn-air cells with large peak power density of 106.6 mW cm(-2), low charge and discharge overpotentials (0.67 V), high discharge rate capability (1.18 V at 20 mA cm(-2)), and long cycling stability (400 cycles), which are comparable or even superior to the mixture of state-of-the-art Pt/C and RuO2 cathode.									97	4	0	0	1	0	98			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000405764700064	28535344

Here we employ a genetic approach based on the dgd1 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate the function of DGDC in thylakoid membranes. The primary defect in the genetically well-characterized dgd1 mutant resulted in a 90% reduction of the DGDC content. The mutant showed a decreased photosystem II (PSII) to photosystem I ratio. In vivo room-and low-temperature (77 K) chlorophyll fluorescence measurements with thylakoid preparations are in agreement with a drastically altered excitation energy allocation to the reaction centers. Quantification of pigment-binding apoproteins and pigments supports an altered stoichiometry of individual pigment-protein complexes in the mutant. Most strikingly, an increase in the amount of peripheral light-harvesting complexes of PSII relative to the inner antenna complexes and the PSII reaction center/core complexes was observed. Regardless of the severe alterations in thylakoid organization, photosynthetic oxygen evolution was virtually not compromised in dgd1 mutant leaves.									75	1	0	0	74	0	80			0032-0889			WOS:A1997YF80000035	9390443

The understanding of its atomic structure and layer stacking behavior at low temperature is far from complete. This work systematically revealed how the oxygen-containing groups density, type and temperature affect the spacing of multilayer GO layers through the ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulation method. We found that the density of oxygen-containing groups is the main variable that controls the distribution of surface oxidation areas and the degree of distortion of the graphene sheets. With the increase of C/O ratio, the distribution of oxygen-containing functional groups tends to aggregate, and the deformation of graphite flakes becomes more serious. The layer spacing of multilayer GO is affected by temperature. The types of released small molecules, the degree of pyrolysis of the graphene skeleton and the interlayer spacing are all affected by OH/O ratio. With more hydroxyl groups, it is easier to release long O-H chains, and the graphene skeleton is less likely to be pyrolyzed. This in-depth investigation has helped develop a fundamental understanding of the atomic structure of graphene oxide and has laid basic foundations for an effective control of graphene layer distance and properties.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000729897500003

In toluene/CHCl3 solution, the process reaches an intrinsic enantioselectivity of up to S = 14.4 (er = 93.5:6.5). The reversible reaction proceeds in two steps: A fast initial reaction approaches a quasi-equilibrium with KR/S = 4.5, followed by a second, slow racemization phase approaching Krac = 9. A simple mechanistic model featuring a living ion-pairing catalysis with full reversibility is proposed. Deuterium transfer from co-solvent CDCl3 to product 2 and isolation of a Michael conjugate formed from 2 and 1 demonstrate the intermediacy of flavanone enolate ion pairs. A kinetic model shows good agreement with the experimentally observed, peculiar, time-dependent evolution of the species concentrations and the enantiomeric excess of 2. The reaction is a chemical model of the chalcone isomerase enzymatic reaction. Furthermore, it is an ideal model for studying the characteristic behavior of reversible asymmetric catalyses close to their equilibria.									37	2	0	0	5	0	38			1434-193X	1099-0690		WOS:000308939800017

Deletion of short segments of the large extrinsic loop results in mutants incapable of evolving oxygen. Alterations in psbC, the gene encoding CP43, are introduced into Synechocystis 6803 by transformation and homologous recombination. Specifically, plasmid constructs bearing the site-directed mutations are introduced into a deletion strain where the portion of the gene encoding the area of mutation has been deleted and replaced by a gene conferring antibiotic resistance. We have constructed a deletion strain of Synechocystis appropriate for the introduction of mutations in the large extrinsic loop of CP43 and have used it successfully to produce site-directed mutants.									18	0	0	0	10	0	18			1052-6781			MEDLINE:9274055	9274055

The results indicated that the introduced Lignin could helpfully reduce the cyclization degree of fibers, accomplishing the stabilization process at a lower temperature. Meanwhile, the introduced Lignin could efficiently attenuate the exothermal rate of fibers, accomplishing the stabilization process with a higher heating rate. Moreover, the abundant oxygen-containing groups in Lignin acted as a free-radical scavenger to slow down the free radical cyclization rate of fibers in the low stabilization temperature stage (<240 degrees C), while the carboxyl group in Lignin served as an initiating agent to accelerate the ionic cyclization of fibers in the high stabilization stage (>280 degrees C). It has been established that the oxygen structural unit of Lignin could be a promising candidate to facilitate the stabilization behaviors of PAN-derived fibers. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Mohite, Santosh V.; Xing, Ruimin; Li, Bingyue; Latthe, Sanjay S.; Zhao, Yong; Li, Xiying; Mao, Liqun; Liu, Shanhu								Spatial Compartmentalization of Cobalt Phosphide in P-Doped Dual Carbon Shells for Efficient Alkaline Overall Water Splitting								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				59	3			1996	2004		10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b03363				FEB 3 2020	2020	Highly durable and earth-abundant bifunctional catalysts with low cell voltage are desirable for alkaline overall water splitting in the industrial fields. Herein, a novel carbon-based CoP hybrid with spatial compartmentalization of CoP nanoparticles (NPs) in P-doped dual carbon shells is achieved via a cheap Co-glycerate-template strategy. Benefitted from the uniform atomic blending of Co2+ ions in the Co-glycerate precursors, CoP NPs in situ formed in the confined space with NaH2PO2 as phosphorus source during the annealing process; meanwhile, glycerate suffered carbonization and transformed into P-doped dual carbon shells during the annealing process, including interior thin carbon coating, closely encircled CoP NP, and peripheral hollow carbon sphere loading a lot of CoP NPs. Not only does spatial compartmentalization of CoP NPs avoid the aggregation and expose more active sites but also P-doped dual carbon shells improve the conductivity and durability of the catalyst. As expected, the optimized hybrid exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activities in alkaline media, such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) overpotential of 101 mV, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 280 mV, and a low cell voltage of 1.66 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, durability and stability are greatly improved under harsh electrochemical conditions. The current strategy shades new insight into the development of carbon-based transition metal phosphides (TMP) catalysts for electrocatalysis applications.									34	1	0	0	0	0	34			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000511246600043	31922740

A major challenge in this chemistry is sensitivity of these low-valent metal sites to more abundant O-2. Since O-2 is a stronger oxidant than CO2 and isolated from the obvious competitive inhibition of CO2, partial reduction of O-2 leads to formation of reactive oxygen species like O-2(-) and H2O2, which are deleterious to the catalyst itself. An iron porphyrin complex appended with four ferrocene groups in its distal site is demonstrated to reduce CO2 unabated in the presence of O-2 as it can reduce O-2 to benign H2O under the same conditions. Further investigations reveal that iron porphyrins, in general, reduce CO2 selectively in the presence of O-2. The aforementioned selectivity is derived from a 500 times faster rate of reaction of CO2 with Fe(0) porphyrin relative to O-2 despite a higher driving force for the latter.									40	3	0	0	2	0	40			2155-5435			WOS:000467335600016

The online dissolution investigation using the highly sensitive online analytical methodology of electrochemical flow cell coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry reveals that the addition of Ru nanoparticles inhibits Pt dissolution presumably because of three effects: (i) suppression of Pt oxide formation, (ii) sacrificial corrosion of Ru, and (iii) lowering of local surface pH. The Ru nanoparticles, however, also lead to a decrease of the amount of crystal structure ordering, which in turn is one of the reasons for the increase of the corrosion of Cu. By measuring the potential of total zero charge it is shown that Ru decoration does not alter the electrochemical properties of the native Pt surface. Finally, Ru decoration of the Pt-based electrocatalyst is shown to present a viable approach to enhance the platinum corrosion resistance, which is confirmed by thin-film rotating disc electrode accelerated degradation tests.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000458706000024

The anode was prepared by the Pechini method and characterized by SEM. Linear sweep voltammetries on a Ti-RuO2 rotating disk electrode (RDE) confirmed that cyanide is oxidized at 0.45 < E < 1.0 V vs SHE, while significant oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurred. Bulk oxidation of free cyanide was investigated on Ti-RuO2 meshes fitted into a filter -press electrolyzer. Bulk electrolyzes were performed at constant potentials of 0.85 V and 0.95 V and at different mean linear flow rates ranging between 1.2 and 4.9 cm s(-1). The bulk anodic oxidation of cyanide at 0.85 V and 3.7 cm s(-1) achieved a degradation of 94%, with current efficiencies of 38% and an energy consumption of 24.6 kWh m(-3).

However, a cost-effective and scalable technique for synthesizing these nanosheets remains elusive. Here, we report a novel strategy for producing silicon nanosheets on a large scale through the simultaneous molten-salt-induced exfoliation and chemical reduction of natural clay. The silicon nanosheets thus synthesized have a high surface area, are ultrathin (similar to 5 nm) and contain mesoporous structures derived from the oxygen vacancies in the clay. These advantages make the nanosheets a highly suitable photocatalyst with an exceptionally high activity for the generation of hydrogen from a water-methanol mixture. Further, when the silicon nanosheets are combined with platinum as a cocatalyst, they exhibit high activity in KOH (15.83 mmol H-2 per s per mol Si) and excellent photocatalytic activity with respect to the evolution of hydrogen from a water-methanol mixture (723 mu mol H-2 per h per g Si).									43	2	0	0	6	0	43			1884-4049	1884-4057		WOS:000373890300006

Dynamical mass measurements are available only for few (similar to 10) BHs in X-ray binaries, while theoretical models strongly depend on the hydrodynamics of supernova (SN) explosions and on the evolution of massive stars. In this paper, we present and discuss the mass spectrum of compact remnants that we obtained with sevn, a new public population-synthesis code, which couples the parsec stellar evolution tracks with up-to-date recipes for SN explosion (depending on the carbon-oxygen mass of the progenitor, on the compactness of the stellar core at pre-SN stage and on a recent two-parameter criterion based on the dimensionless entropy per nucleon at pre-SN stage). sevn can be used both as a stand-alone code and in combination with direct-summation N-body codes (starlab, higpus). The parsec stellar evolution tracks currently implemented in sevn predict significantly larger values of the carbon-oxygen core mass with respect to previous models. For most of the SN recipes we adopt, this implies substantially larger BH masses at low metallicity (a parts per thousand currency sign2 x 10(-3)), than other population synthesis codes. The maximum BH mass found with sevn is similar to 25, 60 and 130 M-aS (TM) at metallicity Z = 2 x 10(-2), 2 x 10(-3) and 2 x 10(-4), respectively. Mass loss by stellar winds plays a major role in determining the mass of BHs for very massive stars (a parts per thousand yen90 M-aS (TM)), while the remnant mass spectrum depends mostly on the adopted SN recipe for lower progenitor masses. We discuss the implications of our results for the transition between neutron star and BH mass, and for the expected number of massive BHs (with mass > 25 M-aS (TM)) as a function of metallicity.									210	5	0	0	3	0	212			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000360846400055

Degradation of humic acid (HA) confirmed that PS can be activated even under 0.67 mA cm(-2). The synergistic effect between PS-based and Co/AC electrochemical oxidation reduced the PS dosage, hydraulic retention time, and current density. PS dosing neutralized the effluent, overcoming the problem of alkaline effluent. Moreover, the negative effect of NO3- was eliminated due to PS dosing. Electron spin resonance detection illustrated that (OH)-O-center dot was generated and dominated in the process of PS activation. PS also promoted the production of atomic H* in Co/AC bed, and improved the stability of active species. Quenching experiments of radicals revealed that HA degradation was mainly fulfilled by the (OH)-O-center dot and SO4-center dot radicals that were adsorbed on the particle electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry curves indicated that PS dosing increased the overpotential for oxygen evolution of Co/AC electrode, inhibiting the side reaction of oxygen.									28	2	0	0	10	0	30			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000623245500003

This work investigates an Al-incorporated Ni-ferrite (NiFe2O4) particle to demonstrate a detailed deactivation mechanism induced by redox stress and suggests a strategy to prolong the lifespan of the particle. It is revealed that the grain coalescence and surface densification hamper the redox performance by decreased electrical conductivity and retarded gas transfer, eventually leading to deactivation over the cycles. The formation of a spinel solid solution with aluminum (Al) incorporation was found to be an effective strategy to prevent densification and maintain the long-term performance. Al incorporation at 3.3 wt % is determined as the best particle that can maintain the highest H-2 yield (8.2 mmol H-2.g(-1)) and average production rate (0.41 mmol H-2.g(-1).min(-1)) for 11 cycles.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2168-0485			WOS:000717346600016

It can be well preserved during subduction-zone metamorphism for its high refractoriness and low solubility in fluid and melt. The chemical composition and mineral inclusions preserved in garnet can be used to constrain the P-T conditions, metamorphic evolution, and fluid action. The chemical composition of garnet is related to many factors, such as whole-rock composition, P-T conditions, garnet-forming metamorphic reactions and the assemblage of coexisting minerals. Thus the major elements, trace elements, oxygen isotopes, mineral inclusions and their relations in garnet should all be taken into account when it is used to constrain the metamorphic P-T evolution in UHP metamorphic rocks. In addition, in-situ analyses of U-Pb isotopes and trace elements in accessory minerals such as zircon and/or monazite inclusions in garnet can place a direct constraint on the time of metamorphic garnet growth. Through studying the history of garnet growth during subduction-zone metamorphism, it can not only provide petrologic and geochemical evidence for the processes to produce garnet-bearing metamorphic rocks, but also give clues to the origin of garnet. These are very important to the chemical dynamics of subduction-zone metamorphism.									9	11	0	0	0	0	15			1000-0569	2095-8927		WOS:000288468500006

Spatially resolved techniques, such as scanning/transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM), are widely applied to address this challenge. However, battery materials are susceptible to electron beam damage, complicating the data interpretation. In this study, we demonstrate that, under electron beam irradiation, the surface and bulk of battery materials undergo chemical and structural evolution equivalent to that observed during charge-discharge cycling. In a lithiated NiO nanosheet, a Li2CO3-containing surface reaction layer (SRL) was gradually decomposed during electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) acquisition. For cycled LiNi0.4Mn0.4Co0.18Ti0.02O2 particles, repeated electron beam irradiation induced a phase transition from an R (3) over barm layered structure to an Fm (3) over barm rock-salt structure, which is attributed to the stoichiometric lithium and oxygen removal from R (3) over barm 3a and 6c sites, respectively. Nevertheless, it is still feasible to preserve pristine chemical environments by minimizing electron beam damage, for example, using fast electron imaging and spectroscopy. Finally, the present study provides examples of electron beam damage on lithium-ion battery materials and suggests that special attention is necessary to prevent misinterpretation of experimental results.									85	2	0	0	6	0	89			2045-2322			WOS:000338991700001	25027190

Herein, graphitized and curved carbon nanochambers decorated with boron and nitrogen tailored highly-dispersed cobalt moieties (B,N-Co/GCCN) were developed via a feasible strategy combining room temperature crosslinking and in situ catalytic graphitization processes. The graphitized and curved carbon nanochambers enhanced the electron transfer and structural stability and tailored the electronic structure of metal active sites. Moreover, the in situ coupled amorphous carbon and cobalt-nitrogen/boron moieties represented catalytically active sites for catalyzing ORR. Notably, the selected B doping made the electron density of Co of B,N-Co/GCCN higher compared to N-Co/GCCN, promoting the adsorption and activation of oxygen molecule. Benefiting from this integrated structure, the B,N-Co/GHC exhibited high ORR activity comparable to commercial Pt/C catalyst, along with robust electrocatalytic stability with little change in half-wave potential after 5000 cycles. Impressively, a homemade zinc-air battery driven by B,N-Co/GHC showed higher discharging performance than the one driven by Pt/C, demonstrating promising application prospect.

ASTROBIOLOGY				17	11			1173	1181		10.1089/ast.2016.1574				NOV 2017	2017	Since Earth's biochemistry is carbon-based and water-borne, the main strategies for searching for life elsewhere are follow the carbon and follow the water. Recently, however, there is a growing focus on the prospect that putative exotic life on other planets could rely on unearthly biochemistries. Here, we hypothesize a novel oxygen-free organic chemistry for supporting potential exotic biosystems, which is named CHN biochemistry. This oxygen-free CHN biochemistry starts from simple oxygen-free species (including hydrocarbons, hydrogen cyanide, and nitriles) and produces a range of functional macromolecules that may function in similar ways to terran macromolecules, such as sugars (cyanosugars), acids (cyanoacids), amino acids (amino cyanoacids), and nucleobases (cyanonucleobases). These CHN macromolecules could further interact with each other to generate higher cyanoester and cyanoprotein systems. In addition, theoretical calculations indicate that the energy changes of some reactions are consistent with their counterparts in Earth's biochemistry.

Here, we present an in situ electrochemical coordination tuning of cobalt sites for OER in a strong base, where an electrolyzing soluble cobalt-2,2'-bipyridine (Co-bpy) complex partially splits the bpy ligand, leading to the deposition of active Co sites with fine coordination at room temperature. We deposited the Co sites while catalyzing water oxidation at the same condition so that this catalyst can adapt the hostile alkaline condition. This robust coordination environment involving the remaining bpy and generated (oxy)hydroxide ligands (Co-BH catalyst) sustains the highly improved OER activity over 500 h at 200 mA cm(-2), outperforming other fragile Co sites with only (oxy)hydroxides. In addition, this work presents an efficient tuning of metal coordination environments to in situ generate highly active and stable metal sites in alkaline electrolytes for water splitting.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000502169900108

However, for 2e-WOR and 2e-ORR to hold any industrial relevance, inexpensive, stable, highly efficient, selective, and environmentally benign electrocatalysts must be developed. Designing a catalyst to meet such an extensive criterion remains a challenge. Single-atom catalysts (SACs), combining the benefits of heterogenous and homogenous catalysis, have drawn immense attention due to their distinguished catalytic performance. Ergo, we aim towards the exploration of a bifunctional SAC material capable of catalyzing the 2e-WOR and 2e-ORR to produce H2O2. Through density functional theory (DFT) calculations we investigate the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of SnO2-supported SACs. Considering 16 different single metal atoms, various promising candidates were identified. Particularly, Mn, Ti and Fe were found to be markedly active and selective 2e-WOR catalysts and W for the 2e-ORR. This work highlights the immense potential of bifunctional systems; a route towards increasing H2O2 yields while simultaneously minimizing manufacturing complexity and cost.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000722283100001

However, their poor oxygen resistance causes a great loss of electronic properties and surface reactivity, which significantly inhibits the fabrication, the understanding of the chemical nature and full exploitation of the potential of MXene-based materials. Herein we report a facile carbon nanoplating strategy for efficiently stabilizing the MXenes against structural degradation caused by spontaneous oxidation, which provides a material platform for developing MXene-based materials with attractive structure and properties. Hierarchical MoS2/Ti3C2-MXene@C nanohybrids with excellent structural stability, electrical properties and strong interfacial coupling are fabricated by assembling carbon coated few-layered MoS2 nanoplates on carbon-stabilized Ti3C2 MXene, exhibiting exceptional performance for Li storage and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Remarkably, ultra-long cycle life of 3000 cycles with high capacities but extremely slow capacity loss of 0.0016% per cycle is achieved for Li storage at a very high rate of 20 A g(-1). They are also highly active HER electrocatalyst with very positive onset potential, low overpotential and long-term stability in acidic solution. Superb properties highlight the great promise of MXene-based materials in cornerstone applications of energy storage and conversion.									331	35	0	0	14	0	343			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000403911800007	28436058

During water electrolysis, the steady magnetic field reduces the overvoltage reactions of the hydrogen and oxygen evolution and enhances the process productivity. The obtained data indicate that in addition to the conductive influence of the steady field on the electrolyte, where an electric current passes, the same effect occurs for gas bubbles that are charged at the time they leave the electrodes. It is shown that hydrogen bubbles are negatively charged, and oxygen is positive in acidic and alkaline pH regions, as well as at the zero point at pH similar to 2.5. Trajectories of the motion of bubbles in the initial period are close to parabola. This is due to the action of an orthogonally directed Lorentz force F-L and a buoyancy force F-A. The vertical run of the trajectories indicates that F-L -> 0, which means that the charges on the bubbles disappear. It has been suggested that the negative charge on hydrogen bubbles is created by hydrated electrons emitted from the cathode, which quickly interact with other particles in the electrolyte solution.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0024-998X	1574-0579		WOS:000459139400009

We find that some additives favor the formation of superoxide over the formation of lithium peroxide. We have tried to relate the influence of the additive on superoxide formation to properties of the pure solvent: Additives with a large donor number do not exert any influence. Although all additives with a large acceptor number facilitate superoxide formation, we have ascribed the effect to the polarity of the additive. We discuss in the present paper how the polarity of the additive increases solvent rearrangement energies. Following the Marcus Hush theory this introduces an activation barrier for the second electron transfer. Therefore, electrochemical oxygen reduction stops at the superoxide stage, and larger overpotentials are required to facilitate the second electron transfer. From a broader perspective this finding is of significance as solvent effects in electrocatalysis have so far been neither well investigated nor understood.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1932-7447			WOS:000400534100023

Among renewable energy resources, solar energy is by far the largest exploitable resource. Photosynthesis provides a blueprint for solar energy conversion and storage in fuels. Natural green leaves capture and convert solar energy into chemical fuel through photosynthesis. The two reactions are the splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen (water splitting) and the reduction of CO2 into carbohydrates (CO2 reduction). Inspired by natural leaves, constructing artificial leaves by mimicking photosynthesis to capture solar energy, split water into hydrogen and oxygen, and convert atmospheric carbon dioxide, thus producing various forms of environmentally clean fuels, is of high significance. Many major advances in this research area are highlighted in this Minireview. Some typical successful prototypes from natural systems that can be used for the biomimetic design of artificial leaves are particularly emphasized.									56	2	0	0	5	1	58			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000288081300006

Since discovery of high entropy alloys (HEAs) in 2004, the concept of high entropy has been enlarged to ceramic, sulfide, fluoride, and phosphide materials. Correspondingly, their nearly infinite compositional space has been expanded to refractories, lanthanides, and recently platinum group metals (PGMs). Among these types of alloys, PGM-based HEM nanoparticles (HEM-NPs) are of great scientific interest because of the ability to continuously tailor their properties by tuning the ratio of noble to non-noble metal species. Besides, the functional properties of bulk HEAs such as shape memory effect, magnetocaloric, and superconductivity are attracting more and more attentions. In this review, we discuss the progress in the PGM-based HEMs focusing on catalytic performance of nano-particles and functional properties of bulk materials. We begin with the synthesis of HEM-NPs emphasizing on the ability of alloying immiscible elements into single phase NPs. Then, we summarize the reported catalytic/electrocatalytic applications of HEM-NPs for different types of reactions, including CO2/CO reduction reactions, CO oxidation, methanol oxidation, oxygen reduction reaction and electrochemical water splitting. We present a case-by-case discussion to clarify how various metal species can play distinct role in chemically complex structure of HEM-NPs under different reaction conditions. We further try to give a picture of the current state of shape memory, magnetocaloric, and superconductivity effects in the bulk PGM-based HEAs. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

It continues to attract interest as a half-reaction in electrochemical water-splitting to hydrogen and dioxygen in abiotic systems. There is a corresponding interest in improving the activity of nonprecious metal electrocatalysts for this reaction. One of the most well-known water oxidation catalysts is amorphous cobalt oxide. This catalyst can operate in water at neutral pH with low overpotentials and is known to continually reform under catalytic conditions, a type of self healing. The active sites for the electrocatalytic reaction are thought to be adjacent octahedral cobalt sites in the bulk material, meaning that only the surface of the material is active. Thus, catalytic activity could be improved by increasing the surface area to volume ratio of the active material. To this effect, codeposited microporous materials such as metal organic frameworks (MOFs) can be used to control the morphology of cobalt oxide thin films. This study employs a highly stable MOF, UiO-66, to act as a templating agent for an electrodeposited cobalt oxide film. By depositing this porous crystalline MOF on the electrode surface prior to the electrochemical growth of the catalyst, we show the catalytic current density of the cobalt oxide material can be increased relative to the unmodified material. Through cyclic voltammetry (CV), controlled potential electrolysis (CPE), and electron microscopy studies, we show that the increase in current density is likely due to an increase in the effective surface area of the catalyst resulting from catalyst deposition around the MOF particles.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2574-0962			WOS:000469885300038

Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) porous sandwich cathode architecture constructed through the self-assembly of the in situ growing Fe2O3 nanorods on graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (CNS) together with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (Fe2O3@CNS-CNTs) is presented. The formation of Fe-N structure can offer the active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and Fe2O3 nanorods provide the nucleation sites for the growth of Li2O2. Due to the 3D sandwich structure, the Li2O2 nanosheets can be deposited in the inner space of the 3D structure with an embedded mode, which confines the size and distribution of Li2O2. This work offers more possibilities for the realization of the controllable Li2O2 deposition, holding great promise in enlightening the hybrid cathode design for Li-O-2 batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000606934300001

The effects of these parameters on the Co-OEC activity is explored by (a) examination of the intermediate range structural order within films through high energy X-ray scattering and pair distribution function analysis, and (b) direct measurement of film conductivity, which has been measured with an interdigitated array microelectrode. We find that the nature of the anion is a critical determinant of the size of cobaltate clusters comprising the Co-OEC thin films which in turn is a critical determinant of film conductivity. Improved conductivity of the Co-OEC films with the size of the metalate clusters is consistent with a model for electron conduction that arises from the hopping of hole equivalents delocalized over metalate clusters. The hole hopping is fast relative to the rate-determining step of OER, which may become limited by proton transport within the films.									25	0	0	0	3	0	25			2574-0962			WOS:000458706900002

The model is first applied to steady one-dimensional simulation results obtained with detailed chemistry. The effects on the fluorescence intensity of the model parameters are examined to explore the dominant processes. The dominant interference process in the experiments carried out to date is the absorption of incident laser light by the high concentration of OH in and behind the reaction zone. The model is then applied to unsteady two-dimensional simulation results obtained with reduced chemical schemes to obtain synthetic PLIF image. The results demonstrate good qualitative agreement between the experimental and calculated laser-induced-fluorescence intensities. The model limitations and the experimental uncertainties are discussed together with a critical evaluation of the modeling approach. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Further, in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy has been used to monitor the evolution of surface species during precise transient gas composition changes using high-speed gas switching valves. The results show that platinum has a sufficiently strong interaction with all the supports so as to form small platinum particles. The smallest sizes are observed for the Pt/Ce sample. The alumina containing samples show, in contrast to the Pt/Ce sample, a decreased methane conversion with increasing oxygen concentration and a clear kinetic bistability between increasing and decreasing oxygen concentrations. The bistable kinetics is likely connected to oxidation and reduction of platinum occurring for different stoichiometric gas mixtures depending on the history of the system, for which an oxidation of the platinum particles effectively inhibits the dissociative adsorption of methane leading to a low reaction rate. It is shown for the alumina containing samples that the adverse effects of oxygen excess can be circumvented by the use of periodic operation so that the average methane conversion is improved. Further, the Pt/Ce sample seems to exhibit additional active sites at the platinum-ceria interface explaining the generally higher conversion of methane for this sample.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000341934700006

Chronocoulometry of films with known nickel concentrations reveals that a total of four electrons per nickel site comprise the signature anodic peak at 1.32 V during the first oxidative scan, and two electrons are passed through the associated cathodic peak on the reverse scan. The anodic and cathodic signals each contain two electrons on the successive scans. Catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was detected within the anodic peak, which is at a lower potential than is widely assumed. In order to rationalize these experimental results, we propose that the four-electron oxidation event is the conversion of the film from nickel(II) hydroxide ([Ni-II-OH](-)) to a higher valent nickel peroxide species (e.g., Ni-IV-OO or Ni-III-OO.). The subsequent reduction of the nickel peroxide species is confined by a chemical step resulting in the accumulation of [Ni-II-OOH](-), which is then oxidized by two electrons to form Ni-IV-OO during the subsequent oxidative scan on the time scale of a cyclic voltammetric experiment. Our proposed mechanism and the experimental determination that each nickel site is oxidized by four electrons helps link the myriad of seemingly disparate literature data related to OER catalysis by nickel electrodes. The faster catalysis that occurs at higher oxidative potentials is derived from a minority species and is not elaborated here.									66	0	0	0	4	0	66			0002-7863			WOS:000370215400017	26829375

Homoplasmic mtDNA somatic mutations and novel variants were identified in nearly all samples. Southern blot analysis and direct sequencing of mutation sites showed that the intracellular mass of mtDNA was greatly (6-8-fold) increased in pancreatic cancer cells in relation to corresponding normal cells; this property accounted for and greatly facilitated the identification of these mutations among the dense desmoplastic host reaction characteristic of primary pancreatic cancers. Structural characteristics and mathematical modeling of the evolution of mtDNA mutations suggested that many of the mutations identified might represent a random evolution of homoplasmic variants, rather than necessarily being a product of selective pressures, Complete sequencing of the nuclear MnSOD gene, which protects cells from the mitogenic and toxic effects of oxygen radicals, did not reveal any mutations. Nevertheless, the nearly ubiquitous prevalence and high copy number of mtDNA mutations suggest that they be considered of promising clinical utility in diagnostic applications.									183	9	1	0	142	0	196			0008-5472	1538-7445		WOS:000167255400014	11245424

In this work, non-thermal plasma oxidation is combined with electroreduction to achieve an efficient two-step NH3 synthesis. A Ti bubbler is introduced in the first step of plasma activation of air to effectively produce nitrate/nitrite (NOx-) in an absorption solution, and the production rate achieves the highest value of 55.29 mmol h(-1); the obtained NOx- aqueous solution is directly employed as catholyte for the second step of electroreduction with oxygen vacancy-rich Co3O4 nanoparticles as the catalyst. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the introduction of oxygen vacancies endows their adjacent Co atoms with improved activity, which promotes adsorption and hydrogenation of NOx-, meanwhile suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction. Thus the oxygen vacancy-rich Co3O4 NPs present a significant NH3 production rate of 39.60 mg h(-1) cm(-2), high Faradaic efficiency of 96.08% and a large current density (376.48 mA cm(-2)), outperforming the previously reported ones including N-2 or NOx- electroreduction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000842344600001

We have fabricated SnS thin-film photoelectrodes by spin coating mixed-phase SnS nanocrystals synthesized via a hot-injection technique on glass/ Cr/ Au substrates. The obtained SnS thin films can be transformed into SnS2 by introducing structural phase changes via a facile low-vacuum annealing protocol in the presence of sulfur. This sulfurization process enables the insertion of sulfur atoms between layers of SnS and results in the generation of shallow donors that alter the mechanism for water splitting. The SnS2 thin films are used as stable photocatalysts to drive the oxygen evolution reaction, and the light-current density of 0.195 mA/ cm2 at 0.8 V vs. Ag/(A)gCl can be achieved due to the high carrier density, lower charge transfer resistance, and a suitable reaction band position. Based on a combination of UV-Vis spectroscopy (ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy), cyclic voltammetry and Mott-Schottky analysis, the band positions and band gaps of SnS and SnS2 relative to the electrolyte are determined and a detailed mechanism for water splitting is presented. Our results demonstrate the potential of layered tin sulfide compounds as promising photocatalysts for efficient and large-scale water splitting.									29	2	0	0	2	0	31			2073-4344			WOS:000411566400009

Photo-electrochemical Effect in the Amorphous Cobalt Oxide Water Oxidation Catalyst Cobalt-Phosphate (CoPi)								ACS ENERGY LETTERS								3129	3138		10.1021/acsenergylett.2c01560		AUG 2022			2022	The cobalt-phosphate amorphous oxyhydroxide water-splitting catalyst, CoPi, is widely investigated because of its reactivity and self-repair analogous to the oxygen-evolving catalyst in Photosystem II. CoPi films show optical absorption features analogous to those seen more generally in transition metal oxides and oxygen-evolving catalysts. Possible photocatalytic properties of CoPi have, up until now, not been considered. Herein, we report on the finding of wavelength-dependent photo-electrochemical responses in CoPi. Red light excitation (623 nm) into a manifold of charge transfer and d-d electronic transitions was seen to produce photoanodic current responses that enhance OER, while blue light excitation (415 nm) within the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer transition was found to produce photocathodic responses that inhibit OER and oxidative repair. These results demonstrate intrinsic wave-length-dependent photo-electrochemistry in CoPi and opportunities to use light-excited states in CoPi, and potentially other transition metal oxides, to enhance OER and to track reaction mechanisms using light-triggered, pump-probe techniques.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2380-8195			WOS:000864196900001

The optical gap is found to be 1.94 eV and the transition is indirectly allowed. The chemical analysis reveals an oxygen deficiency and the oxide exhibits n-type conductivity, confirmed by a negative thermopower. The plot log a vs 1/T shows linearity in the range (400-670 K) with the donor levels at 0.14 eV below the conduction band and a break at similar to 590 K, attributed to the ionization of the donors. The conduction occurs by small polaron hopping through mixed valences Fe2+/3+ with an electron mobility mu(400 K) of 10(-3) V cm(2) s(-1), alpha-Fe2O3 exhibits long term chemical stability in neutral solution and has been characterized photoelectrochemically to assess its activity as bias-free O-2-photoanode. The flat band potential V-fb (-0.45 V-SCE) and the electron density N-D (1.63 x 10(18) cm(-3)) were determined, respectively, by extrapolating the linear part to C-2 = 0 and the slope of the Mott Schottky plot. At pH 6.5, the valence band (+1.35 V-SCE) is suitably positioned with respect to the O-2/H2O level (+0.62 V) and alpha-Fe2O3 has been evaluated for the chemical energy storage through the photocatalytic reaction: (2SO(3)(2-) + 2H(+) -> S2O32- + O-2 + H2O, Delta G = 213.36 kJ mol(-1)). The best photoactivity occurs in SO32- solution (0.025 M, pH 8) with an oxygen rate evolution of 7.8 cm(3) (g catalyst)(-1) h(-1). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a novel NixCo1-x(OH)2 coupled with NiFe amorphous compound array growing on nickel foam substrate (expressed as NixCo1-x(OH)2/ NiFe-AM) was developed by facile hydrothermal and electrodeposition methods. Significantly, NixCo1-x(OH)2/NiFe-AM with this unique structural exhibits superior activity and stability in the two half reactions of water electrolysis. In addition, when tested in an alkaline electrolyte with a current density of 10 mA cm-2, the overpotentials of HER and OER was 157 mV and 196 mV (60 mA cm-2), respectively. The stability can up to 60 h.

The entry of these ions from natural leaching processes is discussed. Natural leaching processes include biological and chemical aqueous oxidation of sulphidic waste rock and tailings. The effects of biological and non-biological oxidation of pyrite on the solubilization process and the mobility of dissolved copper and zinc were evaluated using experimental data and mathematical modelling. The diffusion and convection of atmospheric oxygen through unsaturated but moist pyrite deposits are shown to be rate-limited for establishing the acidity and metal ion flux in the groundwater regime.The evolution of acidic water conditions may take several years to develop, depending on the inherent kinetics and neutralizing capacity of the calciferous components of the waste rock or tailings. Chemical and biochemical reactions play an important role during the onset of acidic conditions, while diffusive and convective transport are important later. The results of this evaluation were used to construct a practical model to predict acid mine drainage problems and suggest covers as a method of abatement to reduce oxygen and hydraulic transport.									9	1	0	0	4	0	10			0304-386X			WOS:A1992HY40300007

However, improving the microstructure and electronic structure of the material to enhance their photocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution remains a challenge. We designed and reported two analogous CMPs including CMP-1 and CMP-2 that contain triazine and dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide units, which were prepared by Pd-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction. The main difference of two CMPs is that the triazine units are connected to benzene unit (CMP-1) or thiophene unit (CMP-2). Both of the CMPs exhibit excellent light capture capability, and compared with CMP-2, CMP-1 has faster separation rates and lower recombination rates for the charge carriers (electron/hole), and then, a higher hydrogen evolution rate was obtained from water decomposition reaction. We find the H-2 production rate of CMP-1 can be up to 9,698.53 mu mol g(-1)h (-1), which is about twice of that of CMP-2. This work suggests that molecular design is a potent method to optimize the photocatalytic performance toward hydrogen evolution of the CMPs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2296-2646			WOS:000791381500001	35402380

The composition and morphology of Mn-x-Co3O4/CNTs were thoroughly analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The as-prepared dandelion-type Mn-x-Co3O4 has nano-needles with a diameter of 75 +/- 10 nm. The numbers of active sites and oxygen vacancies for the catalytic process were increased by the incorporation of Mn in Co3O4, thereby enhancing electrochemical performance of Co3O4/CNTs. Twenty-five percent (w/w) Mn doping in Co3O4 (Mn-0.25-Co3O4/CNTs) exhibited the best electrocatalytic performance in the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) among all as-prepared Mn-x-Co3O4/CNTs, which is even superior to the Pt/C based electrode in the Zn-air battery tests, including higher open-circuit voltage (1.43 V), greater discharge peak power density (56.7 mW/cm(2)), and a larger specific capacity (707.3 mAh/g(-Zn) at 10 mA/cm(2)). Owing to its high efficiency, stability and low-cost, Mn-0.25-Co3O4/CNTs, is a promising alternative to prepare ORR/OER bifunctional catalysts for the rechargeable Zn-air battery industry.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000618934300002

Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of NiCo alloy integrated nitrogen-doped tubular carbon (TC) nanostructure (NiCo-N-TC) using metalorganic self-assembly of M(II)-melamine-dipicolinic acid (DPA) (M: Ni(II), Co(II)). The NiCo alloy particles of as-synthesized NiCo-N-TC catalyst are confined at the tip like a cork. The as-synthesized catalyst was structurally engineered by acid treatment. The engineered catalyst (NiCo-N-TC-H) has an open-head hollow nanoarchitecture with uniform distribution of ultrafine NiCo alloy particles on the TC framework. The NiCo-N-TC-H catalyst follows desired 4-electron pathway for the electroreduction of oxygen in both alkaline and acidic pH. It has outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte with a very low potential gap (Delta E) of 0.74 V. Acid-treatment-induced increase in surface area, and graphitic-N and carbon content facilitates the overall bifunctional activity. The bifunctional activity of NiCo-N-TC-H is successfully utilized for the development of rechargeable ZAB. It has long cycling stability and delivers high open circuit voltage (1.54 V), power density of 148.8 mW cm(-2), and high voltaic efficiency. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Investigation of Pyrolysis Gas Chemistry in an Inductively Coupled Plasma Facility								46th AIAA Thermophysics Conference								21 pp.	21 pp.						2016	2016	The pyrolysis mechanics of Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablators (PICA) makes it a valued material for use in thermal protection systems for spacecraft atmospheric re-entry. The present study of the interaction of pyrolysis gases and char with plasma gases in the boundary layer over PICA and its substrate, FiberForm, extends previous work on this topic that has been done in the UVM 30 kW Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Torch Facility. Exposure of these material samples separately to argon, nitrogen, oxygen, air plasmas, and combinations of said test gases provides insight into the evolution of the pyrolysis gases as they react with the different plasmas. Measurements done to date include timeresolved absolute emission spectroscopy, location-based temperature response, and more recently, spatially resolved and high-resolution emission spectroscopy, all of which provide measure of the characteristics of the pyrolysis chemistry and material response. Tests with relatively inert argon plasmas established a baseline for the pyrolysis gases that leave the material. CN Violet bands, NH, OH and Hydrogen Alpha (Halpha) lines were seen with relative repeatability in temporal, spectral, and intensity values. Tests with incremental addition of reactive plasmas (diluted nitrogen and oxygen) provided a preliminary image of how the gases interacted with atmospheric flows. Evidence of a temporal relationship between NH and Halpha relating to nitrogen addition is seen, while oxygen addition sharply reduced the signal of previously seen pyrolysis gases. Temperature analysis highlighted the reaction of the material to oxygen addition and displayed the in depth material response to argon and air/argon plasmas. The development of spatial emission analysis has been started with the hope of better resolving the previously seen.					46th AIAA Thermophysics Conference46th AIAA Thermophysics Conference	13-17 June 201613-17 June 2016		Washington, DC, USAWashington, DC, USA	0	0	0		0	0	0						INSPEC:16076286

Near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to study in operando the initial steps of oxidation for Ni-5Cr, Ni-15Cr, Ni-30Cr and Ni-15Cr-6W at 500 degrees C, p(O-2)=10(-6) mbar. The comparison of oxide evolution for these alloys quantifies the outsized impact of W in promoting chromia formation. For the binary alloys an increase in chromia due to Cr-surface enrichment is followed by NiO nucleation and growth thus seeding a dual-layer structure. The addition of W (Ni-15Cr-6W) shifts the reaction pathways towards chromia thus enhancing oxide quality. Density functional theory calculations confirm that W atoms adjacent to Cr create highly favorable oxygen adsorption sites. The addition of W supercharges the reactivity of Cr with oxygen essentially funneling oxygen atoms into Cr sites. The experimental results are discussed in the context of surface composition, chemistry, reactant fluxes, and microstructure.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2397-2106		WOS:000820061100001

However, it is still a grand challenge to increase the specific surface area of the catalyst to expose more active sites from structural advantages and optimize the adsorption/desorption energy of reaction intermediates. Here, we report the design and fabrication of a three-dimensional (3D) PdCuRu nanostructure that is assembled by porous nanosheets through a facile wet-chemical and subsequent chemical etching method. Interestingly, the prepared 3D porous nanostructures not only provide a wealth of surface active centers for reactants, but also provide a lot of ways for mass transport and charge transfer. More importantly, the alloy structure effectively optimizes the electronic structures of Ru and Cu, leading them to be favorable for the adsorption/desorption of H(ads)during HER. As a result, the 3D PdCuRu porous nanosheets (PdCuRu PNSs) display excellent electrocatalytic HER performance in both acidic and alkaline media. It is worth mentioning that the 3D PdCuRu PNSs could also show excellent kinetic stability with negligible activity loss representing a new class a class of promising electrocatalysts for HER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2196-0216			WOS:000563880800018

However, both the preparation and determination of such active sites remain a challenge. The structural engineering of carbon- and nitrogen-coordinated metal sites (M-N-C, M = Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu, etc.) via employing new heteroatoms, e.g., P and S, remains challenging. In this study, carbon nanosheets embedded with nitrogen and phosphorus dual-coordinated iron active sites (denoted as Fe-N/P-C) were developed and determined using cutting edge techniques. Both experimental and theoretical results suggested that the N and P dual-coordinated iron sites were favorable for oxygen intermediate adsorption/desorption, resulting in accelerated reaction kinetics and promising catalytic oxygen reduction activity. This work not only provides efficient way to prepare well-defined single-atom active sites to boost catalytic performance but also paves the way to identify the dual-coordinated single metal atom sites.									344	28	0	0	19	0	346			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000512222700047	31902210

The strip is thereby indirectly polarized, and electrochemical reactions at the strip surface result in the dissolution of the oxide layer and the evolution of hydrogen and oxygen bubbles. In this paper, we extend an earlier mathematical model for the electrochemical aspects of the process, which took account only of the liquid phase, to include the effect of the gas phase. The model is two-dimensional, steady-state and isothermal, and comprises five ionic species, the mixture velocity, pressure, and the gas fraction; numerical solutions of this model are then obtained. The results of the single and two-phase models are compared, and their implications for the actual pickling process are discussed.

Gypsiferous soils occur in large areas of the iranian central plateau. The origin of gypsum in the Aridisols of central Iran and its distribution in different landscapes were studied using sulfur and oxygen isotopic composition of both solid and dissolved sulfates. The results strongly support the hypothesis that the area was cut off from the Tethys seaway at the end of the Mesozoic era and, as a result, the Lower Cretaceous sulfate has controlled the S geochemistry of the younger sediments, including the soils studied. The mean values of delta(34)S and delta(18)O of the soil gypsum and of dissolved sulfate match with the average isotopic values of the marine sediments which are the most common soil parent materials. The results also confirm that S and O in dissolved SO4 and SO4 in gypsum have not undergone any reduction and re-oxidation reactions. Dissolution and reprecipitation appear to be the possible mechanisms responsible for the observed minimal isotope fractionation. Both delta(34)S and delta(18)O values of the soil gypsum decrease slightly with decreasing elevation in the study area. These findings are important for understanding the landform evolution in this arid region. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.									16	2	0	0	7	1	17			0016-7061			WOS:A1997YK54400012

Two new classes of manganese cluster complexes of formula Ba2Mn2L21(H3L1)(2)(CH3OH)(4) 1 and (Mn4L6Cl2)-Cl-2 2 were prepared (H4L1 = N,N'-(ethane-1,2-diyl)bis (2-hydroxybenzamide); L-2 = methyl picolinimidate) and characterized by standard techniques including microanalysis, IR spectroscopy, ESI spectrometry, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. X-ray diffraction studies of these complexes revealed (i) a box-type structure for 1 formed by two redox-active manganese(III) ions and two barium(II) ions connected by two bridging bisamido-bisphenoxy ligand molecules; and (ii) a planar-diamond array for Mn4N6 cluster 2 where the picolinimidates act as chelating ligands through the two nitrogen atoms. The ability of 1 and 2 to split water has been studied by means of water photolysis experiments. In these experiments, the oxygen evolution was measured in aqueous media in the presence of p-benzoquinone (acting as the hydrogen acceptor), the reduction of which was followed by UV-spectroscopy. The relevant photolytic activity found for 1 is in contrast to the inactivity of 2 in the photolytic experiments. This different behavior is discussed on the basis of the structure of the biomimetic models and the proposed reaction mechanism for this process supported by DFT calculations.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2073-4344		WOS:000448331700042

Herein, efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production in pure water was realized on graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) decorated by oxidative red phosphorus (ORP). The composite produces 250 mu M of H2O2 within 120 min under visible light irradiation via synchronous water oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions, which is more than 25-fold enhancement of pristine GCN. It is revealed that red phosphorus (RP) can significantly promote charge separation but induce reductive decomposition of H2O2. Successfully, H2O2 decomposition over RP is dramatically suppressed by preventing the interaction between H2O2 and P atoms through oxidizing RP with the formation of P-O bonds by an oxidation post-treatment. This strategy opens a new door for the rational design of highly active metal-free photocatalysts toward solar-to-H2O2 conversion in pure water.									21	1	0	0	3	0	20			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000702150200005

Numerous efforts have examined the combustion of butanol from the perspective of low dimensional gas-phase transport configurations that facilitate modeling and validation of combustion kinetics. However, fewer studies have focused on multiphase butanol combustion, and none have appeared on isolated droplet combustion that couples experiments with robust modeling of the droplet burning process. This paper presents such an experimental/numerical modeling study of isolated droplet burning characteristics of n-butanol. The experiments are conducted in an environment that simplifies the transport process to one that is nearly one-dimensional as promoted by burning in a reduced gravity environment. Measurements of the evolution of droplet diameter (D-o = 0.56-0.57 mm), flame standoff ratio (FSR equivalent to D-f/D) and burning rate (K) are made in the standard atmosphere under reduced gravity and the data are compared against numerical simulation. The detailed model is based on a comprehensive time-dependent, sphero-symmetric droplet combustion simulation that includes spectrally resolved radiative heat transfer, multi-component diffusive transport, full thermal property variations and detailed chemical kinetic. The simulations are carried out using both a large order kinetic mechanism (284 species, 1892 reactions) and a reduced order mechanism (44 species, 177 reactions). The results show that the predicted burning history and flame standoff ratios are in good agreement with the measurements for both the large and reduced order mechanisms. Additional simulations are conducted for varying oxygen concentration to determine the limiting oxygen index and to elucidate the kinetic processes that dictate the extinction of the flame at these low oxygen concentrations.

Renewable energy sources can be coupled with electrochemical conversion processes to store energy in chemical bonds. To promote these difficult transformations, electrocatalysts that operate at high conversion rates and efficiency are required. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a promising class of materials; however, the insulating nature of MOFs has limited their application as electrocatalysts. The recent development of conductive MOFs has led to several electrocatalytic MOFs that display activity comparable to that of the best-performing heterogeneous catalysts. Although many electrocatalytic MOFs exhibit low activity and stability, the few successful examples highlight the possibility of MOF electrocatalysts as replacements for noble-metal-based catalysts in commercial energy-converting devices. We review herein the use of pristine MOFs as electrocatalysts to facilitate important energy-related reactions.									141	4	0	0	11	0	143			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000416158500009	28968485

In addition, oxygen gas has to be purged in the reaction mixture in order to increase the reaction efficiency which, in itself, is an energy-consuming process. Herein, we report, for the first time, the use of Ag3PO4 as an excellent photocatalyst for the oxidative coupling of benzyl amines induced by ambient air in the absence of any external source of molecular oxygen at room temperature. The conversion efficiency for the selective oxidation of benzyl amine was found to be greater than 95% with a selectivity of >99% after 40 min of light irradiation indicating an exceptionally high conversion efficiency with a rate constant of 0.002 min(-1), a turnover frequency of 57 h(-1), and a quantum yield of 19%, considering all of the absorbed photons. Ag3PO4, however, is known for its poor photostability owing to a positive conduction band position and a favorable reduction potential to metallic silver. Therefore, we further employed a simple catalyst regeneration strategy and showed that the catalyst can be recycled with negligible loss of activity and selectivity.									19	1	0	0	3	0	19			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000546698600041	32484649

We demonstrated that IgG exposure to pro-oxidative ferrous ions or to reactive oxygen species enhances paratope flexibility and hydrophobicity, leading to expansion of the spectrum of recognized antigens, regulation of cell proliferation, and protection in experimental sepsis. We propose that ferrous ions, released from transferrin and ferritin at sites of inflammation, synergize with reactive oxygen species to modify the immunoglobulins present in the surrounding microenvironment, thus quenching pro-inflammatory signals, while facilitating neutralization of pathogens.									63	0	1	0	52	0	64			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000234307200054	16246843

An electrocatalyst was computer-aided designed with Mo isolated single atoms (Mo-ISA) supported on heteroatom S, N-codoped carbon having excellent HER performance. Here, by performing comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) computations, we investigated the influence of the N dopent concentration and the sites of S atom doping on the HER performance. Our computed results demonstrate that the Mo-ISA/N1C and Mo-ISA/S-6 N1C catalysts possess good stability and high HER reactivity. Moreover, the interactions between hydrogen and the Mo atoms could be controlled by the N dopent concentration on carbon support, and the MoISA/N1C catalyst showed best HER reactivity. In particular, the S atom was introduced into Mo-ISA/N1C at the S-6 site showing an enhanced HER performance due to the competitive effect of the S-induced tensile strain and charge transfer. Our DFT computations open up new opportunities for application of S, N-codoped Mo-based high-efficient catalysts for HER.									28	1	0	0	1	0	28			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000456951700098

With the aid of density functional theory calculations, we investigated the thermodynamic performances during water splitting besides the structural and electronic performances of monolayer g-C3N4 embedded with single Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag or Au atom. Based on the detailed analysis of the electronic redistributions and chemical bond relaxations, the ratio of ionic and covalent bonding parts of chemical bonds were adjusted by the single atoms, it changed the adsorption energy of intermediates, the free energy changes during reaction and then the overpotentials of oxidation evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Interestingly, the overpotentials of OER and HER reduce as the percentage of covalent bonding parts is close to a certain value, which are conducive to improve the OER and HER efficiency. In addition, the differences of redox potentials between catalysts and water oxidation/H+ reduction are larger than the corresponding overpotentials of OER and HER on Pd-1/ and Pt-1/g-C3N4, thus the OER and HER can happen on them.									38	2	0	0	2	0	38			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000441872300086

The porous structures exhibited wide electrochemical potential windows (2.46-2.70 V). although somewhat less than that for the ax-deposited films (3.04 V) because of surface damage due to the oxygen plasma treatment. A film of pore diam 400 nm and pore depth 3 mum exhibited a 400-fold increase in the capacitance (3.91 x 10(3) F cm(-2)) in comparison to an as-deposited surface film. A film with 30 nm diam pores showed little enhancement in the capacitance at useful frequencies due to the high pore impedance. Impedance measurements carried out at -0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl indicated a faradaic reaction. most likely hydrogen evolution. Although the dc current was small (ca. 3.0 muA cm(-2) real area for the 60 nm honeycomb), it represents a pathway for charge leakage, limiting the negative potential limit for charge storage. However. similar limits were also observed for a representative acetylene black and activated carbon. The as-deposited diamond and 60 x 500 nm honeycomb exhibited significantly higher effective potential limits for anodic charging due to the lack of surface oxidation current. This allows more charge to be stored per unit capacitance for diamond materials than for graphitic carbons. Due to the surface damage. the honeycomb sample did not store as much charge per unit capacitance as the as-deposited sample.

The as-prepared USCS Au-38.4@Au(9.3)Pt(52.3)NPs have an average diameter of 2.3 +/- 0.5 nm. It is found that the morphology, composition and size of Au-Pt NPs are highly dependent on the reaction conditions including the addition sequence of the precursors, and the concentrations of Fe(ii) ions, Au(iii) ions and Pt(ii) ions. In addition, USCS Au-38.4@Au9.3Pt52.3-NP/C catalysts (USCS Au-38.4@Au(9.3)Pt(52.3)NPs loaded on the Vulcan XC-72R carbon black) exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic media due to the higher electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and electronic effect between Pt and Au. For instance, USCS Au-38.4@Au9.3Pt52.3-NP/C catalysts exhibited greatly enhanced HER activity in terms of overpotential (16 mV at a current density of -10 mA cm(-2)) and are better than commercial Pt/C catalysts (31 mV at a current density of -10 mA cm(-2)) reported in the literature thus far, to the best of our knowledge. Strikingly, their mass activity is about 13.1-fold higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, they also show an improved ORR activity,E-onset= 1.015 V andE(1/2)= 0.896 V, which are positively shifted by nearly 28 mV and 21 mV than those of commercial Pt/C catalysts (0.987 V and 0.875 V), respectively. In addition, they also showed a higher kinetic current density (12.85 mA cm(-2)at 0.85 V) and a better long-term durability. Our synthetic strategy presented here may be extended to the preparation of ultra-small Au-based bimetallic or multi-metallic NPs.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000579877200035	33026009

The results reveal that the prepared Co@CN nanocomposites have typical core-shell structure and show highly efficient catalytic performance in a reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), rhodamine and methylene blue. Their rate constant (K-app) is 0.074 s(?1) in a reduction of 4-NP, which is much higher than that of reported transition metal-based catalysts. Moreover, the overpotential of Co@CN is only 96 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(?2) in alkaline solution, showing high electrocatalytic activities in the hydrogen evolution reaction. The excellent synergistic effect between nitrogen-doped graphite C shell and magnetic Co core enables the Co@CN nanocomposites catalysts to hold abundant active sites and to transmit rapidly electron ability, resulting in Co@CN nanocomposite catalysts having a highly efficient catalytic nature.									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000499841800001	31614341

It is found that the optimal as-prepared Cu(0)-CoNi-OH/NF electrode exhibits extraordinarily electrocatalytic activity for HER and it only requires an overpotential of 47 mV to reach a benchmark HER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. The prepared Cu(0)-CoNi-OH/NF electrode also exhibits extraordinary stability and fast reaction kinetics with a small Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1). The excellent activity is attributed to the unique metal/hydroxide interfaces and the increased electrochemical activity surface area after Cu doping.

Here, we report how a higher catalytic efficiency can be achieved by utilizing an earth-abundant Nickel oxide (NiO) catalyst via an improved control of the crystalline growth orientation and self-assembly. The relationship between the surface charge and the morphology of the nano-catalysts is investigated using a hydrothermal method where the pH is utilized to control both the crystal growth direction and crystallization of Ni(OH)(2) and eventually in NiO, where the self-assembly properties of nanoflakes (NFs) into hierarchical flower-like nickel oxide NFs depend on balancing of forces during synthesis. The surface charge of the NiO at different pH values was measured with electrophoretic dynamic light scattering (EDLS) and is known to be closely related to that of Ni(OH)(2) and is here utilized to control the relative change in the surface charge in the precursor solution. By preparing NiO NFs under variation of the pH conditions of the precursor Ni(OH)(2) system, the surface energies of exposed lattice planes of the growing nanostructures can be altered and an enhanced crystal growth orientation in a different direction can be controlled. Specifically, the [111] and [220] growth orientation in cubic NiO can be favored or suppressed with respect to the [200] direction.Benefiting from the large surface area provided by the mesoporous NiO NFs, the catalyst electrode exhibits high activity toward the oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline electrolyte. The NiO nanostructure synthesized at pH 10 displays oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 0.29 V and 0.35 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 1 mA cm(-2) and 10 mA cm(-2) current density, respectively. This is compared to commercial NiO with more than 0.15 V additional overpotential and the same or lower overpotential compared to RuO2 and IrO2 at alkaline conditions. The results show that the OER catalytic activity can be drastically increased by a detailed control of the crystal growth orientation and the self-assembly behavior where the active surface charge around the point of zero charge during synthesis of the metal hydroxides/oxides is introduced as an important design principle for producing efficient electrocatalysts.

It has been proposed that CP43-Arg357, which is located in the vicinity of the Mn4Ca cluster, plays a key role in the O-2 evolution mechanism; however, direct evidence for its involvement in the reaction has not yet been obtained. In this study, we have for the first time detected the structural coupling of CP43-Arg357 with the Mn4Ca cluster by means of isotope-edited Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Light-induced FTIR difference spectra upon the S-1 -> S-2 transition (S-2/S-1 difference spectra) of the Mn4Ca cluster were measured using isolated PSII core complexes from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells, where the Arg side chains were labeled with either [eta(1,2)-N-15(2)]Arg or [zeta-C-13]Arg. Bands due to Arg side chain vibrations, which were extracted by taking a double difference between the S-2/S-1 spectra of isotope-labeled and unlabeled samples, were found at 1700-1600 and 1700-1550 cm(-1) for [eta(1,2)-N-15(2)]Arg- and [zeta-C-13]Arg-labeled PSII, respectively. These frequency regions are in good agreement with those of the CN/NH2 vibrations of a guanidinium group in difference spectra between isotope-labeled and unlabeled Arg in aqueous solutions. The detected Arg bands in the S-2/S-1 difference spectra were attributed to CP43-Arg357, which is the only Arg residue located near the Mn4Ca cluster. The presence of relatively high frequency bands arising from unlabeled Arg suggested that the guanidinium N(eta)H2 is engaged in strong hydrogen bonding. These results indicate that CP43-Arg357 interacts with the Mn4Ca cluster probably through direct hydrogen bonding to a first coordination shell ligand of a redox-active Mn ion. This structural coupling of CP43-Arg357 may play a crucial role in the water oxidation reactions.									18	0	1	0	13	0	19			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000288889900032	21348470

Recent achievements in the design and synthesis of efficient non precious-metal and even non-metal electrocatalysts make the replacement of noble metal counterparts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with earth-abundant elements, for example, C, N, Fe, Mn, and Co, a realistic possibility. It has been found that surface atomic engineering (e.g., heteroatom-doping) and interface atomic or molecular engineering (e.g., interfacial bonding) can induce novel physicochemical properties and strong synergistic effects for electrocatalysts, providing new and efficient strategies to greatly enhance the catalytic activities.In this Account, we discuss recent progress in the design and fabrication of efficient electrocatalysts based on carbon materials, graphitic carbon nitride, and transition metal oxides or hydroxides for efficient ORR, OER, and HER through surface and interfacial atomic and molecular engineering. Atomic and molecular engineering of carbon materials through heteroatom doping with one or more elements of noticeably different electronegativities can maximally tailor their electronic structures and induce a synergistic effect to increase electrochemical activity. Nonetheless, the electrocatalytic performance of chemically modified carbonaceous materials remains inferior to that of their metallic counterparts, which is mainly due to the relatively limited amount of electrocatalytic active sites induced by heteroatom doping. Accordingly, coupling carbon substrates with other active electrocatalysts to produce composite structures can impart novel physicochemical properties, thereby boosting the electroactivity even further. Although the majority of carbon based materials remain uncompetitive with state-of-the-art metal-based catalysts for the aforementioned catalytic processes, nonmetal carbon hybrids have already shown performance that typically only conventional noble metals or transition metal materials can achieve. The idea of hybridized carbon-based catalysts possessing unique active surfaces and macro- or nanostructures is addressed herein. For metal carbon couples, the incorporation of carbon can effectively compensate for the intrinsic deficiency in conductivity of the metallic components. Chemical modification of carbon frameworks, such as nitrogen doping, not only can change the electron-donor character, but also can introduce anchoring sites for immobilizing active metallic centers to form metal nitrogen carbon (M-N-C) species, which are thought to facilitate the electrocatalytic process. With thoughtful material design, control over the porosity of composites, the molecular architecture of active metal moieties and macromorphologies of the whole catalysts can be achieved, leading to a better understanding structure activity relationships. We hope that we can offer new insight into material design, particularly the role of chemical composition and structural properties in electrochemical performance and reaction mechanisms.									671	44	0	0	21	0	680			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000399859800028	28205437

In consideration of the synergistic effects of Ru on water dissociation and Ru2P on proton reduction, Ru/Ru2P interfaces were engineered in situ via a high-pressure phosphorization strategy with phosphine as both a phosphorus source and reactant. The Ru/Ru2P-loaded P-doped carbon (Ru-Ru2P/PC) catalyst therefore exhibited superior alkaline HER activity compared to the Pt catalyst. The overpotential of the Ru-Ru2P catalyst to drive a 50 mA cm(-2) alkaline HER was reduced by 65 mV compared to the Pt/C catalyst, and the loading of noble metal was much lower. Thus, the mass activity was doubled. With its great stability under alkaline conditions, the easily synthesized Ru-Ru2P catalyst shows promising application potential in industrial electrolysis systems.									44	5	0	0	3	0	46			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463824300052

Inspired by the efficient electron transport capacity of corner-sharing structures and the low steric hindrance of edge-sharing units, an attempt is made to exert both merits by combining these two networks. Here, a unique self-assembled hybrid SrCo0.55Fe0.5O3-delta nanorod composed of a corner-sharing SrCo0.5Fe0.5O3-delta phase and edge-sharing Co3O4 structure is synthesized through a Co-site enrichment method, which exhibits the low overpotentials of 310 and 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen-evolving reaction in 0.1 m and 1.0 m KOH, respectively. This efficiency is attributed to the high Co valence with strong Co-O covalence and the short distance between Co-Co/Fe metal active sites in hybrid nanorods, realizing a synergistic benefit. Combined multiple operando/ex situ characterizations and computational studies show that the edge-sharing units in hybrid nanorods can help facilitate the deprotonation step of lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) while the corner-sharing motifs can accelerate the electron transport during LOM processes, triggering an unusual lattice-oxygen activation. This methodology of combining important material structural genomes can offer meaningful insights and guidance for various catalytic applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000844261100001

The alloys and coatings capable of functioning in such aggressive environments are invariably multicomponent and multhiphase materials. The protectivity is achieved through the development of adherent, self-healing protective scales by the diffusional transport of the coating and substrate elements. However with prolonged exposure interdiffusion of other elements, originally added, to increase the mechanical properties of the alloys, will act to undermine the integrity of the protective scales. A knowledge of the diffusional transport properties of these elements is essential to predict the protective behaviour of the coatings and the scales developed, and hence to design alloys and coatings with better capabilities to resist HT corrosion. In this work we will present model of heterogeneous reactions controlled by diffusion and reactions at multiple interfaces, e.g., at alloy/coating and coaling/gas boundaries. We describe here the recent progress that has been made in understanding the diffusion processes in single-phase solid solutions and in particular, the diffusion in an reacting (e.g. oxidized) multicomponent alloy. The oxidation of single-phase binary and higher alloys does not always follow the parabolic rate law. It has been found that the selective oxidation of binary alloys after initial transition (incubation) period, frequently leads to a steady-state condition. During the initial reaction period (transient state and variable boundary conditions) an instantaneous parabolic rate constant that varies that with time is often used to describe the rate of the reaction. For alloys with low concentrations of the oxidized metals, the steady-state rate constant is smaller than that of the pure metal and diffusion in the alloy affects the subsequent oxidation process.The model of chemical interdiffusion enables one to obtain an approximate expression for the evolution of component distributions in open systems, as a result of the thermochemical treatment and/or oxidation. The proposed boundary conditions allow to study the evolution of the alloy composition as a result of its reaction with a surrounding environment, that is to predict the concentration profile's of all elements beneath the growing scale.The studies of interdiffusion in beta-NiAl(Pt)/MAR M002 diffusional couples allowed calculation of the intrinsic diffusivities of five components. In this paper the information on the evolution of the elements distribution in the beta-NiAl(Pt)/MAR M002 system (Pt modified beta-NiAl coating on MAR M002 superalloy) is presented. An agreement between the computed and experimental results suggests that the generalised Darken model correctly describe the transport process in open systems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

By applying a highly positive potential (+2.5 V vs Ag/AgCl) to an aqueous electrolyte containing potassium hydrogen phthalate, glucose, and lactic acid or sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate using a BDD electrode, an anodic current corresponding to the electrolytic decomposition of these organic compounds was observed. No such current was seen on glassy carbon or platinum electrodes due to a significant background current caused by the oxygen evolution reaction. The electric charge for the anodic current observed at the BDD electrode was found to be consistent with the theoretical charge required for the electrolytic decomposition of the organic compounds to CO2 and was used to calculate COD. This analysis was performed by a simple I-t measurement at constant potential using a BDD electrode, and no calibration was needed. This new simple indicator, "ECOD" (electrochemical oxygen demand), will be useful for continuous monitoring of industrial wastewater with low protein concentrations and on-site instant analysis of natural water with a BDD electrode-based portable ECOD meter.									31	4	0	0	3	0	36			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000340701500009	25052688

However, it is a huge challenge to unearth a promising model for elucidating the role of dopants and vacancies on catalysts upon CO2 electroreduction. Herein, porous indium oxynitride nanosheets with simultaneous incorporation of nitrogen dopant and oxygen vacancy (V-o-N-InON) are reported for achieving efficient CO2 conversion to formic acid (HCOOH). As a result, the catalyst exhibits an extremely high formate selectivity of 95.1% at a low potential of -0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) compared with pristine In2O3, V-o-In2O3, and InN, delivering a large partial current density of 121.1 mA cm(-2) for formate production at -1.13 V versus RHE in the flow cell. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the generation of *OCHO intermediate is the rate-determining step. The synergistic effect between nitrogen dopants and oxygen vacancies contributes to the activation of CO2, facilitates the charge transfer, and reduces the reaction free energy of *OCHO protonation. This work not only discloses a fundamental understanding of synergistic effects between nitrogen dopants and oxygen vacancies to improve catalytic performance, but also provides an effective platform toward CO2 conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000805093000001

The visualization and quantification of collective defect flow based on electrochromism is a powerful approach to explore oxygen kinetics and electrochemical reaction even in cases that electronic conduction is considerably mixed, but whether or not the measured kinetic properties harmonize with those obtained by the conventional impedance spectroscopy remains veiled. Here, we identify complementary relationships between the two methods by investigating the oxygen vacancy transport in Ca 30%-doped bismuth ferrite thin films epitaxially grown on SrTiO3 (110) substrates. We find that the activation energy of ionic hopping is 0.78 (or 0.92 eV) for the application of an electric bias along [001] (or [1 (1) over bar0]) due to the grain elongation along [001]. We anneal the films in an N-2 gas environment at high temperatures to suppress the electronic contribution for access to standard impedance spectroscopy. The oxygen kinetic properties obtained from the two methods are consistent with each other, complementarily revealing the collective phase evolution as well as the ionic impedance of the bulk, grain boundary, and interfacial regions. These comparative works provide useful insights into ionic defect conduction in oxides in an intuitive and quantitative manner.

Herein, we report a core-shell structured carbon hybrid (PNC@CoNC) as an effective bifunctional oxygen catalyst prepared by a surface polymerization strategy and a subsequent pyrolysis process, consisting of nanoporous N-doped carbon core carbonized from ZIF-8 and N-doped graphitic carbon shell with embedded Co nanoparticles carbonized from the cobalt ion-doped polydopamine coating layer. The desirable nanoarchitecture endows the hybrid with a high specific surface area of 531 m(2) g(-1), high conductivity, abundant micro-/meso-pores and electrocatalytically active N-dopant species. As a result, the hybrid PNC@CoNC displays a positive half-wave potential of 0.81 V towards oxygen reduction and a low overpotential of 490 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) towards oxygen evolution in alkaline electrolytes, as well as excellent electrochemical stability. The bifunctional oxygen activity is comparable with that of the commercial catalysts and the recently reported electrocatalysts. Expectedly, as an air-electrode catalyst in rechargeable Zn-air battery (ZAB), PNC@CoNC shows a high power density of 130 mW cm(-2), a low charge/discharge voltage gap, and superior cycling stability. Additionally, the as-prepared hybrid also shows promising application potential in solid-state ZAB. Therefore, this work provides a lesson for the synthesis of non-noble metal electrocatalysts in advanced new energy devices.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000616688400046

IrO2 supported on a SiC-Si composite was synthesised by the Adams fusion method. XRD and nitrogen adsorption experiments showed an influence of the support on the surface properties of the IrO2 particles, affecting the IrO2 particle size. The prepared catalysts were electrochemically characterised by cyclic voltammetry experiments at 25,80,120 and 150 degrees C. In accordance with the observed variation in particle size, a support loading of up to 20% improved the activity of the catalyst. Powder conductivity measurements were also performed, which showed the influence of the support particles in the packing of IrO2 particles, perhaps favouring the formation of channels and pores between particles, thus increasing the catalyst utilisation.

Here, we demonstrate a facile electrolysis-solvothermal technique for making Pt and carbon quantum dots coloaded multiwall carbon nanotube (Pt-CQDs/MWCNT) catalyst with the assistant of electric field. Despite of the ultralow Pt amount (0.81 wt%) for the optimized Pt-CQDs/MWCNT catalyst, it exhibits ultrahigh electroactivity and durability toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). The mass activities of the catalyst for HER and EOR can be achieved to 4889.7 mA/mg (-40 mV) and 4917 mA mg; 1Pt (forward peak), which are 8.1 times and 5.6 times more active than those of commercial Pt/C respectively. The characterization results reveal that Pt nanpparticles (Pt NPs) with intrinsic structure play the key role in excellent catalytic performance for HER and EOR. CQDs not only support abundant anchoring points for fixation and dispersion of Pt NPs, but also construct 3D conductive network with MWCNT supporter for improving the catalytic performance.									15	0	0	0	4	0	15			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000613347800004

In this study, we probed the hydroxylation of model (001)-oriented La1-xSrxMnO3 (LSMO) perovskite surfaces, where the electronic structure and manganese valence were controlled by five substitution levels of lanthanum with strontium, using ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in a humid environment. The degree of hydroxyl formation on the oxide surface correlated with the proximity of the valence band center relative to the Fermi level. LSMO perovskites with a valence band center closer to the Fermi level were more reactive toward water, forming more hydroxyl species at a given relative humidity. More hydroxyl species correlate with greater electron-donating character to the surface free energy in wetting and reduce the activity to catalyze oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics in a basic solution. New strategies for designing more active catalysts should include design of electronically conducting oxides with lower valence band centers relative to the Fermi level at ORR-relevant potentials.									25	4	0	0	1	0	26			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000418206600017

This work reports a scalable, oil-based method based on thermal decomposition of organometallic complexes to yield highly uniform Ni-Fe-based nanocatalysts with a well-defined morphology (i.e. Ni-Fe core-shell, Ni/Fe alloy, and Fe-Ni core-shell). Transmission electron microscopy reveals their morphology and composition to be NiOx-FeOx/NiOx core-mixed shell, NiOx/FeOx alloy, and FeOx-NiOx core-shell. X-ray techniques resolve the electronic structures of the bulk and are supported by electron energy loss spectroscopy analysis of individual nanoparticles. These results suggest that the crystal structure of Ni is most likely to contain alpha-Ni(OH)(2) and that the chemical environment of Fe is variable, depending on the morphology of the nanoparticle. The Ni diffusion from the amorphous Ni-based core to the iron oxide shell makes the NiOx-NiOx/FeOx core-mixed shell structure the most active and the most stable nanocatalyst, which outperforms the comparison NiOx/FeOx alloy nanoparticles expected to be active for the OER. This study suggests that the chemical environment of the mixed NiOx/FeOx alloy composition is important to achieve high electrocatalytic activity for the OER and that the 3-D morphology plays a key role in the optimization of the electrocatalytic activity and stability of the nanocatalyst for the OER.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000466774500060	30775739

PN-CNPs are used as carbon support for Pd and employed as electrocatalyst in hydrogen evolution reactions. The prepared Pd/PN-CNPs electrocatalyst was subjected to morphological and electrochemical studies carried out using FE-SEM, EDS, ICP, XRD, CV, and LSV techniques. The membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were prepared and tested in 25cm(2) area PEM cell setup and the test results obtained are promising as the cell voltage is 1.9V at 1000mAcm(-2) at 80 degrees C. Furthermore, the cell setup was operated continuously for 500h and has shown stable performance without any hindrance in electrochemical activity.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000468337500017		
J	Xue, Zhicun; Guo, Qinghua; Gong, Yan; Xu, Jianliang; Yu, Guangsuo				Xue, Zhicun/AAD-9867-2020				Numerical study of a reacting single coal char particle with different pore structures moving in a hot O-2/CO2 atmosphere								FUEL				206				381	389		10.1016/j.fuel.2017.06.035				OCT 15 2017	2017	Based on pseudo-steady-state approach, the effect of particle size and porosity on conversion characteristics of single coal char particle moving in high temperature O-2/CO2 atmosphere was studied to analyze the particle conversion mechanism. The particle size and porosity were variable in the range of 0.1-1.0 mm and 0-0.4 respectively. The particle structure model is developed referring to experimental coal char particle pore structure. The Navier-Stokes equations were coupled with energy and species conservation equations to solve the problem. Stefan flow, Maxwell-Stefan equation and Soret effect were considered for mass transport. Water-gas-shift reaction, CO oxidation reaction and four heterogeneous reactions were taken into account. The reacting particles moving in different oxygen concentration were modeled for validation against experimental results of literatures. The results show that with the decrease of particle size, the reactive zone expands relative to the particle but shrinks relative to the space and attaches to the particle surface because of the low Reynolds number and the small pore size. The particle with high porosity is more sensitive to the change of the ambient oxygen concentration due to the large contact surface with gas flow. Additionally, the detaching of the flame sheet and the endothermic Boudouard reaction are two significant factors affecting the surface temperature. The insufficient supply of oxidant causes the decrease of the specific carbon consumption rate along with the enhancing of the particle size and porosity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Deep traps are accompanied by extremely fast capture rates and extremely slow release rates, which severely suppress the hole transport process. Herein, we proposed a unique method to progressively convert deep traps on the hematite surface for fast hole transfer via in situ one-step metal organic framework modification. This stepwise deep-trap passivation is achieved by hematite corrosion first on the surface and subsequent construction of a porous titanium layer. The gentle trap finishing helps prevent surface losses caused by excessively intense trap passivation. The hematite corrosion can initially passivate 80% of the surface deep traps, while the subsequent porous titanium layer can completely passivate the deep traps. In addition, the accurate optimization of the porous titanium layer can reconstruct the benign shallow traps on the surface, acting as superior oxygen evolution reaction active sites. This sophisticated surface-trap adjustment is accompanied by the rapid reduction of deep traps and the gradual increase of shallow traps, obtaining a superior surface state that is conducive to charge transport and interface catalysis. The obtained treated hematite yields a photocurrent density of 3.08 mA.cm(-2) at 1.23 VRHE, increased by 570% compared to the pristine hematite.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000557854700019	32666781

In this work, Fe, N, and S co-doped porous carbon nanosheets (Fe-N-S/C) are synthesized by hightemperature sulfuration from Fe and N co-doped carbon (Fe-N/C). Fe-N-S/C not only exhibits superior oxygen reduction activity than Pt/C (20%) with a half-wave potential of 0.86 V, but also exhibits remarkable biocompatibility while facilitating electron transfer between microorganism and electrode. Satisfactorily, the MFCs with Fe-N-S/C as the catalysts for both cathode and anode show outstanding performance with a maximum power density of 923 +/- 21 mW m- 2 and favorable durability after 30 days of operation. Furthermore, 16srDNA results confirm that Fe-N-S/C effectively promotes the growth of functional colonies in anode biofilms, leading to high-efficient electricity production. The development of bifunctional electrode materials in this study can improve the performance of MFCs and facilitate their practical application.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000701372400001

However, their mechanism remains poorly understood even on the most catalytically-active platinum surfaces, for which such a fundamental parameter as the reactions' order with respect to the hydrogen concentration is still unknown. With this motivation, we have performed rotating disc electrode measurements on polycrystalline Pt in 0.1 M NaOH with different hydrogen partial pressures (between 10 and 100 kPa H-2), from which we have derived a reaction order of 1/2. The latter value has important implications in the procedure to follow in order to derive kinetic currents free of diffusion contributions. More precisely, the HOR currents must be corrected for the diffusion overpotential and converted into a mass-transport free kinetic current using a modified version of the Koutecky-Levich equation that takes into consideration this non-unit reaction order, while the HER side only needs to be ohmically compensated due to the impossibility to supersaturate the electrolye with H2. Most importantly, our results point at a mechanism consisting of a dissociative adsorption (Tafel) reaction combined with a one-electron transfer (Volmer) rate-determining step, in terms consistent with the well-established view of the hydrogen-bonding strength as the main HOR/HER activity descriptor.

Herein, a series of cheap and functional phosphate composites with different ratios of cobalt and nickel are synthesized using a simple polyalcohol refluxing method, and their excellent capacity and OER properties are systematically studied. Notably, owing to the different major role of Co and Ni elements in the phosphate composites for capacity and OER, the optimal electroconductibility, structural adjustment, electrochemical active sites, and activities for capacity and OER are obtained from the composites with the different ratios of Co/Ni. In addition, using high-capacity BiPO4 (BPO) as the negative electrodes, the new type of all-phosphate asymmetric supercapacitor (CNPO-40//BPO) shows a high energy density and reaches 36.84 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 254.52 W kg(-1). Its cyclic stability is also more excellent than that of the CNPO-40//AC device using commercial activated carbon as the negative electrodes. This study is beneficial to the more in- depth research on efficient dual-function electromaterials in capacity and OER and provides a high-efficient way to improve the practicality of asymmetric supercapacitors using the high-capacity Bi-based electromaterials as the negative electrodes.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000679917500075	34255472

Here, hierarchically porous MnCo2O4 nanotubes with single-or double-wall architecture are fabricated through a facile electrospinning technique, by adjusting the concentration of the electrospinning solution. The electrochemical measurements indicate that both types of nanotubes possess excellent catalytic abilities toward oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in alkaline aqueous or non-aqueous media. When used as air-electrode catalysts for Li-O-2 batteries, both single-and double-wall MnCo2O4 nanotubes show significantly improved electrochemical performance. In particular, the novel double-wall MnCo2O4 nanotubes (DW-MCO-NT), with a high surface area and a large pore volume almost twice as big as the single-wall nanotubes, can offer numerous catalytically active sites as well as sufficient space to deposit discharge products. The DW-MCO-NT based Li-O-2 batteries can deliver a maximum discharge capacity of 8100 mA h g(-1), with a potential plateau at 2.77 V, and achieve an excellent cyclability over 278 cycles, under strict conditions of 1000 mA h g(-1) at 400 mA g(-1) within 2.6-4.3 V. Moreover, the XRD and SEM analyses show that the dominant discharge product with a particulate shape is crystal Li2O2 and is prone to being completely decomposed, endowing the MnCo2O4 nanotube-based Li-O-2 battery with a long cycle life.									24	3	0	0	0	0	25			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000438665100025	29963679

LSCF offers potential applications in many processes, such as electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), oxygen sensors, and dense membrane for oxygen separation and thus have been studied extensively in various fields. However, its physical and electrochemical properties are substantially influenced by dopant concentration, dopant type and processing conditions (synthesis methods, composite cathode effect, fabrication conditions, and chromium poisoning). Understanding and correlating the effect of LSCF composition, its synthesis methods, fabrication conditions, and its parameters are essential to enhance the performance of LSCF cathode for high-to-intermediate temperature SOFC applications. This review emphasizes the importance of enhancing the performance of LSCF cathode by optimizing the influential factors to facilitate and expedite research and development efforts for SOFC commercialization in the near future. Various synthesis and fabrication methods used to prepare and fabricate LSCF and LSCF-based composite cathodes are discussed in detail. Moreover, their pros and cons in optimizing the microstructure of LSCF cathodes are highlighted. Finally, the strategies to improve the long-term microstructural stability and electrochemical performances of the LSCF cathode are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2229-838X			WOS:000813247100017

Here we developed a hydrothermal decomposition method to synthesize silver nanoparticles (NPs) supported on carbon nitride (Ag/g-C3N4) from silver oxide (Ag2O) precursor. The obtained Ag/gC(3)N(4) electrocatalyst is capable of producing CO at a low onset overpotential (190 mV), and exhibits a high Faraday efficiency (FE) up to 94.0% at -0.7 V vs RHE along with a mass activity of 45.7 mA/mg. The improved electrochemical performance is attributed to the ultra-stable oxygen species derived from the incomplete decomposition of Ag2O and coexisted with Ag NPs in the final Ag/g-C3N4 composite. The presence and durability of oxygen species were verified from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Ag MNN Auger spectra, and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements. The strong interaction between Ag NPs and g-C3N4 substrate via the Ag-N bonding alters the rate-determining step (RDS) of CO2 RR from the electron transfer (CO2 to*CO2 center dot-) to the proton transfer (*CO2 center dot- to *COOH) process.

Herein, one-dimensional CuCo2O4 nanotubes are fabricated by a cost-efficient electrospinning technique as a bifunctional cathodic catalyst for a lithium-oxygen battery for the first time. The as fabricated CuCo2O4 nanotubes with hollow and hierarchically mesoporous/macroporous architecture accelerate the mass (O-2 and Li+) transport and alleviate the clog of insoluble discharge products. Along with their highly intrinsic activity toward oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, the CuCo2O4 nanotubes-based lithium-oxygen battery demonstrates remarkably improved electrochemical performance, such as low overpotential, high discharge capacities (8778 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)), superb rate capability, and superior reversibility up to 128 cycles under a controlled capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA gr(-1). The further ex-situ SEM and XRD analyses reveal that the disk-like toroidal-shaped Li2O2 product can be efficiently decomposed during the recharging process, confirming the good reversibility of CuCo2O4 nanotubes-based cathode. These outcomes demonstrate the good prospect of CuCo2O4 nanotubes as an effectively non-noble metal catalyst in the reversible Li-O-2 battery.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			2168-0485			WOS:000449577200171

Herein, a unique 3D hierarchical NiMo3S4 nanoflowers with abundant defects and reactive sites were grown directly on carbon textiles (NiMo3S4/CTs) using a facile hydrothermal synthesis method. The defect-rich NiMo3S4 nanoflakes, prepared by doping Ni2+ in the lattice of Mo-S, displays extended d-spacing of (002) crystal plane, resulting in the electrocatalytic activity of hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER) was improved under alkaline conditions. The self-supported NiMo3S4/CTs electrode delivers a small overpotential of 149.5 mV for HER and 126.2 mV for OER at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Based on detailed structure analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the excellent HER and OER activities can be attributed to the unique structure of the nanoflowers, where the metallic characteristics for Ni-doped Mo-S lead to the enhancement of intrinsic conductivity and the rich abundance of Ni3+ active sites. As a result, the NiMo3S4/CTs as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water-splitting was performed in alkaline electrolyte, where the system required only 1.55, 1.66 and 1.76 V to deliver current densities of 10, 50 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. This study provides a new method for improving the electrocatalysis properties of transition metal sulfides by metal-ion doping to generate more active defect sites, thus promoting the development of non-noble-metal electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.

Such environments contain high pressures, inhomogeneous media, and mixing/diffusion timescales that control the oxidation rates. Modeling atomic and molecular spectra of the U-O kinetics products is a critical tool to help understand uranium gas-phase oxidation reactive pathways, reaction rate dependencies, and U x O y formation. By applying spectral modeling to spatially varying, non-uniform flowfields, important features and unique spectral trends can potentially be linked to critical flow and reaction characteristics in processes such as developing flame fronts and turbulent structures. In this research we will discuss the use of Quasi-Steady State Approximation (QSSA) analysis to reduce the reaction set for more tractable 3D simulations. Analysis was performed using synthetic spectroscopic models to understand the sensitivity of mechanism choice, plasma properties, and the presence of various intermediate product species (UO, U + , etc.) on the resultant spectroscopic features from a temporal and spatial evolution perspective.					2022 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)2022 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)	22-26 May 202222-26 May 2022		Seattle, WA, USASeattle, WA, USA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-6654-7925-7	INSPEC:21862621

Undoubtedly, only precise tailoring and control over the catalytic properties can ensure high efficiency and successful implementation of such devices in day-to-day practical utilization. However, contrary to theoretical predictions, systematic experimental work dealing with the doped materials and their impact to electrocatalysis are relatively underrated despite the considerable effect that it could bring into this field. Herein, we investigate the effect of four different dopants (i.e., Ti, V, Mn, and Fe) incorporated to both layered MoS2 and WS2 as solid-state solution toward their electrocatalytic performance through their evaluation as catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Our results pointed out that doping by Mn and Fe can enhance the electrocatalytic performance toward ORR, whereas doping by Ti and V revealed poor electrocatalytic effects (inhibition) compared to both undoped MoS2 and WS2. Surprisingly, none of the dopants contributed to the improvement of either MoS2 or WS2 toward HER activity. Therefore, in addition to the experimental data, density functional theory calculations were performed to further investigate the role of the dopants in the performance of MoS2 toward HER. According to these calculations, all dopants preferably occupied the edges of the crystal structure and thus could affect the electrocatalytic properties of the initial material. However, the observed Delta G values for hydrogen adsorption revealed that MoS2 is the best catalyst with a subsequent trend for doped materials following the less negative binding energies V < Ti < Mn < Fe, which was in good agreement with experimentally obtained overpotentials of the respective samples. This study thus elucidates the reasons for negative effects of doping in TMDs.

Their commercial applications are hindered by the low oxygen reduction reaction/ oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) bifunctional activity (for URFCs and MABs), OER selectivity (brine electrolysis in seawater and Martian environments), and high cost of the benchmark electrocatalysts (OER: RuO2, IrO2 and ORR: Pt/C) which affects the performance and affordability of the devices. Low-cost electrocatalysts with highly symmetric ORR/OER bifunctional activity and high OER selectivity are crucial for largescale FC, WE, URFC, and MAB application. Recent studies have revealed that tuning the structure of pyrochlore oxides provides a pathway to enhancing OER and ORR activity over a wide range of pH. Pyrochlore oxides commonly contain a cubic A(2)B(2)O(7-x) structure with two types of tetrahedrally coordinated O atoms containing (1) A-O-A and (2) A-O B types with a cationic radii mismatch of r(A)/r(B) > 1.5 and propensity toward oxygen vacancy formation. The variety of pyrochlore oxides and their tunable properties make them attractive for a wide spectrum of applications. Among all the metal oxides, Ru-based pyrochlores (e.g., Pb2Ru2O7-x) exhibit the best bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity, i.e., low bifunctionality index (BI), in alkaline medium. Furthermore, pyrochlores exhibit high OER selectivity in brine electrolytes due to the presence of surface oxygen vacancies, making them suitable for space applications (brine electrolysis on Mars) and coastal hydrogen generation. Their bifunctional activity and selectivity can be further amplified by (1) substituting "A " and "B " sites of pyrochlores (AA'BB'O7-x), (2) tuning metal oxidation states of A and B by varying synthesis conditions, and (3) modulating oxygen vacancy concentration, each of which yield favorable structural and electronic variations. In recent years, research on the synthesis and understanding of pyrochlores has significantly enhanced their viability, offering a new horizon in the quest for economical and active electrocatalysts. However, an account that focuses on critical developments in this field is still lacking. In this Account, we focus on the recent development of a variety of pyrochlore electrocatalysts to understand intrinsic structure activity-selectivity-stability relationships in these materials. Recent developments and applications of pyrochlore-based electrocatalysts are discussed under the following headings: (1) modulation of crystal and electronic structure of pyrochlores, (2) structure-activity-stability relationships of different pyrochlores for OER and ORR, (3) development of OER-selective pyrochlores for brine electrolysis, and (4) the application of pyrochlores in electrochemical devices. Finally, we highlight some unaddressed issues such as the precise identification of active sites, which can be addressed in the future through advanced in situ and ex situ characterization techniques coupled with the density functional theory-based analyses. This Account provides foundational understanding to guide the comprehensive development of highly active, selective, stable and low-cost structurally engineered pyrochlores for high performance electrochemical devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000834271900001	35878953

Inspired by the tunable electronic structure of these motifs, a high-throughput computational search for synthetic hydrogen catalysts is performed based on a similar motif of TM atoms embedded into the lattice of graphene. Based on an initial list of 300 possible embedding geometries, binders, and host atoms, descriptors for stability and catalytic activity are applied to extract ten promising candidates for hydrogen evolution, two of which are expected to exhibit high activity for hydrogen oxidation. In several instances, the active TM atoms are earth-abundant elements that show no activity in the bulk phase, highlighting the importance of the coordination environment in tuning the d-orbitals. In addition, it is found that the most active candidates involve a hitherto unreported surface reaction pathway that involves a Kubas-complex intermediate, which significantly lowers the kinetic barrier associated with hydrogen dissociation and association									52	2	0	0	4	0	52			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000367199600015

The effect of CoOx loading on the charge potential in the oxygen evolution reaction (Li2O2 -> 2Li(+) + O-2 + 2e(-)) was investigated in coin-cell tests. The CoOx (38.9 wt%)/CG composite showed a low charge potential of 3.92 V with a delivered capacity of 2 mAh cm(-2) under a current density of 0.2 mA cm(-2). The charge potential was 4.10 and 4.15 V at a capacity of 5 and 10 mAh cm(-2), respectively, with a current density of 0.5 mA cm(-2). The stability of the electrolyte and discharge product on the gas-diffusion layer after the cycling were preliminarily characterized by H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The high activity of the composite was further analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and potential-step chronoamperometry. The results indicate that our near-dry milling method is an effective and green approach to preparing a nanocomposite cathode with high surface area and porosity, while using less solvent. Its relative simplicity compared with the traditional solution method could facilitate its widespread application in catalysis, energy storage, and materials science.									9	2	0	0	0	0	11			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000340175300015	24962019

Titanium dioxide, a semiconductor, is an inactive oxygen evolution electrocatalyst because of its low conductivity and poor reactivity. Here, thin film of a low-symmetry (short-range order) mesoporous titanium dioxide (lsm-TiO2) electrocatalysts having about 200 m(2)g(-1) surface area and semi-crystalline anatase wall were prepared by evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) approach, followed by a two-step calcination process. The porosity, order, surface area, crystallinity and activity of ism-TiO2 are controlled by tuning the titanium precursor/surfactant ratio. The lsm-TiO2 catalyst with a precursor/surfactant ratio of 1.5 wt% showed unprecedented electrocatalytic activity and substantial shift in the oxygen evolution onset potential to 1.55 V vs. RHE (overpotential ca. 320 mV), small Tafel slope (51 my dec(-1)) and charge transfer resistance, and current density of 11 mA cm(-2) was obtained at 1.65 V vs. RHE, significantly more efficient than highly ordered hexagonal mesoporous TiO2 counterpart and comparable to state-of-the-art transition metal oxide electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the lsm-TiO2 electrode has excellent durability and is activated during electrolysis with no visible current decays or potential drifting is observed after 12.0 h of electrolysis, demonstrating the promise of this low-symmetry mesoporous TiO2 as an electrocatalyst for energy conversion technologies.

N-doped carbon coupled with transition metal-based species are among the most promising cathode catalysts for Zn-air batteries. However, the aggregation of metal-based sites during the synthetic/cycling process is a serious drawback of these catalysts. Herein, in situ encapsulation of ultra-small Co/Co4N nanoparticles into N-doping carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) anchored on reduced GO (Co/Co4N@N-CNTs/rGO) has been achieved through pyrolyzing a core-shell-structured ZIF-8@ZIF-67-modified GO (ZIF-8@ZIF-67/GO) precursor; the nanoparticles have been further applied as a bifunctional catalyst in Zn-air batteries. Benefitting from its uniform dispersion of Co-based particles, close contact of Co/Co4N species and N-CNTs, and high N content, Co/Co4N@N-CNTs/rGO shows outstanding catalytic activity/stability towards ORR and OER. Moreover, Zn volatilization and rGO introduction in Co/Co4N@N-CNTs/rGO can effectively promote the reactions of Zn-air cells. Hence, the Co/Co4N@N-CNTs/rGO-based conventional Zn-air battery exhibits a fantastic specific capacity of 783 mA h g(Zn)(-1), a continuous discharge platform over 6 days, a high-power density of similar to 200 mW cm(-2) and an ultra-long cycling life of 440 h with a small overpotential of similar to 0.8 V. Moreover, a flexible Co/Co4N@N-CNTs/rGO-based Zn-air cell was also designed and revealed outstanding mechanical flexibility and good electrochemical performance, which suggests its potential application prospects in wearable electronic devices.									35	2	0	0	3	0	36			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000500778500026	31701977

Several kinetic parameters are considered, including Total, Volmer and Tafel overpotentials, exchange current densities and activation energies of the elementary reactions. Such parameters are investigated by measuring the overpotential decay immediately after the interruption of an applied cathodic current. The effects of NaBH4 treatment and temperature on the mechanism of the HER are analysed on the basis of the dependence of the Volmer and Tafel overpotentials on current density. The effect of the NaBH4 concentration on the performance of the hydrogen storage alloy as a negative electrode material in nickel-metal hydride batteries and/or alkaline fuel cells is discussed from the standpoint of relative velocity of the elementary reactions.

The system demonstrated surprising performance, attributed to the low onset potential in addition to the superior stability. Herein, heteroatoms including nitrogen, sulphur, and oxygen acted as promotors between the MWCNTs and GO for the hydrogen sulphide oxidation reaction. The electrochemical measurements indicated that the composite has a superior current density of 98.20 mA cm(-2) with better stability towards the H2S oxidation reaction. This enhancement will subsequently increase the current density for H-2 generation from H2S at an onset potential of -0.5 V versus a saturated calomel electrode (SCE). Furthermore, compared with the initiation barrier on different surfaces, it was observed that the presence of S atoms can facilitate the first S-H bond dissociation and drive the second dissociation of S-H species.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000708595800001

Pyrite (20 - 100% reactive), sedimentary organic matter (SOM; 3 - 56%), and siderite (3 - 28%) were the main O-2 reductants. Trace-levels of carbonate acted as a pH buffer, while a lower boundary pH of 3 indicated acid buffering by K-feldspar dissolution. The processes identified in the incubation experiments were used to formulate a kinetic reaction modelling framework that was able to reproduce the major ion composition during subsequent column experiments. These experiments showed that there was at least 2 orders of magnitude difference between reaction rates of the incubation and column experiments. However, the combined approach was useful for identifying and quantifying key geochemical reactions that affect the water quality evolution in represented field conditions and will serve as basis for the model-based interpretation of the operational field scale injection and recovery experiment.					2nd International Conference on Environmental Science and Development (ICESD 2011)2nd International Conference on Environmental Science and Development (ICESD 2011)	JAN 07-09, 2011JAN 07-09, 2011	Asia Pacific Chem Biol & Environm Engn Soc; Int Assoc Comp Sci & Informat TechnolAsia Pacific Chem Biol & Environm Engn Soc; Int Assoc Comp Sci & Informat Technol	Mumbai, INDIAMumbai, INDIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2010-4618		978-981-08-8716-2	WOS:000392766200005

The extension to biological systems is now proceeding, with surprising evidence of involvement of natural processes, including the action of singlet oxygen in white blood cell phagocytosis.									29	0	0	0	9	0	29			0020-7608	1097-461X		WOS:A1991EY44600003

Part 1. - Metallic iridium								JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				773				69	78		10.1016/j.jelechem.2016.04.033				JUL 15 2016	2016	A better understanding of iridium dissolution is important in the elucidation of the general mechanism of noble metals corrosion and in the design of more durable iridium based applied materials. In the current work iridium dissolution has been addressed by a complementary electrochemical and mass spectrometric technique based on a scanning flow cell (SFC) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Time- and potential resolved iridium dissolution profiles are recorded and analyzed. It is found that during the anodic treatment dissolution is increasing constantly with potential. Anodic dissolution decreases with time, which is attributed to the buildup of a passivating oxide layer. In case a significantly low reductive potential is applied to the oxidized electrode, an additional.dissolution process is observed. It is concluded that like other members of the noble metals group, e.g. gold and platinum, thoroughly studied before, dissolution of iridium is initiated by a change in the iridium oxidation state during the initial formation or reduction of a thin compact anhydrous oxide layer. Both transitions metal/oxide and oxide/metal during oxidation and reduction, respectively, result in dissolution. Thus, dissolution is a transient process. The Ir(III)/Ir(IV) transition in the thick hydrous oxide layer, responsible for iridium oxide electrochromism, do not lead, however, to any significant change in dissolution signal. At even higher anodic potentials, further destabilization is caused by a change in the oxidation number (increase and decrease) of iridium cations during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). At studied potentials OER on the metallic electrodes, covered by a thin compact anhydrous oxide layer, has Tafel slope of ca. 66 mV dec(-1), which is comparable to literature data on bulk IrO2 electrodes and, probably, implies on similarities in the OER mechanism on these materials.

An as-prepared sample in which Au is present as a surface oxyhydroxy complex does not adsorb CO. On an activated sample in which only metallic Au is detected, 0.18 +/- 0.03 mol CO/(mol Au) are adsorbed on Au at -60 degrees C, which shows an IR band at 2090 cm(-1). When oxygen is present in the gas phase, this species reacts with a turnover rate of 1.4 +/- 0.2 mol CO(mol Au min)(-1), which is close to the steady-state turnover rate. In contrast, there is a very small quantity of adsorbed oxygen on Au. A small IR peak at 1242 cm(-1) appears when an activated sample is exposed to CO. It reacts rapidly with oxygen and is shifted to 1236 cm(-1) if O-18 is used. It is assigned to the possible intermediate hydroxycarbonyl.									60	4	0	0	1	0	60			1520-6106			WOS:000237409500026	16640425

This study focuses on the photocatalytic activity of flower-like SnS2 nanoparticles (composed of nanosheet subunits) embedded in TiO2 synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. The materials were characterized using different techniques, and their photocatalytic activity was assessed for hydrogen evolution reaction and the degradation of methylene blue. Among the catalysts studied, 10 wt. % of SnS2 loaded TiO2 nanocomposite shows an optimum hydrogen evolution rate of 195.55 mu molg(-1), whereas 15 wt. % loading of SnS2 on TiO2 exhibits better performance against the degradation of methylene blue (MB) with the rate constant of 4.415 x 10(-4) s(-1) under solar simulated irradiation. The improved performance of these materials can be attributed to the effective photo-induced charge transfer and reduced recombination, which make these nanocomposite materials promising candidates for the development of high-performance next-generation photocatalyst materials. Further, scavenging experiments were carried out to confirm the reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in the photocatalytic degradation. It can be observed that there was a 78% reduction in the rate of degradation when IPA was used as the scavenger, whereas around 95% reduction was attained while N-2 was used as the scavenger. Notably, very low degradation (<5%) was attained when the dye alone was directly under solar irradiation. These results further validate that the center dot OH radical and the superoxide radicals can be acknowledged for the degradation mechanism of MB, and the enhancement of degradation efficiency may be due to the combined effect of in situ dye sensitization during the catalysis and the impregnation of low bandgap materials on TiO2.									9	0	0	0	3	0	9				2073-4344		WOS:000653577400001

The importance of droplet generation rate, droplet size, and its residence time in the slag-metal emulsion on the overall reaction kinetics has become evident in recent times. Residence times of the droplets are strongly dependent on the decarburization rate, the CO bubbles giving a buoyant force to the droplets. The present work aims at developing a mathematical model for predicting the composition evolutions of the slag and the metal phases as the blow proceeds in an LD converter. The process dynamics are modeled by dividing the LD convertor into three separate continuous stirred tank reactors. Oxidation reactions are assumed to be primarily taking place at the interface between the slag and the metal phases in the emulsion. Among the different mass transfer and reaction steps controlling the kinetics, the mass transfer of FeO in the slag phase and that of the metalloids within the metal droplet are assumed to be rate-controlling. For a Fe-C-X (X = Mn, Si etc.) droplet, simultaneous removal of elements have been modeled by Gibbs' free energy minimization at the slag-metal interface. Effects of droplet size, mass transfer coefficient, and initial carbon content on the mean residence time of metal droplets in the slag-metal emulsion have also been identified.

Mass transfer and electron transfer are two primary factors that need to be optimized in order to enhance electrocatalytic reactions. The use of nanocatalysts proves to be a promising way of promoting the performance of electrocatalytic reactions, this improvement is usually attributed to their ability to enhance electron transfer. However, when catalysts are taken down to the nanoscale, their size is comparable to the thickness of an electrical double layer, so any curvature can lead to an inhomogeneous local electric field on the electrode, which then changes the mass transfer essentially. In this article, we introduce the new concept of local-field-induced mass transfer in nano-electrocatalytic systems, and provide a brief review of recent progress, revealing its effect on nano-electrocatalysis, which may bring new insight into the future design of nano-electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000731594700008	34549470

Liquid-phase synthesis of intermetallics has arisen as the promising methodology due to its precise control over size, shape, and resistance toward sintering compared with the traditional metallurgy. This short review tends to provide perspectives on the liquid-phase synthesis of intermetallics in terms of both thermodynamics and methodology, as well as its applications in various catalytic reactions. Specifically, basic thermodynamics and kinetics in the synthesis of intermetallics will be first discussed, followed by discussing the main factors that will affect the formation of intermetallics during synthesis. The application of intermetallics in electrocatalysis will be demonstrated case by case at last. We conclude the review with perspectives on the future developments with respect to both synthesis and catalytic applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000702161600001	34428332

However, uncovering the detailed roles of how such active species' structures affect their catalytic performance remains a challenge owing to the lack of direct structural information on a specific active species. Herein, we deposited molybdenum(VI), an active species in oxidation reactions, on the Zr-6 node of a mesoporous zirconium-based metal-organic framework (MOF) NU-1200, using solvothermal deposition in MOFs (SIM). Due to the high crystallinity of the NU-1200 support, the precise structure of the resulting molybdenum catalyst, Mo-NU-1200, was characterized through single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). Two distinct anchoring modes of the molybdenum species were observed: one mode (Mol), displaying an octahedral geometry, coordinated to the node through one terminal oxygen atom and the other mode (Mo2) coordinated to two adjacent Zr-6 node oxygen atoms in a tetrahedral geometry. To investigate the role of base in the catalytic activity of these Mo centers, we assessed the activity of Mo-NU-1200 for the aerobic oxidation of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol as a model reaction. The results revealed that Mo-NU-1200 exhibited remarkably higher catalytic reactivity under base-free conditions, while the presence of base inhibited the catalytic reactivity of this species. SCXRD studies revealed that the molybdenum binding motifs (structures of the supported metal on the Zr-6 node in the MOF) changed over the course of the reactions. Following the oxidation without base, both pristine coordination modes (Mol and Mo2) evolved into a new coordination mode (Mo3), in which the molybdenum atom coordinated to two adjacent oxygen atoms from the Zr-6 node in an octahedral geometry, while in the presence of base, the pristine Mol coordination mode evolved entirely into the pristine Mo2. This study demonstrates the direct observation of an active species' structural evolution from metal installation to subsequent catalytic reaction. As a result, these subtle structural changes in catalyst binding motifs led to distinct differences in catalytic activities, providing a compelling strategy for elucidating structure-activity relationships.									25	2	0	0	1	0	26			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000634761500029	33706512

Herein, we describe the synthesis of bimetallic and trimetallic (Ni, Co and Mn) oxide-hydroxide nanosheets and evaluate their catalytic activity toward water oxidation. The catalytic activity of porous trimetallic nanosheets was found to be higher than that of bimetallic hybrids. In addition, the trimetallic systems also possess excellent stability. A current density of 10 mA/cm(2) is achieved for an overpotential of 287 mV and ~0% loss even after 8000 cycles. The enhanced performance by the trimetallic system can be attributed to the large electrochemical surface area and better intrinsic activity. The electronic modulation in this three-element system is evident from the X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) study and Mott-Schottky analysis. The position of flat-band potential plays a significant role in determining the charge transfer kinetics, thereby affecting the water oxidation activity in the semiconductor-electrolyte system. Trimetallic system also offers better oxygen evolution reaction kinetics as evident from the least activation energy compared to the bimetallic counterparts. The local structure system is realized with the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis. The present study highlights the importance of intrinsic activity in designing efficient non-noble metal electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773611500002

Dimagnesium manganate (Mg2MnO4) is one Mn(IV) containing oxide which has been of interest. Nanostructures of the above oxide (spinel) have been obtained by the thermal decomposition of nanostructured metal oxalate precursor at 500 degrees C. The size and anisotropy of the oxide nanostructures was controlled by choosing appropriate decomposition temperature of the oxalate precursor. Mg2MnO4 nanorods were obtained at low temperature (500 degrees C), formed by aligned nanoparticles of size similar to 8-10 nm. These nanoparticles show Curie-Weiss behavior with Weiss constant (14 K). Below similar to 50 K there is a small deviation resulting in a negative Weiss constant (-736 K) indicating exchange cross over (from ferromagnetic like interactions to antiferromagnetic interactions). The high temperature magnetic moment corresponds to Mn (IV). Electrochemical experiments show that nanostructured Mg2MnO4 is an efficient anode material for oxygen evolution reaction with a current density of 14 mA/cm(2). The stability of the anode over several cycles of oxidation and reduction is highly encouraging. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Pt/CdS showed high activity (67.7 mu mol h(-1)) for H-2 evolution in borate buffer solution containing [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) as an electron donor under visible-light irradiation. A cyano complex containing [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) and Cd2+, which efficiently scavenged photogenerated holes and effectively facilitated the oxidation of [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) to [Fe(CN)(6)](3-), was formed on the CdS surface in the reaction. Modification of other metal sulfides, such as ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4, with the cyano complex K-2[CdFe(CN)(6)] significantly improved their rates of H-2 evolution (ZnIn2S4:4.8 -> 15 mu mol h(-1); CdIn2S4:0.8 -> 6 mu mol h(-1)) in the presence of [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) and an appropriate O-2-evolution system (CoOx-loaded TaON photoanode), enabling Z-scheme water splitting.									26	0	0	0	3	0	26			2398-4902			WOS:000422784900013

The photoelectrochemically self-improving behaviour of a silicon/gallium nitride photocathode highly efficient for hydrogen production is now reported.Development of an efficient yet durable photoelectrode is of paramount importance for deployment of solar-fuel production. Here, we report the photoelectrochemically self-improving behaviour of a silicon/gallium nitride photocathode active for hydrogen production with a Faradaic efficiency approaching similar to 100%. By using a correlative approach based on different spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, as well as density functional theory calculations, we provide a mechanistic understanding of the chemical transformation that is the origin of the self-improving behaviour. A thin layer of gallium oxynitride forms on the side walls of the gallium nitride grains, via a partial oxygen substitution at nitrogen sites, and displays a higher density of catalytic sites for the hydrogen-evolving reaction. This work demonstrates that the chemical transformation of gallium nitride into gallium oxynitride leads to sustained operation and enhanced catalytic activity, thus showing promise for oxynitride layers as protective catalytic coatings for hydrogen evolution.									22	2	0	0	0	0	22			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000636966700001	33820963

In this sense the full knowledge of the behavior of radiation-induced defects in Sn-doped Si is particularly important. The present report gives a systematic study of the evolution of the vacancy-oxygen (VOn, 1 <= n <= 6) defects and the carbon-oxygen (CiOi) defect in electron-irradiated Sn-doped Cz-Si containing carbon. The radiation-induced defects and their reactions were investigated by Infrared Spectroscopy (IR) in the course of 20 min isochronal anneals from room temperature up to similar to 750 degrees C. Interestingly, in Sn-doped Cz-Si samples we were able to monitor and study IR bands correlated with VO5/VO6 defects. In particular, we tentatively attributed two bands at 1037, 1051 cm(-1) to the VO5 defect, and two other bands at 967, 1005 cm(-1) to the VO6 defect. Concerning carbon-related defects, our results show that the disappearance of the 862 cm(-1) band of the CiOi defect is accompanied in the spectra by the emergence of a band at 1048 cm(-1) previously correlated with a CsO2i structure.

Oxyhydroxides and p-n heterojunctions have been demonstrated as efficient catalysts for the water oxidation reaction. In this work, to address the drawbacks of poor conductivity and sluggish oxidation kinetics of hematite, we introduce a p-type NiOOH overlayer as a surface catalyst onto n-type Sn-doping hematite (Sn@alpha-Fe2O3) photoanode. The oxygen vacancies (Ov) are reconstructed both in the bulk of Sn@alpha-Fe2O3 and the surface decoration layer of NiOOH via Ar plasma treatment, effectively reducing unavoidable defects introduced by the NiOOH overlayer. Compared with the original Sn@alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode, the Sn@alpha-Fe2O3/NiOOH-Ar photoanode exhibits a significant increase in photocurrent density (at 1.23 VRHE) of & SIM;3 times and a decrease in the onset potential of similar to 200 mV. The performance improvement can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the p-n junctions formed by NiOOH decoration and improved conductivity through oxygen vacancy reconstruction, which remarkably improves carrier separation in the bulk of alpha-Fe2O3 and suppresses carrier recombination on the photoanode surface. Moreover, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation proves that the real active sites are farther from (rather than near) the oxygen vacancies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000829615500001

Herein, we develop an in situ phase transformation strategy to synthesize Ti3C2@SrTiO3 MXene nanocomposites as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for ZABs. The Ti3C2@SrTiO3 heterostructures guarantee excellent structural stability and promote interfacial charge transfer to accelerate the electrocatalytic redox kinetics. Ti3C2 MXene not only promotes fast electronic/ionic transfer but also stably anchors SrTiO3 nanocubes without aggregation to provide abundant catalytic active sites and prominent structural stability. Advantageous oxygen vacancies introduced in SrTiO3 nanocrystals could effectively regulate the electronic structure of active sites, triggering higher intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, Ti vacancies in the MXene display an important synergetic effect to promote the electron transfer in Ti3C2@SrTiO3 heterostructures. Theory calculations reveal that abundant vacancy defects substantially strengthen the oxygen intermediates' adsorption ability on the Ti3C2@SrTiO3 catalyst, essentially lowering the energy barrier for the ORR/OER process. As expected, the ZABs based on the Ti3C2@SrTiO3 catalyst exhibit exceptional electrochemical performance, an extraordinary open-circuit voltage of 1.44 V, and an essentially improved power density of 122 mW cm(-2). The in situ transformation and defect modulation strategies provide enlightening clues to design a high-performance ZAB cathode catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000824072600001

Thermogravimetric and XRD measurements indicate an isomorphic substitution of Fe by Cr. Electrochemical characterization shows increasingly sluggish hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics with increased Cr loadings. This decrease in activity is accompanied by the inhibition of the reduction of iron in alpha-Fe-1 (-) xCrxOOH To investigate the origin of this decrease in activity, DFT calculations were performed for mixtures of Fe and Cr placed at Fe(OH)(2). Based on phase diagrams, the most stable structures under HER conditions are identified and used to estimate the theoretical overpotential. In contrast to experiment, no decrease in HER activity is observed. Instead, mixed FeCr sites display an overpotential comparable to that of Pt. Taking into account the inhibition of the bulk reduction in the presence of Cr, the activity decreases in agreement with experiment. These results are very important in the search for cathodes in the chlorate process that are active also in the absence of chromate in solution and may offer a new route for Pt free HER catalysts in alkaline solution.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000435619700016

XPS depth profiles with variable X-ray energies and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyses show that the as-synthesized Au (x) Pd1-x (x = 0.25 and 0.5) bimetallic NPs have gradient alloy structures with Au-rich cores and Pd-rich shells. The evolution of composition and structure in the surface region corresponding to a mean free path of 0.6-0.8 nm (i.e., 2-3 layers to the bulk from the particle surface) was studied with ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) under CO/O-2 reaction in the Torr pressure regime. Under the reaction conditions of 80 mTorr CO and 200 mTorr O-2 at 200 A degrees C, the surface region of Au0.75Pd0.25 NP is Au-rich (similar to 70% by Au). All Au (x) Pd1-x (x = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75) NP catalysts have higher turnover rates for the model CO/O-2 reaction than pure Pd and pure Au NPs. The Pd-rich Au0.25Pd0.75 NPs show the highest turnover rates and the Pd-rich Au0.5Pd0.5 NPs the lowest turnover rates at 200 A degrees C. Interestingly, the Au-rich Au0.75Pd0.25 NPs exhibit steady-state turnover rates which are intermediate to those of the Pd-rich bimetallic nanoparticles.									57	0	0	0	5	1	58			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000290166400002

However, the intrinsic drawbacks of weak visible-light adsorption and poor charge separation efficiency seriously limit its practical applications. Thus, struggling controls over their structure parameters to optimize the photoelectrical properties on molecular-level for realizing highly active metal-free g-C3N4 photocatalysts have attracted a lot of focuses. Herein, a novel isopropanol assisted solvothermal-copolymerization strategy is rationally designed to synthesize a compact O, S-co-doping g-C3N4 (CNUS) with markedly reinforced pi-pi* and pi-pi* electron transitions. The meliorative structure and energy level configuration result in elevated effects for both visible-light (photon) adsorption and photo induced carries transfer, and the CNUS exhibits outstanding photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and rhodamine B degradation performance under visible light. In addition, after continuously testing, the CNUS still shows superior stability with nearly negligible decay for both photocatalytic reactions. The characterization results indicate that the incorporated oxygen and sulfur engineer the charge, and the layered-stacking distance decreases from 0.328 to 0.322 nm, compared its counterpart (CNU prepared by direct pyrolysis of urea).

Advances in nanoscience and material chemistry have afforded great opportunities for the design and optimization of nanostructured electrocatalysts with high efficiency and practical durability. In this review article, we specifically emphasize the synthetic methodologies for the versatile surface overcoating engineering reported to date for optimal electrocatalysts. We discuss the recent progress in the development of surface overcoating-derived electrocatalysts potentially applied in polymer electrolyte fuel cells and water electrolyzers by correlating catalyst intrinsic structures with electrocatalytic properties. Finally, we present the opportunities and perspectives of surface overcoating engineering for the design of advanced (electro)catalysts and their deep exploitation in a broad scope of applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000726872500001	34870651

Various electrolytes containing different anions (acetate, chloride, phosphate, perchlorate, and sulfate) and cations (Li+, Na+, and K+) were prepared at pH 1, 3, and S to investigate how these anions and cations affect the efficiency of the photo-oxidation reaction of water on the WO3 surface. To quantitatively compare their effects on O-2 evolution, photocurrent to oxygen conversion efficiency was obtained for each electrolyte by simultaneously measuring photocurrent and O-2 produced in a sealed divided cell. The type of competing reactions present in each electrolyte and their effects on water oxidation to O-2 or to hydrogen peroxide, which is known to accumulate on the WO3 surface and cause photocorrosion, were investigated. The results reported in this study will be useful in formulating optimum electrolyte compositions to enhance desired photo-oxidation reactions for various photoelectrochemical cells.									219	4	1	0	17	0	220			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000302591300002

The band gap E-g of In0.9Ni0.1TaO4 is about 2.3 eV, and particles with sizes in the range of 300-500 nm were observed by TEM measurements. We loaded 1.0 wt % partially oxidized nickel as electron-trapping and hydrogen-evolution sites onto the In0.9Ni0.1TaO4 surface from an aqueous Ni(NO3)(2) solution. The TEM measurements show that nearly spherical nano NiOx particles with a size of about 15 nm are distributed on the surface of In0.9Ni0.1TaO4. Stoichiometric amounts of oxygen and hydrogen were evolved under visible-light irradiation using NiOx/In0.9Ni0.1TaO4 with a quantum yield of about 0.66%. This system behaves as a short-circuited microphotoelectrochemical cell. The surface of NiOx is the cathode, and the surface of In0.9Ni0.1TaO4 is the anode.									66	7	0	0	8	1	68			1520-6106			WOS:000179985100003

In addition to thiosulfate, dithionate, trithionate, and tetrathionate, other polythionates such as pentathionate and hexathionate were detected during the oxidation process. The polythionates found are sensitive to the pH, with the average length of the sulfur chain decreasing with increasing pH. By varying the pH and the concentrations of the reactants, we find that the reaction is first order with respect to each of the reactants with rate constant k = 0.025 M-1 s(-1). With HOS2O3-, HSO3-/SO32-, S3O62-, S4O62-, and S5O62- as key intermediates that are eventually oxidized to sulfate, a proposed 14-step kinetic model simulates the reaction process, including the evolution of the thiosulfate and tetrathionate concentrations at various pHs.									31	1	1	0	3	0	31			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000279211500034	20515027

Two major phenomena, occurring during the reactions, hinder the development of the full potential of nanoparticle catalysts: sintering and contamination with carbon containing species, sometimes called coking. Here, we demonstrate that Ir nanocrystals, arranged into periodic networks on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) supports, can be restored without sintering after contamination by persistent carbon. This restoration yields the complete removal of carbon from the nanocrystals, which keep their crystalline structure, allowing operation without degradation. These findings, together with the possibility of fine tuning the nanocrystals size, confer this nanoparticle system a great potential as a testbed to extract key information about catalysis-mediated oxidation reactions. For the case of the CO oxidation by O-2, reaction of interest in environmental science and green energy production, the existence of chemical processes not observed before in other nanoparticle systems is demonstrated.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000810838300007

Nevertheless, one of the problems concerned with the application of this material is the joint presence of the Ce(III) and Ce(IV) in the ceria sublattice, mainly under low partial pressure of oxygen. TG and DTA measurements were performed in order to verify non-stoichiometric character for cerias hydrothermally treated under reflux and in autoclave. X-ray powder diffraction was used to observe long-range structural evolution varying time and temperature of reaction and the type of hydrothermal synthesis. Finally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) gave the temperature influence for powder morphology. Those techniques pointed out that: i) reaction temperature is not important for converting Ce3+ to Ce4+; ii) testing the reaction time parameter, it is observed quite complete oxidation for the 2-12 h range; and iii) the type of hydrothermal. synthesis parameter influences the crystallinity and non-stoichiometric character of products.									15	0	0	0	0	2	15			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000220510700018

The obtained results have shown that only reactions involving simple electron transfer like hydroquinone/benzoquinone are active in the potential region of the supporting electrolyte stability, although this system is irreversible on diamond electrodes. For oxidation reactions with more complex mechanism, diamond electrodes show no electrocatalytic activity in the potential region of the supporting electrolyte stability. These complex oxidation reactions can take place on diamond electrodes in the potential region of the supporting electrolyte decomposition. The reactivity of some alcohols and carboxylic acids is studied by cyclic voltammetry. Isopropanol in 1 M H2SO4 is oxidized on diamond anode at a constant current density and the intermediates formed are analyzed by HPLC. Finally, a simplified mechanism for the oxidation of organics by electrogenerated OH. radicals on diamond is proposed.									101	1	0	0	20	10	101			1344-9931			WOS:000085618300002

In this work, a small amount of P was doped to the surface of PtNi concave cube (P-PtNi CNC). Interestingly, the P-PtNi CNC nanocatalyst shows an enhanced methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) performance with achieving 8.19 times of specific activity than that of comercial Pt/C. The electrochemical in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results reveal that the surface P doping promotes the adsorption energy of OH, enhancing the resistance against CO poisoning. Therefore, the intermediate adsorbed CO (COads) reacted with adsorbed OH (OHads) through the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) mechanism to generate CO2 and release surface active sites for further adsorption. This work provides a promising strategy via the incorporation of non-metallic elements into the PtNi alloys bounded with high-index facets (HIFs) as efficient fuel cell catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000801137000005

The synthesized NGS with the nitrogen level as high as 10.12 atom% is proven to be a promising material for VRFB. The structures and electrochemical properties of the materials are investigated by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impendence spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that not only the nitrogen doping level but the nitrogen type in the NGS are significant for its catalytic activity towards the [VO](2+)/[VO2](+) redox couple reaction. In more detail, among four types of nitrogen species (pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, quaternary-N, oxidic-N) doped into the graphene lattice, quaternary-N play mainly roles for improving the catalytic activity toward the [VO](2+)/[VO2](+) couple reaction.

The performance of the five-layer CCM was evaluated and compared with a conventional three-layer CCM and a CCM hot-pressed at a higher temperature via converting the protonated form of Nafion to Na+ form and then being reprotonated back to H+ form after hot-pressing. The five-layer CCM exhibits the highest performance and stability, attributed to the expansion of the triple-phase boundaries for electrochemical reactions and the improvement of contact and mass-transfer resistance.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1099-0062	1944-8775		WOS:000247213200007

The detailed chemical reaction model was employed to describe the heat release of detonation chemical reactions. The 2nd additive semi-implicit Runge-Kutta method and 5th order Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory （WENO） scheme were used to integrate the two-dimensional time-dependent reactive Euler equations. For the stoichiometric hydrogen and oxygen mixture diluted by 25% argon, as the channel width is 30 mm and the initial temperature is 300 K,the critical initial pressure for marginal detonation is 3. 5 kPa. Under this critical condition, the cellular pattern, the velocity and maximum pressure along the wall and the wave evolution of marginal detonation were obtained. The difference between the marginal and ordinary detonation was discussed including the detonation velocity, average velocity,the ratio of cell width to length, transverse wave structure, unreacted gas pocket and vortex structure. The intrinsic instability and chemical dynamics characteristics of marginal detonation were deeply recognized.			对矩形管内临界爆轰动力学特征进行了数值分析.采用基元反应描述爆轰化学反应过程,采用二阶附加半隐的龙格-库塔法和5阶WENO格式求解二维反应欧拉方程.对于25%氩稀释化学计量比的氢氧预混气体,当管道宽度为30 mm、初温为300 K时,产生临界爆轰的预混气体初压为3.5 kPa.在此临界条件下,获得了临界爆轰胞格结构、沿壁面的速度和峰值压力曲线及流场波系演变特征.着重对比分析了矩形管内临界爆轰与普通爆轰在爆轰波速度、平均速度、胞格宽长比、横波结构、未反应气囊及旋涡结构之间的差异,深入认识了临界爆轰的不稳定性和化学反应动力学特征.						0	0	0		0	0	0			1000-5773			CSCD:2360599

However, new catalyst and electrode designs with reduced Ir content have been suffering from limited stability caused by (electro)chemical degradation. This has remained a serious impediment to a wider commercialization of larger-scale PEM electrolysis technology. In this combined DFT computational and experimental study, we investigate a novel family of iridium-niobium mixed metal oxide thin-film catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), some of which exhibit greatly enhanced stability, such as minimized voltage degradation and reduced Ir dissolution with respect to the industry benchmark IrOx catalyst. More specifically, we report an unusually durable IrNbOx electrocatalyst with improved catalytic performance compared to an IrOx benchmark catalyst prepared in-house and a commercial benchmark catalyst (Umicore Elyst Ir75 0480) at significantly reduced Ir catalyst cost. Catalyst stability was assessed by conventional and newly developed accelerated degradation tests, and the mechanistic origins were analyzed and are discussed. To achieve this, the IrNbOx mixed metal oxide catalyst and its water splitting kinetics were investigated by a host of techniques such as synchrotron-based NEXAFS analysis and XPS, electrochemistry, and ab initio DFT calculations as well as STEM-EDX cross-sectional analysis. These analyses highlight a number of important structural differences to other recently reported bimetallic OER catalysts in the literature. On the methodological side, we introduce, validate, and utilize a new, nondestructive XRF-based catalyst stability monitoring technique that will benefit future catalyst development. Furthermore, the present study identifies new specific catalysts and experimental strategies for stepwise reducing the Ir demand of PEM water electrolyzers on their long way toward adoption at a larger scale.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000614062400022	33442973

We then correlate electrocatalytic activity with Ni:Fe stoichiometry as a function of surface area, crystallite size, and free volume. In order to ensure in-series comparisons, calcination at 350 degrees C/air was necessary to crystallize the respective NiyFe1_(y)Ox nanoarchitectures, which index to the inverse spinel structure for Fe-rich materials (y <= 0.33), rock salt for the most Ni-rich material (y = 0.9), and biphasic for intermediate stoichiometry (0.5 <= y <= 0.67). In the intermediate Ni:Fe stoichiometric range (0.33 <= y <= 0.67), the OER current density at 390 mV increases monotonically with increasing Ni content and increasing surface area, but with different working curves for ambigels versus aerogels. At a common stoichiometry within this range, ambigels and aerogels yield comparable OER performance, but do so by expressing larger crystallite size (ambigel) versus higher surface area (aerogel). Effective OER activity can be achieved without requiring supercritical-fluid extraction as long as moderately high surface area, porous materials can be prepared. We find improved OER performance (71 decreases from 390 to 373 mV) for Ni(0.67)Fe(0.33)Ox aerogel heat-treated at 300 degrees C/Ar, owing to an increase in crystallite size (2.7 to 4.1 nm). For the ORR, electrocatalytic activity favors Fe-rich NiyFe1_(y)Ox materials; however, as the Nicontent increases beyond y = 0.5, a two-electron reduction pathway is still exhibited, demonstrating that bifunctional OER and ORR activity may be possible by choosing a nickel ferrite nanoarchitecture that provides high OER activity with sufficient ORR activity. Assessing the catalytic activity requires an appreciation of the multivariate interplay among Ni:Fe stoichiometry, surface area, crystallographic phase, and crystallite size.									8	0	0	0	0	0	10			0743-7463			WOS:000411549700016	28627895

It starts with discussing the different synthesis methods and the tactics for modifying the physicochemical characteristics of Mo2C. In addition, the variables that influence the morphology and electrochemical performance of Mo2C have been explored. The synthesis methods are examined based on their tricks, benefits, and drawbacks, including solid-gas, solid-solid, solid-liquid, and some other processes (chemical vapor deposition, Sonochemical, microwave-assisted, plasma, etc.). Methods that are safe, cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and suited for large-scale production of Mo2C are given special consideration. The solid-solid reaction is found to be a facile and cost-effective method to synthesize Mo2C structures having high surface area and small particle size. Also, the various electrochemical applications of Mo2C are reviewed. Mo2C is an extremely active and durable electrocatalyst mainly for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The electrochemical parameters such as activity, stability, etc., are examined and described in detail. The possible ways to improve the electrochemical performance of Mo2C are discussed. Finally, the difficulties in developing Mo2C nanostructures that are suited for energy storage and conversion applications are discussed.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000745543400001

Current methods of oxidation, however, disrupt the graphene lattice and yield pores having diameter > 20 nm for any oxidizing species. In this work, a method for photothermal oxidation of graphene is presented for the first time that suggests absence of pores in the graphene layer during atomic force microscopy. The mechanism of oxidation is studied on CVD (chemical vapor deposition)-grown graphene using in situ Raman spectroscopy. Analysis of the temporal evolution of Raman spectra in different oxidizing environments enabled extraction of the reaction energy of oxidation - providing fundamental insight into the oxidation process. Additionally, atomic force microscopy revealed clear phase contrast between the oxidized and un-oxidized domains which were randomly distributed across the graphene layer. This work will enable engineering of oxygen-related defects in graphene for electronic and sensing applications.									27	0	0	0	2	0	27				2046-2069		WOS:000375445500098

Recent research studies have revealed that polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based materials are emerging as potential electrocatalysts for boosting electrocatalytic energy conversion due to their high electronic conductivity, excellent mechanical and chemical stability. Aiming to gain a better understanding of the advantages and applications of PVA in the field of electrocatalytic energy conversion, this review systematically summarizes the recent progress of PVA-based materials achieved in the field of electrocatalytic energy conversion. We start by discussing the distinct advantages of PVA for electrochemical reactions. Next, the experimental progress on investigating the multifunctionalities of PVA-based materials for energy conversion is illustrated. Finally, the challenging issues that need to be addressed before realizing the commercial applications are also discussed, hoping to offer guidance for the construction of more efficient PVA-based electrode materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000746672500001

The observed dependences of the reaction rates on pH and C(acac) arise from hydrolytic equilibria of [Mn(acac)3]. The reaction is first order in [S2O3(2-)] but consumes no S2O3(2-). Instead, 1 mol of acetylacetone is consumed per mol of Mn(III) reduced. EPR and kinetic data suggest a S2O3(2-)/S2O3- catalytic cyclic which provides a low-energy path for the acac --> Mn(III) electron transfer. Rate constants for reduction of [Mn(acac)3] (k1), [MN(H2O2]+ (k2) and [Mn(acac)2(H2O)(OH)] (k3) follow the sequence k1 < k2 almost-equal-to k3. An inner-sphere mechanism plausible for the k2 and the k3 paths; k1 prpbably an outer-sphere process.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0300-9246			WOS:A1991FG57200006

However, the HOR kinetics in alkaline is two to three orders of magnitude slower than that in acid. More critically, fundamental understanding of the sluggish kinetics derived from the pH effect is still debatable. In this review, the recent development of understanding HOR mechanism and rational design of advanced HOR electrocatalysts are summarized. First, recent advances in the theories focusing on fundamental understandings of HOR under alkaline electrolyte are comprehensively discussed. Then, from the aspect of intermediates binding energy, optimizing hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and increasing hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE), the strategies for designing efficient alkaline HOR catalysts are summarized. At last, perspectives for the future research on alkaline HOR are pointed out.

Herein, isostructural NiCo2O4 and MgCo2O4 hierarchical hollow nanocages (NiCo2O4 HCs and MgCo2O4 HCs) have been ingeniously constructed for diluted CO2 photoreduction. NiCo2O4 HCs exerts an apparent quantum yield of 1.56% with CO selectivity of 89%, exceeding most previous inorganic catalysts in pure CO2. Nevertheless, MgCo2O4 HCs is almost inert, even though it shows higher CO2 uptake ability. DFT calculations results indicate that CO2 molecule adsorbed on Ni sites can be readily reduced to CO, while the CO2 on Mg sites cannot participate in this reaction. Therefore, only adsorbed CO2 which can participate in reduction reactions, named active adsorption, can accelerate the whole reactions. This work unearths atomic-level insights into the relation between CO2 adsorption and reduction, providing fundamental guidance to improve photocatalytic performance.									66	4	0	0	11	0	66			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000496894300064

In this study, a facile operation protocol is presented for constructing an exquisite threedimensional coral reef-like carbon nanotube assembly bridged with N-doped graphene (assigned as 3D CNTAs-NG, which represented carbonization products at 900 degrees C) as highly efficient and durable ORR/ OER electrocatalysts. It does not require the introduction of reductive atmosphere. In this tactic, the dicyanamide ligand on the Co-MOF not only was instrumental in the introduction of nitrogen but also acted as the inducer of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to lock the metallic Co in graphitic carbon layers. Graphene oxide (GO) is chosen as a matrix to pin the CNTs and ensure the uniform distribution of CNTs. The obtained CNTAs-NG structure possesses 3D open porous texture, abundant defects, desired nitrogen bonding type and high specific surface area, providing them with excellent ORR and OER properties. As such, the optimized 3D CNTAs-NG sample shows high onset potential (E-onset = 0.97 V vs. RHE) and half-wave potential (E-1/2 = 0.85 V vs. RHE) for ORR and overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) for OER. Meanwhile, the prepared optimum catalyst exhibited outstanding durability for ORR and OER in alkaline solutions. This work may pave significant concepts for the synthesis of highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts with intriguing architectures and compositions. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, distinctive CuCo2O4/CoOOH supported on 3D porous nickel foam was synthesized suc-cessfully via annealing and green hydrothermal strategies. Importantly, this unique catalyst with the sy-nergistic effect can exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity, which only requires 125 mV (eta 10) for HER and 217 mV (eta 20) for OER. Remarkably, CuCo2O4/CoOOH/NF shows a voltage of 1.583 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2. The excellent performances can be ascribed to the synergistic effect between CuCo2O4/NF and CoOOH/NF. In addition, the high-conductive 3D nickel foam substrate and the reciprocally permeated nanosheet can improve electrical conductivity, accelerate reaction kinetics and provide massive exposed active sites. This study provides a novel insight into the facile preparation of bifunctional electrocatalysts, which boosts the electrocatalytic performance for electrolysis of water.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

It is particularly relevant in fuel cells because it is slow to react and requires high overpotentials. This work aims to study electrodes with deposits of Au on Ti obtained by electrodeposition. The substrates have undergone potentiodynamic growths of oxides before deposition for some electrodes and after deposition for other electrodes under study, at different final potentials. Both procedures resulted in the formation of a composite Au layer on the Ti surface. The electrochemical behavior of these composite layers was examined in a 0.01 M HClO4 solution, both oxygen-free and oxygen-saturated, and compared with the behavior of Ti as a target, using the cyclic voltammetry technique. In the potential region of the oxygen reduction reaction (RRO), the Au layer on the Ti obtained by first performing the Au deposition and then the growth of the anode oxide showed a better response, not only in the onset potential of the RRO, but also in the current densities. In all cases the voltammetry curves of the Au and TiO2 composite layers were similar to those shown by the Au polycrystalline.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0327-358X	1850-1168		WOS:000640648700002

The results show that the slag-line can be effectively protected when the slag-line is connected to the negative electrode, and the graphite as an auxiliary electrode is connected at positive potential. Under the applied negative electric field, a thick protective adhesion layer is formed on the surface of the slag-line due to the electrochemical reactions. Additionally, the slag-line material is further reacted with surface of the formed protective layer and generates another interface reaction layer. Under the effect of double protective layers, the slag-line can be perfectly devoid of corrosion attack under the negative electric field. The performance of the slag-line and the production time of the whole continuous casting can be improved. The external electric field is expected to be a new technical approach to alleviate corrosion of the SEN.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0955-2219	1873-619X		WOS:000726701700005

The structure and properties of the catalysts were characterized by TGA, Raman, FTIR, XRD,TEM, SEM, XPS and H-2-TPR, and their catalytic performance was tested by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) reaction. Characterization and reaction results showed that higher cobalt dispersion was found on the catalyst with higher cobalt loading, and majority of cobalt species in the freeze-dried samples was fcc phase Co degrees. Excessive cross linking originated by high Co2+ concentration during the construction of 3D NGA led to the restraint of mass transfer of reactants to cobalt active sites, and therefore, lower FTS activity was observed on the catalysts with higher cobalt loadings. The fcc phase Co degrees in fresh Co/NGA catalysts was transformed in to hcp phase Co degrees during FTS reaction, and as a result, catalytic activity was increased with increasing time on stream.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000581923700003

Experiments performed on the three complexes immobilized on conductive substrates reveal the catalytic efficiency in the order Co-Ni > Ni > Co based on threshold and overpotentials as well as electro-impedance parameters. Remarkably, the Co-Ni mixed metal cluster shows low onset overpotential of only 270 mV and a small Tafel slop of 53.4 mV/dec. Moreover, the Faradaic efficiency exceeds 90% for the Co-Ni cluster. Their characteristics are major improvements on those reported for transition metal complexes. These complexes could be proposed as promising electrocatalysts for water oxidation reaction.

Here, we report on an artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) based on the beta-barrel protein nitrobindin (NB) equipped with a manganese protoporphyrin IX catalyst (MnPPIX@NB) for the epoxidation of aromatic alkenes. After exchanging the metal cofactor and two rounds of directed evolution, our ArM shows improved activity (>7-fold increase) with an ee of 20%. The evolution campaign also revealed the importance of the proximal ligand for peroxide activation and subsequent oxygen atom transfer. By utilizing cell adhesion-promoting peptides, a facile strategy is presented to immobilize ArMs on the surface of E. coli cells for on-cell catalysis and chemogenetic engineering of ArMs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000653775900001

Although many metal catalysts are active in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), their reactivity and selectivity are nonetheless hindered by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The competition of the HER and CO2RR stems from the energy scaling relationship between their reaction intermediates. Herein, we predict that bimetallic monolayer electrocatalysts (BMEs) - a monolayer of transition metals on top of extended metal substrates - could produce dual-functional active sites that circumvent the scaling relationship between the adsorption energies of HER and CO2RR intermediates. The antibonding interaction between the adsorbed H and the metal substrate is revealed to be responsible for circumventing the scaling relationship. Based on extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identify 11 BMEs which are highly active and selective toward the formation of formic acid with a much suppressed HER. The H-substrate antibonding interaction also leads to superior CO2RR performance on monolayer-coated penta-twinned nanowires.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000768421900001	35432893

Ni/NiO/C exhibits an HOR activity one order of magnitude higher than that of its parent Ni/C counterpart. Moreover, Ni/NiO/C also shows better stability and CO tolerance than commercial Pt/C in alkaline media, which renders it a very promising HOR electrocatalyst for hydrogen fuel cell applications. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also performed to shed light on the enhanced HOR performance of Ni/NiO/C; the DFT results indicate that both hydrogen and hydroxide achieve optimal binding energies at the Ni/NiO interface, resulting from the balanced electronic and oxophilic effects at the Ni/NiO interface.									95	11	0	0	10	0	97			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000476919100040	31155829

Herein, two-dimensional (2D) holey NiFeP nanoarrays are vertically grown on a threedimensional (3D) porous nitrogen-doped carbon sponge (N-CS) to form a hierarchically self-supported electrocatalyst (named NiFeP@N-CS) for efficient water splitting. Benefiting from the bimetal synergy effect and the hierarchical structure, the obtained bifunctional electrocatalyst NiFeP@N-CS exhibits high electrocatalytic performance for HER and OER (186 mV and 216 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) in 1.0 M KOH. As a result, the water electrolyzer assembled by NiFeP@N-CS electrocatalyst as both anode and cathode only requires 1.63 V at the same current density and maintains outstanding durability up to 24 h.

Herein, a hybrid material, CoFe@N-C/MNGF containing an N-doped carbon shell on the surface of CoFe alloy nanoparticles and three-dimensional (3D) mesoporous N-doped graphene foam with exposed active sites as an electron transfer substrate has been successfully synthesized to replace noble-metal catalysts. The electrocatalytic performance of CoFe@N-C/MNGF demonstrates better OER activity in 0.1 M KOH alkaline electrolyte with a remarkably low overpotential of 330 mV and low Tafel plot 130.6 mV.dec(-1) at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2). And CoFe@N-C/MNGF has considerable ORR performance in terms of catalyst activity, electron transfer number and stability, which suggests its usefulness as a suitable replacement for ORR catalysts based on noble-metal used for cathode electrode of alkaline fuel cells. In particular, it showed a potential of 0.87 V in 0.1 M KOH alkaline electrolyte and low Tafel plot 71.7 mV.dec(-1) at 5 mA.cm(-2) and the number of electrons (n) transferred was estimated to be 2.1-3.61 at 0.15 to 0.35 V.

In the present study, quaternary metallic heterogeneous nanocatalysts (NCs) consisting of Pt-cluster decorated CoO2-SnPd2-SnO(2)hierarchical structures (namely CSPP) are proposed with improved heteroatomic interactions for an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium (0.1 M KOH). The CSPP NCs have been synthesized with different Pt contents (1, 2 and 14 wt%) by using a wet chemical reduction method on a carbon nanotube (CNT) support with simultaneous heterogeneous and homogenous nucleation. Of special relevance, the mass activity (MA) of CSPP-1 (similar to 1.0 wt% Pt) and CSPP-2 (similar to 2.0 wt% Pt) NCs is 2146.2 mA mg(-1)and 1555.7 mA mg(-1), which is similar to 32 and similar to 23-fold increased, respectively, as compared to that of the commercial J.M.-Pt/C catalyst (20 wt% Pt) at 0.85 Vvs.RHE. Through intensive analysis of microscopy and spectroscopy results, we demonstrated that such enhanced ORR activities for the ultra-low dosage of Pt are mainly dominated by incorporation of Pt atoms into the defect sites of the Co-Sn-Pd surface. These Pt-atoms lower the adsorption strength for oxygenated speciesviaelectron confinement from adjacent sites, resulting in enhanced splitting and relocation kinetics of subsequent oxygen molecules on the NC surface and thus ORR performance.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000542706600014

Here, to obtain a battery with high voltage and powder density as well as desirable capacity and energy density, a hybrid battery is assembled by integration the merits of Zn-NiCo2S4 and Zn-air batteries in one system at the cell level. In this hybrid battery, the Zn plate acts as an anode, and aqueous alkaline serves as the electrolyte. The cathode is fabricated through self-growth of NiCo2S4 nanotubes on a filter paper derived three-dimensional nitrogen doped carbon carrier, which possesses high specific capacity and excellent four-electron oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction activities. This hybrid battery exhibits two voltage plateaus at 1.75 and 1.08 V, which originates from the Zn-NiCo2S4 and Znair batteries, respectively. The specific capacity of this battery reaches as high as 626 mAh.g(-1) based on the mass of Zn consumed. Its energy density achieves 688 Wh.g(-1), which outperforms both Zn-NiCo2S4 Furthermore, the outstanding stability of this hybrid battery is demonstrated by a 400 cycle charge-discharge experiment continued for 400 h. This work creates a precedent for the development of a hybrid battery. More importantly, it also provides a feasible method for the fabrication of high performance power sources by integrating the merits of two totally different devices together.									32	2	0	0	3	0	33			2168-0485			WOS:000475838100043		
J	Li, Shengjian; Wang, Ruihong; Yang, Xu; Wu, Jun; Meng, Huiyuan; Xu, Hailing; Ren, Zhiyu								Binary Metal Phosphides with MoP and FeP Embedded in P,N-Doped Graphitic Carbon As Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction								ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING				7	13			11872	11884		10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b02473				JUL 1 2019	2019	Binary metal phosphides, a new class of nonprecious catalysts, have drawn tremendous attention in recent years for their synergistic interactions between different components. Herein, a novel in situ phosphorization and simultaneous graphitization strategy is developed to intentionally construct MoP-FeP hybrids with multiple active sites embedded in P,N-doped graphitic carbon (MoP-FeP/GC) as an effective electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). A macroporous amino phosphonic acid chelating resin was employed as phosphorus nitrogen and carbon resources. According to the strong coordination between the central metal and functional groups, H3P(Mo3O10)(4) and FeCl3 were successively introduced into the backbone of the resin to form a resin-P(Mo3O10)(4)(3-)-Fe3(+) precursor. After one-step pyrolysis, the highly dispersed MoP and FeP particles were achieved in situ. Simultaneously, the resin carbon was converted into graphitic carbon coupled with P,N codoping. As expected, the MoP-FeP/GC catalyst displays superior ORR activity to individual MoP and FeP, indicating a strong synergistic effect. The onset potential and half wave potential for MoP-FeP/GC are 0.91 and 0.75 V, respectively, which achieve the comparable level to those of state-of-the-art 20% Pt/C catalyst in alkaline electrolyte. This approach is simple and scalable, which opens an avenue for the rational design of binary metal phosphides as the nonprecious metal catalysts for ORR.									23	2	0	0	3	0	25			2168-0485			WOS:000474474800090

Shafizadeh, A.G.W. Bradbury, J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 23 (1979) 1431-1442] that the thermal decomposition of cellulose over the wide range of mass loss is essentially the same in both air and nitrogen. At the beginning of the decomposition oxygen interacts only with surface cellulose, resulting in only congruent to 3% of mass loss. The two-phase model of cellulose is proposed to explain all observable phenomena related to both the pyrolysis (inert atmosphere) and the oxidative decomposition (air or oxygen). According to the model, the decomposition occurs through a migration of chain ends from the phase of polymer cellulose into the phase of products (char, gases and high-boiling tar). The interface between two phases is the region of location of chain ends; therefore unzipping of cellulose is preferable in comparison to the random scission of macromolecules. That is why the yield of levoglucosan can reach 60%. It evolves as a result of the unzipping by the transglycosylation with activation energy of about 200 kJ/mol. Oxygen interacts with products of the decomposition but does not penetrate into the matrix of polymer cellulose. The oxidation is the fast reaction subsequent to the depolymerization; therefore, the main step of the degradation is independent of the oxidative reactions. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a super-low ruthenium (Ru) (0.6 wt%) doped bimetallic phosphide derived from 2D MIL-53(NiFe) MOF nanosheets (i.e., Ru-NiFeP/NF) on nickel foam was developed via a continuous two-step hydrothermal followed by phosphorization process. The as-obtained Ru-doped NiFeP/NF with optimized electronic structure and enhanced electric conductivity delivers admirable performance for HER in a wide pH range, which requires overpotentials of 29, 105, and 56 mV to reach current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) in acid, neutral, and alkaline media, respectively. For the OER, only requires an overpotential of 179 mV to achieve 10 mA.cm(-2) in alkaline media. In a two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer, the as-prepared Ru-NiFeP/NF electrodes only need 1.47 V to yield 10 mA.cm(-2), which is superior to the integrated RuO2 and Pt/C couple electrode (1.5 V). This work highlights the rational design of MOF-derivates and electronic structure engineering strategy by heteroatom doping, which can be extended to design and prepare other high-performance MOF-based electrocatalysts.									46	6	0	0	0	0	48			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000580627000103

For oxo-bridged [Fe, Fe] species, the Fe-Fe and Fe-O distances in Configurations a, b, c, d, e(1) and f were more consistent with experimental (ca. 2.53 or 3.06 angstrom) than in the cluster models designed by Yakovlev et at. with two framework Al atoms nearby. For oxo-bridged [Fe,M] species, the geometric parameters of Configurations g, i and j agreed well with experimental. Configuration i was found to be of higher stability by 64.2 kJ mol(-1) compared to its isomer Configuration k(1). +II and +III constituted the dominant valence states for Fe in Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite, and the state of mixed +II and +III valences did exist in ZSM-5 zeolite as in Configuration b(1), b(2) or c. Fe of +I state was absolutely non-existent in ZSM-5 zeolite even if predefined so. The calculated reaction heats of "alpha-oxygen" formation clearly showed that the oxidation processes were always facilitated by N2O than O-2. The reaction heats of ZSM-5 zeolites exchanged with mono-Fe and binuclear Fe species (n -> o, a(1,2) -> b(1,2) and e(1) -> f) were -114.9, -65.3, -67.4 and -48.8 kJ mol(-1), respectively, in excellent agreement with the results obtained by Ryder, Yakovlev et al. Moreover, "alpha-oxygen" generation was favored by introduction of extra-framework Al (i -> j: -73.9 kJ mol(-1)) compared to the binuclear Fe species. All factors considered, the best candidates for "alpha-oxygen" generation were Configuration al, 2 for oxo-bridged [Fe,Fe] species and Configuration i for oxo-bridged [Fe,Al] species, respectively.

Herein, through density functional theory (DFT) calculation, we found that 5d transition metals such as iridium (Ir) with unique electronic properties can effectively modulate 3d transition-metal oxyhydroxides, thus producing versatile electronic structures to facilitate the OER activity. We therefore synthesized NiFe(3d)Ir(5d) oxyhydroxides and explored their electronic structures via in situ and ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and valence band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VB-XPS). The DFT, XAS, VB-XPS and electrochemical studies demonstrated that Ir served as a modulator in the 3d metal oxyhydroxide framework, and created a local environment favoring 3d-5d orbital interaction, and the repelled Ni 3d orbitals facilitated the overall OER process. The Ir-doped catalyst on a glassy carbon electrode delivers 133 mV lower overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline electrolyte, a 53-fold improved turnover frequency (TOF) over that of pristine NiFe oxyhyroxides, with negligible activity decay after 500 hours of operation.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000474712700006

The sluggish anodic O-2 evolution reaction (OER) always results in low overall energy conversion efficiency and the product of OER, O-2, is not of significant value. In addition, the potential formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may lead to degradation of cell membranes and thus premature device failure. Herein we report a general concept of integrating oxidative biomass upgrading reactions with decoupled H-2 generation from water splitting. Five representative biomass substrates, ethanol, benzyl alcohol, furfural, furfuryl alcohol, and S-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), were selected for oxidative upgrading catalyzed by a hierarchically porous Ni3S2/Ni foam bifunctional electrocatalyst (Ni3S2/NF). All the five organics can be oxidized to value-added liquid products at much lower overpotentials than that of OER. In particular, the electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF to the value-added 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) was further studied in detail. Benefiting from the more favorable thermodynamics of HMF oxidation than that of OER, the cell voltage for integrated H-2 production and HMF oxidation was significantly reduced by-100 mV relative to pure water splitting to achieve 100 mA cm(-2), while the oxidation product (FDCA) at the anode was much more valuable than O-2. When utilized as electrocatalysts for both cathode and anode, Ni3S2/NF demonstrated outstanding durability and nearly unity Faradaic efficiencies for both H-2 and FDCA production. Overall, such an integration of oxidative biomass valorization and HER via earth-abundant electrocatalysts not only avoids the generation of explosive H-2/O-2 mixture and ROS, but also yields products of high value at both electrodes with lower voltage input, maximizing the energy conversion efficiency.									413	22	0	0	27	0	418			0002-7863			WOS:000385992100033	27652996

The enzyme is also capable of functioning as a peroxygenase in the same reaction, by utilizing hydrogen peroxide in place of the reductase domain, cofactor and oxygen. As a starting point for developing a practically useful hydroxylation biocatalyst, we compare the activity and regioselectivity of wild-type P450 BM-3 and its F87A mutant on various fatty acids. Neither enzyme catalyzes terminal hydroxylation under any of the conditions studied. While significantly enhancing peroxygenase activity, the F87A mutation also shifts hydroxylation further away from the terminal position. The H2O2-driven reactions with either the full-length BM-3 enzyme or the heme domain are slow, but yield product distributions very similar to those generated when using NADPH and O-2.									75	0	0	0	51	0	85			1615-4150	1615-4169		WOS:000179051900003

The reactive Euler equations and related Rankine-Hugoniot conditions are deduced from the mesoscopic description of the process. The steady propagation problem is solved for a Zeldovich, von Neuman and Doering (ZND) wave, providing the detonation profiles and the wave thickness for different overdrive degrees. The one-dimensional stability of such detonation wave is then studied in terms of an initial value problem coupled with an acoustic radiation condition at the equilibrium final state. The stability equations and their initial data are deduced from the linearized reactive Euler equations and related Rankine-Hugoniot conditions through a normal mode analysis referred to the complex disturbances of the steady state variables. Some numerical simulations for an elementary reaction of the hydrogen-oxygen chain are proposed in order to describe the time and space evolution of the instabilities induced by the shock front perturbation.					26th International Symposium on Rarefied Gas Dynamics (RGD26)26th International Symposium on Rarefied Gas Dynamics (RGD26)	JUN 20-JUL 25, 2008JUN 20-JUL 25, 2008	Japan Soc Promot Sci; Japan Aerosp Explorat Agcy; Soc Promot Space Sci; Iwantani Naoji Fdn; Inoue Fdn Sci; Casio Sci Promot Fdn; Kaijma Fdn; IHI Corp; IHI Aerosp Engn Co Ltd; Osaka Vaccuun Ltd; Nissin IncJapan Soc Promot Sci; Japan Aerosp Explorat Agcy; Soc Promot Space Sci; Iwantani Naoji Fdn; Inoue Fdn Sci; Casio Sci Promot Fdn; Kaijma Fdn; IHI Corp; IHI Aerosp Engn Co Ltd; Osaka Vaccuun Ltd; Nissin Inc	Kyoto, JAPANKyoto, JAPAN	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0094-243X		978-0-7354-0615-5	WOS:000265564800006

In addition, the degradation reaction is shown to be dependent on oxygen, Mn(II), and dithiothreitol in vitro. Despite its low sequence identity with proteins of known structure, TflA is structurally homologous to proteins of the vicinal oxygen chelate superfamily. Like other metalloenzymes in this superfamily, the TflA fold contains four modules that associate to form a metal binding site; however, the fold displays a rare rearrangement of the structural modules indicative of domain permutation. Moreover, unlike the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad commonly utilized by vicinal oxygen chelate dioxygenases and other dioxygen-activating non-heme Fe(II) enzymes, the metal center in TflA consists of a 1-His-2-carboxylate facial triad. The substrate-bound complex shows square-pyramidal geometry in which one position is occupied by O5 of toxoflavin. The open coordination site is predicted to be the dioxygen binding site. TflA appears to stabilize the reduced form of toxoflavin through second-sphere interactions. This anionic species is predicted to be the electron source responsible for reductive activation of oxygen to produce a peroxytoxoflavin intermediate.									11	1	0	0	9	0	12			0006-2960			WOS:000287049500018	21166463

Herein, a hierarchical nanocluster hybrids of trimetallic (Fe-Ni)Co-x - OH nanofilms decorated amorphous Ni3S2 with S-vacancy supported on nickel foam (NF) was proposed via rapid two-step electrodeposited pathway. By effectively breaking long-range-order of Ni3S2 to form S-vacant amorphous phase, combining with the strong electronic interactions between the (FeNi)Co-x - OH and Ni3S2, it resulted in favorable water adsorption ability, free-energy of H* adsorption (Delta G(H*)) and fast mass/charge transfer for hydrogen evolution process. The (Fe-Ni)Co-x - OH/Ni3S2 nanohybrids displayed ultralow overpotential of 91 and 145 mV at 100 and 1400 mA.cm(-2) respectively with admirable durability for 100 h at 200 mA.cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, even exceeding Pt plate. The amorphous S-vacant Ni3S2 plays a crucial role for hydrogen evolution: compared with both original and defective Ni3S2, the free energy of disordering Ni3S2 for *H - OH and H* intermediates more tend to thermodynamical neutrality according to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. For water-to-oxygen evolution (eta(100) = 280 mV), in situ newly formed ultrathin NiOOH nanosheets on near-surface Ni3S2 layer coupling with (Fe-Ni)Co-x - OH nanofilms can be identified as intrinsic OER active species; and the host metallic Ni3S2 phase provides wonderful conductivity. Impressively, the bifunctional (Fe-Ni)Co-x - OH/Ni3S2 nanohybrid represents the best electrocatalyst so far, achieving cell-voltage of 1.45 and 1.61 V at 10 and 200 mA.cm(-2) respectively with super stability for 100 h.									45	3	0	0	1	0	45			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000510526000026

EDS was utilized to measure the elemental composition. XRD and Rietveld refinement were employed for the phase and crystal structure analysis. It was observed that the crystal structure of LaNiO3 was distorted after Sr2+-substitution and formed tetragonal lanthanum-strontium nickelates (LSN) for x <= 0.8, and rhombohedral strontium nickelate for x = 1.0. For all the samples, secondary phases (NiO for 0.2 <= x <= 1.0 andSrCO3 for 0.8 <= x <= 1.0) were also observed. Rietveld analysis suggests that Sr2+-substitution caused the cell volume to contract. The oxidation state of Ni in the samples were investigated by XPS for the elusive Ni4+. An increase in the mass specific activity for OER was observed as the degree of Sr2+-substitution increase until x = 0.6, however, the activity decreased for higher values of x.

The emphasis of the study was to follow the evolution of the PSDF from the onset of particle inception to particle mass growth. At the onset of soot inception, the PSDF was found to follow a power-law dependence on particle diameter. The PSDF becomes bimodal at larger height above the burner surface, and remains bimodal throughout the flame. Numerical simulation using a kinetic model proposed previously and a stochastic approach to solve aerosol dynamics equations again showed a bimodal PSDF. Further analysis revealed that bimodality is intrinsic to an aerosol process involving particle-particle coagulation and particle nucleation dominated by monomer dimerization.

Typically, these oxygenation reactions proceed with high selectivity and reactivity, which is seldom found in its "biomimetic" chemocatalytic counterparts. Furthermore, enzymatic oxygenation can avoid undesired overoxidation, which is frequently observed in (industrial) chemical transformation. Therefore, it is not surprising that tremendous attention has been paid to enzymatic oxygenation. Their application in organic synthesis has been steadily growing over the years. The goal of the present Review is to provide a handy reference for chemists interested in using homogeneous oxygenase catalysis and those interested in discovering new types of biomimetic oxidations and oxygenations with dioxygen. In this Review, we will review the recent advances in in homogeneous oxygenase catalysis to reveal the great achievements and potentials in this field.									84	5	0	0	20	0	85			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000433404300002	29630343

In the present work, the empirical values of these branching ratios have been deduced using a numerical optimization approach. They were obtained using the optimization scheme known as the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) with our MACD-00 model and simultaneous volume emission rate (VER) measurements of the O(S-1) greenline and O-2(0,0) atmospheric band emissions. The CMA-ES was employed as the optimization algorithm that would match the 0(1S) and O-2(0,0) VER profiles simulated by the MACD-00 model to observations made by OXYGEN/S35, S310.10, NASA Flight 4.339, ETON flights P229H and P230H, OASIS, SOAP/WINE, MULTI-FOT, and WINDII. We found that most of the values deduced fors were in the [0.1, 0.3] range, while most of the values of alpha were in the [0.01, 0.03] range. Excluding the outliers, the average branching ratio values involving the production of O-2 (b(1)Sigma(+)(g)) and O-2 (c(1)Sigma(-)(u)) were determined to be epsilon = 0.15 +/- 0.02 and alpha = 0.018 +/- 0.004, respectively. Overall, the simulations showed good agreement with the observations albeit with some discrepancies in the peak altitudes and shape of the profiles, possibly due to small perturbations in the observed VER profiles that are not considered in our simulations.

J	Li, Fen; Li, Jinxia; Zhou, Lihui; Dai, Sheng					Dai, Sheng/0000-0001-5787-0179			Enhanced OER performance of composite Co-Fe-based MOF catalysts via a one-pot ultrasonic-assisted synthetic approach								SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS				5	4			1095	1102		10.1039/d0se01750g				FEB 21 2021	2021	Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as one of the most promising electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their abundant metal sites and porous structures. However, the limited modulation of the single-metal sites of MOF-based catalysts restricts further promotion of their catalytic performance. In this work, we have developed a composite Co-Fe-based MOF catalyst based on Co-BDC (1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) and Fe-BDC, which modulated the electronic structure via the construction of the heterogeneous interfaces of Co-BDC and Fe-BDC. Enhanced OER performance was achieved in the composite Co-Fe-BDC catalyst, far more exceeding that of the counterpart Co-BDC or Fe-BDC. In addition, it was found that additional ultrasonic treatment effectively facilitated the dispersion of Fe-BDC on Co-BDC, as compared to the composited MOF obtained via physical mixture or magnetic stirring. The composite Co-Fe-BDC catalyst prepared via the ultrasonic-assisted one-pot synthesis exhibited an overpotential of 295 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which was even superior to that of the commercial RuO2 catalyst, while holding a lower cost and excellent stability. Insights gained in this study may shed new lights on heterogeneous interfaces and composition strategy of MOF-based electrochemical catalysts.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2398-4902			WOS:000620730300018

The focus is on the overpotential determining anodic PTE for the oxygen evolution reaction. The influences of catalyst loading, ionomer content and porous titanium substrate on the polarization behavior are analyzed. The comparison of a porous fiber-sintered substrate with a powder-sintered substrate shows no significant differences in the kinetic and mass transport regions. Ohmic losses, however, are lower for fiber PTEs above a catalyst loading of 1.0 mg<INF>IrO<INF>2</INF></INF> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. Variations of the Nafion content in the catalyst layer reveal changes of mass transport and ohmic losses and have an influence on the reproducibility. Varying the noble metal loading and therefore the thickness of the applied catalyst layer influences the kinetic region and ohmic resistance of the MEAs. The best compromise between reproducibility and performance is found for a loading of 1.4 mg<INF>IrO<INF>2</INF></INF> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> and 9 wt% Nafion. The stable operation of the aforementioned PTE is shown in a 200 h durability test at 2 A cm<SUP>-2</SUP>.									28	0	0	0	1	0	27			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000501811800025

The chemical networks which researchers focus upon have become increasingly complex, and this has motivated the development of automated methods for exploring chemical reactivity or conformational change in a "black-box" manner, harnessing modern computing resources to automate mechanism discovery. In this work, we present a new approach to automated mechanism generation which couples molecular dynamics and statistical rate theory to automatically find kinetically important reactions and then solve the time evolution of the species in the evolving network. The key to this chemical network mapping through combined dynamics and ME simulation approach is the concept of "kinetic convergence", whereby the search for new reactions is constrained to those species which are kinetically favorable at the conditions of interest. We demonstrate the capability of the new approach for two systems, a well-studied combustion system and a multiple oxygen addition system relevant to atmospheric aerosol formation.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1549-9618	1549-9626		WOS:000685205900021	34283599

All catalysts in the presence of halides exhibited high electrocatalytic performances of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and efficient suppression of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of up to 97%. The increasing adsorption strength from F- to I- is proposed to form more porous structures and higher oxidized Zn species, thus facilitating the protonation of CO2 and stabilizing the adsorbed intermediates induced by charge donation from the adsorbed halides on Zn surface to CO2, enhance CO2RR and simultaneously suppress HER.									34	3	0	0	3	0	35			1566-7367	1873-3905		WOS:000440771300024

The hot carriers and near-field enhancement induced by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excitation are the key parameters that are responsible for the enhanced performance. Thus, the logical combination of the plasmonic nanostructures and electrocatalytic materials can be an effective strategy for further widening application of the plasmonic effect. This short Review provides a concise overview of the fundamental principles of LSPR; the mechanism of plasmon-enhanced electrocatalysis; alternative design methods of plasmonic nanomaterials for various catalytic systems; and recent progress in plasmon-mediated electrocatalysis for the production of energy, including electrochemical conversion of different feedstocks into fuels along with fuel cell catalysis. This Review also sheds light on where major advancements are required to further improve the field of plasmon-mediated electrocatalysis to major paradigm shift toward a sustainable future. the areas achieve a major paradigm shift toward a sustainable future.									49	1	0	0	3	0	49			2380-8195			WOS:000435159000029

After partial desorption, uniformly distributed voids are formed in the oxide layer. Analysis of the evolution in the void area distribution with extent of desorption suggests that the rate determining step in void growth is the creation of a diffusing Si monomer within the void. This explains the unexpected substantial rearrangement of the Si substrate upon desorption of a single monolayer of oxygen.									105	1	0	0	1	0	106			0031-9007			WOS:A1992JD32100032	10046648

The amount of oxidizing agents was varied to obtain a different amount of oxygen functionality on the GO surface. The difference in the amount of oxidizing agents during preparation produced GO samples with the interlayer distance 8.7 angstrom and 11.7 angstrom. The interlayer distance increased due to the heavily functionalized GO surface. The products were analyzed using X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, Raman, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), selected area electron diffraction, and zeta potential measurements. We determined that increasing the oxidizing agents could have a profound effect in rapidly driving the reaction to completion by increasing the rate of reaction. The prepared GO samples exhibited differing degrees of thermal decomposition behavior. Since the number of oxygen functional groups on the GO surface is directly linked to the hydrophilic properties of the GO, it could be successfully tuned by introducing changes in the amount of reactants. This technique directly influenced the GO's aqueous dispersion behavior. This work explores the ways to have better control over the extent of oxygen functionalization in the GO surface. GO with a greater amount of oxygen functionality can be useful in the synthesis of composite materials, and it can also potentially enhance the electronic storage capabilities in capacitors for energy storage, as well as other applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0098-6445	1563-5201		WOS:000393681300011

That is, increasing with altitude, the O-17/O-16 ratio shows an additional enhancement over what is expected on the basis of the O-18/O-16 increase. As tropospheric CO2 has a mass-dependent isotopic composition that varies by less than 3 parts per thousand in delta(18)O, isotopic measurements of middle atmospheric CO2, combined with a quantitative understanding of the enrichment mechanism, could provide valuable information regarding processes such as stratosphere-troposphere exchange and the mean age of an air mass. It is known that the mass-independent enrichment in stratospheric CO2 occurs when CO2 quenches an O(D-1) atom formed by the photolysis of O-3, but the details of this process remain uncertain. Here a series of laboratory and numerical experiments are presented which have been performed to study the time evolution and final equilibrium values of the CO2 + O(D-1) reaction in an effort to reach a better understanding of the CO2 enrichment mechanism. Results show that while the isotopic composition of the CO2 reservoir is qualitatively controlled by the isotopic composition of the O(D-1) reservoir, there are a number of complicating factors. The simple mixing model discussed here consistently overpredicts the measured isotopic enrichment, thus indicating the CO2 + O(D-1) isotopic exchange is more complicated than has generally been recognized.									23	0	0	0	5	0	23			2169-897X	2169-8996		WOS:000087844900008

Temperature-programmed hydrogen reduction (H-2-TPR) was applied to evaluate the reduction properties of the as-prepared materials. The oxygen storage capacities (OSC) of CexZr1-xO2 nanocrystals with various amounts of ceria were evaluated by measuring mass changes of samples before and after a severe hydrogen-reduction process. The oxygen exchange property of the as-prepared samples was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (DSC/TG) detection in a programmed atmosphere and temperature protocol. Surface status evolution of the samples before and after reduction was traced by in situ Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (in situ FTIR). Phase evolution was followed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in combination with Rietveld refinement. The results indicated that nanoscale phase segregation emerged when zirconia became dominant in chemical content, and the solubility limit was revealed to be 33.1% of ZrO2 in CeO2 lattice. Zirconium ions in CZ can be reduced into trivalence or lower ones, which was rarely reported before. Among the series of samples containing different ceria contents, Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 has the superiority of a lower beginning reduction temperature and has an appreciable OSC of 0.44 mol of O-2/mol of Ce. Repeatable oxygen release and adsorption were highlighted based on the DSC/TG measurement. Oxygen was released from the lattice of the samples during the reduction, leading to a crystal phase change of about 54% in volume fraction from simple fluorite into pyrochlore-II type. In addition, adsorption of hydroxyls was found to accompany the reduction process, both Zr and Ce can be coordinated in situ in the process, and fresh surface favored the adsorption. Cerium ions can be reduced at lower temperature than Zr ions, according to TPR and IR results.									41	8	0	0	0	0	46			1932-7447			WOS:000265529700010

However, it suffers from slow kinetics due to the difficulty of N?N bond activation and the side hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, on the basis of the concept of Lewis acid pair, we propose a metal-free electrocatalyst based on boron-decorated black phosphorus by using extensive first-principles calculations. In the integrated structure of the catalyst, the doped B atoms serve as Lewis acid pairs and catalytic centers, while the channels of BP provide structural advantages for hosting the pair and activating the N?N bond. A new strategy of nitrogen activation based on the pull-pull effect is thus developed. Performance evaluations show that this metal-free catalyst is highly efficient for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction with an ultra-low onset-potential of 0.19 V. This work opens a new possible avenue for nitrogen activation and can be generally applied to other two-dimensional or bulk materials.									83	9	0	0	2	0	84			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000460687400059

A 3-D structure of graphene oxide (GO) conformally coated with 2,2'-biquinoline-4,4'-dicarboxylate (BQ)-Co2+ complexes is synthesized via polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-mediated in situ self-assembly, in which PVP promotes attachment of BQ and Co2+ and prevents the restacking of nanosheets, while formation of amorphous BQ-Co2+ complexes allows their uniform growth. This structure is subsequently converted to 3-D graphene supported CoP NP-embedded N-doped carbon via calcination and low-temperature phosphidation and applied as a catalyst toward the HER. The onset overpotential, overpotenitial at 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope, and exchange current density of this catalyst are 6.3 mV, 78.0 mV, 45.7 mV dec(-1), and 0.3126 mA cm(-2) (0.5 M H2SO4), respectively, all of which compare favorably to those of most reported non-noble-metal-based catalysts, and the catalyst displays superior durability with a slight current increase after 23 h of chronoamperometric measurement or little current loss after 2000 CV cycles. This work develops a strategy to fabricate high-performance and low-cost HER catalysts and deepens the understanding of the mechanism of the polymer-mediated in situ self-assembly of amorphous metal-organic complexes.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2574-0962			WOS:000504953500057

Herein, self-supported P-doped nickel superstructure films (NiPx) developed on Cu foil were prepared via a facile one-step electrodeposition route from the choline chloride-ethylene glycol (Ethaline)-based deep eutectic solvent (DES). Two depositional patterns including potentiostatic deposition and a consecutive potential cycling approach were compared, and the latter model with a potentiodynamic control was found to be a valid electrochemical protocol to create crack-free NiPx films which were highly active for catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under an alkaline condition. The optimal deposited sample with a Ni/P ratio of 1:0.056 achieved a low overpotential of 105 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 44.7 mV dec(-1) and excellent catalytic stability for at least 60 h. Detailed experimental investigations coupled with theoretical analyses revealed that the high-performance catalytic activity of the NiPx films originated from the enriched active sites and enhanced electronic conductivity induced by P-doping, which also altered the surface electronic structure of the material and resulted in a lower energy barrier for water dissociation and favorable H adsorption free energy. This study provides a new electrochemical potentiodynamic strategy performed in DES for the fabrication of transition-metal-phosphide based catalysts for enhancing HER catalysis.									25	1	0	0	2	0	26			2168-0485			WOS:000455288800160

This review article provides an overview of the fundamentals and recent advances in the field of metal-free carbon catalysts, including graphenes, carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbons, graphitic carbon nitrides, and related composites. Special focus is placed on their controllable preparation and applications in gas phase, liquid phase, electrochemical, and photocatalytic reactions, as well as defect and surface chemistry related catalytic activities of carbon materials. Some perspectives are highlighted on the development of more efficient metal-free carbonaceous catalysts featuring high stability, low cost, optimized structures, and enhanced performance, which are the key factors to accelerate the designed preparation and commercialization of carbocatalysts.									101	12	0	0	12	0	105			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000361189400003

The polarization curves of the porous electrodes were obtained by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in a 1 M KOH solution. The results show that, in the lower current density zone, the overpotential decreases with the increasing thickness of the aligned porous electrode. At higher current density, the overpotential presents a relative complex variation with the electrode thickness. For a thicker porous electrode, its electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) undoubtedly increases. Nevertheless, its bubble removal ability decreases due to deeper porous channels, which adversely affects the HER performance. It is also found that while the aligned pore orientation of the electrode is parallel to gravity direction, the electrode with a thickness of 400 mm has a trade-off between the ECSA and bubble removal ability and shows optimal performance.

In this paper we present a generic framework for describing the two-dimensional spatiotemporal evolution of gaseous, liquid and solid phases, as well as their interdependence with interfacial (electro-)chemistry and microstructure in a continuum description. The modeling domain consists of up to seven layers (current collectors, channels, electrodes, separator/membrane), each of which can consist of an arbitrary number of bulk phases (gas, liquid, solid) and connecting interfaces (two-phase or multi-phase boundaries). Bulk and interfacial chemistry is described using global or elementary kinetic reactions. Multi-phase management is coupled to chemistry and to mass and charge transport within bulk phases. The functionality and flexibility of this framework is demonstrated using four application areas in the context of post-lithium-ion batteries and fuel cells, that is, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) cells, lithium-oxygen (Li-O) cells, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEFC). The results are compared to models available in literature and properties of the generic framework are discussed. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society.

Recent developments in literature have suggested that the ratio of iron and nickel in Fe-Ni thin films plays an essential role in the performance and stability of the catalysts. In this work, the metallic ratio of iron to nickel was tested in alloy bimetallic nanoparticles. Similar to thin films, nanoparticles with iron-nickel atomic compositions where the atomic iron percentage is <= 50% outperformed nanoparticles with iron-nickel ratios of >50%. Nanoparticles of Fe20Ni80, Fe50Ni50, and Fe80Ni20 compositions were evaluated and demonstrated to have overpotentials of 313, 327,, and 364 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). While the Fe20Ni80 composition might be considered to have the best OER performance at low current densities, Fe50Ni50 was found to have the best current density performance at higher current densities, making this composition particularly relevant for electrolysis conditions. However, when stability was evaluated through chronoamperometry and chronopotentiometry, the Fe80Ni20 composition resulted in the lowest degradation rates of 2.9 mu A/h and 17.2 mu V/h, respectively. These results suggest that nanoparticles with higher iron and lower nickel content, such as the Fe80Ni20 composition, should be still taken into consideration while optimizing these bimetallic OER catalysts for overall electrocatalytic performance. Characterization by electron microscopy, diffraction, and X-ray spectroscopy provides detailed chemical and structural information on as-synthesized nanoparticle materials.									19	1	0	0	2	0	19			2470-1343			WOS:000492429100015	31656894

Unfortunately, benchmarking iridium oxide OER catalysts has proven difficult since IrO2 cannot undergo proton underpotential deposition like platinum and other transition metal eletrocatalysts, making it difficult to estimate the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), as well as OER specific and mass activity. In this work, we propose a method to calculate the ECSA of iridium oxide in an operating PEM electrolyzer. A universal constant, 596 (+/- 21) mu C/cm(2), was obtained from the correlation of pseudocapacitive charge and ECSA of iridium oxide. In the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), the calculated ECSA (1.81 (+/- 0.065) m(2) over a 25-cm(2) geometric area) showed an iridium oxide catalyst utilization of similar to 93%. Additionally, the IrO2 OER specific and mass activities at 80 degrees C, 1.6 V in an operating PEM electrolyzer were 0.401 (+/- 0.014) mA/cm(2) and 132 mA/mg, respectively.

Water-splitting is a constructive technology for unpolluted and high-purity H-2 production, and a series of non-precious electrocatalysts have been developed over the past decade. To further improve the catalytic activities, metal doping is always adopted to modulate the 3d-electronic configuration and electron-donating/accepting (e-DA) properties, while for anion doping, the electronegativity variations among different non-metal elements would also bring some potential in the modulations of e-DA and metal valence for tuning the performances. In this review, we summarize the recent developments of the many different anion-mixed transition metal compounds (e.g., nitrides, halides, phosphides, chalcogenides, oxyhydroxides, and borides/borates) for efficient water electrolysis applications. First, we have introduced the general information of water-splitting and the description of anion-mixed electrocatalysts and highlighted their complementary functions of mixed anions. Furthermore, some latest advances of anion-mixed compounds are also categorized for hydrogen and oxygen evolution electrocatalysis. The rationales behind their enhanced electrochemical performances are discussed. Last but not least, the challenges and future perspectives are briefly proposed for the anion-mixed water dissociation catalysts.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000737989400003	34981288

The nitrogen species were found to undergo the N-center dot to N- transformation during sample storage under different conditions, with an activation energy of about 0.45 eV. Three main possible evolution pathways for the dopant state were identified and discussed. It was established that the most probable transformation consists of migration of an oxygen vacancy site to an interstitial nitrogen atom followed by the formation of a nonparamagnetic substitution nitrogen center. Possible diffusion routes of oxygen vacancy and corresponding energy barriers were estimated and found to be in agreement with experimental observations.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1932-7447			WOS:000359683800072

However, large-scale AP implementation remains impeded by a dearth of cheap, efficient catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Cobalt oxide materials can catalyze the OER and are potentially scalable due to the abundance of cobalt in the Earth's crust; unfortunately, the activity of these materials is insufficient for practical AP implementation. Attempts to improve cobalt oxide's activity have been stymied by limited mechanistic understanding that stems from the inherent difficulty of characterizing structure and reactivity at surfaces of heterogeneous materials. While previous studies on cobalt oxide revealed the intermediacy of the unusual Co(IV) oxidation state, much remains unknown, including whether bridging or terminal oxo ligands form O-2 and what the relevant oxidation states are. We have addressed these issues by employing a homogeneous model for cobalt oxide, the [Co(III)(4)] cubane (Co4O4(OAc)(4)py(4), py = pyridine, OAc = acetate), that can be oxidized to the [Co(IV)Co(III)(3)] state. Upon addition of 1 equiv of sodium hydroxide, the [Co (HI)(4)] cubane is regenerated with stoichiometric formation of O-2 Oxygen isotopic labeling experiments demonstrate that the cubane core remains intact during this stoichiometric OER, implying that terminal oxo ligands are responsible for forming O-2. The OER is also examined with stopped-flow UV visible spectroscopy, and its kinetic behavior is modeled, to surprisingly reveal that 02 formation requires disproportionation of the [Co(IV)Co(III)(3)] state to generate an even higher oxidation state, formally [Co(V)Co(III)3] or [Co(IV)(2)Co(III)(2)]. The mechanistic understanding provided by these results should accelerate the development of OER catalysts leading to increasingly efficient AP systems.									101	2	0	0	26	0	101			0002-7863			WOS:000363002900025	26390993

TiO2 is 5 to 10 times more photoactive than WO3 with reference to oxygen evolution. Ag ions are the best of the SEAs, for all the semiconductors tested in the photo-redox process. No oxygen evolution is observed when Hg2+ or Cu2+ ions are used as SEAs. The effect of high (10(-2) Mol dm(-3)) and low (10(-3) mol dm(-3)) SEA concentrations is also studied but no common trend is observed. Instead, each system (i.e., SEA+H2O+Semiconductor) exhibits a different behaviour and the results are rationalised in terms of the spectral and redox potential features of the system.									15	0	0	0	5	1	15			0035-001X			WOS:000222244400012

Here, a unique and facile method is reported for the synthesis of NiFe alloy derived from templated Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) on carbon cloth, exhibiting excellent water oxidation activity and stability in alkaline solution. The best water oxidation activity is obtained with O-NiFe@C-600, in which overpotential of 250 mV is required for generating water oxidation current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and overpotential of 300 mV was needed for affording 100 mA cm(-2). In addition, outstanding long-term stability over 25 h in chronoamperometric measurements was achieved for O-NiFe@C-600. The catalysts considerably outperform the activity and stability of the other PBA derived catalysts and even the noble metal catalysts RuO2. The excellent performance is attributable to unique self-supported structures of the PBA-derived NiFe catalysts on carbon cloth as well as the incorporation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by in-situ O-2 plasma activation which further increases the number of active sites for water oxidation. Additionally, well-defined graphitized cells largely enhances stability of the catalyst by acting as chemical protective layers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The reaction variants studied included type of oxidant, dopamine (DA) concentration, pH, adhesion time prior to spin, substrate chemistry, and notably, DA solution aging time. A strong oxidant, sodium periodate (SP), and a weak oxidant, atmospheric oxygen were chosen. It was found that reactions in solution were much faster and produced much thicker PDA films with SP than with oxygen. PDA thickness correlated positively with DA concentration, SP solution pH, and adhesion time. DA oxidation and aggregation is a dynamic process, which is reflected in the DA aging-time parameter. PDA film thickness reached a maximum value as DA solution aged. Color photography, UV vis spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering indicated that the optimal DA aging time for PDA adhesion is the result of the evolution of PDA particle size and chemistry over time. The capture of the optimal aging-time window was identified as the critical parameter for preparing PDA films with continuity and appreciable thickness. When these conditions were applied in a modified dip-coating method, comparable PDA films were fabricated as those obtained from spin-coating. Native silicon wafers (SiO2) as well as wafers that were modified with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and amine-containing polydimethylsiloxane (PADMS) were chosen to represent a wide range of substrates with different substrate-PDA interactions. The main effect of substrate structural difference was on PDA film morphology. "Island" morphologies were obtained on PDMS where only hydrophobic interactions are responsible for PDA adhesion, while "speck" morphologies were observed on SiO2 and PADMS. The stabilities of the fabricated PDA films were tested in 0.1 M HCl and DMSO. The SP-derived PDA films exhibited very little mass loss compared to those fabricated using either the conventional dip-coating method or oxygen as an oxidant. Choosing a strong oxidant, understanding the DA reaction dynamics, and taking advantage of the optimal DA aging time are important in the fabrication of stable PDA films on a variety of substrates.									2	1	0	0	0	0	3			0743-7463			WOS:000488993300015	31536357

Complementary, XPS measurements provided information about changes in the chemical environments of Pd, Co and nitrogen during sequential temperature-programmed reactions. A preactivation thermal treatment under hydrogen led to the destruction of the perovskite structure while in the course of the NO + H-2 + O-2 reactions, the regeneration of the perovskite structure evidenced by XRD at 873 K started at lower temperature (573 K) at the surface. Palladium has been incorporated in order to evidence its effective role in the surface modifications of LaCoO3 and its consequence on the catalytic activity.					7th Congress on Catalysis and Automotive Pollution Control7th Congress on Catalysis and Automotive Pollution Control	AUG   30, 2006AUG   30, 2006		Brussels, BELGIUMBrussels, BELGIUM	19	0	0	0	0	0	20			1022-5528			WOS:000246740900034

Films of different thicknesses (100-500 nm) were synthesized at substrate temperatures of 40, 350, and 450 degreesC. Their composition has been studied by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, elastic recoil detection, and ion beam nuclear reaction analysis. Scanning electron microscopy and wide-angle X-ray scattering have been used for studying the surface texture of the samples and for their microstructural characterization, respectively. The electrochemical characterization by cyclic voltammetry has shown that, despite the high physical density of the films, compared with that obtained by the thermochemical methods, they exhibit large charge-storage capacities. For the materials synthesized at 350-450 degreesC, an explanation of these results has been sought in specific features of the RuO2 rutile-type cell and columnar texture of the oxide film. The much higher capacity of the films synthesized at 40 degreesC would be rather due to a poor sintering of the oxide phase. Study of the chlorine evolution reaction in the samples prepared at 350 and 450 degreesC points to a Volmer-Tafel mechanism, with a chemical desorption rate-determining step, and significant radical intermediate coverage. Films deposited at 40 degreesC exhibited an unsatisfactory wear resistance under the anodic polarization required for the chlorine evolution reaction investigation.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000220089000028

Whereas NiOx is deposited if oxygen is used as a reactive gas, the use of air as a reactive gas leads to the deposition of the NiOx(OH)(y), which is electrochemically more active than the NiOx. By recording X-ray photoelectron spectra from the as-deposited catalysts and after their electrochemical investigations, we determined that the electrochemical activity correlates with the amount of hydroxide sites on the surface. Such a behavior was already observed for CoOx and CoOx(OH)(y). As a consequence, CoNiOx(OH)(y) was deposited using air as a reactive gas to study the influence of nickel on the electronic structure of CoOx(OH)(y) and its effect on the electrochemical activity.									136	2	0	0	8	0	136			1932-7447			WOS:000398247500005

Here, we report the exploration of advanced OER/ORR bi-functional catalysts based on foaming-assisted electrospinning. The addition of foaming agent is beneficial to prevent the agglomeration of FeCo alloy nanoparticles decorated on the N-doped mesoporous carbon nanofibers (FeCo@NCNF). These rationally designed electrocatalysts exhibit an excellent bi-functional electrocatalytic activity with a low reversible overvoltage of 0.749 V. The as-constructed Zn-air battery delivers a power density of 134.83 mW cm-2 and long-term cycling stability with a slight increase of 0.02 V in potential gap over 216 h at 5 mA cm-2, surpassing to most bi-functional electrocatalysts ever reported.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000728639700002

Particularly, ARR was widely considered inherent to these kinetic issues. In this paper, unambiguous evidences of strong and reversible ARR is found in Na2/3Ni1/3 Mn2/3O2 through mapping of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (mRIXS). Strikingly, the material displays negligible voltage hysteresis (0.1 V) and high initial coulombic efficiency with a highly stable electrochemical profile. Our independent analysis of the Ni, Mn and O states consistently interpret the redox mechanism of Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2, which reveals a strong ARR system with facile kinetics and highly stable electrochemical profile that previously found only in cationic redox systems of conventional non-Alkali-rich materials.									45	4	0	0	1	0	45			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000546641600010

One of the major challenges in developing rechargeable ZABs is the slow kinetics of oxygen reduction and evolution (ORR/OER) on the air electrode during battery discharging and charging. Here, we report on a composite air electrode consisting of a Mn-Co mixed oxide electrocatalyst film on a carbon gas diffusion layer synthesized via anodic electrodeposition. The Mn-Co oxides have a fibrous structure and exhibit high catalytic activity towards both ORR and OER. ZAB test results show that the catalyst reduces the discharge-charge voltage gap and improves the round-trip efficiency in comparison with the baseline Pt-Ru/C catalyst. Furthermore, the catalyst remains stable for repeated cycles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									54	3	0	0	1	0	57			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000380904100084

An oxygen evolution experiment displays a low catalytic water oxidation activity with a first-order reaction kinetic mechanism. The result indicates that the O-O bond formation of the dinuclear catalyst 1 follows a water nucleophilic attack pathway rather than a radical coupling pathway. The most plausible interpretation is that the steric hindrance effects of the L1 and bda ligands lead to a disadvantage in forming the face-to-face configuration of the two active sites in a one dimer molecule.

Here, a convenient, one-step pyrolysis method was introduced into the preparation process of a difunctional electrocatalyst, an Fe-, Co-, and N-codoped carbon-based cube hybrid (Co7Fe3/CFNC) with abundant active components, including metallic Co7Fe3 nanoparticles and Fe/Co-Nx species. The as-constructed Co7Fe3/CFNC demonstrates impressive activity/stability for ORR/OER. Moreover, practical zinc-air battery building with Co7Fe3/CFNC electrocatalysts reveals a superior cycling stability for 224 h.

An oxygen terminated nanofaceted Re surface containing ridges and valleys is used as the nanotemplate in this study. Deposition of cobalt onto this surface, followed by annealing to similar to 800 K, results in preferential cobalt nanocluster nucleation and growth within the valleys of the nanofaceted surface. Decreasing the nanofacet width, cobalt coverage, and annealing temperature lead to the same preferential cobalt nanocluster self assembly, an increase in nanocluster density, and a decrease in nanocluster volume. The preferential nucleation and growth observed for Co nanoclusters on faceted Re makes this a model system for future studies of different substrates and metallic overlayers more relevant to catalytic reactions.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000264318300007

Exploring stable and efficient photocatalysts are highly desired. Herein, we propose novel low-dimensional InSbS(3 )semiconductors with good stability based on density functional theory. Such InSbS3 structures could be obtained from their bulk crystal by suitable exfoliation methods. Our calculations indicate that two-dimensional (2D) and one-dimensional (1D) InSbS3 nanostructures have moderate band gaps (2.54 and 1.97 eV, respectively) and suitable band edge alignments, which represents sufficient redox capacity for photocatalytic water splitting. 2D InSbS3 monolayer possesses oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and 1D InSbS(3 )single-nanochain possesses hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity under acidic conditions. Interestingly, two edge electron states can be introduced when the dimension of InSbS3 is reduced from 2D to 1D and the new electron states can exist in arbitrary-width nanoribbons, which can effectively promote the process of HER. Moreover, InSbS(3 )monolayer and single-nanochain also exhibit large solar-to-hydrogen efficiency, high carrier mobility, and excellent optical ab-sorption properties, which can facilitate the process of photocatalytic reactions. Our findings can stimulate the synthesis and applications of low-dimensional InSbS3 semi-conductors for overall water splitting.(C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a novel nanoforest-like NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu heterojunction with excellent overall water splitting activity and long-term stability is synthesized through the facile substrate etching and hydrothermal crystallization processes. The nanotree-like NiCo2O4/CuxO supported on Cu foam achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at small overpotential (eta(10) = 92 mV for the HER; eta(10) = 213 mV for the OER), which is significantly ahead of the corresponding pristine catalyst NiCo2O4/Cu (eta(10) = 295 mV for the HER; eta(10) = 349 mV for the OER) and CuxO/Cu (eta(10) = 309 mV for the HER; eta(10) = 347 mV for the OER). In addition, NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu can work stably for more than 125 h, and the stability is superior to the noble metal catalysts (Pt/C and RuO2) at different potentials. The electrons transfer from Cu2O to NiCo2O4 with the formation of Cu-O bonds at the interface, making parts of the relatively inert Cu(i) into the active Cu(ii), introducing abundant new active sites. The hierarchical self-supported nanoforest-like structure enlarges the electrochemically active surface area and ensures the bonding strength of NiCo2O4/CuxO with the Cu skeleton, giving rise to excellent stability. The superb electrocatalytic performance and stability of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu makes it a promising bifunctional catalytic material for overall water splitting. This study provides new testimony of interface effects and the mechanism may inspire the extending design of more effective catalysts.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000661958000001

In recent years, the blooming development of HMF electrochemical oxidation (HMF-EOR) has given a new birth to the traditional aerobic oxidation, which only needs non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts to convert HMF into FDCA under appropriate potential and ambient temperature. Cathodic H-2 evolution reaction or biomass reduction reaction, coupled with anodic HMF oxidation, can also provide more value for HMF-EOR. In this review, most recently reported studies on the electrocatalytic synthesis of FDCA from HMF are introduced, including the structure and electrochemical performance of catalysts, reaction mechanism, optimization of the reaction conditions, and characterization methods. Electrocatalysts without noble metals are classified according to their composition, which has great effects on their catalytic activity. Furthermore, challenges and suggestions for HMF-EOR are provided in the end. It is anticipated that this review could promote scientists to develop effective electrocatalysts for the economical and environment-friendly synthesis of FDCA in industrial applications.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000686590400001

The chemical analyses concerned the parameters more involved in the oxidative reactions (SO2, acetaldehyde, phenols, wine color), as well as the main fermentative volatile compounds. The kind of closure influenced the oxygen content in wines, free and total SO2 concentration, and wine color (color intensity and hue). During bottle aging, free and total SO2 concentration was significantly and negatively correlated with absorbance at 420 nm (A420), whereas the correlations with A520 were weak. Probably, the limited extent of the variations in red color (A520), when varying SO2 concentration, were due to the low pH of this rose wine. No effect of the kind of closure on phenols and the main fermentative volatile compounds was observed. The wines bottled with cork closures (N trials), after 12 mo of storage, had higher color intensity and hue, measured by spectrophotometry, and were visually distinguished from the other trials for the more intense pink reflections. On the whole, under the conditions of this work, all the used closures guaranteed a good preservability to the rose wines during the 1st year of bottle aging, and the changes in composition did not significantly affect wine sensory characteristics. Therefore, these synthetic closures can represent an alternative to the cork closures for a medium to long term bottle aging of these wines.									13	0	0	0	7	0	13			0022-1147	1750-3841		WOS:000314990500006	23324077

Although substantial efforts and significant progress have been made in recent years, it is still one of the major challenges to explore a stable and efficient bifunctional catalyst in high-temperature molten salt environments. Herein, the NiMnO3-La2O3 composite is synthesized on porous nickel foam substrates by a hydrothermal method and used as a cathode catalyst for the iron molten air battery. The results show that the NiMnO3-La2O3 composite has excellent stability and durability. After 250 cycles in a 500 degrees C molten salt electrolyte, the microscopic morphology of the catalyst is almost the same as that before using. Moreover, the NiMnO3-La2O3 composite exhibits excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER)/oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, less discharge polarization, and excellent rate performance. The iron molten air battery with NiMnO3-La2O3 composite cycles stably over 250 cycles with the highest Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% and the average discharge potential of 1.14 V at 500 degrees C in the air. This work opens a new avenue toward developing a stable and efficient bifunctional cathode catalyst for the iron molten air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000564494200003

Input variables tested included particle size and oxygen concentration in the process gas. The response variables included the size distributions, chemical composition, and morphology of the reacted particles at seven locations along a laboratory reactor. Particles with initial size < 45 A mu m contained mostly chalcopyrite, they increased their mean size and decreased the amount of dust in the population during oxidation. This was explained by a reaction path involving rapid melting followed by collision and coalescence of reacting droplets during flight. Particles with sizes > 45 A mu m contained varying amounts of chalcopyrite and pyrite, and tended to either maintain or decrease their mean size upon oxidation. When size reduction was observed, dust was produced because of fragmentation, and the particles showed no evidence of collisions during flight. The main oxidation products detected in the particles consisted of matte, cuprospinel, and magnetite. A plot of the mean size divided by the mean size in the feed against the fraction of sulfur eliminated generalized the experimental data so far reported in the literature, and helped identify the reaction path followed by the particles.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000426808500016

The high-alkaline granites consist of quartz alkaline feldspar syenite, alkaline feldspar granite, quartz monzonite porphyry, alkaline feldspar syenite,etc. Based on the petrographic observation, whole-rock analysis and electronic probe analysis,it is showed that mineral assemblage of high-alkali granites is characterized by alkali feldspar, quartz, arfvedsonite and aegirine-augite. They display high Si,K + Na,Fe and Mn and low Al, Ca, Mg and H2O. Crystallization temperatures of the high-alkali granites are estimated between 650degC~755degC and their oxygen fugacity is in the range of 1017.17 Pa~10-14.39 Pa on the light of ilmenite-magnetite thermometer. Combining with the feature of arfvedsonite, it can be inferred that water-rock reactions occurred during the late evolution processes of alkaline magma obviously, which suggests that the Zaheba high-alkali granites formed under low pressure, high oxygen fugacity,middle-high temperatures, and in an open magma system near the surface.									1	1	0		0	0	1			1001-6872			INSPEC:10169143

However, maximizing the catalytic activity and stability of the electrocatalysts in catalyzing ORR is significantly important but still remains challenge. To address this issue, we herein reported an effective strategy that fabricate the cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated with defectrich graphitized carbon shell in the hierarchical porous N-doped carbon aerogel (Co/NCA), which can simultaneously enhance the electrochemical stability while boosting the electrocatalytic activity for ORR. The desirable combination of the Co nanoparticles encapsulated with defect-rich graphitic carbon shells coupling with Co-N-x sites, the large accessible surface-active sites, and the hierarchical porous structure give rise to the superior electrocatalytic activity and stability for ORR in wide pH range. As expect, the asobtained catalyst exhibits high efficiency for ORR with an onset potential of 0.95 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode, vs. RHE) and a half-wave potential of 0.83 V in 0.1 M KOH, comparable to the commercial Pt/C. Importantly, the catalyst also provides excellent ORR properties in acidic and neutral media with almost a 4e(-) pathway and superior durability and methanol tolerance, showing a potential as electrocatalysts for practical applications.

In this work, a nonprecious-metal bifunctional catalyst of ultrafine and uniform Ni2.25Co0.75N nanoparticles anchoring on N-doped reduced graphene oxide (denoted as Ni2.25Co0.75N/NrGO) was prepared by the thermal ammonolysis of the corresponding hydroxide/graphene oxide precursor. As a result of the intimate combination of redox-active metal nitrides and electroconductive N-doped reduced graphene oxide (NrGO), the Ni2.25Co0.75N/NrGO hybrid not only exhibited high OER activity but also showed outstanding ORR kinetics and durability, comparable to commercial RuO2 and Pt/C electrocatalysts, respectively. Furthermore, Zn-air batteries assembled by using the as-prepared Ni2.25Co0.75N/NrGO hybrid electrocatalysts yielded a high power density and gravimetric energy density of 193 mW cm(-2) and 864 W h kg(-1), respectively, characteristic with a low charge/discharge voltage gap of 0.72 V and excellent cyclability up to 166 h at 10 mA cm(-2) in an aqueous system. More importantly, the ORR experiment and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy coupled with density functional theory calculations verified that the electronic transfer from bimetallic NiCo nitride to NrGO may enhance the ability in forming O-2 adsorption and *OOH on NrGO, which is the possible origination of the ORR high activity.									29	1	0	0	1	0	29			2168-0485			WOS:000503330400030

The TEM and HRTEM images clearly showed the heterogeneous nanostructures at the interface between Bi12GeO20 and g-C3N4. The as-prepared Bin GeO20/g-C3N4 composites exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activities for the degradation of microcystin-LR and RhB aqueous solution and reduction of aqueous Cr(VI) as compared to the pure Bi12GeO20 and g-C3N4 under visible-light irradiation. On the basis of the radical species trapping experiments and ESR analyses, Of and h(+) were confirmed to be the mainly active species involved in the degradation of organic pollutants and this reaction was identified to be an oxygen-induced pathway. Meanwhile, combined with the in situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and kinetic isotope effect investigations, the photocatalytic reduction of aqueous Cr(VI) was identified as a proton assisted electron transfer reaction. Moreover, the enhanced photocatalytic activities of the Bi12GeO20/g-C3N4 composites can be attributed to the improved photo-absorption properties and effective separation of photo-induced charge carriers caused by the Z-scheme system of the as-prepared Bi12GeO20/g-C3N4 composites.

This method is based on the assumption that a nonequilibrium system can reach its final equilibrium state by a series of RCCE states determined by maximizing entropy or minimizing relevant free energy. Those constraints are imposed by some small number of slow reactions. Much research has been done on this method and many RCCE models of C-1 - C-4 hydrocarbon fuel combustion have been established by the previous researchers. Those models show good performance compared with the result of detailed kinetic model (DKM). In this study, RCCE method is further developed to model normal pentane (n-C5H12) combustion with least number of constraints. The chemical mechanism for DKM contains 133 species and 922 reactions. Two sets of constraints were found during the study: (1) 16 constraints for the normal pentane and pure oxygen mixture and (2) 14 constraints for the mixture of normal pentane and oxygen with argon as diluent. Results of the first constraint set were compared with result of DKM and results of the second constraint set were compared with those of DKM and experimental data by calculating their ignition delay times. Comparisons showed that the first set of constraints had relatively good accuracy and the second set of constraints agreed very well with the experimental data.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0195-0738			WOS:000475315200009

Herein, we propose hydroxylated carbon black as an improved deposition support, which not only functions as a conductive agent, but also improves the morphology of the discharge products. These improvements can significantly enhance the discharge properties and chargeability of the gas cathode, particularly in simulated air or ambient air. For example, the hydroxylated carbon black doubles the energy output of the air cathode in ambient air. It is believed that increased defects and hydroxyls on the hydroxylated carbon surface might play an important role. By the first principle calculation, it is revealed that a strong affinity between the hydroxyls and Li2O2 occurs, and this facilitates the nucleation of Li2O2. It is believed that the promoted nucleation can restrain the growth of the discharge products due to the competitive relationship between nucleation and growth of new phase in chemical reactions. Finally, smaller Li2O2 nanosheets formed on the hydroxylated carbon cathode instead of the dense discharge product layer, avoid the block of the porous cathode, thus benefiting the electrochemical performances. These results show that besides developing better catalysts, hydroxylation of carbon matrix is also an effective strategy to enhance the electrochemical performances of the lithium air battery.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000413526200050

Engineering the electronic structure via heteroatom doping is supposed to be efficient. However, a feasible synthesis and precise control are still challenging. Here, we propose a fast-pyrolyzing and controllable-activation strategy to construct an O-rich carbonaceous support and atomically dispersed FeN4 site with axial O coordination (Fe1N4-O-1), which was confirmed by aberration-corrected electron microscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. A wide potential range of 310 mV (-0.56 V to -0.87 V vs. RHE) could be achieved when FECO was continuously maintained at nearly 100%, which exceeded the existing results to the best of our knowledge. DFT calculations revealed that the superior performance originated from the axial O-coordination induced electronic localization enhancement, which could facilitate the desorption of CO and increase the energy barrier for the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction.									51	3	0	0	2	0	51			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000647432900001

All candidates thus far are exclusively metallic catalysts, which suffer inherent corrosion and oxidation susceptibility during acidic proton-exchange membrane electrolysis. Herein, based on theoretical predictions, we designed and synthesized nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) dual-doped graphene as a nonmetallic electrocatalyst for sustainable and efficient hydrogen production. The N and P heteroatoms could coactivate the adjacent C atom in the graphene matrix by affecting its valence orbital energy levels to induce a synergistically enhanced reactivity toward HER. As a result, the dual-doped electrocatalytic HER activity than single-doped ones and comparable performance to some of the traditional metallic catalysts. graphene showed higher									786	39	0	0	34	0	795			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000336640600122	24779586

Steady-state rates were reached except at the lowest c0. The dark O2 evolution was negligible. To determine the contribution of the photochemical decomposition of H2O2, the use of evolution rates measured in the absence of TiO2 was shown to be irrelevant. Therefore this contribution was derived, in an original manner, from the rates obtained with a Cr3+-doped TiO2 sample that has the same properties as the undoped specimen for the absorption and scattering of UV light but a negligible photocatalytic activity as evidenced by other reactions. The steady-state photocatalytic rates thus calculated were numerically fitted to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism by iterative variations of the constants. According to this mechanism, an optimal surface coverage by H2O2 of ca. 0.4 was found to correspond to the maximal photocatalytic effect to background ratio q observed for c0 = ca. 1 mM. The value of q obviously depends on the wavelength range and type of TiO2; it was found equal to 25 in the region 300-400 nm for TiO2 Degussa P25, which illustrates the importance of the photocatalytic decomposition. The total O2 evolution, smaller than that expected from H2O2 --> H2O + 1/2O2, was thought consistent with the previously suggested internal hydroxylation of TiO2 by H2O2.									85	0	0	0	17	0	85			0743-7463			WOS:A1991FM78400024

However, the complex reaction pathways of nitrate reduction to NH3 are not fully revealed by previous reports. Here we point out that Ag/Cu2O hybrids prepared with the assistance of oxygen vacancies (O-v) have very competitive activity (selectivity: 96.85%, Faradaic efficiency: 96.45%) for NH3 synthesis from NO3. Detailed characterizations demonstrate that this high performance of Ag/Cu2O hybrids derives from the strong interface interactions owing to the formation of strong Ag-Cu bonds. Both online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the strong interface interactions between Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and Cu2O can efficiently boost the adsorption of NO3 and facilitate the formation of *N intermediates in NH3 synthesis.

Noble metal catalysts have shown excellent catalytic performance in electrolysis of water for hydrogen evolution, but their scarcity and high cost limit their large-scale use. Therefore, the design of non-noble metal catalysts with high catalytic activity and stability and low cost is an urgent problem to be solved. Two zinc-based coordination polymers have been synthesized by one-pot method. We developed an effective method through simple Co2+ doping, which improved and optimized the electrocatalytic performance to obtain two high-quality electrocatalysts for electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen with low starting potential (-210 mV and -240 mV), high Tafel efficiency (117.7 mV dec-1 and 127.8 mV dec-1) and excellent cycle stability (>95% LSV retention after at least 2000 cycles). We also synthesized two isomorphic Co-based or Ni-based coordination polymers, and found that their electrocatalytic performances were improved to some extent after the introduction of Co ions, but the effects were not as good as that of zinc-based coordination polymers. This work not only provides two examples of good electrocatalyst, but also provides an idea to improve and optimize the electrocatalytic performance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729139100006

In this work, we show that although Au is recognized to be inert towards OER, the catalytic activity of Fe3O4 catalyst for OER was highly boosted by coupling Fe3O4 with Au to address these two issues. Here, Au nanoparticles were attached to hierarchical Fe3O4 microsphere through electrochemical deposition, a mild and rapid approach that can be accomplished within 3 min and requires no sophisticated equipment. With the coupling of Au, interfacial charge transfer resistance of Fe3O4 declined remarkably. On the other hand, oxidability of Fe sites and electron accepting capability of Au sites was elevated due to strong interaction between Au and Fe3O4. Owing to these two merits induced by Au, Fe3O4 exhibited enhanced catalytic activity for OER. The potential of Fe3O4 to obtain 10 mA/cm2 decreased by 640 mV, the current density was amplified up to 2.5 fold at the potential of 2 V (vs SCE), and the Tafel slop was reduced by 146 mV/dec.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In this work, we investigate the electrochemical hydrogen evolution catalysis of WS2 quantum dots (QDs) synthesized electrochemically. WS2 QDs were evaluated for a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4 as a binder-less electrocatalyst, which necessitated a low HER onset of 190 mV and reached -200 mA cm(-2) at 473 mV. In contrast, the bulk WS2 exhibited a poor performance, which required 780 mV to drive -50 mA cm(-2). The electrochemical disintegration of bulk WS2 into QDs is the key behind such activation.									22	0	0	0	2	0	22			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000454918600019

Possible evolution of ZnxCo1-x(C3H4N2) MOF structures and their conversion to Co@NC nanostructures is established from an X-ray diffraction technique and transmission electron microscopy analysis, which reveal that MOF-derived Co@NC core-shell nanostructures are well ordered and highly crystalline in nature. Co@NC-MOF core-shell nanostructures show excellent catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with onset potential of 0.97 V and half-wave potential of 0.88 V versus relative hydrogen electrode in alkaline electrolyte, and excellent durability with zero degradation after 5000 potential cycles; whereas under similar experimental conditions, the commonly utilized Pt/C electrocatalyst degrades. The Co@NC-MOF electrocatalyst also shows excellent tolerance to methanol, unlike the Pt/C electrocatalyst. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis shows the presence of ORR active pyridinic-N and graphitic-N species, along with CoNxCy and CoNx ORR active (M-N-C) sites. Enhanced electron transfer kinetics from nitrogen-doped carbon shell to core Co nanoparticles, the existence of M-N-C active sites, and protective NC shells are responsible for high ORR activity and durability of the Co@NC-MOF electrocatalyst.									106	6	0	0	7	0	107			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000432032800029	29635725

Herein, we investigated the synthesis of nickel-based hybrid metal oxides (NixM1-xOy) and their catalytic performance towards OER. NixM1-xOy catalysts were synthesized by solution combustion synthesis (SCS) using the metal nitrates as oxidizer and glycine as fuel. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs display a porous morphology for the hybrid binary NixM1-xOy, the common feature of combusted materials. X-ray diffraction (XRD) of NixM1-xOy depicted well-defined diffraction peaks, which confirms the crystalline nature of synthesized catalysts. The particle size of as-synthesized materials ranges between 20 and 30 nm with a mesoporous nature as revealed by N-2-physisorption. The electrocatalytic performance of the as-prepared materials was evaluated towards OER in alkaline medium. Among them, NixCo1-xOy showed the best catalytic performance. For instance, it exhibited the lowest overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (404 mV), onset potential (1.605 V), and Tafel slope (52.7 mV dec(-1)). The enhanced electrocatalytic performance of NixCo1-xOy was attributed to the synergism between cobalt and nickel and the alteration of the electronic structure of nickel. Also, NixCo1-xOy afforded the highest Ni3+/Ni2+ when compared to other electrocatalysts. This leads to higher oxidation states of Ni species, which promote and improve the electrocatalytic activity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000741033500001	35425214

Compared with catalytic kinetics, much less attention has been paid to catalyst stability, and the weak understanding of the catalyst deactivation mechanism restricts the design of robust electrocatalysts. Herein, we discuss the issues of catalysts' stability evaluation and characterization, and the degradation mechanism. The systematic understanding of the degradation mechanism would help us to formulate principles for the design of stable catalysts. Particularly, we found that the dissolution rate for different 3d transition metals differed greatly: Fe dissolves 114 and 84 times faster than Co and Ni. Based on this trend, we designed Fe@Ni and FeNi@Ni core-shell structures to achieve excellent stability in a 1 A cm(-2) current density, as well as good catalytic activity at the same time.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000764481500001

In comparison with conventional catalysts in the powdery form, the self-supported nanostructures are more promising for practical applications. However, the preparation of self-supported nanocatalysts with high stability in acidic media remains challenging. Herein, IrOx nanostructures anchored on carbon cloth were prepared by a facile two-step method, which involved a fast dip-coating process and a subsequent annealing treatment under different temperatures. High hydroxide contents and mixed valence of iridium were observed for the obtained samples. By optimizing the annealing temperature, we achieved a low overpotential of 220 mV at the current density of 20 mA cm(-2). The optimal activity was attributed to a balance between hydroxide content and electrochemical surface area. Moreover, the self-supported IrQ(x) nanostructure showed a good stability over 50 h.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000507149600002

Analyses on the structural evolution of the intermediates at different intervals identified that the formation of Co3O4 nanotubes followed a nanoscale Kirkendall effect. The outward diffusion of cobalt species was faster than the inward diffusion of oxygen species, resulting in the formation of nanovoids at the initial stage and subsequently the tubular structure. The Co3O4 nanotubes showed a higher activity and stability than the spherical nanoparticles in CO oxidation, primarily due of the facile redox feature. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Suppressing water electrolysis is a prime consideration, while the round-trip efficiency is an often-overlooked issue. Here, we report an aqueous alkaline dual-ion battery with Na+ and OH- intercalating anode and cathode. Despite the oxygen-evolving cathode, the battery exhibits high Coulombic efficiency because oxygen evolution is suppressed by asymmetric anode and cathode polarization, Together with the low voltage loss, the battery yields a high round-trip efficiency of 77.7% at 1 Ag-1 Other merits of this battery include moderate energy density and the use of safe, harmless, and cheap materials, manifesting a practical choice for grid energy storage. The ultra. fast intercalation reactions also endow the battery with high-rate performances comparable to supercapacitors. Moreover, this work proposes and verifies the concept of asymmetric electrode polarization, shifting the paradigm for electrode selection in aqueous batteries.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2666-3864		WOS:000856516900003

Herein, a series of CuxCo3-xO4 nanorods with different Cu2+ concentrations was prepared by a convenient hydrothermal method. The corresponding structures and electrochemistries were further characterized in order to reveal the composition effect of catalyst on catalytic activity. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations indicate that more Cu2+ occupying CO2+ positions and dispersing on the catalyst surface has an enhanced catalytic activity in terms of higher capacity, lower overpotential and better reversibility. This implies that suitable charge transfer from Li2O2 to the catalyst plays an important role in improving the electrochemical performance of Li-O-2 batteries. The present study is helpful for designing a highly active catalyst by tuning the composition of the catalyst surface.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000410597200027

Platinum-based materials are the most active electrocatalysts for catalyzing HER, but reducing the use of Pt is required because of the high price and scarcity of Pt. Here, we achieve pseudo-atomic-scale dispersion of Pt, i.e. individual atoms or subnanometer clusters, on the sidewalls of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with a simple and readily upscalable electroplating deposition method. These SWNTs activated with an ultralow amount of Pt exhibit activity similar to that of commercial Pt/ C with a notably higher (similar to 66-333-fold) Pt loading for catalyzing the HER under the acidic conditions required in proton exchange membrane technology. These catalysts resemble pseudo-atomic-scale Pt systems which are mainly composed of a few to tens of Pt atoms dispersed on the sidewalls of the SWNTs. The Pt loading is only 0.19-0.75 atom % at the electrode surface, and characteristic peaks for Pt cyclic voltammograms are undetectable. The atomic dispersion increases the portion of the surface active-atom sites, and therefore, notably lower Pt loading is needed to attain a high catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest higher ability for SWNTs, in comparison to graphene, as a catalyst support for immobilizing Pt atoms, thus providing an atomic dispersion. Moreover, a high HER activity for the SWNTs activated with Pt atoms, similar to that of bulk Pt, is predicted.									212	22	0	0	10	0	213			2155-5435			WOS:000401054300004

The shapes of the resulting materials were tuned via a solvent engineering approach to form rhombic-shaped nanosheets and nanotubes with hexagonal close packed-crystal structures. The as-synthesized materials exhibited suitable properties as bifunctional catalysts for HER and ORR reactions surpassing by far the electrocatalytic activity of commercially available amorphous C-60. The C-60 nanotubes displayed the most efficient catalytic performance with a small onset potential of -0.13 V vs. RHE and ultrahigh electrochemical stability properties towards the generation of molecular hydrogen. Additionally, the rotating-disk electrode measurements revealed that the oxygen reduction mechanism at the nanotube electrochemical surfaces followed an effective four-electron pathway. The improved catalytic activity was attributed to the enhanced local electric fields at the high curvature surfaces.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2398-4902			WOS:000539290400030

The sophistication of the co-assembly is further highlighted by the three structural roles of lithium ions. This unique structure contributes to its multi-functional properties such as ionic conductivity and catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (by CPM-B1 carbonized material) and provides a new path to develop MOF materials with complex secondary building units and multi-functional applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000871918700001	36285729

To do so, there is a need to develop new methods to assemble suitable OER co-catalysts at the semiconductor-solution interface. Although Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are frequently used as precursor materials to synthesize high surface area, effective OER electrocatalysts, until now their utilization as co-catalysts in a working photo-electrochemical cell (PEC) has remained underexplored. As a proof-of-concept, here we provide a simple route for modification of BiVO4-based photoanodes with highly-active porous cobalt-oxide co-catalysts, converted from a cobalt-imidazolium MOF (ZIF-67). Photo-electrochemical and impedance spectroscopy analysis reveal that the co-catalyst significantly accelerates photoanodic OER (rather than serving as a surface passivation layer), and thus greatly improves the overall PEC performance. Hence, given the chemical flexibility of MOFs, this work provides a new tool-kit for designing efficient water splitting PECs.									36	2	0	0	2	0	36			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472225200029

This multiphysics modeling estimates locally if the fretted interface is running under adhesive or abrasive wear condition. For each situation, a specific energy wear coefficient is considered which finally allows the simulation of the composite adhesive-abrasive (W-shape) fretting scar. A good correlation is observed with former Ti-6Al-4V cylinder-on-flat fretting wear experiments. This model also predicts the transition from pure abrasive to abrasive-adhesive response, W-shape and U-shape fretting scar profiles and for the first time provides reliable estimations of the maximum wear depth extension.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0301-679X	1879-2464		WOS:000663722000004

The thermal degradation of the treated larch samples was studied by thermal analysis and cone calorimeter. The flame retardant properties were characterized in limiting oxygen index, char yield, heat release rate and total heat release. Kinetic parameters of thermal degradation were obtained following the method of Broido. The limiting oxygen index and char yield increased while the heat release rate and total heat release decreased, which shows that combustibility of larch has largely decreased. For the degradation of the larch treated with flame retardants, the activation energy was greatly decreased, which shows that the flame retardants catalyze the dehydration and decomposition of larch. The main decomposition of larch occurred at lower temperatures (<300 ℃) through the reaction which includes dehydration, rearrangement, carbonization, evolution of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and ultimately a carbonaceous residue, resulting in the formation of less flammable products and correspondingly more char, leading to low combustibility.			将落叶松用一系列磷-胺-醛树脂型阻燃剂进行阻燃处理,所得阻燃落叶松采用热分析、锥形量热研究其热解行为,用氧指数、剩炭率、热释放速率、总热释放量等参数表征它的阻燃性能,并用Broido方程计算落叶松的动力学参数.结果发现,阻燃落叶松氧指数、剩炭率增加,热释放速率、总热释放量降低,表明经阻燃剂处理的落叶松燃烧性降低.落叶松经阻燃剂处理后,热解活化能降低很多,表明阻燃剂对落叶松热解具有催化作用,其主要热解阶段在低于300℃进行.在此温度下,落叶松热解主要发生脱水、重排交联炭化反应,产生水、CO及CO_2、固体残渣,可燃性气体大大降低,达到降低落叶松燃烧性的目的.						1	2	0		0	0	3			1009-606X			CSCD:2913857

Herein, we report a novel hollow near-spherical superstructure of a cobalt sulfide electrocatalyst (h-CoxSy) via the accumulation of two-dimensional cobalt sulfide nanosheets in a sulfurization-pyrolysis process of hollow ZIF-67. Benefiting from the porous characteristics, a unique hollow superstructure and saw-toothed edges derived from the hollow ZIF-67 precursor, the h-CoxSy exhibited outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic performances, with overpotentials of 320 and 295 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER and HER, respectively. When h-CoxSy was employed as both the anode and cathode for overall water splitting, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) can be obtained at a cell voltage of 1.88 V, along with impressive operation stability.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000691604600001

Although various efforts are advocated to obtain high activity, it is still difficult for phosphides to exhibit cycle performance in hydrodechlorination (HDC), limiting their practical development. By linking the changes in the oxidation state of MoP before and after HDC with its catalytic performance, the Mo-P-O bond is found to be the active catalytic site, not only promoting electron transfer but also forming the defect-rich structure. Based on this, H2O2-treated MoP after HDC reached a performance of 19.9%, and the activity could be restored after multiple cycle reactions, while the untreated one still had poor performance, demonstrating that carrying out the H2O2 treatment process can realize the recycling of MoP, which is of importance for industrial application of catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000680445800020

This reaction poses some formidable challenges at the interface of oxidation catalysis and photochemistry. Molecular innovation is expected to provide a decisive lead in the field of artificial photosynthesis. Key achievements include the discovery of novel transition metal catalysts, exhibiting oxygen-evolving activity upon multi-electron oxidation and the design of antenna-like sensitizers. The thermodynamic and photophysical requirements of the system are discussed herein. A successful combination is obtained with polynuclear dendrimeric Ru(II) polypyridine sensitizers, activating colloidal IrO2 nanoparticles or a tetra-ruthenate polyoxometalate catalyst. In this latter case, an unprecedented quantum yield up to 30% is achieved, which holds great promise for the up-grade to functional materials and practical technology. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A nonlinear system was numerically solved for various combinations of materials, temperatures, and light availability, by adopting a typical Newton method, in conjunction with a multi-step up-winding finite differences scheme. The probability of the packaged olive oil not to reach the end of its shelf life (P-safe) and its time evolution, was in very good agreement with the experimental data. P-safe was proposed as a reduction indicator for shelf life predictions at "real-life" conditions. Exposure to light at any pattern could significantly stimulate the oxidative degradations, only assisted by elevated temperatures and presence of oxygen. Plastic containers showed particularly higher protective role when oil was stored at light, while glass was the most protective material when oil was stored at dark.					13th European Symposium on Mathematics in Industry (ESMI)13th European Symposium on Mathematics in Industry (ESMI)	JUN 21-25, 2004JUN 21-25, 2004		Eindhoven, NETHERLANDSEindhoven, NETHERLANDS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1612-3956		3-540-28072-3	WOS:000235037100039

The resulting electrically active point defects were characterized by deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) and several of these defects involve oxygen and/or carbon, two major impurities in as-grown crystalline silicon. Both interstitial- and vacancy-type defects are observed; in particular, interstitial carbon is found to migrate at room temperature with a diffusion constant of similar to 1x10(-15) cm(2) s(-1) and is effectively trapped by interstitial oxygen atoms. The concentration of implantation-induced defects increases linearly with dose but the defect production decreases at high enough dose rates, This dose rate effect depends on the ion mass and is qualitatively predicted by computer simulations of the defect reaction kinetics.

Moench., differing in their drought tolerance under field conditions have been used to study the effect of individual components of drought stress, namely high light intensity stress, heat stress and water stress, on their photosynthetic performance. Chlorophyll content, chlorophyll fluorescence, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco, EC 4.1.1.39) content, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPcase, EC 4.1.1.31) activity and photosynthetic oxygen evolution were used as key parameters to assess photosynthetic performance. The results indicated that photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) was severely reduced by all three stress components, whereas PEPcase activity was more specifically reduced by water stress. Degradation of Rubisco and chlorophyll loss occurred under high light and water stress conditions. Of the four drought-tolerant varieties, E 36-1 showed higher PEPcase activity, Rubisco content and photochemical efficiency of PSII, and was able to sustain a higher maximal rate of photosynthetic oxygen evolution under each stress condition as compared to the other varieties. A high stability to stress-induced damage, or acclimation of photosynthesis to the individual components of drought stress may contribute to the high yields of E 36-1 under drought conditions. In the E 36-1 variety markedly higher levers of the chloroplastic chaperonin 60 (cpn 60) were observed under all stress conditions than in the susceptible variety CSV 5.									107	3	0	0	101	1	115			0022-0957			WOS:000076379900012

Incorporation of Pt with transition metals to form alloy nanocrystals with different structures and atomic distributions has been reported as a promising approach to enhance HER activity and improve Pt utilization. However, whether the structural ordering of the Pt-based bimetallic alloy affects the HER activity still remains unknown. Here, we synthesized PtNi/C nanoparticles through a modified coprecipitation method and obtained their ordered and disordered phases at different annealing temperatures in a reducing atmosphere. It is contrary to our expectation that the disordered PtNi/C exhibited a superior activity toward the HER in alkaline media compared with the ordered PtNi/C. To understand this interesting phenomenon, a systematic study combining X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was conducted. In addition, we studied the mechanism of the HER in an alkaline electrolyte based on newly constructed models. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrated that the unexpected activity change may be attributed to the synergistic effect between the formation of Ni/Pt-OH bonds and the increased degree of disorder of Pt and Ni atoms on their surface.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000518703000011

Tbe reaction of Mn(ClO4)2 . 6H2O with tbe tripodal amine ligand tris(2-methylpyridyl)amine (TMPA) yields the eight-coordinate complex [Mn(TMPA)2](ClO4)2 (1) which crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/n with a=9.7063(3), b=10.929(3), c = 18.378(7) angstrom, beta=101.96(3)-degrees. The X-ray structure shows an eight-coordinate Mn(II) ion with coordination to six pyridyl and two amine nitrogens which form a bicapped trigonal antiprism geometry. The oxidation of the Mn(II) complex with H2O2 produces the dioxo-bridged dimeric Mn(III,IV) complex [Mn2(mu-O)2(TMPA)2](ClO4)3 which shows antiferromagnetic coupling between the two valence trapped Mn ions leading to S=1/2 ground state in a 16-line EPR spectrum typical of such dioxo-bridged mixed valent Mn complexes and similar to the EPR spectrum exhibited by the S2 State Photosystem II. While the Mn(II) complex is stable to oxidation by O2, in the presence of catechol in methanol solution, it is readily oxidized by O2 to give the catecholate complex. The oxidation of 3,5-di-t-butylcatechol to the quinone by O2 is catalyzed by 1.									51	0	0	0	1	1	51			0020-1693			WOS:A1993MB33300009

The thin films were deposited on MgO(1 0 0), MgO(1 1 0), and MgO(1 1 1) by pulsed reactive crossed-beam laser ablation (PRCLA). The quality of the films was determined by analyzing the composition as well as the crystallographic phase structure and texture of the electrodes. The catalytic activity for both the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions is evaluated from polarization curves for the selected electrodes. The compositional analysis of the films indicates that the ablation is congruent mainly for the LCCO, and that the films are nearly stoichiometric in their composition. The crystallographic orientation of the grown films is affected by the substrate. Under the selected deposition conditions it was not possible to grow parallel epitaxial films on MgO(1 1 0) and MgO(1 1 1). The key factors for epitaxy are besides the lattice misfit, also chemical/ electronic interactions between film and substrate. The predominant crystallographic orientation is the one corresponding to the next lower surface/interfacial energy. The prepared films act as bifunctional catalysts, and the electrochemical experiments indicate that different exposed surfaces affect the performance of the electrode. The most active electrode was found to be the (1 0 0) textured film. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we propose a cathodic electrochemical activation strategy toward greatly boosted HER activity of a Co3O4 nanoarray via room-temperature cathodic polarization in sodium hypophosphite solution. After activation, the overpotential significantly decreases from 260 to 73 mV to drive a geometrical catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Notably, this activated electrode also shows strong long-term electrochemical durability with the retention of its catalytic activity at 100 mA cm(-2) for at least 40 h.									50	2	0	0	1	0	51			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000428549200018	29424845

A peapod-like CoSe2@NC bifunctional electrocatalyst is successfully fabricated herein by confining CoSe2 nanoparticles (NPs) to one-dimensional (1D) N-doped carbon (NC) nanorods based on a polyaniline encapsulation strategy. The electronic coupling role between NC and CoSe2 is revealed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy. In situ Raman spectroscopy is conducted to examine the structure of CoSe2@NC under the OER in an alkaline electrolyte. The peapod-like CoSe2@NC nanorods exhibit superior activity towards the ORR (E1/2 = 0.83 V) and OER (eta = 340 mV @10 mA cm-2) in a 0.1 mol L-1 KOH solution. The as-assembled rechargeable ZAB achieves a large peak power density of 137.1 mW cm-2 and outstanding stability for 500 cycles at 10 mA cm-2. The encapsulation of CoSe2 NPs in the NC shells impedes their aggregation and corrosion during the ORR and OER processes. Experimental and DFT-based computational analyses assist in ascribing the outstanding bifunctional catalytic performance to the formation of N-CoSe2 active sites. These results provide a facile pathway for the development of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for high-performance rechargeable metal-air batteries.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000720258500001

Herein, an electrocatalyst with a hetero-atomic pair confined on a tungsten phosphide (WP) substrate so that the Fe3+ -site of the pair is distal to the surface is shown to deliver an extremely low overpotential of 192 mV at 10 mAcm-2 and one of the highest oxygen production turnover frequencies (TOF) of 2.1 s-1 at 300 mV under alkaline environment for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Operando characterization shows the Lewis acidic Fe3+ site boosts a large population of Co4+/3+ and the deprotonation of coordinated water, allowing simultaneously enhanced electron-transfer as well as the proton-transfer. A significant contribution from the WP substrate modulates the order of hydroxide transfer in the pre-equilibrium step (PES) and rate-determining-step (RDS), leading to a remarkable OER performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1521-3773		MEDLINE:36173929	36173929

The EIS patterns are recorded in the hydrogen underpotential deposition (UPD) and overpotential deposition (OPD) regions of the voltammogram in acidic electrolyte (0.1 M HClO4) where the hydrogen interacts with palladium. The atomic ratio of hydrogen to Pd (n((H/Pd))) estimated from the H-upd region of the voltammogram of Pd nanoparticles suggests a gradual alpha-beta transition unlike the sharp transition reported with bulk Pd thin-films. However, a potential range of this transition can be estimated from the EIS patterns. The diffusion characteristics of hydrogen in the Pd lattice are absent in the EIS patterns (at mid-frequency region) of these nanoparticles due to the very small particle size. The kinetic parameters, those effectively describe the Pd-H system, are estimated from the complex non-linear least square (CNLS) fit of the EIS patterns. A maximum in the charge-transfer resistance with potential, similar to that reported with bulk Pd thin-films, is observed with both Pd and Pd3Co nanoparticles suggesting the trapping mechanism of hydrogen.

Because of the use of unsatisfactory electrocatalysts, however, it is still encountering issues of low yield rates and limited efficiency, resulting from the sluggish reaction kinetics, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction and additional reaction product formation. Herein, an atomically dispersed transition metal dimer species was employed to selectively accelerate the nitrogen reduction reaction kinetics for high reduction efficiency and simultaneously alleviate the additional reaction. In this system, atomic Fe and Mo metal dimer in situ anchored on defect-rich graphene layers can realize selective electroreduction of nitrogen to ammonia by numerous FeMoNxC active sites. It exhibits higher catalytic activity than its counterparts (Fe@NG and Mo@NG) owing to a combination of ligand, geometric and synergistic effects, with a yield rate of 14.95 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) at -0.4 V and a faradaic efficiency of 41.7% at -0.2 V. The superior performance of this atomic transition metal dimer catalyst can outperform some precious metal-based catalysts due to its excellent selectivity and high catalytic activity. The specific structure of the N-coordinated FeMo dimer was further identified to be FeMoN6 by density functional theory (DFT). The catalytic reaction pathway and mechanism were explored by (DFT) calculations and proposed based on the FeMoN6 model. The existence of numerous FeMoN6 active sites can not only weaken the N N bond, but also efficiently catalyze nitrogen reduction through the alternating pathway.									59	6	0	0	1	0	60			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000489727600008

Here, we report visible-light-driven amination of biomass-derived alpha-hydroxyl acids and glucose into amino acids using NH3 at 50 degrees C. Ultrathin CdS nanosheets are identified as an efficient and stable catalyst, exhibiting an order of magnitude higher activity towards alanine production from lactic acid compared to commercial CdS as well as CdS nanoobjects bearing other morphologies. Its unique catalytic property is attributed mainly to the preferential formation of oxygen-centered radicals to promote alpha-hydroxyl acids conversion to alpha-keto acids, and partially to the poor H-2 evolution which is an undesired side reaction. Encouragingly, a number of amino acids are prepared using the current protocol, and one-pot photocatalytic conversion of glucose to alanine is also achieved. This work offers an effective catalytic system for amino acid synthesis from biomass feedstocks under mild conditions.									47	1	0	0	6	0	47				2041-1723		WOS:000577262800010	32994420

Herein, we rationally designed a novel strategy to stabilize atomic Pt catalysts in alloyed platinum cobalt (PtCo) nanosheets with trapped interstitial fluorine (SA-PtCoF) for ZAB5. The trapped interstitial F atoms in the PtCoF matrix induce Lattice distortion resulting in weakening of the Pt-Co bond, which is the driving force to form atomic Pt. As a result, the onset potentials of SA-PtCoF are 0.95 V and 1.50 V for the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER), respectively, superior to commercial Pt/C@Ru02. When used in ZAB5, the designed SA-PtCoF can afford a peak power density of 125 mW cm(-2) with a specific capacity of 808 mA h gz,-1 and excellent cyclability over 240 h, surpassing the state-of-the-art catalysts.									52	2	0	0	3	0	52			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000524490200022

This paper presents a simple and economical method for the rational synthesis of Ni-MoS2 nanocomposites, maximizing the contact area and reducing the contact resistance between MoS2 and the nickel surface. In this way, it is possible to maximize the synergistic effect between both materials, obtaining a hybrid nanomaterial with high electroactivity toward the generation of hydrogen. A conventional nickel catalyst (NWts) was compared with the one obtained by dispersing a small amount of MoS2 (0.1425 mu g cm(-2)) over the surface denoted as NMS, and with the same type of catalyst after a 10 s electrodeposition of Ni (NMSN), to have a Ni-MoS2-Ni laminar structure. Thus, the NMSN catalyst shows a current density value of 59% higher than the observed value on the NMS catalyst and 113% higher than that found in the conventional NWts catalyst. Finally, these results were analyzed using DFT theoretical studies. DFT calculations predict a charge transfer between MoS2 and nearby Ni atoms, which becomes more important when a second Ni layer is placed on MoS2 explaining the increase in catalytic activity in the NMSN catalyst. Furthermore, the high hydrophobicity of the MoS2 plays an important role in the electrochemically active surface when comparing NMS and NMSN catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000693413400010

The process of PANI deposition is easier on the PS layers formed at n-Si wafers and essentially retarded at PS/p-Si samples, presumably due to a parallel reaction of oxygen evolution. The polymerization reaction starts at the pore bottoms and propagates towards the external surface of the PS layer. Electric conduction of PS/PANI composites is lower than of uncovered PS layers.

Although considerable advances have been achieved in their syntheses and electrochemical applications, further development and fundamental understanding are limited by a lack of strategies that can allow the quantitative analyses of their intrinsic catalytic characteristics, that is, active site density (SD) and turnover frequency (TOF). Here we show an in situ SD quantification method using a cyanide anion as a probe molecule. The decrease in cyanide concentration triggered by irreversible adsorption on metal-based active sites of a model Fe-N-C catalyst is precisely measured by spectrophotometry, and it is correlated to the relative decrease in electrocatalytic activity in the model reaction of oxygen reduction reaction. The linear correlation verifies the surface-sensitive and metal-specific adsorption of cyanide on Fe-N-x sites, based on which the values of SD and TOF can be determined. Notably, this analytical strategy shows versatile applicability to a series of transition/noble metal SACs and Pt nanoparticles in a broad pH range (1-13). The SD and TOF quantification can afford an improved understanding of the structure-activity relationship for a broad range of electrocatalysts, in particular, the SACs, for which no general electrochemical method to determine the intrinsic catalytic characteristics is available.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20				2691-3704		WOS:000656118100009	34467322

In this work, a model has been developed that considers diffusional limitations during microbial growth in solid or paste foods, and it was applied to predict Listeria innocua growth in a solid medium under oxygen restrictions. The kinetics of L innocua growing in a liquid broth under different oxygen concentrations were determined and results were incorporated to the model. Experiments to validate the model were conducted measuring the distribution and evolution of L. innocua growing in a solid K-carrageenan model food. Preferential growth on the surface was measured in the solid food, being changes inside the medium much more limited. A good concordance was obtained between the model simulations and the experimental results in the solid food. Some slight differences were nevertheless observed on the surface due to the effect of the different environment surrounding the cells. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It is of critical importance to develop low-cost yet efficient electrocatalysts to overcome the high activation barriers during water electrocatalysis. Among the various approaches of catalyst preparation, corrosion engineering that employs the autogenous corrosion reactions to achieve electrocatalysts has emerged as a burgeoning strategy over the past few years. Benefiting from the advantages of simple synthesis, effective regulation, easy scale-up production, and extremely low cost, corrosion engineering converts the harmful corrosion process into the useful catalyst preparation, achieving the goal of "transforming damage into benefit." Herein, the concept of corrosion engineering, fundamental reaction mechanisms, and affecting factors are firstly introduced. Then, recent progresses on corrosion engineering for fabricating electrocatalysts toward water splitting are summarized and discussed. Specific attentions are devoted to the formation mechanisms, catalytic performances, and structure-activity relations of these catalysts as well as the approaches employed for performance improvements. At last, the current challenges and future exploiting directions are proposed for achieving highly active and durable electrocatalysts. It is envisioned to shed light on the multidisciplinary corrosion engineering that is closely associated with corrosion and material science for energy and environmental applications.									27	1	0	0	2	0	27			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000600502100001

At first glance, the morphologically distinct features were not perceivable across TM dopants. However, the detailed XPS analysis confirmed that the WO3 NPs doped with Cr and Fe ions formed a relatively large number of surface defects. Moreover, we found through EXAFS analysis that the chromium and iron ions doping on WO3 NPs promoted the dramatic shortening of the W-O bond length as compared to pristine WO3 and other metal ion doped WO3 NPs. Much enhanced photocatalytic and electrocatalytic activities of Cr@WO3 and Fe@WO3, which relied on the different density of surface defects created by the charge and size of the TM dopants, were demonstrated in the photocatalytic degradation reactions of 4-chlorophenol and the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. The present result can serve as a practical guideline for atomically precise control of oxygen vacancy toward the development of high-performance metal oxide photocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000691195700006

However, the nitrogen doping in the carbon matrix usually involves a tedious chemical synthesis process with toxic compounds. So, the synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon from nitrogen-containing biomass with simpler carbonization methods would be advantageous. Herein, we report a facile synthesis of nitrogen-enriched porous activated carbon from mandarin peel biomass. The prepared carbon possesses uniform pore distribution, and a highly mesoporous and defective nature with enriched nitrogen and oxygen species over the carbon surface. The excellent ORR activity is confirmed by the rotating ring electrode (RDE) measurements. The onset potentials of ORR are 0.83, 0.81, and 0.87 Vvs.RHE and the half-wave potentials are 0.7, 0.71, and 0.75 Vvs.RHE for open-air-, KOH- and NaOH-treated samples, respectively. All the samples follow the conventional four-electron transfer process with good stability in an alkaline medium. We have observed a correlation between the onset potential and nitrogen content of carbon. Moreover, the kinetic current increases with an increase of specific surface area due to higher electrochemically active surface sites. The honeycomb-like morphology allows the electrolyte to penetrate through the porous network and enhance the ORR activity. This study reveals a trade-off between nitrogen content, porous texture, and surface-active sites.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000546037400016

An Adaptive Random Pore Model for Multimodal Pore Structure Evolution with Application to Char Gasification								ENERGY & FUELS				25	4			1423	1437		10.1021/ef101532u				APR 2011	2011	An extension of the random pore model has been developed that allows different pore sizes to grow at different rates, depending on the instantaneous pore-scale reactant penetration at a given location within a reacting porous particle. This is accomplished by incorporating pore scale effectiveness factors, consistent with the random pore geometry, into equations for the growth of each individual pore size. This framework allows the evolution of the char structure with local conversion to adapt to changes in boundary conditions (reactants, temperature) and the development of intraparticle gradients, rather than being, predetermined by the initial pore structure (i.e., by the value of the random pore model structural parameter, psi). This framework also facilitates the calculation of intrinsic kinetic parameters from experimental measurements by providing an estimation of the fraction of the total surface area participating in a given reaction. Without using any fitting parameters, the model has been found to satisfactorily reproduce some coal char oxidation experiments from the literature. The model has also been applied to two cases of practical interest for char particle gasification: zone II reaction conditions and reactants that change over the course of conversion. In these casts, the results of the adaptive random pore model differ from those predicted by the original random pore model.									34	0	0	0	1	0	34			0887-0624			WOS:000289697700010

Herein, a classic CaFe-layered double hydroxide (CaFe-LDH) stabilizer, which exhibits a super-stable mineralization efficiency for removing Ni2+ ions with a maximum saturated removal capacity of 321 mg g(-1) is prepared. This stabilizer can remove not only 10 000 mg L-1 Ni2+ ions to a few mg L-1, but also 1 mg L-1 Ni2+ ions to 2 mu g L-1. Moreover, the CaFe-LDH shows great mineralization capability for the real Ni-containing electroplating solution. It is demonstrated by ex situ X-ray diffraction and extended X-ray absorption fine structure characterization that the isomorphous substitution of Ca2+ by Ni2+ in the laminate of LDH dominates the mineralization process, and the CaFe-LDH is transformed to the corresponding NiCaFe-LDH accordingly. Further application of the resultant NiCaFe-LDH shows improved electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction and photocatalytic CO2 reduction activities. This work paves great way for Ni2+ ion removal from wastewater and utilization of the recycled Ni resource.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000708729100001

Thin titanium oxynitride (TiOxNy) coatings are deposited on a forest of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), directly grown on a stainless-steel mesh, by capacitively coupled radiofrequency plasma-assisted pulsed laser deposition (RF-PAPLD) in a N-2 environment. The resulting high-surface-area binder-free electrode is further coated with a low quantity of well-dispersed Pt nanoparticles (NPs) by PLD in an inert atmosphere. High-speed imaging of the laser-induced plasma expansion provided evidence of a higher kinetics of the expanding plume at higher RF plasma powers, changing the morphology of the TiOxNy coatings. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated that the coatings are homogeneous throughout their thickness, where the Ti-N, Ti-O-N, and Ti-O bonds exist in all samples. The oxygen content of the coating increases with the RF plasma power. Both TiOxNy/MWCNT and Pt/TiOxNy/MWCNT nanostructures are tested in a gas diffusion electrode setup to evaluate their activity in the ORR. The results showed the superior activity of the Pt/TiOxNy-0.03 Torr-30 W/MWCNT, reaching the highest current density of 180 mA cm(-2), while the commercial Pt/C electrode with the same Pt loading yielded 105 mA cm(-2) at the potential of 0.5 V.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2365-709X			WOS:000812289800001

Current catalysts have been limited by cost or toxicity and lack well-defined structures that can facilitate systematic tuning of activity and selectivity. Here, we demonstrate a series of CuCo2-xNixS4 (0 <= x <= 1.2) thiospinel catalysts for 2e(-) ORR with variable compositions that can be synthesized via hydrothermal conversion. Rotating ring disk electrode measurements show that these catalysts have high selectivity for 2e(-) ORR (>60%) and that their activity can be improved by increasing the nickel content without compromising selectivity. An acid treatment step is critical prior to employing the optimized CuCo0.8Ni1.2S4 catalyst for bulk electrosynthesis of H2O2 in 0.05 M H2SO4 solution. Various structural analyses, including synchrotron X-ray spectroscopy, confirm that the catalysts retain the spinel structure after acid treatment and H2O2 electrosynthesis. The acid treatment likely leaches the soluble copper species from the as-synthesized catalysts that would catalyze an electro-Fenton process to consume H2O2, generate hydroxyl radicals, and therefore prevent the accumulation of H2O2. This work demonstrates a general strategy for systematic tuning of metal compound catalysts for practical H2O2 electrosynthesis and facile generation of hydroxyl radicals.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000709692900020

Significant improvement of stability was observed for Mn2O3 covered n-TiO2, i.e., n-TiO2/Mn2O3, thin film electrodes. The Mn2O3, layer also enhanced the rate of oxygen evolution instead of H2O2 formation, due to its catalytic effect. The highest photoresponse was found with an n-TiO2 film prepared at 850 degrees C for 13 min by thermal oxidation. The bandgap energy of both n-TiO2 and n-TiO2/Mn2O3 films was found to be 2.85 eV. X-ray diffraction results indicate rutile structure for the n-TiO2 film. The flatband potential of the n-TiO2 film was found to be -1.13 V/saturated calomel electrode from the intercept of the Mott-Schottky plot. The highest potential-assisted photoconversion efficiencies, 5.1 and 4.1%, and the corresponding practical photoconversion efficiencies, 2.0 and 1.6%, were obtained for water splitting by the n-TiO2 and n-TiO2/Mn2O3 film electrodes, respectively.									57	1	0	0	2	0	57			0013-4651			WOS:000071382900022

Density function theory (DFT) revealed that oxygen vacancies in Bi5O7Br could form an intermediate level, which could allow electron transfer to a new intermediate level, and finally move to the conduction band. The Bi/Bi5O7Br-OV nanotubes demonstrate superior photocatalytic degradation of phenol, showing 3 times higher than that of pristine Bi5O7Br. The defects and Bi endow Bi5O7Br nanotubes with abundant active sites and improve the solar absorption. The increased and more dispersed charge density allow enhanced electronic conductivity and the separation of photogenerated carriers. Furthermore, more (OH)-O-center dot radicals are generated during photochemical reaction, which is beneficial in improving the photocatalytic performance. This work will play significant roles and create opportunities in modifying Bi-based materials for promoting photocatalysis.									47	2	0	0	6	0	47			2168-0485			WOS:000461978200021

This chapter summarizes the proposed chemical mechanisms for a wide variety of manganese-based enzymes that fulfill both nonredox and redox roles. We follow this minireview of manganese enzymes with specific examples drawn from our laboratory showing how small molecule coordination complexes can be prepared that mimic structural, spectroscopic, and reactivity properties of two redox-based manganese enzymes: the manganese catalase and the oxygen evolving complex. We describe two relatively simple systems composed of manganese dimers that catalyze H2O2 disproportionation using either low-valent (Mn(II)(2) --> Mn(III)(2)) or high-valent (Mn(III)(2) --> Mn(IV)(2)) cycles. From this work we illustrate how understanding the mechanism of well-defined model compounds may provide new mechanistic insight to more complex and ill-defined biological catalytic centers.

However, most chemical/electrochemical sensors fail to work in a combustion boiler, due to demanding operation temperatures (> 1000 degrees C). This work, for the first time, reports a well-functioning mixed-potential type CO sensor at 1000-1200 degrees C using nickel oxide (NiO) as the sensing material on the yttrium-stabilized zirconium (YSZ) oxide electrolyte. The influences of feed flow rate, electrode thickness, and porosity on the sensor behavior were investigated and the developed mixed potential gas sensor delivered notable and fast responses to 1000 ppm CO in 3% O-2: 109 mV @1000 degrees C, 40 mV @1100 degrees C, and 7 mV @1200 degrees C. The sensing mechanism was identified different from the common theory based on CO oxidation coupled with oxygen reduction. A new mechanism is attributed to the inverse reactions: CO reduction coupled with oxygen evolution. For the first time, an inversion temperature was found for the CO-NiO reaction. Below the inversion temperature, CO oxidation occurs as commonly presented. Above the inversion temperature, CO is electrochemically reduced over NiO into carbon and oxygen ions, evidenced by electrochemical and compositional characterizations. The results can complement CO sensing mechanisms for mixed potential sensors and further trigger more research efforts to expand the working temperature limit of mixed potential sensors for practical application in combustion control systems.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2522-0128	2522-0136		WOS:000790767500001

In this paper we first discuss the recent gains in NSTF alloy ORR activities from both materials and process improvements, followed by accelerated durability tests of MEA's with these catalyst improvements. Next we discuss recent progress in tailoring NSTF anode catalysts with ultra-low precious group metal oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts for high tolerance to automotive start up/shut down and cell reversal events. We follow with our progress in developing strategies and anode GDL's for optimized fuel cell water management for automotive low temperature operation.

A 3,6-net metal-organic framework (MOF) of [Ni-3(bpt)(2)(DMF)(2)(H2O)(2)]center dot 1.5DMF (Ni-MOF), based on linear [Ni-3(COO)(6)] as a node and [1,1'-biphenyl]-3,4',5-tricarboxylic acid (H(3)bpt) as a linker, was conveniently prepared via a hydrothermal reaction. Benefitting from the wide compatibility of the octahedral coordination geometry in Ni-MOF for different 3d metal ions, the molecular level and controllable metal doping facilitates the production of the desired Ni/ Fe bimetallic MOF. A high-concentration alkali solution of 1 M KOH induced the in situ transformation of the MOF as a precursor to new amorphous electrocatalysts of [ Ni(OH)(2)(H2O)(0.6)] center dot H2O [a-Ni(OH)(2)] and its metal-doped derivatives of aNi(0.77)Fe(0.23)(OH)(2) and a-Ni0.65Fe0.35(OH)(2). In particular, the costly organic ligand H(3)bpt was fully dissolved in the alkaline solution and can be recovered for cyclic utilization by subsequent acidification. The obtained amorphous hydroxide was deduced to be loose and defective layers containing both coordinated and lattice water based on combined characterizations of TG, IR, Raman, XPS, and sorption analysis. As opposed to the crystalline counterpart of Ni(OH)(2) with stacked packing layers and an absent lattice water, the abundant catalytic active sites of the amorphous electrocatalyst endow good performance in both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The bifunctional a-Ni0.65Fe0.35(OH)(2) coated on nickel foam realizes small overpotentials of 247 and 99 mV for OER and HER, respectively, under a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which can work with a cell voltage of merely 1.60 V for overall water splitting. This study provides an efficient strategy for widely screening and preparing new functional amorphous materials for electrocatalytic application.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000765784500036	35138829

Characterization of the catalyst by X-ray diffractometry and transmission electron microscopy confirms the formation of a single-phase, 3-dimensional, ordered mesoporous NiCO2O4 structure. The as-prepared OM NiCO204 exhibits a specific surface area of 95.5 m(2) g(-1) with mesoporous peaks between 3 and 5 nm. Linear scanning voltammetric measurements reveal that OM NiCo2O4 exhibits slightly higher catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction but much higher activity for the oxygen evolution reaction than Ketjen black (KB) carbon. The Li-O-2 battery utilizing OM NiCO2O4 shows a slightly higher discharge voltage plateau and a higher specific capacity of 4120 mAh g(-1) than that with pure KB, and the subsequent charge voltage is much lower than that with KB. Moreover, an enhanced cyclability of Li-O-2 battery with OM NiCO2O4 cathode is observed with a capacity retention ratio of 65.4% after 5 cycles. When restricting the discharge capacity at 1000 mAh g(-1), Li-O-2 battery with OM NiCO2O4 cathode shows an improved cyclability and the cut-off voltage is as high as 2.4V after 20 cycles, suggesting that OM NiCO2O4 could be as a promising catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries.

Here, we report a strategy of nitrogen (N) source-assisted pyrolysis of an oxygen-abundant MOF precursor (MOF-74) to give uniform, atomically-precise Fe sites, which consist of each Fe central atom coordinated simultaneously with two oxygen (O) atoms and two N atoms, and are anchored on N-doped carbon (thus denoted as Fe1N2O2/NC). By in situ synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we have monitored the evolution of coordination structures of Fe atoms (in terms of coordinating atoms and coordination number) along with the increasing pyrolysis temperature. The obtained electrocatalyst exhibits a high selectivity with the faradaic efficiency for CO above 95% over a wide potential range from -0.4 to -0.8 V (in particular, 99.7% at -0.5 V), and a robust durability. Theoretical simulations demonstrate that the ratio of the numbers of coordinating N and O around Fe is very important for regulating the catalytic activity and selectivity of CO2-to-CO conversion. Compared with mono-coordinated Fe sites, the N2O2-coordinated Fe sites have lower free energy change for the steps of COOH* formation and CO desorption, resulting in accelerated reaction kinetics and elevated catalytic activity. This work provides an efficient strategy to prepare well-defined single-atomic active sites via high-precision manipulation of coordinating atoms to boost the catalytic performances for the CO2RR.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000835943600001

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with a controllable coordination environment and exceptional atom utilization efficiency open new paradigms toward designing high-performance water oxidation catalysts. Here, using operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements with calculations of spectra and electrochemical activity, we demonstrate that the origin of water oxidation activity of IrNiFe SACs is the presence of highly oxidized Ir single atom (Ir5.3+) in the NiFe oxyhydroxide under operating conditions. We show that the optimal water oxidation catalyst could be achieved by systematically increasing the oxidation state and modulating the coordination environment of the Ir active sites anchored atop the NiFe oxyhydroxide layers. Based on the proposed mechanism, we have successfully anchored Ir single-atom sites on NiFe oxyhydroxides (Ir0.1/Ni9Fe SAC) via a unique in situ cryogenic-photochemical reduction method that delivers an overpotential of 183 mV at 10 mA center dot cm-2 and retains its performance following 100 h of operation in 1 M KOH electrolyte, outperforming the reported catalysts and the commercial IrO2 catalysts. These findings open the avenue toward an atomic-level understanding of the oxygen evolution of catalytic centers under in operando conditions.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			0027-8424			WOS:000705126700008	34465618

In search for novel catalyst materials, we present in this study density functional theory-based screening of heteroatom-doped transition metal nitrides. We first examine zinc blend and rock salt polymorphs of transition metal nitrides and then consider doping the surface with 25% B, P, Sb, Bi, and C heteroatoms. We fully assess the stability and activity of the examined catalysts. The catalytic activity is measured by the calculated limiting potential, and the stability is assessed against hydroxyl (*OH) poisoning as well as dissolution under CO reduction relevant potentials. Of the screened nitrides, many are predicted to be active for the CO reduction reaction but only a few are stable under electrochemical conditions. In particular, on nearly all of the metal nitrides with a desired catalytic activity for CO reduction, either the competing hydrogen evolution reaction prevails over CO reduction or *OH poisoning occurs at CO reduction onset potentials. We identify five promising candidates including P-doped NbN, C-doped VN, P-doped VN, TiN, and Sb-doped TiN. Ultimately, this study emphasizes the relevance of stability under electrochemical conditions and the importance of taking into account the competition between the CO reduction, hydrogen evolution, and *OH reduction reactions under electrochemical conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000598118800028

The composite films have been characterized by SEM, EDAX, cyclic voltammetry, impedance and Tafel polarization techniques. The studies show that the composite electrodes are greatly active for the ORR than the non-composite one. The higher Sr substitutions (>0.2 mol) have an adverse effect on the electrocatalytic activity. The rate for the ORR at the composite film has been found to decrease with decreasing pH of the electrolyte. Among all the four composite electrodes studied, the G/PPy/PPy(La0.8Sr0.2CoO3)/PPy electrode in 0.5 mol dm(-3) K2SO4 plus 5 m moldm(-3) KOH at 25 degrees C exhibits the highest electrocatalytic activity towards the ORR.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0376-4710	0975-0975		WOS:000251845700003

The efficiency of cobalt electrodeposition on graphite substrate is largely affected by two concurrent cathodic processes: the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The contribution of the currents, originated from the ORR and the HER to the overall recorded cathodic current, hampers the fitting of current transient data of cobalt electrodeposition by Scharifker and Mostany model and the determination of the nucleation mechanism. The recent model proposed by Altimari attempted to deconvolute the observed cathodic current of cobalt electrodeposition into its major components. This study applied the mathematical model of Altimari to the Co electrodeposition from 0.05 M CoCl2 solution without and with 0.05 M sodium citrate. The main purpose of this application is to exclude the contribution of HER current from the total cathodic current. Consequently, the extracted component of the deposition current (I-D) fits nicely the Scharifker model for the instantaneous nucleation mechanism of cobalt in the presence of citrate ions. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the cobalt deposition in absence of citrate is initiated by larger contribution of the progressive nucleation mechanism.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000678482700001

We took the view that the photoinduction of transition states was critical for improving the activity of catalytic reactions. On the basis of theoretical predictions, the reaction Gibbs free energy of permonosulfate (PMS) activation can be rapidly reduced by molybdenum with low valence. We therefore constructed a multiphasic molybdenum dichalcogenide(MoS2) heterostructure-based photosystem that enabled generation of Mo transition states by visible light excitation. According to combination results of electron paramagnetic resonance, photoelectrochemical analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we confirmed that the optimized 2H/1T heterojunction permitted the transport of excited interfacial electrons from the semiconductive 2H phase to the metallic IT phase, and synchronously partially reduced Mo(IV) to Mo(III) at the interface. This intensified the charge transfer between the MoS2 and PMS-containing solution, thereby efficiently splitting the PMS molecules into (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- radicals. In this system, a type of refractory herbicide, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), can be degraded within 60 min at a rate constant of 6.20 x 10(-2) min(-1) using multiphasic MoS2 with a 1T/2H ratio of 1:1.									39	2	0	0	17	0	40			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000479020300022	31274282

Hydrogen was produced by adding sodium dithionite as an oxygen scavenger directly to an algal suspension. When a part of the wall of the bubble column was shaded with a sheet of plastic film impervious to light, the production rate and total volume of hydrogen increased as compared to those in the columns without partial shading. This relationship between the hydrogen photoevolution rate and the proportion of lighted region is contrary to normal photochemical reactions. This phenomenon is considered to be related to the regulation by light of the activity of the enzymes and/or the photosynthetic electron transport systems, which was examined by measuring fluorescence induction curves of dark-adapted Chlorella cells and also the distribution of light intensity within the bubble column bioreactors.									17	0	0	0	7	0	18			1389-1723			WOS:000222580200006	16233636	
J	Zhang, Tingting; He, Chuansheng; Li, Linbo; Lin, Yuqing								Preparation of nitrogen-doped carbon nanoblocks with high electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline solution								CHINESE JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				37	8			1275	1282		10.1016/s1872-2067(15)61123-8				AUG 2016	2016	The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is traditionally performed using noble-metals catalysts, e.g. Pt. However, these metal-based catalysts have the drawbacks of high costs, low selectivity, poor stabilities, and detrimental environmental effects. Here, we describe metal-free nitrogen-doped carbon nanoblocks (NCNBs) with high nitrogen contents (4.11%), which have good electrocatalytic properties for ORRs. This material was fabricated using a scalable, one-step process involving the pyrolysis of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) at 800 degrees C. Rotating ring disk electrode measurements show that the NCNBs give a high electrocatalytic performance and have good stability in ORRs. The onset potential of the catalyst for the ORR is -0.05 V (vs Ag/AgCl), the ORR reduction peak potential is -0.20 V (vs Ag/AgCl), and the electron transfer number is 3.4. The NCNBs showed pronounced electrocatalytic activity, improved long-term stability, and better tolerance of the methanol crossover effect compared with a commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. The composition and structure of, and nitrogen species in, the NCNBs were investigated using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The pyrolysis of Tris at high temperature increases the number of active nitrogen sites, especially pyridinic nitrogen, which creates a net positive charge on adjacent carbon atoms, and the high positive charge promotes oxygen adsorption and reduction. The results show that NCNBs prepared by pyrolysis of Tris as nitrogen and carbon sources are a promising ORR catalyst for fuel cells.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of oxygen and/or MnO2 on the production of HLAs. Herein, abiotic humification performance of the digestate dissolved organic matter (DOM) is investigated with fluxes of air and N-2 in the absence and presence of MnO2. Our results demonstrated that the fate of digestate DOM greatly depends on the oxidizing environment, the MnO2 enhanced nitrogen involved in the formation of HLAs. The synergistic effects of MnO2 and oxygen effectively improved the production of HLAs, and the corresponding component evolution was analyzed using spectroscopic evidence. The two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy results demonstrated that the reaction sequence of digestate DOM followed the order of protein-like substances, substances with an absorbance at 325 nm, substances with UV absorbance at 254 nm and HLAs. Additionally, excitation emission matrix fluorescence combined with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) showed that tryptophan-like C3 was more prone to transformation than tyrosine-like C2 and was responsible for the humification process. The substance with an absorbance at 325 nm was a reaction intermediate in the transformation process of protein-like substances to HLAs. The above findings can be used to promote the production of liquid fertilizer associated with carbon sequestration as well as the sustainable development of biogas production.

It is shown that the codeposition of Ni and Fe is accompanied by an acceleration of the discharge of iron(II) ions (a more electronegative component). A "normal" codeposition behavior is observed in a solution without extra water, whereas an "anomalous" codeposition occurs in a deep eutectic solvent with added water (preferential deposition of iron as a less noble component). The addition of ascorbic acid to the plating solution based on a deep eutectic solvent not only prevents the oxidation of iron(II) ions by atmospheric oxygen but also inhibits the partial reaction of nickel electrodeposition. The iron content in the coating increases both with an increase in the contents of Fe(II) ions and water in the plating bath and with an increase in the cathodic current density. The deep eutectic solvent-based solution allows fabricating uniform nanocrystalline deposits of a nickel-iron alloy with an iron content of up to 10-15 wt.%. The electrocatalytic properties of Ni, Fe, and Ni-Fe coatings are evaluated with respect to the hydrogen evolution reaction in an alkaline medium. It is shown that even at a low iron content in the alloy (similar to 2-7 wt.%), a significant increase in electrocatalytic activity is observed (an increase in the exchange current density).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000756398500001

JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY				85	10			6675	6686		10.1021/acs.joc.0c00697				MAY 15 2020	2020	The Wittig reaction between triphenylphosphine methylide and benzaldehyde has been studied both from conceptual and computational approaches. The supernucleophilic character of ylide accounts for the feasibility of the initial nucleophilic attack The nature of bonding driving the formation of the first oxaphosphetane (OPA) intermediate in such a domino reaction is examined within a topological-based bonding evolution theory perspective. The sequence of the electronic flow associated to the changes in electron density supports a rationalization via two main electronic stages characterizing the single kinetic step: first, the C-C bond formation, which takes place via donation of electron density of the ylide carbon to the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde at a C-C distance of 2.02 angstrom, is formally associated to the transition state region; then, the P-O bond formation via the donation of electron density of the nonbonding region of the carbonyl oxygen to phosphorus at a P-O distance of 2.06 angstrom is located at the end of the reaction path. The detailed picture of bonding patterns suggests that the OPA formation in the Wittig mechanism can be better understood in terms of a two-stage one-step mechanism beyond molecular orbital considerations behind the traditionally accepted [2+2] cycloaddition proposal.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			0022-3263	1520-6904		WOS:000535303300039	32293888

This cage consists of four trimeric units [In-3(mu(3)-OH)(mu(2)-CO)(3 )(mu(2)-HCO2)(3)]and four [tcma](2-) ligands, which all perform as 3-connection nodes to bridge each other, resulting in a tetrahedral cage structure. The trimeric unit [In-3(mu(3)-OH)(mu(2)-CO2)(3)(mu(2)-HCO2)(3)] is observed for the first time in the family of In-based metal-organic structures and can be considered as an evolution of a 6-connected [In-3(mu(3)-O)(mu(2)-CO2)(6)] unit. Each In3+ is terminally coordinated by a mu(1)-HCO2 group. This cage contains potential Lewis acidic/basic active sites endowed by In3+ ions as Lewis acidic sites and the uncoordinated oxygen atoms of mu(1)-HCO2 moieties as Lewis basic sites and was explored as an effective heterogeneous catalyst in the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides and the Strecker reaction for amino nitriles. These catalytic reactions were deduced to happen on the surface of the In-12-GL cage.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000511246600010	31965792

Herein A-site Ba-deficient double perovskite PrBa0.94Co2O5+delta(PB0.94C) is used as a precursor for fabricating PB0.94C-based double/simple perovskite heterostructure (PB0.94C-DSPH). PB0.94C-DSPH with enhanced electrochemical surface area, more hydrophilic surface, and high conductivity ensures abundant active sites, rapid release of gas, and efficient charge transfer at high current densities. The resultant PB0.94C-DSPH delivers the overpotential of 364 mV at a current density of 500 mA cm(-2)for hydrogen evolution reaction in 1.0mKOH solution, along with excellent long-term durability. Promisingly, the electrolyzer with PB0.94C-DSPH cathode and NiFe-layered double hydroxide anode demonstrates high performance for overall water splitting by yielding high current density of 500 mA cm(-2)at 1.93 V. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the double/simple perovskite heterostructure promotes the water adsorption, the dissociation of molecular H2O, and the OH*desorption considerably, which controls the whole hydrogen evolution process. The proposed PB0.94C-DSPH solves the problem of low hydrogen-evolution efficiency at high current density faced by noble metal-based catalysts in basic environment. This study may provide a route to explore high-demand elements in the earth for addressing the critical catalysts in clean-energy utilizations.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17			2366-9608			WOS:000575958300001	34927891

However, little is known about the kinetics of the HCN polymerization process. In the present study, a first approach to the kinetics of two sets of aqueous HCN polymerizations, from NH4CN and NaCN, at middle temperatures between 4 and 38 degrees C, has been carried out. For each series, the presence of air and salts in the reaction medium has been systematically explored. A previous kinetic analysis was conducted during the conversion of the insoluble black HCN polymers obtained as gel fractions in these precipitation polymerizations for a reaction of one month, where a limit conversion was achieved at the highest polymerization temperature. The kinetic description of the gravimetric data for this complex system shows a clear change in the linear dependence with the polymerization temperature for the reaction from NH4CN, besides a relevant catalytic effect of ammonium, in comparison with those data obtained from the NaCN series. These results also demonstrated the notable influence of air, oxygen, and the saline medium in HCN polymer formation. Similar conclusions were reached when the sol fractions were monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy,. and a Hill type correlation was used to describe the polymerization profiles obtained. This technique was chosen because it provides an easy, prompt and fast method to follow the evolution of the liquid or continuous phase of the process under study. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a method of postsynthesis of MXenes in boron, nitrogen codoped CNTs (BNCNTs) is reported with their electrocatalytical hydrogen evolution performance. The encapsulation of hexagonal molybdenum nitrate nanoparticles (h-MoN NPs) into BNCNTs protects h-MoN NPs from agglomeration and poisoning in the complex environment. In principle, the synergism of B and N dopants on the doped CNTs and confined h-MoN NPs produces extremely active sites for electrochemical hydrogen evolution. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the active sites for hydrogen evolution originate from the synergistic effect of h-MoN(001)/CN (graphitic N doping) and h-MoN(001)/BNC. The h-MoN@BNCNT electrocatalyst exhibits a small overpotential of 78 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 46 mV per decade, which are dramatically improved over all reported MoN-based materials and doped CNTs. Additionally, it also exhibits outstanding electrochemical stability in environments with various pH values and seawater media from South China Sea.									53	3	0	0	2	0	55			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000459826500004

Electro-catalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) shows a promising possibility for converting dinitrogen to ammonia under mild conditions, which is expected to replace the harsh Haber-Bosch process. However, the industrial application of NRR is limited by the low yield and unsatisfactory Faradaic efficiency derived from the poor catalytic activity. Herein, the research progress of reaction principles and possible mechanisms of NRR are summarized, followed by the introduction of conventional ammonia detection methods so as to point out the instructive research directions. Then, the recent advances of different metal-based materials including noble metal and non-noble transition metal-based electrocatalysts for NRR are presented with the corresponding prevailing theoretic calculation results. Additionally, the rational design strategies of various metal-based electrocatalysts are discussed according to the increasing adsorption of N-2, and decreasing activation energy of N-2 reduction reaction, as well as the suppressed hydrogen evolution reaction aiming at enhancing the electrocatalytic performance and Faradaic efficiency. Lastly, the current challenges and future prospects are proposed to shed light on the realization of industrialization. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The photocatalytic generation of H2O2 is achieved by using a semiconductor photocatalyst in the presence of alcohol as a proton source. Herein, we have synthesized oxygen vacancy (Ov)-mediated TiO2/B-doped g-C3N4/rGO (TBCN@rGO) ternary heterostructures by a simple hydrothermal technique. Several characterization techniques were employed to explore the existence of oxygen vacancies in the crystal structure and investigate their impact on the optoelectronic properties of the catalyst. Oxygen vacancies offered additional sites for adsorbing molecular oxygen, activating alcohols, and facilitating electron migration from TBCN@rGO to the surface-adsorbed O-2. The defect creation (oxygen vacancy) and Z-scheme mechanistic pathways create a suitable platform for generating H2O2 by two-electron reduction processes. The optimized catalyst showed the highest photocatalytic H2O2 evolution rate of 172 mu mol/h, which is 1.9 and 2.5 times greater than that of TBCN and BCN, respectively. The photocatalytic oxidation of various lignocellulose-derived alcohols (such as furfural alcohol and vanillyl alcohol) and benzyl alcohol was also achieved. Photocatalytic activity data, physicochemical and optoelectronic features, and trapping experiments were conducted to elucidate the structureactivity relationships. The TBCN@rGO acts as a multifunctional Z-scheme photocatalyst having an oxygen vacancy, modulates surface acidity-basicity required for the adsorption and activation of the reactant molecules, and displays excellent photocatalytic performance due to the formation of a large number of active surface sites, increased electrical conductivity, improved charge transfer properties, outstanding photostability, and reusability. The present study establishes a unique strategy for improving H2O2 generation and alcohol oxidation activity and also provides insights into the significance of a surface vacancy in the semiconductor photocatalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000835545100001	35913785

Being born with masses similar to 1.1 M-aS (TM), hybrid WDs in a binary system may easily approach the Chandrasekhar mass (M-Ch) by accretion and give rise to a thermonuclear explosion. Here, we investigate an off-centre deflagration in a near-M-Ch hybrid WD under the assumption that nuclear burning only occurs in carbon-rich material. Performing hydrodynamics simulations of the explosion and detailed nucleosynthesis post-processing calculations, we find that only 0.014 M-aS (TM) of material is ejected while the remainder of the mass stays bound. The ejecta consist predominantly of iron-group elements, O, C, Si and S. We also calculate synthetic observables for our model and find reasonable agreement with the faint Type Iax SN 2008ha. This shows for the first time that deflagrations in near-M-Ch WDs can in principle explain the observed diversity of Type Iax supernovae. Leaving behind a near-M-Ch bound remnant opens the possibility for recurrent explosions or a subsequent accretion-induced collapse in faint Type Iax SNe, if further accretion episodes occur. From binary population synthesis calculations, we find the rate of hybrid WDs approaching M-Ch to be of the order of 1 per cent of the Galactic SN Ia rate.									79	0	0	0	1	0	79			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000356339300059		
B	Li Qian								The Study of Semiconductor Heterostructures for Photocatalysis and Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting								The Study of Semiconductor Heterostructures for Photocatalysis and Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting								179 pp	179 pp						2015	2015	Activated carbon, graphene, carbon nanotubes and fullerene were incorporated into TiO2 to produce carbon-based TiO2 hybrid nanostructures by a solvothermal approach and thermal annealing. The superiority in photocatalytic activities of this carbon-based TiO2 samples on the RhB molecules orignated from the excellent adsorption property, favourable chemical bond formation (Ti-O-C), narrower bandgap, smaller particle size and effective charge carriers separation of the nanocomposites. In a related work, ultra-small Ag nanocrystallites-decorated TiO2 hollow sphere heterostructures were prepared which showed excellent photodegradation performance for RhB. In this metal-semiconductor heterostructures, the Ag nanocrystallites with high crystallinity reduced the recombination rate of charge carriers and favoured the charge transfer across the interfaces. The increased adsorbed surface oxygen, upward shift of Fermi level and increased electron density due to coupling of Ag had contributed to the charge transfer and improvement of quantum efficiency. Furthermore to the study of photocatalytic composites, porous graphitic carbon nitride was synthesized by the controllable thermal polymerization of urea in air. The textural, electrical and optical properties of the samples were tuned by varying the heating rate. In a related work, MoS2 nanosheets were coupled into the carbon nitride to form MoS2/C3N4 heterostructures samples whose kinetic rate was 3.6 times faster than that of bare carbon nitride. As analyzed by SEM, TEM, UV-Vis absorption, PL and photoelectrochemical measurements, the intimate contact interface, extended light response range, enhanced separation speed of charge carriers and the high photocurrent density upon MoS2 coupling were the major factors to the photocatalytic promotion while using MoS2/C3N4 heterostructures. This thesis also reported the fabrication of Ni(OH)2/Ti-Fe2O 3 photoanode by a two-step hydrothermal method for the use in water splitting. It was found that Ti doping had promoted the photovoltage of hematite by surface modification rather than increasing the donor density, while the loading of Ni(OH)2 had further improved the photoelectrochemical performance of Ti-Fe2O3 by reducing both the over-potential of oxygen evolution reaction and the recombination rate of the charge carriers. Another than the Ni(OH)2 loading, the water splitting performance of hematite could also be improved via surface engineering by using CTAB. It was found that the CTAB-Fe2O3 had promoted the photocurrent of pristine hematite by two times at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The increase in carrier's density and resultant stronger band bending from Br| surface engineering had favored the charge carrier's transport. The negative electric field established on the surface of hematite by the Br| layer had speeded up the interfacial charge transfer and oxygen evolution kinetics. Thus, the improved charge carriers transport and interfacial transfer contributed to the overall enhanced water splitting performance. The promotional mechanism of bromine ion surface engineering was explored by electrochemical impedance spectra and was explained in this work.									0	0	0		0	0	0					978-13-395-1930-2	INSPEC:16207535

Herein, a group of hybrid electrocatalysts is synthesized through a facile one-step treatment of perovskite oxide, D-glucosamine hydrochloride and melamine. The high-performance catalyst comprises a unique hybrid architecture, including the mixed oxide substrate derived from perovskite oxide, the in-situ exsolved NiCo nanoalloys, and the nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) grown from the aforementioned nanoalloy particles. The dispersed NiCo nanoalloy serves as a liaison for efficient charge transfer between metal oxides and NCNT, and thus manages to unlock the high intrinsic activity of the metal oxide-based materials. The hybrid catalyst delivers a promising ORR activity, durability and methanol poisoning tolerance comparable to the expensive benchmark Pt/C catalyst. The zinc-air battery using the hybrid catalyst demonstrates a high open circuit voltage of 1.57 V with a maximum power density of 115 mW cm(-2).									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000510526000019

Accordingly, a novel three-dimensional hierarchically porous PbO2 electrode with polypyrrole (PPy) as middle layer (marked as Ti/SnO2-Sb/PPy/PbO2) was developed for the first time. The physicochemical characterization results showed more intact and ordered "pyramid" structures were formed when the PPy was introduced to be the middle layer of PbO2 electrode. Additionally, the crystallinity of PbO2 and the proportion of adsorbed hydroxyl oxygen were all increased significantly. The electrochemical characterization results showed the active surface area and oxygen evolution overpotential of PbO2 electrode were also improved with PPy middle layer as middle layer. Besides, the electrode film resistance was reduced greatly. Also the PbO2 electrode with PPy middle layer possessed higher degradation ability of m-cresol and lower energy consumption. Above results indicated the physicochemical and electrochemical characterization of PbO2 electrode were all enhanced significantly with the introduction of PPy middle layer. Also the phenomenon that current-controlled reaction would transformed into diffusion-controlled reaction in the process of electrochemical degradation was observed. The effects of experimental parameters on electrochemical degradation were evaluated, indicating lower initial m-cresol concentration, higher current density, temperature and pH were beneficial for electrochemical degradation of in-cresol. Additionally, a possible degradation pathway of m-cresol was proposed. Finally, the continuous experiments of m-cresol degradation indicated the Ti/SnO2-Sb/PPy/PbO2 electrode possessed stable degradation ability and high safety within 30 days.

"Mystery molecule" heptazine is an intriguing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) building block. By covalently linking with the electron-rich alkynyl and phenyl oxygen evolution reaction (OER) active units, 10 experimentally feasible 2D covalent heptazine-based frameworks (CHFs) are constructed and screened four promising visible-light-driven OWS photocatalysts, which are linked by p-phenyl (CHF-4), p-phenylenediynyl (CHF-7), m-phenylenediynyl (CHF-8), and phenyltriynyl (CHF-9), respectively. Their HER and OER active sites achieve completely spatially separated, where HER active sites focus on heptazine units and OER active sites located on alkynyl or phenyl units. Their lower overpotentials allow them to spontaneously trigger the surface OWS reaction under their own light-induced bias without using any sacrificial agents and cocatalysts. Among them, CHF-7 shows the best photocatalytic performance with an ideal STH energy conversion efficiency estimated at 12.04%, indicating that it is a promising photocatalyst for industrial OWS. This work not only provides an innovative idea for the exploration of novel polymer photocatalysts for OWS but also supplies a direction for the development of heptazine derivatives.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2198-3844		WOS:000838272000001	35948503

These titanium sources also contain Al, Ca and O as the main impurities. In the present work, three different titanium sources, namely, pure Ti and two commercially produced Ti alloys i.e. FeTi70 and FeTi35 are studied. The Ti or FeTi was brought in contact with the liquid iron using the suction method, for a predetermined time and quenched. The reaction zone between the liquid Fe and the titanium source was subjected to microstructural investigation. The high Ti concentration region obtained in a pure Ti-Fe reaction couple, the inclusion formation in liquid iron after coming in contact with Fe Ti70 and the evolution of existing inclusions in FeTi35 after coming in contact with liquid iron have been studied. The present study has helped in understanding the influence of impurities from the Ti source on the dissolution behavior and the inclusion formation. On the basis of this study, it can be concluded that the Ti rich regions formed after the introduction of pure Ti could modify the existing alumina inclusions in liquid steel, the impurities in FeTi70 contribute to the inclusion formation depending upon the availability of O while FeTi35 introduces inclusions to the liquid steel.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0915-1559			WOS:000318059900012

Herein, we demonstrate a novel and simple strategy for the synthesis of (Fe, Co, Ni)(9)S-8 nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen and sulfur co-doped interconnected carbon nanofibers network ((Fe, Co, Ni)(9)S-8/NSCFs) derived from fish bone as an efficient bifunctional catalyst. The (Fe, Co, Ni)(9)S-8/NSCFs shows large specific surface area (750 m(2) g(-1)), well-defined interconnected nanofibers network structure with high conductivity, synergistic chemical coupling effects between (Fe, Co, Ni)(9)S-8 and NSCFs with doped heteroatoms of N and S. As expected, in alkaline medium, excellent catalytic activity and outstanding durability toward both ORR and OER are obtained. Moreover, the homemade all-solid-state ZAB based on (Fe, Co, Ni)(9)S-8/NSCFs displays outstanding battery capacity and power density together with excellent durability and flexibility. As an additional advance, a digital display screen powered by (Fe, Co, Ni)(9)S-8/NSCFs-based rechargeable ZAB works steadily at twisted, extruded, combusting, and punctured states, making our bifunctional electrocatalysts attractive for wearable energy storage applications.

Temperature measurements within the reactor were obtained as a function of time as well as the evolution of the fuel bed. The products of combustion were cooled down, and usable liquid fuel was recovered and measured. The reaction was found to become unstable for fuel concentrations lower than 50%. The results show that the airflow and tire concentration define different modes of combustion while the reaction remains oxygen limited. Oil production is maximized when an increase in airflow leads to a transition from a rate-limited reaction to a heat transfer-limited propagation. Variation of the tire concentration shows the importance of the inert in achieving high conversion rates. (c) 2004 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

A promising catalyst could be a carbonaceous material containing transition metal ions coordinated by nitrogen and embedded in the carbon surface (metal-N-C site) as the catalytically active site, although sufficient activity and stability in such materials have not yet been attained. In this study, a systematic investigation of the effects of nanostructures on bifunctional catalytic activity was carried out to gain insight into the activity enhancement. A series of graphitic carbon materials with various concave and convex nanostructures were used as a substrate, which is advantageous for forming stable catalysts. The graphitic carbon surface was covered with a carbonaceous thin film containing the Fe-N-C site, which was prepared by iron phthalocyanine sublimation, deposition on the substrate, and decomposition. Distinct dependence of the ORR and OER activities on the nanostructures was observed. The dependence was explained by the surface Fe concentration and specific surface area, and the correlation between the OER and the concave structure was also suggested. The charge-discharge and cycling performances of a zinc-air battery with an air electrode prepared from the Fe-N-C-decorated graphitic carbon material were also tested to confirm the bifunctionality. Our study provides a useful guideline for developing active and stable bifunctional catalysts from the viewpoint of the catalyst nanostructure.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000753913400001

To address the often-insufficient catalytic activity of single M/MO-embedded N-C systems, researchers have introduced a second M/MO, usually via wet processes. In this work, we leverage the unique capability of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to enable the introduction of a trace amount of ceria throughout a Co/CoOx-embedded N-doped carbon nanostructure in a highly uniform and dispersed manner to maximize heterogeneous interfacial areas and thus catalytically active sites. An optimally prepared catalyst achieves an ORR onset potential of 0.95 V (0.1 M KOH) and an OER potential of 1.53 V at 10 mA cm(-2) (1 M KOH) and exhibits excellent cyclic durability. Quasi-operando observations reveal the multifaceted roles of the tiny amount of introduced ceria in facilitating electrocatalytic activity and enhancing durability. The ceria activates reactant adsorbates and transfers the activated intermediates to neighboring CoOx and electronically couples with Co and N species for enhanced catalytic activity. A high concentration of trivalent Ce state is readily and continuously restored during ORR/OER for an uninterrupted activation of reactants, also contributing to a highly stable reaction.

However, their capacity fade presents a major challenge. Partial fluorine (F) substitution into the oxygen (O) lattice appears to be an effective strategy for improving the cycling stability, but the underlying atomistic mechanism remains elusive. Here, using a combination of advanced transmission electron microscopy based imaging and spectroscopy techniques, the structural and chemical evolution upon cycling of Mn-based DRX cathodes with an increasing F content (Li-Mn-Nb-O-F-x, x = 0, 0.05, 0.2) are probed. The atomic origin behind the beneficial effect of high-level fluorination for enhancing the surface stability of the DRX is revealed. It is discovered that, due to the reduced O redox activity while with increasing F concentration, F in the DRX lattice mitigates the formation of an O-deficient surface layer upon cycling. For low F-substituted DRX, the O loss near the surface results in the formation of an amorphous cathode-electrolyte interphase layer and nanoscale voids after extended cycling. Increased F concentration in the DRX lattice minimizes both O loss and the interfacial reactions between DRX and the liquid electrolyte, enhancing the surface stability of DRX. These results provide guidance on the development of next-generation cathode materials through anion substitution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000752410900001	34910330	
J	Chen, Jiuquan; Ji, Lingfeng; Song, Jinwei								Study of Crevice Corrosion Behavior and Cathodic Protection of Carbon Steel Reinforcement in Concrete								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE				17	1					220140	10.20964/2022.01.01				JAN 2022	2022	Chloride ion ingress is one of the critical factors causing concrete failure in structures. Cathodic protection is widely used in concrete for corrosion protection as it promotes interface alkalization and removes chloride ions. However, some positions are in an over-protected state due to cracks in concrete, especially at the concrete-reinforcement interface. Therefore, based on immersion and electrochemical experiments, this paper evaluates the optimal cathodic protection potential of reinforcement under different temperatures through corrosion rate, morphology, and electrochemical parameters, and the electrochemical characteristics of the metal at the opening under the condition of optimal cathodic protection potential. The results showed that with the increase of cathodic protection level, HRB335 steel exhibited a general corrosion state at 20 degrees C. However, the corrosion state changed from pitting to comprehensive corrosion at 50C and 80 degrees C, and the oxygen diffusion process controlled the optimal cathodic protection potential. Considering the corrosion rate, morphology, and electrochemical reaction control process, the optimal cathodic protection potential was -1.0 V and -1.1 V at 50 degrees C and 80 degrees C, respectively. Meanwhile, when the HRB335 steel in the deepest crevice reached the optimal cathodic protection potential, the metal in the opening may be in an over-protected state, and a hydrogen evolution reaction occurred. The higher the temperature, the higher was the metal potential and the more pronounced was the hydrogen evolution reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1452-3981			WOS:000743605300016

In this work, a porous O-doped g-C3N4 (P-CNO) nanosheet with a highly ordered architecture is fabricated by introducing a novel hydrothermal treatment to the precursor before the final thermal condensation. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate (HER) and HER per surface area of P-CNO are 13.9 and 1.7 times higher than that of bulk g-C3N4. The improved photocatalytic activity is ascribed to a synergistic effect of O doping, a porous sheet-like morphology, and increased crystallinity. This work also provides a new approach for the synthesis of other polymer-based photocatalysts with high crystallinity and excellent performance.									71	5	0	0	9	0	73			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000425730600007	29285895

On the basis of that, the self-supporting 3D noble-metal-free bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts were also discussed. Finally, the perspectives for the bifunctional electrocatalysts were discussed.

A disadvantage of some common semiconductors that possess desirable optical bandgaps is their chemical instability under the conditions needed for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, we demonstrate the dual benefits gained from using a cobalt metal thin-film as the precursor for the preparation of cobalt-phosphate (CoPi) OER catalyst on cadmium chalcogenide photoanodes. The cobalt layer protects the underlying semiconductor from oxidation and degradation while forming the catalyst and simultaneously facilitates the advantageous incorporation of the cadmium chalcogenide layer into the CoPi layer during continued processing of the electrode. The resulting hybrid material forms a stable photoactive anode for light-assisted water splitting.									19	2	0	0	4	0	20			1944-8244			WOS:000317549100012	23521596

Diffusional limitations on the various reactions were accounted for through effectiveness factors, averaged over the operating conditions and calculated from a number of off line pellet simulations. The evolution of the coke content of the catalyst with time was included in the simulation so as to check whether or not a steady state reactor operation was possible. The influence of the feed composition (addition of steam and carbon dioxide) and the operating conditions on the coke content was also investigated. For constant methane flow rate and constant total pressure the partial pressure of oxygen decreases when steam is added. This leads to a higher coke content of the catalyst, while coke deposition occurs in a larger area of the reactor, since oxygen is a stronger oxidant than steam.					9th International Symposium on Large Chemical Plants9th International Symposium on Large Chemical Plants	OCT 06-08, 1995OCT 06-08, 1995		ANTWERP, BELGIUMANTWERP, BELGIUM	17	1	0	0	1	0	17			0920-5861			WOS:A1997XU32000011

Upon attachment of sub-microsamples to graphite electrodes in contact with aqueous H2SO4 electrolyte, voltammetric features due to the reduction of Fe(III) minerals and the oxidation of Fe(II) ones, complemented with electrocatalytic effects on oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions, provide characteristic electrochemical fingerprints for pottery samples. A consistent sample grouping discriminating between different potteries from different archaelogical sites, is obtained, all results being consistent with morphological, compositional and mineralogical data. Petrographic analysis supports the grouping, defining the manufacture and firing procedure for the different archaeological context.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000489643800001

Annealing and electrochemical treatments generated a roughened surface, as demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the larger geometric area of which increases current densities. Combining these treatments with the "anodic" pore geometry delivered an effective increase in turnover by almost three orders of magnitude with respect to a smooth, planar Fe2O3 surface. However, the current density depended on the pore length in a non-monotonic manner. An optimal length was found that maximized turnover by equating the rate of transport in the electrolyte with that of charge transfer across the interface.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000359765200009

In this study, we employed first-principle thermodynamic modeling and calculations to evaluate the substantial effects of environmental factors (temperature and oxygen partial pressure), on the surface structure, stability, and nanocrystal morphology of rutile-type ruthenium dioxide (RuO2). Both stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric surfaces with ideal bulk terminations were assessed. The relative ordering of stoichiometric surface stabilities was predicted as (110)>(101)>(100)>(001). The sensitive environment dependence of nonstoichiometric surface stabilities was evaluated by calculating the surface phase diagram, and partially validated by comparing with available experimental observations. The predicted surface stabilities were further coupled with the Gibbs-Wulff construction of equilibrium crystal shape, to predict the morphological evolutions of RuO2 nanocrystals under practical growth conditions. A morphology-controlled growth technique was finally suggested for designing and developing hierarchical nanostructures by intelligently adjusting the thermodynamic growth conditions.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000344779900055

Recently, a variety of nanostructured and nanoporous g-C3N4 materials have been developed for a wide range of new applications. This feature article gives, at first, an overview on the synthesis of g-C3N4 nanomaterials with controllable structure and morphology, and secondly, presents and categorizes applications of g-C3N4 as multifunctional metal-free catalysts for environmental protection, energy conversion and storage. A special emphasis is placed on the potential applications of nanostructured g-C3N4 in the areas of artificial photocatalysis for hydrogen production, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for fuel cells, and metal-free heterogeneous catalysis. Finally, this perspective highlights crucial issues that should be addressed in the future in the aforementioned exciting research areas.									1354	75	2	0	110	0	1388			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000303251500008

Proton coupled electron transfer and redox active tyrosines in Photosystem II								JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY				104	1-2	SI		60	71		10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2011.01.026				JUL-AUG 2011	2011	In this article, progress in understanding proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) in Photosystem II is reviewed. Changes in acidity/basicity may accompany oxidation/reduction reactions in biological catalysis. Alterations in the proton transfer pathway can then be used to alter the rates of the electron transfer reactions. Studies of the bioenergetic complexes have played a central role in advancing our understanding of PCET. Because oxidation of the tyrosine results in deprotonation of the phenolic oxygen, redox active tyrosines are involved in PCET reactions in several enzymes. This review focuses on PCET involving the redox active tyrosines in Photosystem II. Photosystem II catalyzes the light-driven oxidation of water and reduction of plastoquinone. Photosystem II provides a paradigm for the study of redox active tyrosines, because this photosynthetic reaction center contains two tyrosines with different roles in catalysis. The tyrosines, YZ and YD, exhibit differences in kinetics and midpoint potentials, and these differences may be due to noncovalent interactions with the protein environment. Here, studies of YD and YZ and relevant model compounds are described. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									63	0	0	0	23	0	62			1011-1344			WOS:000292066000007	21419640

Here, we investigated the ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity of transition metal atoms (TM) anchored at the S and Se vacancy sites of WSSe monolayer (TMOS -WSSe, TMOSe -WSSe) via performing the first-principles calculation. Our result shows that the single atom catalysts (SACs) PtOS -WSSe and PtOSe -WSSe have low ORR/OER overpotentials (eta ORR/eta OER) of 0.31/0.36 V and 0.43/0.34 V, respectively. The eta(ORR) and eta(OER) of SAC PtOS -WSSe are even lower compared with the previously studied SACs. Besides, the Gibbs free energy changes of the key intermediate adsorption are close to the values at ideal catalyst. Our calculations demonstrate the promising potential of PtOS -WSSe and PtOSe -WSSe as ORR and OER bifunctional SACs. More importantly, the superior ORR and OER catalytic activity of TMOS -WSSe and TMOSe -WSSe are well explained via the intrinsic feature of SACs as well as the interaction between the TM atom and the intermediates. Especially, we demonstrate that the magnetic moment and the catalytic activity of SACs TMOS -WSSe and TMOSe -WSSe are closely correlated. Our result provides new idea for designing highly effectual ORR and OER bifunctional SACs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000863042400005

In particular, the oxidation processes of arylsulfides and benzyl alcohols by a nonheme iron-oxo complex have been studied. We show for the first time that the pseudo-first-order rate constants of fast bimolecular processes in solution (milliseconds and above) can be determined by time-resolved XAS technique. By following the Fe K-edge energy shift, it is possible to detect the rate of iron oxidation state evolution that matches that of the bimolecular reaction in solution. The kinetic constant values obtained by XAS are in perfect agreement with those obtained by means of the concomitant UV-vis detection. This combined approach has the potential to provide unique insights into reaction mechanisms in the liquid phase that involve changes of the oxidation state of a metal center, and it is particularly useful in complex chemical systems where possible interferences from species present in solution could make it impossible to use other detection techniques.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000459222100021	30648388

In particular in situ and operando characterisation techniques have accelerated the understanding of degradation processes and the identification of active sites, motivating the design and synthesis of improved, nanoengineered materials. In this short topical review we report on the latest developments of various sophisticated in situ and operando characterization techniques, including transmission and scanning electron microscopy, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction and synchrotron-based x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and x-ray absorption spectroscopy, among others. We focus on their use in three emerging topics, namely: (i) the analysis of general electrochemical reactions and the surface defect chemistry of electrode materials; (ii) the evolution of electrode surfaces achieved by nanoparticle exsolution for enhanced oxygen activity and (iii) the study of surface degradation caused by Sr segregation, leading to reduced durability. For each of these topics we highlight the most remarkable examples recently published. We anticipate that ongoing improvements in the characterisation techniques and especially a complementary use of them by multimodal approaches will lead to improved knowledge of operando processes, hence allowing a significant advancement in cell performance in the near future.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2515-7655			WOS:000588558200001

In the two semi-reactions of water splitting, water oxidation is preferred to the four-electron-transfer process with a higher overpotential (eta) and is the decisive step in water splitting. Therefore, efficient water oxidation catalysts must be developed. IrOx and RuOx catalysts are currently the most efficient catalysts in water oxidation. However, the limited reserve and high prices of precious metals, such as Ir and Ru, limit future large-scale industrial production of water oxidation catalysts. In this study, we tune inert Ni-foam into highly active NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures as water oxidation catalysts via three-step strategy (surface acid-treating, electroplating, and electrooxidation). NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures as water oxidation catalysts only require. of 257 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to that of IrO2/Ni-foam (280 mV). The high electrochemically active surface area (72.50 cm(2)) and roughness factor demonstrate abundant interfaces in NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures, thus accelerating water oxidation activity. The small value (4.8 Omega cm(2)) of charge transfer resistance (R-ct) indicate that fast electronic exchange occurs between NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures catalyst and reaction of water oxidation. Hydrogen-to-oxygen volume ratios (approximately 2:1) indicate an almost overall water splitting by the double-electrode system. Faraday efficiency of H-2 or O-2 is close to 90% at 2:1 hydrogen-to-oxygen volume ratio. NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures exhibit good stability. The results provide significance in fundamental research and practical applications in solar water splitting, artificial photoelectrochemical cells, and electrocatalysts.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			2470-1343			WOS:000446186000062	31459211

Herein, an electroless plating method was employed to autogenous growth of ultrathin Ni-Fe2B nanosheet arrays on nickel foam (NF), in which the whole liquid phase reduction reaction took no more than 20 min and did not require any other treatments such as calcination. In 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, the resulted Ni-Fe2B ultrathin nanosheet displayed a low overpotential of 250 mV for OER and 115 mV for HER to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm-2, and both OER and HER activities remained stable after 26 h stability testing. Further, the couple electrodes composed of Ni-Fe2B could afford a current density of 10 mA cm-2 towards overall water splitting at a cell voltage of 1.64 V in 1.0 M KOH and along with excellent stability for 26 h. The outstanding electrocatalytic activities can be attributed to the synergistic effect of electron-coupling across Ni and Fe atoms and active sites exposed by large surface area. The effective combination of low cost and high electrocatalytic activity brings about a promising prospect for Ni-Fe2B nanosheet arrays in the field of overall water splitting.

We carry out detailed nucleosynthesis calculations for these energetic explosions and compare the yields with those of ordinary core-collapse supernovae. We find that both complete and incomplete Si-burning takes place over more extended, lower density regions, so that the alpha -rich freezeout is enhanced and produces more Ti in comparison with ordinary supernova nucleosynthesis. In addition, oxygen and carbon burning takes place in more extended, lower density regions than in ordinary supernovae. Therefore, the fuel elements O, C, and Al are less abundant, while a larger amount of Si, S, Ar, and Ca ("Si") are synthesized by oxygen burning; this leads to larger ratios of "Si"/O in the ejecta. Enhancement of the mass ratio between complete and incomplete Si-burning regions in the ejecta may explain the abundance ratios among iron-peak elements in metal-poor stars. Also the enhanced "Si"/O ratio may explain the abundance ratios observed in star burst galaxies. We also discuss other implications of enhanced [Ti/Fe] and [Fe/O] for Galactic chemical evolution and the abundances of low-mass black hole binaries.									126	2	0	0	0	0	128			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000169946200031

Earth-abundant transition metal catalysts have shown efficient catalytic efficiency and are attractive due to sustainable and economic considerations. However, the dynamic evolution process during their whole service time remains elusive, which is greatly complicated by the multiple component and valence states as well as the structural complexity of materials. Here in this work, we investigated the atomic-scale evolution of multivalent nickel-based sulfides (from NiS2 to alpha-NiS, beta-NiS and Ni3S4) as model catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), via operando Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopies corroborated by theoretical calculations. Dynamic reconstruction propagating from surface to bulk, mediated by sulphur vacancy, has been demonstrated for these materials, all with the terminated Ni3S2 phase on the catalyst surface being responsible for subsequent catalysis. Partial Fe substitution prompts this reconfiguration process and hence improves the HER performance, and therefore establishes the dynamic working mechanism of the widely-adopted doping strategy. We unprecedentedly reveal the dynamic reconstruction with the lower valence state tendency of transition metals in the catalytically terminated phase during the HER, and the life-time dynamic correlation between structure and activity, providing insights into future catalyst design.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000732843200001

Namely, N-doped carbon nanotubes embedded Co nanoparticles with different Co/C mass ratios were prepared by a thermal polymerization procedure. These Co nanoparticles were transferred then into CoP via a phosphorization process. MoS2 nanosheets were grown on the N-doped carbon nanotubes with CoP nanoparticles through a hydrothermal synthesis. The performance of N-doped carbon nanotubes embedded Co nanoparticles in hydrogen evolution reaction were adjusted with the change of Co/C ratios and calcination temperature. It is interesting that the phosphorization process and vertical growth of MoS2 nanosheets promoted hydrogen evolution performance greatly. After growing MoS2 nanosheets, N-doped carbon nanotubes embedded CoP nanoparticles exhibits excellent electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance in an alkaline electrolyte (1 M KOH). Compared to N-doped carbon nanotube embedded Co nanoparticles, the composite sample revealed low onset potential, small Tafel slope and good stability. The excellent electrocatalytic property is attributed to the synergistic effect of MoS2 nanosheet and N-doped carbon nanotube embedded CoP nanoparticles as well as N-doped carbon nanotubes improved their electronic structure and increased conductivity.

This manuscript describes synthesis of composite mixture by engineering the N-doped carbon (NC) layer on the surface of FeCo-doped MOF at nanoscale level via sonication, and pyrolysis process produced metal-coordinated N-doped carbon hybrids (FC-NC/NC). The addition of NC in FeCo bimetal contributes to larger-size and more robust carbon shells compared to bimetal-decorated without NC. The representative core shell assembly with greater electrolyte-accessible surface and enrich mass diffusion paths ultimately benefit the FC-NC/NC catalyst to demonstrate higher performance, which affords the minimum overpotentials of 295/193 mV towards oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions, and stable durability performance under alkaline solution. Furthermore, the excellent water electrolyzer activity was achieved by FC-NC/NC with a cell voltage of 1.64 V at 10 mA cm(-2) . Hence, this strategy is a fruitful trial to optimized the active sites of FeCo-based electrocatalyst towards alkaline water electrolyzer.

As metal oxides possessing a regular structure with high crystallinity are widely accepted as promising for effective catalysis, numerous studies have been devoted to the relevant photoinduced applications. However, their irregular derivative phases with lower crystallinity, which could exhibit tempting opportunities for catalytic activities, have long been ignored. Here, the surface-amorphized bismuth oxychloride is produced by homogeneous nanoparticle distribution through a rapid precipitation strategy. Comparing with its surface-crystallized counterpart, the partially amorphized bismuth oxychloride undergoes a fast surface reconstruction process under light irradiation, forming active surfaces with rich oxygen vacancies (OVs), leading to not only distinctive OV-mediated interfacial charge-transfer mechanisms with improved carrier dynamics but also robust water-surface interface with enhanced physical and chemical interaction, thus resulting in enhanced photocatalytic water oxidation. The strategy of optimizing by tuning the interfacial interaction behavior proposed in this work could broaden horizons for establishing more efficient partially amorphized energy conversion materials.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000618153100029	33478209

However, substantial technical breakthroughs are needed to reduce the costs for electricity and chemical reagents. In this study, we explore a specific wastewater electrolysis cell (WEC) as an alternative of decentralized H-2 production coupled with onsite water treatment. A prototypical WEC consists of a multi-junction semiconductor anode and a stainless steel cathode paired in single compartment cell. A distinct layer of BiOx/TiO2 on anode surface had relatively low crystallinity that was shown to be beneficial for higher oxide formation and O-2 evolution. The over-potential and Tafel slope of the BiOx/TiO2 anode were determined to be 0.32 V and 120 mV decade(-1). In a single compartment WEC with a NaCl electrolyte ([Cl-] <= 50 mM), the current density (j) ranged up to 500 A m(-2) at cell voltages less than 6V, while the current efficiency (CE) for free chlorine (FC) evolution showed maximum value near 0.3. The CE and energy efficiency (EE) for the HER were assessed using NaCI solutions (50 mM with or without 2.5 g L-1 urea) and real wastewater with variable compositions ([Cl-]: 6-33 mM, [chemical oxygen demand]: 60-790 mg L-1). The ohmic resistance of wastewater electrolyte rules out the usage of membrane separation, resulting in side reactions such as reduction of O-2 whose CE values monotonically decreased with an increasing j under the diffusion controlled regime. Chloride ions reduce the electron consumption during O-2 reduction, while elevated levels of FC significantly lower the CE for the HER. The combined presence of oxidizable organic compounds and Cl- enhance the CE for the HER as long as the concentration of organics is enough to quench FC to maintain a pseudo steady-state concentration. The highest CE (0.8) and EE (0.23) for HER were observed during electrolysis of real wastewater at j values exceeding 200 A m(-2). However, a dependency of value of EE on the applied cell voltage needs to be addressed further.

First principles density functional theory calculations of GaSbxP1-x alloys in a 216 atom supercell configuration indicate that an indirect to direct band gap transition occurs at x = 0.0092 or higher Sb incorporation into GaSbxP1-x. Furthermore, these calculations indicate band edge straddling of the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions for compositions ranging from x = 0.0092 Sb up to at least x = 0.065 Sb making it a candidate for use in a Schottky type photoelectrochemical water splitting device. GaSbxP1-x nanowires were synthesized by reactive transport utilizing a microwave plasma discharge with average compositions ranging from x = 0.06 to x = 0.12 Sb and direct band gaps between 2.21 eV and 1.33 eV. Photoelectrochemical experiments show that the material is photoactive with p-type conductivity. This study brings attention to a relatively uninvestigated, tunable band gap semiconductor system with tremendous potential in many fields.									30	1	0	0	0	0	30			2045-2322			WOS:000369746900004	26860470

To increase fluid mixing and solubility of reactants, as well as to reduce reaction time, complex three-dimensional networks inducing chaotic advection have to be designed. Alternatively, turbulence in the liquid can be generated by active mixing methods (magnetic, acoustic waves, etc.) or adding small quantities of elastic materials to the working liquid. Here, polyelectrolyte multilayer capsules embodying a catalytic polyoxometalate complex have been suspended in an aqueous solution and used to create elastic turbulence and to propel fluids inside microchannels as an alternative to viscoelastic polymers. The overall effect is enhanced and controlled by feeding the polyoxometalate-modified capsules with hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, thus triggering an on-demand propulsion due to oxygen evolution resulting from H2O2 decomposition. The quantification of the process is done by analysing some structural parameters of motion such as speed, pressure, viscosity, and Reynolds and Weissenberg numbers, directly obtained from the capillary dynamics of the aqueous mixtures with different concentrations of H2O2. The increases in fluid speed as well as the capsule-induced turbulence effects are proportional to the H2O2 added and therefore dependent on the kinetics of H2O2 dismutation.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1473-0197	1473-0189		WOS:000343920200012	25238401

In ADCs, the metal centers are in intimate contact with the support, hence, the support significantly affects the catalytic behavior of the ADCs by participating in reactions, either directly or indirectly. Therefore, for electrocatalytic reactions, thorough understanding of the function of the supports is required in designing effective ADCs with superior activity and stability. In this review, we summarize and discuss the functions of supports in several synthesis strategies and electrocatalytic reactions of atomically dispersed noble-metal catalysts. We outline various synthesis strategies, and identify a need for a suitable design of the support to stabilize the atom-dimension metal structure. Furthermore, we describe (electro)catalysis of ADCs, with focus on support-derived factors that affect the catalytic performance of the ADCs, such as strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), geometric effects of atom-dimension structure, local environment near metal centers, and chemical proper ties of supports. Finally, we identify current challenges and future prospects of functional supports in ADCs.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2589-7780			WOS:000652366100001

Then, the anisotropic shock waves pass through the oxygen rich layers.

Herein, ultrathin cobalt-nickel-magnesium layered double hydroxide (CoNiMg-LDH) nanosheets with plentiful oxygen vacancies are synthesized via sacrificial magnesiumbased replacement reaction at room temperature. Self-doping and mild reduction of magnesium can significantly increase the concentration of oxygen vacancies in CoNiMg-LDH, which promotes the electrochemical charge transfer efficiency and enhances the adsorption ability of electrolytes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations also indicate that Mg2+ doping can decrease the formation energy of oxygen vacancies in CoNiMg-LDH nanosheets, which increases the concentration of oxygen vacancies. Thus, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor CoNiMg-LDH//Actived Carbon accomplishes a superior capacity of-333 C g-1 (208 F g-1) at 1 A g-1 and presents a gravimetric energy density of 73.9 Wh kg-1 at 0.8 kW kg-1. It presents only 13% capacity loss at 20 A g-1 after 5000 cycles. This discovery emphasizes the positive role of magnesium in regulating oxygen vacancies to improve the performance of supercapacitors, which should be beneficial for extending the scope of superior SCs active materials.

Herein, for the first time, CNT@Ni@NiCo silicate core-shell nanocomposite is designed and used as a cathode catalyst in Li-O-2 batteries. This nanocomposite shows a promising electrochemical performance with a discharge capacity of 10 046 mA h g(cat)(-1) and a low overpotential of 1.44 V at a current density of 200 mA g(cat)(-1), and it can sustain for more than 50 cycles within the voltage range of 2-4.7 V. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterizations prove that the formation of Li2CO3 and other side products are prevented, likely due to the encapsulation of CNTs by NiCo silicates and Ni nanoparticles, which may help decompose the side products. Finally, the synergistic effects, which are contributed by the high electrical conductivity of CNTs, high surface area, the high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of NiCo silicate, and the simple decomposition of side products by Ni nanoparticles enable outstanding performance of the CNT@Ni@NiCo silicate core-shell nanocomposite as a cathode catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries.									34	4	0	0	1	0	34			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000437106300034		
J	Yang, Zhiyuan; Zhao, Lili; Zhang, Sasa; Zhao, Xian								Ferroelectric-enhanced BiVO4-BiFeO3 photoelectrocatalysis for efficient, stable and large-current-density oxygen evolution								APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY				26						101374	10.1016/j.apmt.2022.101374				MAR 2022	2022	The efficient BiVO4 photoanodes converting light to charge carriers and further oxidizing water to oxygen in PEC system is the gordian technical barrier for water spliltting, because that BiVO4 remain suffering from sluggish water oxidation kinetic, severe surface recombination and inefficient carrier separation. Firstly, the suitable cocatalysts loading can solve the sluggish kinetics of surface reaction and serious recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Secondly, constructing heterostructures composed of multi-semiconductors can improve the separation efficiency of charge carriers and light absorption range. On the other hand, the existence of the built-in electric field can also provide a driving force for the transport of photoinduced charge carriers, thus enhancing separation efficiency. Herein, a ferroelectric enhanced photoelectrocatalysis system, by taking BiVO4 and Co3O4 as photocatalyst and cocatalyst, and coupling the ferroelectric material BiFeO3 to form BiVO4-BiFeO3 heterojunction was developed. The Co3O4 cocatalyst provided active sites for OER and BiVO4-BiFeO3 heterojunction promoted carrier separation. Besides of the regulation of heterojunction structure, BiFeO3 could also form the local internal electric field through ferroelectric polarization at a low voltage, which further promoted carrier separation and increased photocurrent. The as-prepared Co3O4/BiVO4-BiFeO3 sample exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic and photoelectrochemical activity for OER in 1 M KOH, an impressive photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE was achieved under AM 1.5 G light (2.24 mA/cm(2)), which was approximately double higher than those of Co3O4/BiVO4 and Co3O4/BiFeO3, respectively. Importantly, after the ferroelectric polarization of BiFeO3 was performed, photocurrent densities of 4.51 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V and 1280 mA/cm(2) at 1.86 V vs. RHE were obtained under AM 1.5 G light, attesting the polarization-induced electric field contributed to enhance photoelectrochemical catalytic performance. The large-current-density OER obtained was also an important preponderance for the practicability. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Many strategies have been used, and coordination polymers with structures similar to Prussian blue appear to be interesting electrocatalysts due to their efficiency, stability and tunable properties. In this paper, a novel catalyst produced from a cobalt-pentacyanidoferrate precursor is presented and applied in studies of the OER. This material showed a high surface active area and electrocatalytic activity comparable to traditional cobalt hexacyanidoferrate. According to the theoretical calculations, the improvement of these properties is an effect of the framework arrangement and it is not caused by changes of the electronic structure. Further experimental evidence is necessary to determine the active species. However, our results of spin densities obtained from DFT calculations suggest that the active species for water oxidation is the radical Fe(III)CN-Co(III)-O-center dot.									24	1	0	0	2	1	24			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000468001400035	30801085

Thus it is very difficult to foresee, without experimental data, the overall effect of these parameters. If radiolysis of pure water under gamma rays or alpha particles has been widely studied, it is not the case for self radiolysis of tritiated water (low energy P particles radiation). In order to fill this lack of experimental knowledge and to understand the radiolysis of stored tritiated water produced in tritium plants, we studied the evolution of hydrogen and oxygen concentrations in the gaseous phase above chemically pure tritiated water. The simulation of pure water radiolysis has been carried out and the results are compared with experimental data. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Bias-induced surface reconstruction of a MOF-derived bimetallic (Co & V) oxide as an electrocatalyst for water oxidation								SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS				6	20			4779	4786		10.1039/d2se00970f		SEP 2022		OCT 11 2022	2022	The four-electron oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the bottleneck in the overall water splitting process, which needs to be addressed for the better hydrogen economy of an electrolyzer. In this work, a bimetallic metal-organic framework with the formula [Co(C4H4N2)(VO3)(2)] was annealed at 500, 600, and 700 degrees C in an argon atmosphere to yield CoV@500, CoV@600, and CoV@700, respectively. The high-temperature annealing leads to the generation of heterostructured nanoparticles of crystalline spinel oxide Co2VO4 and amorphous VOx wrapped with a carbon and nitrogen matrix. CoV@600 exhibits superior OER performance to afford the state-of-the-art current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a lower overpotential of 273 mV and a small Tafel slope of 54.32 mV dec(-1) that outperformed the benchmark electrocatalyst RuO2 and other catalysts used here. The superior OER performance could be ascribed to the lower charge transfer resistance, presence of oxygen vacancy, and lattice defects. Interestingly, the long-term chronopotentiometric stability exhibits a lowering in the overpotential with time, and a detailed investigation of the catalyst after OER manifests the leaching of the amorphous vanadium oxide and oxidation of Co(ii) to Co(iii) induced by the potential bias. Leaching triggers the surface decoration of cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) with core spinel oxide (Co2VO4) as confirmed from XPS, TEM, FESEM, and PXRD techniques. Further, accelerated degradation studies and the LSV after the 1000(th) cycle present a lowered overpotential of 241 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density. The synergistic effect between the active CoOOH surface and defect-rich core spinel oxide could be the origin of the enhanced OER performance. This work not only presents superior OER performance of the annealed product of the framework but also demonstrates a strategy to obtain in situ bias-induced surface modification and emphasizes the importance of the postmortem analysis of a catalyst after catalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000858864300001

According to density functional theory calculations, adsorption of OH* species on Sn atoms is energetically more favorable than that of Co atoms, and as a result, highly active CoOOH is generated by leaching of Sn atoms from surface layers. We observed enhanced OER performance with superior mass activity by blending SCH with activated charcoal, which displays a low overpotential of 293 mV and higher mass activity than that of pristine SCH. More importantly, it outperforms Co(OH)(2) and RuO2 having the same carbon composition because of the formation of thermodynamically stable and amorphous CoOOH on the surface of single-crystalline SCH and strong tethering ability of activated charcoal.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000526414400068	32186865	
J	Lu, Zhanpeng; Yang, Wu								In situ monitoring the effects of a magnetic field on the open-circuit corrosion states of iron in acidic and neutral solutions								CORROSION SCIENCE				50	2			510	522		10.1016/j.corsci.2007.07.009				FEB 2008	2008	The effects of a 0.4 T horizontal magnetic field (HMF) on the open-circuit corrosion states of iron in static aqueous solutions are studied by in situ monitoring the responses of two electrochemical parameters to the applied magnetic field, i.e. the open-circuit potential (OCP) and the current under potentiostatic polarization. The applied magnetic field makes the OCP shift in the noble direction. Withdrawing the magnetic field causes a negative shift of the OCP in acidic solutions, but it does not cause any significant change of OCP ill neutral solutions. Imposing a magnetic field induces a cathodic current for iron that was previously potentiostatically polarized at the OCP without magnetic field. Withdrawing the magnetic field induces an anodic current for iron that was previously potentiostatically polarized at the OCP with the magnetic field. The magnetic field effect is more significant in the acid solutions than in the salt solutions. The magnetic field effects on the oxygen reduction and on the activation-controlled iron dissolution reaction are found to be insignificant. The magnetic field effect on the hydrogen reduction reaction oil iron in acidic solutions is demonstrated. Results show the possibility that a magnetic field would affect the hydrogen evolution by enhancing the electron-transfer process that has been categorized in the classical electrochemistry kinetics to be the rate-determining process. The memory effect of the magnetic field on the electrochemical reaction is identified and discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the binary Cu-Ru alloy system is very unstable in the bulk state, the atomic-level well-mixed CuRu solid solution nanoparticles were found to have high thermal stability up to at least 773 K in a vacuum. The exhaust purification activity of the CuRu solid solution was comparable to that of face-centred cubic Ru nanoparticles. According to in situ infrared measurements, stronger NO adsorption and higher intrinsic reactivity of the Ru site on the CuRu surface than that of a pure Ru surface were found, affected by atomic-level Cu substitution. Furthermore, CuRu solid solution was a versatile catalyst for purification of all exhaust gases at a stoichiometric oxygen concentration.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000589505900028	34094383

In our Si photoanode structure, to eliminate the Si/water interface, the Si is stabilized with a thick insulating and chemically inert SiO2 film and locally defined electrocatalysts on the Si surface. The stabilized p(+)n-Si photoanode with SiO2 film and micropatterned Ni catalysts produced photocurrent densities of 27 mA cm(2) at water oxidation potential without corrosion for 24 h under water oxidation conditions. In addition, we provide a device modeling of our Si cell, i.e., an integrated photovoltaics-electrolyzer cell, to quantitatively assess the interplay between optical shadowing and catalytic performance, as a function of the coverage and characteristics of electrocatalysts on the water oxidation reaction during PEC water splitting. Design principles for high performance oxygen evolving Si photoanodes are presented based on the device modeling.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000368562200017

The high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) analysis confirm that the WCTHP nanoparticles are dominated by (01 (1) over bar0), (10 (1) over bar0) and (1 (1) over bar 00) facets with a preferred orientation of [0001]. The Pt loaded WC-mp/G materials show high activity and extremely high stability in electrocatalysis.

The hypochlorous acid serves as an oxidation agent upon adding 100 mM ethanol or 2-propanol into the solution.

The nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube/graphene oxide composites were prepared by chemical oxidation method followed by annealing process. Such composite enhances the active adsorption sites, electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance leading to better impact toward ORR. The N-graphene oxide/functionalized carbon nanotube catalyst that furnishes both pyridinic-N and pyridinic-N-O (or oxidic-N) shows higher efficiency toward electrocatalytic ORR performance in alkaline conditions. More interestingly, as-prepared electrocatalyst shows durability test up to 20 000 potential cycles without loss in its half-wave potential (E-half) while commercial Pt/C catalyst shows a huge loss in E-half value under similar conditions, indicating sustainability in the performance of former, especially compared to the reported metal or metal-free electrocatalysts. The origin of high catalytic activity of oxidic-N is correlated with pi-electron density at the Fermi level studied by density functional theory and considered as an electronic descriptor.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000687238400001

Ligand design is one of the key tools to improve the activity and stability of molecular catalysts. The establishment of ligand design rules can facilitate the development of improved molecular catalysts. In this paper it is shown that chemical oxidants can be used to probe oxygen evolution activity for nickel-based systems, and trends are reported that can improve future ligand design. Interestingly, different ligand effects were observed in comparison to other first-row transition metal complexes. For example, nickel complexes with secondary amine donors were more active than with tertiary amine donors, which is the opposite for iron complexes. The incorporation of imine donor groups in a cyclam ligand resulted in the fastest and most durable nickel catalyst of our series, achieving oxygen evolution turnover numbers up to 380 and turnover frequencies up to 68 min(-1) in a pH 5.0 acetate buffer using Oxone as oxidant. Initial kinetic experiments with this catalyst revealed a first order in chemical oxidant and a half order in catalyst. This implies a rate-determining oxidation step from a dimeric species that needs to break up to generate the active catalyst. These findings lay the foundation for the rational design of molecular nickel catalysts for water oxidation and highlight that catalyst design rules are not generally applicable for different metals.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000583248800001	33090703

The high overvoltage of hydrogen on mercury allows the use of acidic mobile phases without problems with evolution of hydrogen gas. The accessible potential range is limited by the reduction of Zn2+ dissolved from the scrubber column. The possibilities for trace amount determinations of nitrocompounds are demonstrated in the detection of trinitrophenyl derivatives of amino acids from reaction with trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid.

The aim of this study was to investigate the hydrochemical evolution of a freshwater lens, using the barrier island Spiekeroog, Germany, as an example. For this purpose, groundwater samples were obtained during several campaigns, and hydrochemical data and C-13/C-12 isotope ratios of dissolved inorganic carbon were linked to apparent groundwater ages. Results show that apparent groundwater ages increase with depth and range between 4 and 51 years. All groundwater samples were close to equilibrium with respect to calcite and considerably enriched in calcium and bicarbonate, suggesting calcite dissolution in the unsaturated zone of the dune sediments. The estimated average rate of decalcification was similar to 13 mm/a, resulting in a decalcification depth of similar to 4.6 m for the oldest sediments of an approximate age of 350 years. Moreover, C-13/C-12 isotope ratios of dissolved inorganic carbon indicated secondary carbonate mineral reactions within the aquifer, such as recrystallization and closed-system calcite dissolution. Cation exchange was primarily observed in older groundwater, i.e. the deeper part of the aquifer, and the calculated time of complete freshening of the aquifer is similar to 600 years. Regarding redox reactants, dissolved oxygen and nitrate concentrations decreased rapidly in young groundwater, while dissolved manganese and iron were virtually absent in samples collected below the zones of oxygen and nitrate reduction. Dissolved sulfide species indicate sulfate reduction in older groundwater, and methanogenesis was detected locally. The absence of solute manganese and iron may be explained by the formation of minerals, such as iron sulfides, siderite, and rhodochrosite, that serve as possible sinks for redoxsensitive solutes. In conclusion, this study showed that hydrochemical data can be linked to groundwater ages to describe the hydrochemical evolution of a freshwater lens in a homogeneous sandy aquifer as a function of residence time.									24	0	0	0	14	0	24			0883-2927			WOS:000432195100018

The cathodic reduction of anodic products is sufficiently suppressed in the current technology by the addition of chromium(VI) to the electrolyte, but due to the high toxicity of these compounds, alternative pathways are required to maintain high process efficiency. In this paper, we evaluate the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics and selectivity on thermally formed manganese oxide-coated titanium electrodes in hypochlorite and chlorate solutions. The morphology and phase composition of manganese oxide layers were varied via alteration of the annealing temperature during synthesis, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, synchrotron radiation X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy measurements. As shown in mass spectroscopy coupled electrochemical measurements, the hydrogen evolution selectivity in hypochlorite and chlorate solutions is dictated by the phase composition of the coating. Importantly, a hydrogen evolution efficiency of above 95% was achieved with electrodes of optimized composition (annealing temperature, thickness) in hypochlorite solutions. Further, these electrode coatings are nontoxic and Earth-abundant, offering the possibility of a more sustainable chlorate production.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			2168-0485			WOS:000475838100027

Oxygen permeability across dense (Ba0.5Sr0.5)(Co0.8Fe0.2-xCrx)O3-delta (x = 0.00, 0.05, 0.10) membranes as oxygen separators for the high-temperature air separation were studied at 700-850 degrees C, and it is increased as x = 0.00 > 0.05 > 0.10 for (Ba0.5Sr0.5)(Co0.8Fe0.2-xCrx)O3-delta. The lowered oxygen permeability of the Cr-doped membranes is attributed to the higher oxidation state of the doped Cr cations with respect to Fe/Co ones, leading to the decrease in the oxygen vacancy concentration in the (Ba0.5Sr0.5)(Co0.8Fe0.2-xCrx)O3-delta (x = 0.00) oxide. The enhanced oxygen permeation stability for the partially Cr-doped (Ba0.5Sr0.5)(Co0.8Fe0.2-xCrx)O3-delta (x = 0.05, 0.10) separation membranes was observed by the long-term permeation tests. The oxygen ionic transporting mechanism for oxygen permeation across the as-prepared dense (Ba0.5Sr0.5)(Co0.8Fe0.2-xCrx)O3-delta (x = 0.10) membranes was also studied at 700-850 degrees C. The results demonstrate that the oxygen diffusive transporting in the sintered ceramics is the rate-limiting step for the dense (Ba0.5Sr0.5)(Co0.8Fe0.2-xCrx)O3-delta (x = 0.10) membranes in the temperature range of 700-850 degrees C investigated.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000722532700004

The results reveal that distorted IrO6 is more conducive to OER activity. Specifically, for a given material, regulating the transformation of the IrO6 octahedron from D4h compression to D4h elongation causes electrons near the EF level to become more delocalized, which is very beneficial for reducing the energy of the rate determining step. Our findings will guide the design and preparation of more efficient iridium-based OER catalysts.									19	1	0	0	3	0	19			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000468418800007	31041960

The code has been upgraded to couple the description of irradiated fuel thermochemistry already available with oxygen transport taking into account thermodiffusion. The impact of oxygen redistribution during a power transient on irradiated fuel thermochemistry in the fuel and on chemically reactive gas release from the fuel (I-(g), I-2(g), CsI(g), TeI2(g), Cs-(g), Cs-2(g)) is studied. The simulations show that oxygen redistribution, even if moderate in magnitude, leads to the reduction of metallic oxides (molybdenum dioxide, cesium molybdates, chromium oxide) at the fuel pellet center and consequently to the release of a much greater quantity of gaseous cesium. Pellet-Cladding Interaction failure propensity is shown to decrease in consequence of the thermodynamically favourable reaction of iodine with released cesium in the free volume of the rod.

Distinct from steam reforming, electrochemical water splitting, especially powered by renewables, has been considered as a promising technique for scalable production of high-purity hydrogen with no carbon emission. Its commercialization relies on the reduction of electricity consumption and thus hydrogen cost, calling for highly efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts with the capability of steadily working at high hydrogen output. This requires the electrocatalysts to feature (1) highly active intrinsic sites, (2) abundant accessible active sites, (3) effective electron and mass transfer, (4) high chemical and structural durability, and (5) low-cost and scalable synthesis. It should be noted that all these requirements should be fulfilled together for a practicable electrocatalyst. Much effort has been devoted to addressing one or a few aspects, especially improving the electrocatalytic activity by electronic modulation of active sites, while few reviews have focused on the synergistic modulation of these aspects together although it is essential for advanced electrochemical water splitting.In this Account, we will present recent innovative strategies with an emphasis on our solutions for synergistically modulating intrinsic active sites, electron transportation, mass transfer, and gas evolution, as well as mechanical and chemical durability, of non-preciousmetal electrocatalysts, aiming for cost-effective and highly efficient water splitting. The following approaches for coupling these aspects are summarized for both cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). (1) Synergistic electronic modulations. The electronic structure of a catalytic site determines the adsorption/desorption of reactive intermediates and thus intrinsic activity. It can be tuned by heterogeneous doping, strain effect, spin polarization, etc. Coupling these effects to optimize the reaction pathways or target simultaneously the activity and stability would advance electrocatalytic performance. (2) Synergistic electronic and crystalline modulation. The crystallinity, crystalline phase, crystalline facets, crystalline defects, etc. affect both activity and stability. Coupling these effects with electronic modulation would enhance the activity together with stability. (3) Synergistic electronic and morphological modulation. It will focus on concurrently modulating electronic structure for improving the intrinsic activity and morphology for increasing accessible active sites, especially through single action or processing. The mass transfer and gas evolution properties can also be enhanced by morphological modulation to enable water splitting at large output (4) Synergistic modulation of elementary reactions. Electrocatalytic reaction generally consists of a couple of elementary reactions. Each one may need a specific active site. Designing and combining various components targeting every elementary step on a space-limited catalyst surface will balance the intermediates and these steps for accelerating the overall reaction. (5) Integrated electrocatalyst design. Taking all these strategies together into account is necessary to integrate all above essential features into one electrocatalyst for enabling high-output water electrolysis. Beyond the progress made to date, the remaining challenges and opportunities is also discussed. With these insights, hopefully, this Account will shed light on the rational design of practical water-splitting electrocatalysts for the cost-effective and scalable production of hydrogen.									177	13	0	0	11	0	178			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000542223900003	32466638

Whereas signatures of18O have been observed by the Phoenix Lander and the sample analysis at Mars for carbon dioxide, the underlying isotopic exchange pathways with minerals of the crust of Mars are still elusive. Here, we reveal that reactions of gaseous18O-carbon dioxide over goethite (FeO(OH)) and hematite (Fe2O3) lead to an18O transfer from the atmosphere that enriches the18O content of the iron oxides in the absence of water and light. This proof-of-concept study shows that isotopic enrichment processes on Mars not only are limited to the atmosphere but also proceed via chemical interaction with dry iron oxides. These processes are decisive to comprehending the18O cycle between the atmosphere and the surface on the planetary scale									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1948-7185			WOS:000779724600019	35290734

However, the realization of efficient Z-scheme water splitting using oxysulfides as hydrogen evolution photocatalysts (HEPs) has been hampered by backward reactions involving reversible redox couples, the low efficiency of interparticle electron transfer, and a lack of knowledge regarding the means of promoting hydrogen evolution activity under nonsacrificial conditions. In this study, La5Ti2CuS5O7 was found to realize water splitting without any redox mediator by constructing Z-scheme-type photocatalyst sheets with BiVO4 as the oxygen evolution photocatalyst. It is also demonstrated that p-type doping and the formation of a La5Ti2Cu0.9Ag0.1S5O7 solid solution effectively enhance the water-splitting activity of the photocatalyst sheet. An apparent quantum yield of 4.9% at 420 nm and a solar to hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of 0.11% were obtained, both of which are among the highest values reported for water-splitting systems employing a particulate photocatalyst absorbing visible light up to ca. 700 nm. This work shows the potential for oxysulfides to serve as HEPs for Z-scheme water splitting and provides insights toward the development of efficient photocatalyst sheets.									87	1	0	0	7	0	87			2155-5435			WOS:000426804100009

However, their use is limited due to their high cost, scarcity, and issues with carbon monoxide poisoning. We developed a simple method to prepare a nickel foam (NF)-based monolith electrode with a NiO nanosheet array structure as an efficient electrocatalyst toward the oxidation of methanol to produce formate. By a simple ultrasonic acid treatment and air oxidation at room temperature, an inert NF was converted to NiO/NF as a catalytically active electrode due to the uniform NiO nanosheet array that was rapidly formed on the surface of NiO/NF. In alkaline electrolytes containing methanol, the as-prepared NiO/NF catalysts exhibited a lower methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) potential of +1.53 V vs RHE at 100 mA cm(-2) compared to that of inert NF samples. The difference in potentials between the E-MOR and the E-OER at that current density was found to be 280 mV, indicating that methanol oxidation occurred at lower potentials as compared to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We also observed that the NiO/NF could also efficiently catalyze the oxidation of CO without being poisoned by it. NiO/NF retained close to 100% of its initial activity after 20,000 s of methanol oxidation tests at high current densities above 200 mA cm(-2). Because of the simple synthesis method and the enhanced catalytic performance and stability of NiO/NF, this allows methanol to be used as an OER masking agent for the energy-efficient generation of value-added products such as formic acid and hydrogen.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000672492800033	34170102

Sub-cellular biochemistry				92				301	335		10.1007/978-3-030-18768-2_10				2019	2019	The invention of a biological membrane which is used as energy storage system to drive the metabolism of a primordial, unicellular organism represents a key event in the evolution of life. The innovative, underlying principle of this key event is respiration. In respiration, a lipid bilayer with insulating properties is chosen as the site for catalysis of an exergonic redox reaction converting substrates offered from the environment, using the liberated Gibbs free energy (DeltaG) for the build-up of an electrochemical H+ (proton motive force, PMF) or Na+ gradient (sodium motive force, SMF) across the lipid bilayer. Very frequently , several redox reactions are performed in a consecutive manner, with the first reaction delivering a product which is used as substrate for the second redox reaction, resulting in a respiratory chain. From today's perspective, the (mostly) unicellular bacteria and archaea seem to be much simpler and less evolved when compared to multicellular eukaryotes. However, they are overwhelmingly complex with regard to the various respiratory chains which permit survival in very different habitats of our planet, utilizing a plethora of substances to drive metabolism. This includes nitrogen, sulfur and carbon compounds which are oxidized or reduced by specialized, respiratory enzymes of bacteria and archaea which lie at the heart of the geochemical N, S and C-cycles. This chapter gives an overview of general principles of microbial respiration considering thermodynamic aspects, chemical reactions and kinetic restraints. The respiratory chains of Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae are discussed as models for PMF- versus SMF-generating processes, respectively. We introduce main redox cofactors of microbial respiratory enzymes, and the concept of intra-and interelectron transfer. Since oxygen is an electron acceptor used by many respiratory chains, the formation and removal of toxic oxygen radicals is described. Promising directions of future research are respiratory enzymes as novel bacterial targets, and biotechnological applications relying on respiratory complexes.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0306-0225			MEDLINE:31214991	31214991

Herein, we report a new strategy for precisely tuning the number of Fe atoms in clusters anchored on N-doped carbon. Such a tunability offers the capabilities of altering O-2 adsorption from superoxo-like to peroxo-like configuration as well as tailoring N species in carbon matrix during pyrolytic catalyst synthesis. As a result, Fe-2 clusters on N-doped carbon display excellent acidic ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.78 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) as well as remarkable durability with only a -20 mV shift after 20,000 cycles in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. This work provides insights into non-noble-metal electrocatalyst design at the atomic level from the angle of both active sites and catalyst supports.									189	14	0	0	5	1	188			2451-9294			WOS:000496957600013

Both the kinetics and the density of states results demonstrated that the direct dissociation of O-2 on all three M-ML/WC(0001) surfaces are almost impossible. Yet the barriers of the formation and dissociation of OOH on Au-ML/WC(0001) are much smaller than those on the Pt-ML/WC(0001) and the Pd-ML/WC(0001) surfaces, implying that the Au-ML/WC(0001) exhibits the highest catalytic activity for ORR via a combination of 2e(-) hydrogenation of O-2 and 4e(-) dissociation of OOH. The rate-limiting step barrier of 0.83 eV for the hydrogenation of OH forming H2O is also comparable to that on the traditional Pt-based catalysts. The deactivation mechanism of Pt-ML/WC(0001) and the performance of Pd-ML/WC(0001) for ORR were identified. The present study is conductive to designing new efficient catalyst without using of the precious Pt for efficiently promoting ORR. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Detailed experiments and findings show that nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (NCQDs) have a significant impact on the morphology of the CoP catalyst, and nitrogen doping can regulate the surface-active sites to obtain the catalyst with abundant structural defects. Simultaneously, nitrogen doping can regulate the content of pyridinic N and pyrrolic N, which exerts positive effects on the formation of the bond structure and electron conduction between NCQDs and CoP.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1520-5827		MEDLINE:36084196	36084196

Compared to pristine hematite, the activity of the modified photoanode in this work delivered almost twofold higher photocurrent under Air Mass 1.5G illumination. Further research revealed that the enhanced performance of the hematite photoanode with a titanium-modified surface resulted from the dominant impact of heterojunction formation and suppressed surface recombination, supplemented by a slightly improved light-harnessing ability.									11	2	0	0	1	0	11			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000368282100050	26558337

Model calculations have been performed for three metals with widely differing properties: Cd(0001), Au(111) and Pt(111). In line with experimental findings, the energy of activation decreases in this order. These results are explained in terms of the interaction of the bonding orbital of the hydrogen molecule with the d band of the electrode as it passes the Fermi level.

However, there are still many questions and details that remain to be answered. In this article, I very briefly outline some aspects of Photosystem II electron transport that are crucial for the efficient oxidation of water and require further studies. To fully understand Photosystem II reactions is not only a satisfying intellectual pursuit, but is also an important goal as we develop new solar technologies for the splitting of water into pure O-2 and H-2 for use as a potential fuel source.

The Au/Rh electrodes were prepared utilizing a spontaneous deposition process (SDP) of rhodium adlayer on the gold surface. In particular, rhodium deposition was obtained in non-deaerated 50 mM HClO4 solution containing 10 mM RhCl3 at open circuit for a given time. The modified gold electrode with adsorbed rhodium species (Au/ Rh) exhibit higher electrochemical activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. The effects on the electrochemical activity of the Au/Rh electrode such as: rhodium coverage, pH, electrolyte composition and applied potentials were critically evaluated and discussed. An optimized pulsed chronoamperometric detection technique for the analytical determination of several mono- and di-protic organic acids such as acetic, tartaric, oxalic, malic, etc., was successfully proposed. An average film composition of AU93(+/- 1) Rh-7 +/- 1 was evaluated by XPS technique. The film composition remains unchanged after various electrode treatments such as cycling of potentials and/or polarization conditions for long times in alkaline medium. Thus, the adsorbed rhodium oxide particles show a good chemical and mechanical stability despite the conditions of electrochemical treatment of the electrode surface. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The results clearly indicated that high temperature caused inhibition of photosystem II and photosystem I catalyzed electron transport activities in thylakoids of Synechococcus 6301. The reason for the inhibition of photosystem II activity is alteration at the level of water oxidation complex and the reason for the loss of photosystem I activity may be attributed to the changes at the level of reaction center, P(700).

Co-ZIF-67 exhibited efficient performance for visible light-driven water oxidation, with a turnover frequency of 0.035 s(-1). Co-ZIF-67 also maintained a stable current density after electrolysis for over 24 h, and it electrocatalyzed the oxygen evolution reaction within a wide pH range. DFT calculations suggest that the catalyst activates water molecules while the dissociated proton is received by nearby 2-methylimidazole ligands. This process permits Co-ZIF-67 to effectively catalyze the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic oxidation of water.									33	1	0	0	2	0	33			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000373993600008

Its performance depends critically on the properties of the oxygen carriers (OC). Ceria is recognized as one of the most promising OC candidates, because of its fast chemistry, high ionic diffusivity, and large oxygen storage capacity. The fundamental surface ion-incorporation pathways, along with the role of surface defects and the adsorbates remain largely unknown. This study presents a detailed kinetics study of CO2 splitting using CeO2 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 (CZO) in the temperature range 600-900 degrees C. Given our interest in fuel-assisted reduction, we limit our study to relatively lower temperatures to avoid excessive sintering and the need for high temperature heat. Compared to what has been reported previously, we observe higher splitting kinetics, resulting from the utilization of fine particles and well-controlled experiments which ensure a surface-limited-process. The peak rates with CZO are 85.9 mu mole g(-1) s(-1) at 900 degrees C and 61.2 mu mole g(-1) s(-1) at 700 degrees C, and those of CeO2 are 70.6 mu mole g(-1) s(-1) and 28.9 mu mole g(-1) s(-1). Kinetic models are developed to describe the ion incorporation dynamics, with consideration of CO2 activation and the charge transfer reactions. CO2 activation energy is found to be -120 kJ mole(-1) for CZO, half of that for CeO2, while CO desorption energetics is analogous between the two samples with a value of similar to 160 kJ mole(-1). The charge-transfer process is found to be the rate-limiting step for CO2 splitting. The evolution of CO32- with surface Ce3+ is examined based on the modeled kinetics. We show that the concentration of CO32- varies with Ce3+ in a linear-flattened-decay pattern, resulting from a mismatch between the kinetics of the two reactions. Our study provides new insights into the significant role of surface defects and adsorbates in determining the splitting kinetics.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000412271600056	28914306

Electron energy loss spectroscopy was used to study the migration and chemical state evolution of the elements. The oxidation process was accompanied by the formation of multilayered oxide scale, consisting of a crystalline oxide layer, amorphous oxide layer (Fe-poor) and Zr-Nb-Fe-O amorphous layer. The formation of closely bonded, semi-free and metallic iron species as well as the out diffusion of Fe contribute to the multilayered structure growth. The amorphization of the C14 phase occurred with the incorporation of oxygen, which preferentially bonded with Zr and Nb.									12	3	0	0	0	0	14			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:000502881500011

Density functional theory calculations indicated that the deposition of Pt NPs was favored on bTNTs with a preferred [004] orientation and a deposition mechanism occurring via oxygen vacancies, where electrons were localized. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy images revealed a graded deposition of Pt NPs with an average diameter of around 2.5 nm along the complete nanotube axis (length/pore diameter of 130 : 1). Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) studies in acidic electrolytes showed comparable results to bulk Pt (per geometric area) and Pt/C commercial catalysts (per mg of Pt). The presented novel HER cathodes of minimal engineering and low noble metal loadings (mu g cm(-2) range) achieved low Tafel slopes (30-34 mV dec(-1)) and high stability in acidic conditions.

Herein, MXene quantum dots (MQD) were grafted on a BiVO4 substrate, then a MoOx layer by combining an ultrathin oxyhydroxide oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC) was constructed as an integrated photoanode. The OEC/MoOx/MQD/BiVO4 array not only achieves a current density of 5.85 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), but also enhances photostability. From electrochemical analysis and density functional theory calculations, high PEC performance is ascribed to the incorporation of MoOx/MQD as hole transfer layers, retarding charge recombination, promoting hole transfer and accelerating water splitting kinetics. This proof-of-principle work not only demonstrates the potential utilization of hole transfer layers, but also sheds light on rational design and fabrication of integrated photoanodes for feasible solar energy conversion.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000758278900001	35142021

We considered [Fe-v(cyclam)(O)(2)](+) and [Fe-V(cyclam)(OH)(O)](2+) as the active catalytic species in liquid water for the water oxidation process and calculated the free-energy landscapes of various steps involved in the mechanistic pathway. Our microkinetics study of the oxygen-oxygen bond formation by both the active catalytic species reveals that the transfer of proton to the cis-oxo or hydroxide of the active catalytic species is the rate-determining step, and the transfer of the hydroxide to the iron-oxo moiety is the less free energetic path. Overall, the O-O bond formation by the active catalytic species [Fe-V(cyclam)(OH)(O)](2+) is more favorable. We carried out a partial charge analysis of the atoms involved in the reaction. From the Lowdin and Mulliken charge analysis on the atoms, we confirm that the addition of a water molecule takes place as the nucleophile that leads to the formation of the peroxide complex. The superoxide complex is formed from the peroxide complex through the proton-coupled electron transfer process. The electron transfer was confirmed by the analysis of the projected density of states (PDOS) and the local density of states. We presented the energetics of crystal field splitting for the peroxide and superoxide complexes based on the PDOS. In the case of liberation of dioxygen with addition of the water molecule, microkinetics analysis reveals that the, release of oxygen is a high free energetic step than the addition of water molecules. Overall, both steps involving the oxygen-oxygen bond formation and the release of oxygen molecules are possible in the case of [Fe-V(cyclam)(OH)(O)](2+) as the active catalytic species. These thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the water oxidation process may help in developing new water oxidation catalysts.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000507149600025

Using potentiodynamic sweeps and cyclic voltammetry techniques in the entire potential region where the positive plate of the battery operates, it was found that for the lead-Tydrolyte electrode system the same reactions take place as for lead in sulfuric acid solution, i.e. the new electrolyte does not change the thermodynamics of the lead-sulfuric acid electrode system and no new, specific to Tydrolyte reactions are taking place - qualitatively, the new electrolyte is not different from a regular sulfuric acid solution. It was observed, however, that Tydrolyte lowers the formation and growth rate of the anodic layer on the smooth electrode (quite similar to the corrosion layer of battery grids), as well as the rate of the oxygen evolution reaction, i.e. it affects the kinetics of the electrode reactions and indicates the possible cause for water loss reduction in batteries.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2352-152X			WOS:000530637100005

The present work demonstrates that solid solutions of zinc selenide and copper gallium selenide (ZnSe:CGSe), with absorption edges ranging from 480 to 750 nm, can be employed as H-2 evolution photocatalysts in particulate photocatalyst sheets for Z-scheme pure water splitting, where CoOx/BiVO4 and Au are used as the oxygen evolution photocatalyst and electron mediator, respectively. Photogenerated holes in the metal selenide are efficiently recombined with electrons from BiVO(4)via the Au layer, thus avoiding self-oxidation of the selenides and leading to stable pure water splitting. Varying the ZnSe:CGSe composition demonstrates that both the p-type semiconductor character and excellent photoelectrochemical properties of selenides are vital to efficient Z-scheme water splitting. This study extends the application field of metal selenides in photocatalytic pure water splitting and creates new opportunities for selenide-based photocatalytic systems for solar fuel production.									41	1	0	0	5	0	41			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463819400010

However, the development of water oxidation catalysts with high activity at low cost remains a great challenge. Herein, an in situ antisolvent approach is reported for synthesizing ultrathin Co-Ni layered double hydroxide (CoNi-LDH) nanosheets wrapped on hollow Co3O4 nanoparticle-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon (HCo3O4-NC) as a high-performance catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Although HCo3O4-NC or NiCo-LDH alone has little OER activity, their hybrid exhibits low overpotential and Tafel slope as well as high stability, due to the synergistic effect of Co3O4 and LDH. Furthermore, the hydrangea-like HCo3O4-NC@NiCo-LDH core@shell composite exhibits higher catalytic activity and stability than commercial IrO2, which makes it a high-performance nonprecious-metal-based catalyst for OER.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000419623600019	28950042

The performance of MoS2/Bi2O3 catalyst was examined for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, photoelectrochemical activity, and crystal violet (CV) dye degradation by comparing with pristine Bi2O3 and MoS2. The hydrogen evolution performances of 2-BO-MS catalyst exhibited 3075.21 mu mol g(-1)h(-1), which is 7.18 times higher than that of MoS2 (428.14 mu mol g(-1)h(-1). The XPS, XRD and HRTEM analyses covered that the superior photocatalytic performance of 2-BO-MS catalyst might have stemmed out due to the existence of oxygen vacancies, enhanced strong interfacial interaction between MoS2 and Bi2O3 and specific surface area. The in-depth investigation has been performed for MoS2/Bi2O3 Z-scheme heterojunction using several characterization techniques. Moreover, the photocatalytic mechanism for hydrogen evolution and photodegradation were proposed based on trapping experiment results. This results acquired using MoS2/Bi2O3 Z-scheme heterojunction would be stepping stone for developing heterojunction catalyst towards attaining outstanding photocatalytic activity.

Another focus of the research is the potential of MoSx nanofilms as a precursor for MoOz(S) nanofilms, which enhance the efficiency of the photo-activated oxygen evolution reaction (OER) using the MoOz(S)/WO3/FTO heterostructures. The nanocrystalline WO3 film was created by laser ablation of a W target in dry air at a substrate temperature of 420 degrees C. Amorphous MoSx nanofilms (2 <= x <= 12) were obtained by laser ablation of an Mo target in H2S gas of varied pressure at room temperature of the substrate. Studies of the energy band structures showed that for all MoSx/WO3/FTO samples, photo-activated HER in an acid solution proceeded through the Z-scheme. The highest photoelectrochemical HER efficiency (a photocurrent density similar to 1 mA/cm(2) at a potential of similar to 0 V under Xe lamp illumination (similar to 100 mW/cm(2))) was found for porous MoS4.5 films containing the highest concentration of catalytically active sites attributed to S ligands. During the anodic posttreatment of porous MoSx nanofilms, MoOz(S) films with a narrow energy band gap were formed. The highest OER efficiency (a photocurrent density similar to 5.3 mA/cm(2) at 1.6 V) was detected for MoOz(S)/WO3/FTO photoanodes that were prepared by posttreatment of the MoSx similar to 3.2 precursor. The MoOz(S) film contributed to the effective photogeneration of electron-hole pairs that was followed by the transport of photoelectrons from MoOz(S) into the WO3 film and the effective participation of holes possessing strong oxidation ability in the OER on the surface of the MoOz(S) film.									6	0	2	0	0	0	8				2079-4991		WOS:000540781800054	32365935

The present work comprises the integration of photocatalyst with wide visible photon absorption material which is vital for hydrogen evolution in photo-electrocatalytic water splitting. Herein, the 1D WO3 NWs have been integrated with stable water oxidation photocatalysts of BiVO4 and Bi2S3 as a photoanode (Bi2S3/BiVO4/WO3) for photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution reactions. The morphological variations in the Bi2S3/BiVO4/WO3 heterostructure manifest catalytic activity and rapid charge transfer characteristics owing to band alignment and a wide range of visible photon absorption. The optimized Bi2S3/BiVO4/WO3 multidimensional photoanode accomplishes a superior photocurrent density of 1.52 mA/cm(2), a seven-fold higher than pristine WO3 photoanode counterpart (0.2 mA/cm(2)) at 1 V vs. RHE. A prodigious lowest onset potential of -0.01 V vs. RHE) has been achieved which enables very high solar to hydrogen conversion. The photoelectrode with entangled morphology such as nanosheets, nanocrystals and nanorods expanded their surface to volume ratio having enhanced catalytic performance. The hybrid photoanodes have demonstrated the lowest charge transfer resistance of 360 Ohm/cm(2) with a 7-fold rise in hydrogen evolution performance. The resultant triadic Bi2S3/BiVO4/WO3 heterostructure appeared to be an emerging stable photo-electro catalyst for hydrogen evolution applications. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM), photoluminescence spectrum (PL), Raman spectrum and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are employed to characterize the physical and chemical properties and indicate that MoO3 is easily formed from MoS2. The result of AFM shows that thickness of the film increases from 0.9 to 1.79 nm after oxygen plasma treatment, which is mainly due to the difference in lattice structure between pristine MoS2 and generated MoO3. XPS analysis shows that the intensity of the S2s peak is reduced to 0 after oxygen plasma treatment. Also, the intensities of Mo4+ peaks disappear at 233.2 eV and 230 eV, leaving only the Mo6+ peaks at 232.5 eV and 235.65 eV, which strongly proves the transformation of MoS2 to MoO3. Further, we use oxygen plasma to treat few-layer MoS2, and find that the top oxidized layer can protect the lower MoS2 from further oxidation. Finally, we obtain p-type doped transistors with this method.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000490120000069

In this work, we investigate the surface reconstruction of CoP nanosheets by an in situ electrochemical activation method. After remodeling, CoP nanosheets experience an irreversible and significant evolution of the morphology and composition, and low-valence Co complexes consisting of Co(OH)(x) species are formed on the surface of CoP nanosheets, and they largely accelerate the dissociation of water. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of CoP and Co(OH)(x), the working electrode shows a remarkably enhanced HER activity of 100 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 76 mV dec(-1), which is better than that of most transition metal phosphide catalysts.

To better the performance of Pt catalyst for hydrogen evolution, a layer of TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2 NTs) fabricated on titanium mesh (3D-Ti) or plate Ti (P-Ti) substrate, respectively, has been selected as support materials to load Pt nanocluster (Pt-x/TiO2 NTs@3D-Ti and Pt-x/TiO2 NTs@P-Ti) via an atomic layer deposition method. It has been revealed that one chemical bond of Ti-O-Pt had been formed between Pt nanocluster and TiO2 nanotube. The theoretical calculations confirm that Ti-O-Pt bond can not only improve the stability of Pt nanocluster but also improve its capability for hydrogen evolution. In addition, the 3D-Ti substrate with open structure can further better Pt nanoclusters' performance on hydrogen evolution. The obtained Pt-x/TiO2 NTs@3D-Ti electrode exhibits an overpotential of 53 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 at -10 mA cm(-2), and its mass activity has been improved by a factor of 18 compared with Pt-x/TiO2 NTs@P-Ti.

A series of La(1 & minus;x)AgxCoO3 (x = 0, 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5%) perovskite catalysts were synthesized by sodium EDTA & minus;citric acid complexation. La97.5Ag2.5CoO3 shows the best catalytic activity with the solubility range at the perovskite A site, with T90, T50, and T10 values of 448, 358, and 302 degrees C, respectively. Moreover, with the presence of 5% steam, these values decreased to 404, 320, and 276 degrees C, respectively. H2-TPR and O2-TPD characterization confirmed that after the A site was partially replaced by Ag+, the improvement of catalytic performance was attributed to the easier formation of oxygen vacancies and the enhancement of lattice oxygen transportation at low temperatures. According to the in situ DRIFTS study, the La97.5Ag2.5CoO3 catalyst had two active centers, including Co3+ and oxygen vacancies. Density functional theory calculations verified that after adding Ag, the formation energy of surface oxygen vacancies was decreased from 0.629 to 0.383 eV, and the oxygen vacancies began to participate in the reaction as an active site. In addition, the stable Co & minus;O & minus;N & minus;Olatt adsorption structure on LaAgCoO3 indicates that there was a synergistic effect between the Co3+ and oxygen vacancy sites. From the experimental and theoretical results, the cyclic redox mechanism of NO-assisted soot oxidation over the LaAgCoO3 catalyst is proposed. Our work reveals the activity evolution of oxygen vacancies in perovskites and the interaction mechanism between the oxygen vacancies and the adjacent metal sites, which provides a promising strategy for the rational design of high-performance perovskite oxidation catalysts.<comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000758014300003

First, it is pointed out that published experimental thermonuclear reaction rates have no rigorous statistical meaning. To overcome this problem, we have been working for the past 3 years on a new method of estimating experimental reaction rates by using a Monte Carlo method. Our new reaction rate evaluation for charged-particle reactions on A=14-40 target nuclei, which is based on this method, has just been completed. With these new reaction rates, many interesting aspects of nucleosynthesis and energy generation can be addressed that were previously not accessible. Second, as an example for a direct measurement, we discuss the recent study of the direct capture component in the O-17(p,gamma)F-18 reaction at our LENA facility. The O-17+p reactions in classical novae are particularly important for the production of radioactive nuclei (mainly F-18), for the Galactic origin of O-17, and for oxygen isotopic ratios in nova presolar grains. Third, as an example for an indirect measurement, we discuss the recent Mg-26 nuclear resonance fluorescence study at our HI gamma S facility. By measuring angular correlations using a linearly polarized gamma-ray beam, we determined the spins and parities of 5 levels near the alpha-particle threshold in Mg-26. Thus we could substantially reduce the rate uncertainties for the Ne-22(alpha,n)Mg-25 neutron source. Our new reaction rates may have an important impact on the s-process in both massive stars and in AGB stars.

The model includes a homogeneous reaction in the electrolyte in which species AB reacts reversibly to form A(-) and B+ and B+ reacts electrochemically on a rotating disk electrode to produce B. The resulting diffusion impedance has two asymmetric capacitive loops, one associated with convective diffusion and the other with the homogeneous reaction. For an infinitely fast homogeneous reaction, the system is shown to behave as though AB is the electroactive species. A modified Gerischer impedance was found to provide a good fit to the simulated data. (C) The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS.

J	Manoj, Kelath Murali; Gade, Sudeep Kumar; Mathew, Lazar								Cytochrome P450 Reductase: A Harbinger of Diffusible Reduced Oxygen Species								PLOS ONE				5	10					e13272	10.1371/journal.pone.0013272				OCT 13 2010	2010	The bi-enzymatic system of cytochrome P450 (CYP, a hemoprotein) and cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR, a diflavoenzyme) mediate the redox metabolism of diverse indigenous and xenobiotic molecules in various cellular and organ systems, using oxygen and NADPH. Curiously, when a 1: 1 ratio is seen to be optimal for metabolism, the ubiquitous CYP: CPR distribution ratio is 10 to 100: 1 or higher. Further, the NADPH equivalents consumed in these in vitro or in situ assemblies usually far exceeded the amount of substrate metabolized. We aimed to find the rationale to explain for these two oddities. We report here that CPR is capable of activating molecular oxygen on its own merit, generating diffusible reduced oxygen species (DROS). Also, in the first instance for a flavoprotein, CPR is shown to deplete peroxide via diffusible radical mediated process, thereby leading to the formation of water (but without significant evolution of oxygen). We also quantitatively demonstrate that the rate of oxygen activation and peroxide depletion by CPR accounts for the major reactivity in the CYP+CPR mixture. We show unambiguously that CPR is able to regulate the concentration of diffusible reduced oxygen species in the reaction milieu. These findings point out that CPR mediated processes are bound to be energetically 'wasteful' and potentially 'hazardous' owing to the unavoidable nature of the CPR to generate and deplete DROS. Hence, we can understand that CPR is distributed at low densities in cells. Some of the activities that were primarily attributed to the heme-center of CYP are now established to be a facet of the flavins of CPR. The current approach of modeling drugs to minimize "uncoupling" on the basis of erstwhile hypothesis stands questionable, considering the ideas brought forth in this work.									29	0	0	0	25	0	32			1932-6203			WOS:000282869800009	20967245

The addition of Sn could refine grain of Pb-Ca alloy. As the Sn content increased from 0.1% to 2.0%, the corrosion current of Pb-Ca alloy decreased by 55% at 1.2 V, the formation quantity of corrosion film reduced by 49% ,the lost weight of working electrode reduced by 75% after galvanostatic anodic corrosion for 3 d under 0.5 A/cm2; The conversion impedance of corrosion film falled down to 4.1 Omega/cm2, the hydrogen evolution or oxygen evolution reaction rate decreased at the same cathodic or anodic polarization potential.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1001-1579			INSPEC:16530710

To enhance the efficiency in hydrogen peroxide generation, herein, we introduce two types of cooperative N vacancies, i.e., NHx and N-2C vacancy, into the framework of polymeric carbon nitride. It is found that the optimized sample delivers a 15 times enhancement in solar-driven H2O2 production as well as excellent stability. And the apparent quantum efficiency reached to 26.78% and 11.86% at 340 nm and 420 nm, respectively. A series of comparative experiments and density functional theory calculations both reveal that NHx and N-2C vacancies can accelerate photoexcited charge separation and assist in activating oxygen in the two-electron pathway, respectively. The strategy of targeted introducing two types of cooperative N vacancies provides a novel and promising solution to design and develop efficient catalyst in various photocatalytic reactions. This work will motivate future work in defect chemistry towards various photocatalytic reactions.									67	3	0	0	11	0	68			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000514218900028

In this context, there is a growing interest in harvesting energy from the large near-infrared (NIR) range of solar radiation (approx. 60% in terms of the photon number or 40% of the energy from the sun's total incoming radiation) for various energy and environmental applications. The immediate goal is to bridge the gaps of photocatalysts by shifting NIR photons into UV-VIS ones through up-conversion photonic mechanisms. Here we present different photonic materials (glasses, crystals and solvothermal core-shell nanocrystals) showing high intense NIR-to-UV-VIS upconversion luminescence. Photocatalytic degradation of organic dye methylene blue as a pollutant model has been successfully attained under NIR radiation. We have also successfully achieved hydrogen and oxygen evolution via water-splitting using Al-doped SrTiO3 (STO:Al) photocatalyst, loaded with rhodium-chromium oxide (RhCrOx) as a hydrogen evolution cocatalyst in order to enable the overall water-splitting reaction. Both experiments have been carried out under low-power commercial 980 nm laser irradiation. Up-conversion driven photocatalysis is proved, as a solely photonic effect, converting incident NIR radiation before reaching the contaminated solution. We also explore the implementation of rare-earth doped upconversion materials with the performance of luminescent solar concentrators (LSC), as a promising option for enhancing the efficiency of optical devices.

The equilibrium states of O-16(2), (OO)-O-16-O-18, and O-18(2) evolution differ from the theoretical binomial distributions, which are expected under the prerequisite of ideal mixing of the water molecules and that of the chemical equivalence of (H2O)-O-18 and (H2O)-O-16 for an infinite cluster. The presence of tills deviation means that there is a typical size of water clusters having access to cleavage by the water splitting enzyme.

By ejecting NPs onto a closely positioned ultramicroelectrode (UME), one can study single-particle collision electrochemistry in acid concentrations as high as 3 M or 750 mM on the electrode surface. This is nearly 2 orders of magnitude greater than previously reported in NP-collision studies. The use of high-bandwidth recording and higher acid concentration allows us to temporally resolve the ultrafast hydrogen adsorption and evolution processes in HER on single colliding Pt NPs. Moreover, the electroactive surface area (EASA) and roughness factor (Rf) of single Pt NPs can be readily derived from the integrated hydrogen adsorption charge. The use of high acid concentrations is critical toward obtaining a full monolayer of adsorbed hydrogen before overlapping with the evolution process. This method allows one to study electrochemical and electrocatalytic behavior of metal NPs in a chemical environment that is close to that used in real applications, for example, fuel cells and electrolyzers.									19	1	0	0	0	0	20			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000462098300037	30785269

Scott, Stuart/0000-0002-4597-9094			CO2-gasification of a lignite coal in the presence of an iron-based oxygen carrier for chemical-looping combustion								FUEL				127				186	201		10.1016/j.fuel.2013.07.045				JUL 1 2014	2014	Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) has the inherent property of separating the product CO2 from flue gases. Instead of air, it uses an oxygen carrier, usually in the form of a metal oxide, to provide oxygen for combustion. All techniques so far proposed for chemical looping with solid fuels involve initially the gasification of the solid fuel in order for the gaseous products to react with the oxygen carrier. Here, the rates of gasification of coal were compared when gasification was undertaken in a fluidised bed of either (i) an active Fe-based oxygen carrier used for chemical looping or (ii) inert sand. This enabled an examination of the ability of chemical looping materials to enhance the rate of gasification of solid fuels. Batch gasification and chemical-looping combustion experiments with a German lignite and its char are reported, using an electrically-heated fluidised bed reactor at temperatures from 1073 to 1223 K. The fluidising gas was CO2 in nitrogen. The kinetics of the gasification were found to be significantly faster in the presence of the oxygen carrier, especially at temperatures above 1123 K. A numerical model was developed to account for external and internal mass transfer and for the effect of the looping agent. The model also included the effects of the evolution of the pore structure at different conversions. The presence of Fe2O3 led to an increase in the rate of gasification because of the rapid oxidation of CO by the oxygen carrier to CO2. This resulted in the removal of CO and maintained a higher mole fraction of CO2 in the mixture of gas around the particle of char, i. e. within the mass transfer boundary layer surrounding the particle. This effect was most prominent at about 20% conversion when (i) the surface area for reaction was at its maximum and (ii) because of the accompanying increase in porosity and pore size, intraparticle resistance to gas mass transfer within the particle of char had fallen, compared with that in the initial particle. Excellent agreement was observed between the rates predicted by the numerical model and those observed experimentally. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Singh, Ravi; Frenklach, Michael								A mechanistic study of the influence of graphene curvature on the rate of high-temperature oxidation by molecular oxygen								CARBON				101				203	212		10.1016/j.carbon.2016.01.090				MAY 2016	2016	Kinetic Monte-Carlo (KMC) simulations of the evolution of a graphene sheet in combustion-like environments were performed using a set of newly established elementary reactions of graphene-edge oxidation by O-2. The KMC results revealed two principal pathways for an oxyradical site: oxidation and regeneration of an aromatic radical site. The two pathways compete for oxyradicals, but exclusion of the regeneration pathway does not significantly affect the oxidation rate. Examination of the morphology of the evolving graphene edges indicated that the addition of O-2 promotes the formation of five-member rings embedded in the graphene. The overall oxidation rate of the graphene was computed to be time dependent, with reactivity decreasing over time as the ratio of reactive edge sites decreases relative to the number of basal-plane carbon atoms. At the same time, the oxidation rate was found to be higher for graphene with a higher initial curvature. Both results are in accord with experimental observations. Analysis showed that distinct aspects of graphene-edge morphology are responsible for curvature either raising or reducing the oxidative reactivity of the graphene edge. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although more than two-thirds of known mineral species have biological imprints, how the biotransformation of minerals may have benefited microbial development, beyond nutritional and energetic use, remains enigmatic. In this research, we have shown that biogenic ferrihydrite nanoparticles are extensively formed at the interface between an actively growing fungus and an iron-containing mineral, hematite. These biogenic nanoparticles formed through the fungus-hematite interactions can behave as mimetic catalysts, similar to nanozymes that imitate peroxidase, which scavenges hydrogen peroxide for the mitigation of potential cytotoxicity. Evidence from various X-ray spectroscopic analyses indicated that non-lattice oxygen in the nanomaterials was chiefly responsible for this catalytic activity, rather than through the conventional mechanisms of iron redox chemistry. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution (similar to 30 nm) 3D volume rendering, and biomass analyses further confirmed that the organism was active and capable of mediating the catalytic reactions. We therefore hypothesize that this confers an advantage to the organism in terms of protection from oxidative stress and ensuring the acquisition of essential iron. This work raises new questions about the roles of biogenic nanomaterials in the coevolution of the lithosphere and biosphere and provides a step toward understanding the feedback pathways controlling the evolution of biogenic mineral formation.									19	3	0	0	11	0	20			0960-9822	1879-0445		WOS:000555598100006	32531287

However, they are still significantly limited by sluggish electrochemical kinetics and irreversibility originating from the parasitic reactions of the bifunctional catalysts and electrolytes. Here, we report the preferential in situ building of interfacial structures featuring the edge sites constituted by FeCo single/dual atoms with the integration of Co sites in the nitrogenized graphitic carbon frameworks (FeCo SAs@Co/N- GC) by electronic structure modulation approach. Compared to commercial Pt/C and RuO2, FeCo SAs@Co/N-GC reveals exceptional electrochemical performance, reversible redox kinetics, and durability toward oxygen reduction and evolution reactions under universal pH environments, i.e., alkaline, neutral, and acidic, due to synergistic effect at interfaces and preferred charge/mass transfer. The aqueous (alkaline, nonalkaline, and acidic electrolytes) ZACs constructed with a FeCo SAs@Co/N-GC cathode tolerate stable operations, have significant reversibility, and have the highest energy densities, outperforming those of noble metal counterparts and state-of-the-art ZACs in the ambient atmosphere. Additionally, flexible solid-state ZACs demonstrate excellent mechanical and electrochemical performances with a highest power density of 186 mW cm(-2), specific capacity of 817 mAh gZ(n)(-1), energy density of 1017 Wh kgZ(n)(-1), and cycle life >680 cycles with extremely harsh operating conditions, which illustrates the great potential of triphasic catalyst for green energy storage technologies.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000703553600065	34412470

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Preparing 1-branch-leaf-type heterogeneous structure full hydrolysis catalyst involves cutting foamed nickel into sheets, cleaning, and drying. A nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)26H2O) and sodium molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO42H2O) are mixed to obtain mixed solution. The concentrations of Ni(NO3)26H2O and Na2MoO42H2O in the mixed solution are respectively 0.05plus minus0.005 molar (M) and 1.3.

After sulfide reaction, MOF-Ni@MOF-Fe-S is vulcanized by MOF-Ni@MOF-Fe with a structure of interwoven and folding nanosheets. Meanwhile, Ni3S2 is formed under the influence of iron. This special structure makes MOF-Ni@MOF-Fe-S to expose more active sites. MOF-Ni@MOF-Fe-S shows superior urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. When MOF-Ni@MOF-Fe-S is used as UOR and HER catalysts, it has low potentials of 1.347 V (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) and 0.145 V (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea, respectively. MOF-Ni@MOF-Fe-S as a bifunctional electrode is assembled as an alkaline urea electrolyzer, showing catalytic activity at a low cell voltage of 1.539 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability during 10 h chronopotentiometry analysis.									23	1	0	0	1	0	23			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000532288400027	32285053

Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical assembly nanostructure consisting of ultrathin Ir-doped Pd nanosheets has been well designed, which could serve as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for advanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and liquid fuel electrooxidation. In particular, the optimized Pd83.5Ir16.5 nanocatalyst displays excellent electrocatalytic HER performance with an overpotential of only 73 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) along with excellent stability. More importantly, it can also show outstanding electrocatalytic performance for liquid fuel oxidation with a mass activity of 4326.1 mA mg(metal)(-1) for ethylene glycol oxidation reaction. Mechanistic study reveals that the highly porous 3D nanostructure, the modulation of electronic structure after the introduction of Ir, not only guarantees a high level of exposure of surface active sites and smooth charge transfer but also generates the new active centers for facilitating the adsorption of H2O and recombination of H*, thereby dramatically increasing the intrinsic activity of electrocatalysis.									40	0	0	0	2	0	41			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000518088800079	32081007

The 3DG frameworks could provide large surface area for assembling WS2 nanosheets and continuous pathways for rapid electron transfer and ion transport; and the WS2 nanosheets with an expanded interlayer spacing of 9.58 angstrom, due to oxygen incorporation, could afford more space for lithium ion intercalation and more active sites for hydrogen evolution. The as-prepared WS2/3DG composite exhibits a high capacity of 766 mA h g(-1) and excellent cycling stability for lithium storage, much better than its annealed counterpart and bulk WS2. The hydrated sheet of WS2/3DG also demonstrates boosted electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction, possessing a low onset overpotential of 75 mV and an extremely large current density of 137 mA cm(-2) at 300 mV with remarkable durability. This work may open up a new pathway for improving the electrochemical properties by synergistically optimizing the electrode architectures and the intrinsic electroactivity of the active materials.									107	10	0	0	5	0	110			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000365205000057		
J	Jin, Jian; Walczak, Karl; Singh, Meenesh R.; Karp, Chris; Lewis, Nathan S.; Xiang, Chengxiang				Singh, Meenesh/T-9489-2019; xiang, chengxiang/B-5106-2010	Singh, Meenesh/0000-0002-3638-8866; 			An experimental and modeling/simulation-based evaluation of the efficiency and operational performance characteristics of an integrated, membrane-free, neutral pH solar-driven water-splitting system								ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE				7	10			3371	3380		10.1039/c4ee01824a				OCT 2014	2014	The efficiency limits, gas-crossover behavior, formation of local pH gradients near the electrode surfaces, and safety characteristics have been evaluated experimentally as well as by use of multi-physics modeling and simulation methods for an integrated solar-driven water-splitting system that operates with bulk electrolyte solutions buffered at near-neutral pH. The integrated membrane-free system utilized a triple-junction amorphous hydrogenated Si (a-Si:H) cell as the light absorber, Pt and cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen-evolution reaction (OER), respectively, and a bulk aqueous solution buffered at pH = 9.2 by 1.0 M of boric acid/borate as an electrolyte. Although the solar-to-electrical efficiency of the stand-alone triple-junction a-Si:H photovoltaic cell was 7.7%, the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency for the integrated membrane-free water-splitting system was limited under steady-state operation to 3.2%, and the formation of pH gradients near the electrode surfaces accounted for the largest voltage loss. The membrane-free system exhibited negligible product-recombination loss while operating at current densities near 3.0 mA cm(-2), but exhibited significant crossover of products (up to 40% H-2 in the O-2 chamber), indicating that the system was not intrinsically safe. A system that contained a membrane to minimize the gas crossover, but which was otherwise identical to the membrane-free system, yielded very low energy-conversion efficiencies at steady state, due to low transference numbers for protons across the membranes resulting in electrodialysis of the solution and the consequent formation of large concentration gradients of both protons and buffer counterions near the electrode surfaces. The modeling and simulation results showed that despite the addition of 1.0 M of buffering agent to the bulk of the solution, during operation significant pH gradients developed near the surfaces of the electrodes. Hence, although the bulk electrolyte was buffered to near-neutral pH, the electrode surfaces and electrocatalysts experienced local environments under steady-state operation that were either highly acidic or highly alkaline in nature, changing the chemical form of the electrocatalysts and exposing the electrodes to potentially corrosive local pH conditions. In addition to significant pH gradients, the STH conversion efficiency of both types of systems was limited by the mass transport of ionic species to the electrode surfaces. Even at operating current densities of <3 mA cm(-2), the voltage drops due to these pH gradients exceeded the combined electrocatalyst overpotentials for the hydrogen- and oxygen-evolution reactions at current densities of 10 mA cm(-2). Hence, such near-neutral pH solar-driven water-splitting systems were both fundamentally limited in efficiency and/or co-evolved explosive mixtures of H-2(g) and O-2(g) in the presence of active catalysts for the recombination of H-2(g) and O-2(g).Broader contextDevelopment of an integrated solar-driven water-splitting system has received increasing attention for large-scale solar-energy-conversion and storage applications. To develop an efficient, scalable and safe technology, a cation-exchange membrane ran anion-exchange membrane is typically employed to separate the gaseous products and minimize the recombination losses in the system, as well as for other system design reasons. As a result, acidic or strong alkaline electrolytes are required to reduce the solution transport losses in the cell and to obtain high transference numbers for protons through the membrane. Alternatively, several studies have reported solar-drived water-splitting devices that operate in bulk electrolytes buffered to near-neutral pH in the absence of a membrane. However, the potential losses due to the pH gradient at the surface of the electrodes, and losses due to product crossover and recombination were not fully understood for those devices. To develop a stable, scalable and safe technology, these loss mechanisms and safety characteristics need to be critically addressed.									129	2	0	0	18	0	130			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000342884300021		
J	Shui, Jiang-Ian; Chen, Chen; Li, James C. M.								Evolution of Nanoporous Pt-Fe Alloy Nanowires by Dealloying and their Catalytic Property for Oxygen Reduction Reaction								ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS				21	17			3357	3362		10.1002/adfm.201100723				SEP 9 2011	2011	The short life and high cost of carbon-supported Pt nanoparticle catalysts (Pt/C) are two main problems with proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Porous Pt alloy nanowires have more durability and catalytic activity than Pt/C. Dealloying is a facile way to make nanoporous Pt. However, the process of porosity formation is difficult to control. In this paper, electrospinning and chemical dealloying techniques are used to make long, thin and yet nanoporous Pt-Fe alloy nanowires. The evolution of nanoporosity is observed and studied. It is found that non-uniform composition in the precursor PtFe(5) alloy nanowires helps the formation of nanoporous structure. The overall wire diameter is about 10-20 nm and the ligament diameter only 2-3 nm. These porous long nanowires interweave to form a self-supporting network with a high specific activity, 2.3 times that of conventional Pt/C catalysts, and also have better durability.									184	13	0	0	12	0	193			1616-301X			WOS:000295184400020

The PA is used not only as chelating agent to form Ni-Co@PA coating but also as solid phosphorus source to safely synthesize heterostructured NiCo-NiCoP. The as-prepared NiCo-NiCoP@PCT used as bifunctional electrodes exhibit superiorly electrocatalytic performance toward both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a low overpotential of 135 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and anodic oxidation reaction of formaldehyde (FOR) with an ultra-low overpotential of 1.18 V to acquire 10 mA cm-2. Besides, when a two-electrode cell is constructed by using NiCo-NiCoP@PCT as anode and cathode, the current density of formaldehyde-based water electrolysis (50 mA cm-2) is 6.25 times bigger than that of conventional water splitting (8 mA cm-2) at the same voltage of 1.76 V. In addition, methanol (CH3OH) is produced simultaneously by hydrogenation reduction reaction of formaldehyde at the cathode, which realized the upgraded conversion of HCHO to small molecular fuel by electrocatalytic reduction. Therefore, it is demonstrated that the two-electrode electrolyzer not only realize the oxidative degradation and upgraded conversion of formaldehyde-based wastewater, but also reduce the energy consumption of water splitting for hydrogen generation. This work presents a new idea of controllable preparation for multifunctional phosphide electrodes and a novel construction of electrochemical cell to realize efficient hydrogen energy preparation and environmental management.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729119300001

A high redox potential reaction center is a prerequisite for the evolution of the water-oxidizing complex of photosystem II. Therefore, it is likely that high-potential phototrophy originally evolved to oxidize alternative electron donors that utilized simpler redox chemistry, such as nitrite or Mn. To determine whether nitrite could have had a role in the transition to high-potential phototrophy, we sequenced and analyzed the genome of Thiocapsa KS1, a Gammaproteobacteria capable of anoxygenic phototrophic nitrite oxidation. The genome revealed a high metabolic flexibility, which likely allows Thiocapsa KS1 to colonize a great variety of habitats and to persist under fluctuating environmental conditions. We demonstrate that Thiocapsa KS1 does not utilize a high-potential reaction center for phototrophic nitrite oxidation, which suggests that this type of phototrophic nitrite oxidation did not drive the evolution of high-potential phototrophy. In addition, phylogenetic and biochemical analyses of the nitrite oxidoreductase (NXR) from Thiocapsa KS1 illuminate a complex evolutionary history of nitrite oxidation. Our results indicate that the NXR in Thiocapsa originates from a different nitrate reductase clade than the NXRs in chemolithotrophic nitrite oxidizers, suggesting that multiple evolutionary trajectories led to modern nitrite-oxidizing bacteria.									21	5	0	0	22	0	26			1751-7362	1751-7370		WOS:000387035700010	27093047

Herein, we describe the direct growth of a film consisting of interconnected Co-entrapped, N-doped carbon nanotubes on carbon cloth using chemical vapor deposition from dicyanodiamine using a Co3O4 nanowire array as catalyst. This integrated architecture is used as a flexible 3D electrode for the electrolytic hydrogen evolution with outstanding catalytic activity and durability in acidic media. Moreover, this electrode is also highly efficient under neutral and basic conditions. It offers us an attractive carbon-based metal-deficient HER catalyst outperforming most transition-metal and all metal-free/deficient catalysts.									66	0	0	0	0	0	66			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000355839300004	25916622

After heat treatment in air, the layered structure in the original interfacial reaction layer disappears, accompanied by the aggregation and growth of the interfacial products. The thickness of the reaction layer increased first and then stabilized. Under the action of the concentration gradient, the residual copper oxide diffused along the pores of BCFN matrix and continued to react with the matrix until it exhausted. The types of interfacial products remained unchanged, which were Ba2Cu2O5 and Co-Cu-O (solid solution). However, serious decomposition of interfacial products (Ba2Cu2O5) occurred due to the low oxygen partial pressure after heat treatment in argon, resulting in the formation of holes and cracks. Part of cobalt precipitated from the BCFN matrix and formed a cobalt-rich phase at the junction of Ag-Cu alloy and interfacial reaction zone. Results showed that the joint microstructure is unstable at high temperature. Controlling the amount of the interfacial products formed during brazing is key to improving the stability of the joint, which provides a theoretical support for further optimizing the sealing quality of membrane components.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2187-0764			WOS:000647720500001

Herein, a new type of surface sulfur-vacancy (Vs)-modified Ru/ZnIn2S4(Ru-ZIS-Vs) Mott-Schottky heterojunction is elaborately proposed as an electrocatalyst. The sulfur vacancy enables the exposure of the interface defects of ZnIn2S4, leading it to bridge well with the doped Ru to build a metal/semiconductor interface of a typical Mott-Schottky catalyst. This change is confirmed to activate the surface and enhance the catalytic activity of ZnIn2S4. In addition, by combining the surface sulfur vacancies with the fabricated Mott-Schottky heterostructure, the electronic structure and the energy band position of the Ru-ZIS-Vs catalyst can be effectively regulated, further driving rapid electron transfer. As a proof of concept, the Ru-ZIS-Vs-catalyzed Li-O(2)battery exhibited an excellent discharge capacity of 3532 mA h g(-1)at a current density of 500 mA g(-1)with reduced overpotentials (0.39 V during discharging and 0.38 V during charging), and enhanced cycling life (321 cycles). This proposed strategy of constructing a heterojunction with the surface defect modification is expected to be an effective way to synergistically boost the performance of the Li-O(2)batteries.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000541615200022

The development of efficient technologies and methods is the premise and guarantee to realize the high-value conversion of biomass. 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), as a versatile biomass platform compound, is generated via dehydration of hexoses (e. g., fructose and glucose) derived from cellulosic biomass. This Review gives an overview of the advances and challenges of electro- and photocatalytic oxidation of biomass-derived HMF to high-value chemicals such as 2,5-formylfuran (DFF) and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). These strategies and methods for the preparation of high-value chemicals by electro- and photocatalytic oxidation of HMF, coupled with, for example, hydrogen evolution reaction, organic substrate reduction, CO2 reduction reaction, or N-2 reduction reaction, were summarized and discussed. Moreover, the catalytic efficiency and mechanism of different types of catalysts were also introduced in these conversion systems.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000753685200001	35050546

Herein, this work reports the fabrication of a metal and hetero atom co-doped fibrous carbon structure derived from cotton textile wastes and its use as an efficient OER catalyst. The free-standing fibrous carbon structure, fabricated with a simple two-step carbonization process, has a high specific surface area of 1796 m(2)/g and a uniform distribution of Fe3O4/NiS nanoparticles (Fe3O4/NiS@CC). The composite exhibits excellent OER performance with an onset potential of 1.44 V and a low overpotential of 310 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in a 1.0 M KOH solution, which even surpass commercial RuO2 catalyst. Additionally, this ternary catalyst shows remarkable long-term stability without current density loss after continuous operation for 26 h. It can be believed that the outstanding OER performance is attributed to the synergistic effect between the iron oxides and nickel sulphides, as well as the micro-meso porous carbon structure. This study demonstrates a new strategy to use conventional textile materials to prepare highly efficient electrocatalysts; it also provides a simple approach to turn textile waste into valuable products.

In view of appropriate hydrogen binding strength on metallic Ni and promoted Volmer step on Ni(OH)(2) as well as potential impact of Ni3S4 on Ni/Ni(OH)(2), Ni3S4/Ni/Ni(OH)(2) on Ti mesh (TM) is prepared rapidly by a simple one-pot electrodeposition. The sample prepared under 0.2 M Ni(NO3)(2), 1.5 M thiourea and applied potential of -1.0 V (denoted as Ni3S4/Ni/Ni(OH)(2)/TM-0.2) exhibits excellent HER activity with overpotential (eta) of 54 mV at -10 mA/cm(2) and Tafel slope of 70 mV/dec, exceeding most of transitional metal-based electrocatalysts. The superior HER activity and long-term durability can be ascribed to strong synergistic effect and coupling effect between Ni3S4, Ni and Ni(OH)(2). This work gives a simple and fast synthetic strategy for depositing highly active ternary Ni3S4/Ni/Ni(OH)(2) hybrid HER electrocatalyst on conductive substrate surface, which is suitable for large-scale production.

J	Boissonneau, P; Thibault, JP								Experimental analysis of couplings between electrolysis and hydrodynamics in the context of MHD in seawater								JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS				32	18			2387	2398		10.1088/0022-3727/32/18/310				SEP 21 1999	1999	The work presented is entirely devoted to the coupling between electrochemistry and hydrodynamics. It takes place in the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of a seawater context for direct propulsion or flow control. The experimental measurements reported were carried out in the small seawater tunnel of our laboratory using seawater with a NaCl concentration of 35 g l(-1). The first aspect of our study is the possible effect of electrolysis micro-bubbles on the how for instance, leading to a possible modification of the turbulent boundary layer or the effect of the flow on bubble characteristics. The second aspect is the effect of the flow conditions on the electrode working conditions, for instance the effective electroactive species and the electrode potential evolution. The main conclusions are that the electrolysis micro-bubbles do not affect the flow in the domain considered, but, in contrast, flow conditions act on bubble size and distribution. On the other hand, the competition between electroactive species (i.e. anodic reactions) is entirely controlled by the flow. Which means, from a practical point of view, that there is no opportunity to select an anode material that enables the selection of oxygen evolution instead of chlorine in the conditions prescribed by seawater MHD applications.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0022-3727			WOS:000082801100012

Effect of nature of side anion on kinetics of anodic processes in 'Chromispel' electrolytes developed for chromium plating								TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF METAL FINISHING				92	2			108	114		10.1179/0020296713Z.000000000136				MAR 2014	2014	Electrochemical chromium plating was carried out in non-standard 'Chromispel' electrolytes containing halogenide instead of sulphate anions. The amount of halogenide anions were varied through changing the CrO3 : I- and CrO3: Cl- ratios within the range from 15 : 1 to 35 : 1. Some of the electrolytes used were also contained. Cyclic voltammetry and a kinetic method were applied for electrode polarisation determination. A anode, plate cathodes and a saturated calomel electrode were used. It was found that the nature of the side anion affected the values. In the Cl 2 containing electrolytes they were found twice as high as those in the presence of I 2 ions. The polarisation curves recorded in the iodide ('Chromispel- I') electrolytes were characterised by a single step, while those obtained in the chloride ('Chromispel- C') electrolytes were found to have a second step, although not so well resolved. It was suggested that oxygen and chlorine evolution reactions determined the first and the second step, correspondingly. The value of first step activation energy found in the chloride electrolytes was essentially lower than that calculated for the Cl 2 containing electrolytes which showed evidence that the oxygen evolution was facilitated there. The experimental data obtained indicated that the electrode polarisation in all electrolytes studied was a concentration one but some chemical interactions or electrochemical hindrances could be expected to interfere in the complex anodic process examined.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-2967	1745-9192		WOS:000337059100007

Here, we report an ammonium-enriched anion exchange ionomer that improves the performance of an AEM electrolyser to levels approaching that of state-of-the-art proton exchange membrane electrolysers. Using rotating-disk electrode experiments, we show that a high pH (>13) in the electrode binder is the critical factor for improving the activity of the hydrogen- and oxygen-evolution reactions in AEM electrolysers. Based on this observation, we prepared and tested several quaternized polystyrene electrode binders in an AEM electrolyser. Using the binder with the highest ionic concentration and a NiFe oxygen evolution catalyst, we demonstrated performance of 2.7 A cm(-2) at 1.8 V without a corrosive circulating alkaline solution. The limited durability of the AEM electrolyser remains a challenge to be addressed in the future.Anion exchange membrane water electrolysers have potential cost advantages over proton exchange membrane electrolysers, but their performance has lagged behind. Here the authors investigate the cause of the poor performance of anion exchange membrane electrolysers and design ionomers that can overcome some of the challenges.									160	5	0	0	4	0	163			2058-7546			WOS:000518736900003

In addition to high ionic conductivity, achieving a wide electrochemical window (EW) to suppress electronic transport (self-discharge and short circuiting) is particularly challenging. The superionic conductor Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) exhibits a wide EW (>5.0 V) while maintaining a good ionic conductivity of similar to 10(-4) mS cm(-1), and serves as a model for promising superionic conductors. However, the physical origin of its electrochemical stability is not fully understood. Here, density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that a major contribution to the wide EW in LLZO originated from the high-barrier kinetics of electrochemical oxygen evolution. The high reaction barrier is attributed to electron holes occurring above the Fermi level, which is consistent with the high-voltage anionic redox potential. Based on the electron-hole relaxation capacity and polyhedral rigidity, we establish a combined charge and bond distance parameter q/r(3) which serves as the design principle for regulating electrochemical stability. Based on this principle, LLZO compounds with Nd3+, In3+, Sb3+, and Y3+ substituted in the Zr4+ site are predicted to have a wider electrochemical window of >5.5 V or even higher. The established anionic electrochemical mechanism for improving the electrochemical stability provides new insight into rationally designing and optimizing electrochemically stable superionic conductors.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000476599900041

DNT mineralizes the xenobiotic compound 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) owing to the catabolic dnt genes borne by plasmid DNT, but the process fails to promote significant growth. To investigate this lack of physiological return of such an otherwise complete metabolic route, cells were exposed to DNT under various growth conditions and the endogenous formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) monitored in single bacteria. These tests revealed the buildup of a strong oxidative stress in the population exposed to DNT. By either curing the DNT plasmid or by overproducing the second activity of the biodegradation route (DntB) we could trace a large share of ROS production to the first reaction of the route, which is executed by the multicomponent dioxygenase encoded by the dntA gene cluster. Naphthalene, the ancestral substrate of the dioxygenase from which DntA has evolved, also caused significant ROS formation. That both the old and the new substrate brought about a considerable cellular stress was indicative of a still-evolving DntA enzyme which is neither optimal any longer for naphthalene nor entirely advantageous yet for growth of the host strain on DNT. We could associate endogenous production of ROS with likely error-prone repair mechanisms of DNA damage, and the ensuing stress-induced mutagenesis in cells exposed to DNT. It is thus plausible that the evolutionary roadmap for biodegradation of xenobiotic compounds like DNT was largely elicited by mutagenic oxidative stress caused by faulty reactions of precursor enzymes with novel but structurally related substrates-to-be.									48	0	0	0	44	0	48			1553-7404			WOS:000323830300083	24009532

The layers prepared in the presence of nitrogen gas were amorphous and their oxygen contents increased with the partial pressure of nitrogen. The evolution of the composition of the layers as a function of the nitrogen partial pressure during deposition was followed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It is found that the oxygen is bound to both tellurium and cadmium atoms. The surface of the CdTe thin films was also studied as a function of their exposure time to a plasma containing a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen. It is found that the oxygen contents of the surface increases with increased exposure time. Also, this exposure resulted in an increase of the oxide thickness and a net decrease in the surface roughness of the films.

Samples with several different distributions of rhodium sulfide phases (Rh2S3, Rh17S15, RhS2 and metallic Rh) were obtained by varying the temperature and exposure time to H2S or sulfur to rhodium ratio when using solid sulfur. Samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the unsupported rhodium sulfide compounds studied using Raman spectroscopy to link Raman spectra to catalyst phases. The electrocatalytic activity of the rhodium sulfide compounds for hydrogen evolution and oxidation was measured using rotating disk electrode measurements in acidic conditions to simulate use in a flow cell. The most active phases for hydrogen evolution were found to be Rh3S4 and Rh17S17 (-034V vs. Ag/AgCI required for 20 mA/cm(2)), while Rh2S3 and RhS2 phases were relatively inactive (-0.46 V vs. Ag/AgCl required for 20 mA/cm(2) using RhS2/C). The hydrogen oxidation activity of all rhodium sulfide phases is significantly lower than the hydrogen evolution activity and is not associated with conductivity limitations.

Here, as a dual-functional-site catalyst, cobalt-chromium layered double hydroxide (CoCr LDH) nanosheets are designed and synthesized, where Co2+ is the catalytically active site and Cr3+ is the charge transfer site. OER investigation of CoCr LDH is conducted for the first time. The CoCr LDH nanosheets have a high specific surface area of 151.78 m(2) g(-1) and exhibit outstanding OER activities, among the best of Co-based candidates. Accordingly, our catalyst affords a low onset potential of 1.47 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) and a stable current density of 22.8 mA cm(-2) at 1.61 V (vs. RHE) for 12 h. The Tafel slope of CoCr LDH is 81.0 mV dec(-1), smaller than that of state-of-the-art RuO2 (90.1 mV dec(-1)). Therefore, the CoCr LDH nanosheets are promising OER catalysts.									128	3	0	0	4	0	128			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000379965800015

The photoexcited electrons that are generated in TiO2 should play an important role in the evolution of hydrogen by water splitting on a platinum surface. Our density-functional calculations reveal that electrons introduced in the conduction band of TiO2 contribute to an upward shift of the Fermi level of platinum via accumulation at the Pt/TiO2 interface, which results inweakened adsorption of H-2 molecules on the Pt surface. We study how the electronic structure of the Pt/TiO2 interface is modified by photoexcited electrons which are represented by extra electrons introduced into the conduction band by substituting fluorine for oxygen. One important consequence of doping is that bonding-antibonding splitting associated with the hybridization of H-2-sigma and Pt-d states is narrowed, which weakens the H-2-Pt binding and enhances the evolution of H-2.									20	1	0	0	1	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000318941200023

Three products: formic acid (C-1), methylglyoxal (C-3), and 2,3-furandiol (C-4), are observed at potentials as low as +50 mV vs. RHE, and at the highest half-reaction energy efficiencies reported to date for any > C1 product (99%). The maximum selectivity for 2,3-furandiol is 71% (faradaic efficiency) at 0.00 V vs. RHE on Ni2P, which is equivalent to an overpotential of 10 mV, with the balance forming methylglyoxal, the proposed reaction intermediate. P content in the series correlates closely with both the total C products and product selectivity, establishing definitive structure-function relationships. We propose a reaction mechanism for the formation of multi-carbon products, involving hydride transfer as the potential-determining step to oxygen-bound intermediates. This unlocks a new and more energy-efficient reduction route that has only been previously observed in nickel-based enzymes. This performance contrasts with simple metallic catalysts that have poor selectivity between multi-carbon products, and which require high overpotentials (> 700 mV) to achieve comparable reaction rates.									102	9	0	0	6	0	105			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000445215400021

The electrochemical reactions include those in electrolysers where gas evolution occurs, in metal deposition reactions and reactions occurring in fuel cells and batteries. The process intensification methods include the use of centrifugal force fields, ultrasonics, rotating electrodes and rotating cells which operate with and without the application of magnetic fields. Such devices can be used in principle to carry out electrolysis without the application of an external potential or current. Other methods considered include the use of light. The area of magnetic field induced fluid flow is also discussed which has applications in lab on a chip technologies. The area of process intensification has largely focused a lot on hydrogen generation as a means of providing a clean, sustainable fuel.									31	0	0	0	1	0	30			1364-0321	1879-0690		WOS:000417070500102

Using in situ small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we monitor the evolution of key structural parameters of four different Pt/carbon catalyst couples, involving carbons with vastly different porosity characteristics (hollow carbons, nanotubes, and carbon blacks). In line with the size of supported Pt nanoparticles, the intrinsic specific electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities of all samples were comparable. However, counter to common sense, a non-monotonic trend between the carbon surface area and the ORR mass-based activity, coupled with a similar relative loss in the electrochemical surface area (ECSA), was observed. This is explained in terms of a varying effective ECSA, which is sensitively dependent on the morphology of the support. In situ SAXS monitoring revealed a mainly coalescence-based increase in mean particle size for the low surface area carbon nanotubes. In contrast, the highly microporous hollow carbons showed strongly enhanced particle stability where Ostwald ripening accounted for the observed coarsening. Altogether, our study provides new atom-scale insights into Pt/C fuel cell catalyst stability. Based on this study, supports of intermediate surface area provide the best compromise between activity and size stability, while highly graphitized or highly nanoporous supports are detrimental.									36	0	1	0	0	0	36			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000389224400009

Initial compositions of flaming or smoldering plumes were dominated by BC or OA respectively, with higher NOx emission in flaming. Replicable results showed that in light, smoldering plumes had faster secondary OA (SOA) formation than flaming, due to the higher emissions of volatile organic compounds in smoldering. Furanic and carboxylic acid compounds were found to be the main gaseous precursors and products, respectively. Evaporation and photooxidation concurrently caused increased oxidation in the beginning, but at a later stage of evolution, SOA evolution showed remarkable divergence: enhanced oxidation for smoldering but decreased for flaming plumes, leading to a higher oxygen-to-carbon ratio for smoldering than flaming up to 0.25. We found the higher NOx emission in flaming promoted the gaseous fragmentation reactions, while the seeding particles dominated by OA in smoldering may cause these contrasting tendencies of OA oxidation between combustion phases. Distinct particulate/gas emissions and resultant evolutions in producing SOA at different combustion phases should be therefore considered in evaluating the impacts of biomass burning emissions.Key PointsThe evolution of plumes from wood smoke was simulated in a novel chamber under real-atmosphere conditionsProduced secondary organic aerosols after evolution showed a higher oxidation state from flaming than smoldering combustion phaseHigher emissions of black carbon and NOx in flaming while organic aerosol (OA) dominated and low NOx in smoldering may cause contrasting tendencies of OA oxidation									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			2169-897X	2169-8996		WOS:000664863900029

Among these noble metal-free catalysts, transition-metal-based nanomaterials are considered as one of the most promising OER catalysts due to their relatively low-cost intrinsic activities, high abundance, and diversity in terms of structure and morphology. Herein, a facile sugar-blowing technique and low-temperature phosphorization are reported to generate 3D self-supported metal involved carbon nanostructures, which are termed as Co2P@Co/nitrogen-doped carbon (Co2P@Co/N-C). By capitalizing on the 3D porous nanostructures with high surface area, homogeneously dispersed active sites, the intimate interaction between active sites, and 3D N-doped carbon, the resultant Co2P@Co/N-C exhibits satisfying OER performance superior to CoO@Co/N-C, delivering 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 0.32 V. It is worth noting that in contrast to the substantial current density loss of Ruo(2), Co2P@Co/N-C shows much enhanced catalytic activity during the stability test and a 1.8-fold increase in current density is observed after stability test. Furthermore, the obtained Co2P@Co/N-C can also be served as an excellent nonprecious metal catalyst for methanol and glucose electrooxidation in alkaline media, further extending their potential applications.									38	1	0	0	1	0	38			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000408936600007	28656598

The dissolution and passivation of porous cadmium electrodes containing hydroxide and the relative stability of oxides are of importance in understanding the reversible behaviour of the cadmium electrode. Under standard conditions, the equilibrium potential of Cd(OH)(2)/Cd lies above the hydrogen-evolution reaction when the cell is not in use, and the active material of the cadmium electrode undergoes self-reductive dissolution (i.e., loss of active material) accompanied by oxygen evolution. The triangular potential sweep voltammetric technique is used to determine the reversibility of the cadmium electrode in alkaline solution. The role of additives such as Ni(NO3)(2) (0.25-0.1 M) and FeSO4 (0.1-0.4 M), TiO2 (0.01-0.03 M) and Na2S (0.01-0.03 M) in Cd(NO3)(2) on the reversibility of the electrode are discussed. The effect of discharge rate on the cyclic efficiency is also investigated. Self-discharge currents are determined by potentiostatic polarization method.									12	5	0	0	1	0	16			0378-7753			WOS:A1996VE11700005

Ideally, this device should operate efficiently and be fabricated with cost-efficient means using earth-abundant materials. Here, a lightweight electrocatalyst electrode, comprising large surface-area NiCo2O4 nanorods that are firmly anchored onto a carbon-paper current collector via a dense network of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes is presented. This electrocatalyst electrode is bifunctional in that it can efficiently operate as both anode and cathode in the same alkaline solution, as quantified by a delivered current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 400 mV for each of the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. By driving two such identical electrodes with a solution-processed thin-film perovskite photovoltaic assembly, a wired artificial-leaf device is obtained that features a Faradaic H-2 evolution efficiency of 100%, and a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 6.2%. A detailed cost analysis is presented, which implies that the material-payback time of this device is of the order of 100 days.									20	3	0	0	0	0	21			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000387136300001		
J	Steenhuis, JJ; Hutchison, RS; Barry, BA								Alterations in carboxylate ligation at the active site of photosystem II								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				274	21			14609	14616		10.1074/jbc.274.21.14609				MAY 21 1999	1999	Photosystem II (PSII) is the photosynthetic enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of water and reduction of plastoquinone (Q). This reaction occurs at a catalytic site containing four manganese atoms and cycling among five oxidation states, the S-n states, where n refers to the number of oxidizing equivalents stored. Biochemical and spectroscopic techniques have been used previously to conclude that aspartate 170 in the D1 subunit influences the structure and function of the PSII active site (Boerner, R. J., Nguyen, A. P., Barry, B. A., and Debus, R, J. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 6660-6672). Substitution of glutamate for aspartate 170 resulted in an assembled manganese cluster, which was capable of enzymatic turnover, but at lower steady-state oxygen evolution rates. Here, we obtained the difference (light-minus-dark) Fourier transform IR spectrum associated with the S(2)Q(-)-minus-S(1)Q transition by illumination of oxygen-evolving wild-type and DE170D1 PSII preparations at 200 K. These spectra are known to be dominated by contributions from carboxylic acid and carboxylate residues that are close to or ligating the manganese cluster. Substitution of glutamate for aspartate 170 results in alterations in the S(2)Q(-)-minus-S(1)Q spectrum; the alterations are consistent with a change in carboxylate coordination to manganese or calcium. In particular, the spectra are consistent with a shift from bridging/bidentate carboxylates in wild-type PSII to unidentate carboxylate ligation in DE170D1 PSII.									21	0	0	0	14	0	21			0021-9258			WOS:000081965200018	10329653

The results showed that the microstructure evolution could be divided into two stages. During the first stage, the reaction between Ti and Al powders was dominant. During the second stage, the Nb-enriched area disappeared gradually and microstructural homogeneity was enhanced with the diffusion of Nb. It was demonstrated that the LaB(6 )phase could be transformed into La2O3, (Ti, Nb)B and the (Ti,Nb)(3)B-2 transition phase in the sintering process. LaB6 addition inhibited the precipitation of the brittle alpha(2) phase and refined the microstructure. Compared with the alloy without LaB6, the Ti2AlNb alloy with 2 wt% LaB6 had 315% and 38.4% improvements in the fracture strain at 25 degrees C and 650 degrees C, respectively, and its yield strength was also increased.

Herein, a strategy of ZrO2 doping was proposed to create rich surface defects on CeO2 (CZO) and, with these defects, to improve Pt dispersion and enhance its affinity as single sites to the CZO support (Pt/CZO). The strongly anchored Pt single sites on CZO support were initially not efficient for catalytic oxidation of CO/C3H6. However, after a simple activation by H-2 reduction, the catalytic oxidation performance over Pt/CZO catalyst was significantly boosted and better than Pt/CeO2. Pt/CZO catalyst also exhibited much higher thermal stability. The structural evolution of Pt active sites by H-2 treatment was systematically investigated on aged Pt/CZO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts. With H-2 reduction, ionic Pt single sites were transformed into active Pt clusters. Much smaller Pt clusters were created on CZO (ca. 1.2 nm) than on CeO2 (ca. 1.8 nm) due to stronger Pt-CeO2 interaction on aged Pt/CZO. Consequently, more exposed active Pt sites were obtained on the smaller clusters surrounded by more oxygen defects and Ce3+ species, which directly translated to the higher catalytic oxidation performance of activated Pt/CZO catalyst in vehicle emission control applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000699957900045	34495644

Stoichiometry of undoped and Li+ doped films (up to 10 mol% of Li+) prepared at 300 and 500 degrees C, respectively, showed deficiency with Co(III) ions in the film structure. All films exhibited substantial electrical conductivity (a) which was slightly dependent on the type of the substrate. The roughness factor, RF, of electrodes was determined by cyclic voltammetry. Spinel oxide films prepared at lower temperatures (300 degrees C) showed high surface area (RF similar to 700). The electrocatalytic properties were studied by different electrochemical methods in alkaline solutions. The results of electrochemical measurements in KOH indicated the formation of surface quasi-reversible redox couple, Co(IV)/Co(III), which is limited by a diffusion-controlled process. The oxygen evolution potentials pointed out remarkable performance of Co3-xO4 (300 degrees C) and Li+ doped Co3-xO4 (500 degrees C) films. The reaction order with respect to [OH-] was found to be nearly 1.2. Durability testing of films in 5 M KOH at 70 degrees C showed high long-term performance and structure stability of Li+ doped Co3-xO4 (500 degrees C) films. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science I,td.

Herein, we have successfully synthesized the novel Ni2P/WS2/Co9S8@C electrocatalyst with the multi-heterojunction interfaces via pyrolysis and in situ phosphorization processes by employing high-nuclearity metal clusters {Co24W8} as pre assembly molecular platform. As expected, Ni2P/WS2/Co9S8@C exhibits outstanding oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution performances with ultralow overpotentials of 204 mV and 67 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media, respectively. The alkali-electrolyzer using Ni2P/WS2/Co9S8@C as cathode and anode electrodes delivers a low cell voltage of 1.48 V achieving 10 mA cm(-2) with good durability. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the interfacial electrons transfer from Co9S8 and Ni2P to WS2 obviously lower the binding energies of adsorbed species and thus enhance their intrinsic activity. This work demonstrates unique advantages of interfacial structure modulation for the rational design of high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000830799500007

As a clean and sustainable way to produce hydrogen, electrocatalytic water splitting attracts ever-increasing interest from the research community. Although the wide application of platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts is limited because of the scarcity and high cost toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the non-PGM electrocatalysts usually suffer from unsatisfactory activity and poor durability. In this work, we report an active and durable V-doped Ni5P4 electrocatalyst that can be used for all-pH HER Particularly, V-Ni5P4 has an HER activity that is comparable to that of Pt in preferred alkaline media, with overpotentials as low as 13 mV and 295 mV at current densities of 10 and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively. The low-cost V-Ni5P4 that enables ultrahigh current density (i.e., at the level of A cm(-2)) would be of great interest to the hydrogen production industry.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000563074900026	32814405

Growth of cells in increasing concentrations of acetate plus 5% CO2 in liquid culture progressively reduced photosynthetic CO2 fixation and net O-2 evolution without effects on respiration, photosystem II efficiency (as measured by chlorophyll fluorescence), or growth. Using the technique of on-line oxygen isotope ratio mass spectrometry, we found that mixotrophic growth in acetate is not associated with activation of the cyanide-insensitive alternative oxidase pathway. The fraction of carbon biomass resulting from photosynthesis, determined by stable carbon isotope ratio mass spectrometry, declined dramatically (about 50%) in cells grown in acetate with saturating light and CO2. Under these conditions, photosynthetic CO2 fixation and O-2 evolution were also reduced by about 50%. Some growth conditions (e.g. limiting light, high acetate, solid medium in air) virtually abolished photosynthetic carbon gain. These effects of acetate were exacerbated in mutants with slowed electron transfer through the D1 reaction center protein of photosystem II or impaired chloroplast protein synthesis. Therefore, in mixotrophically grown cells of C. reinhardtii, interpretations of the effects of environmental or genetic manipulations of photosynthesis are likely to be confounded by acetate in the medium.									111	5	1	0	100	0	117			0032-0889			WOS:000086903400046	10759539

However, pure Fe2O3 must be deposited on supports to ensure high reactivity and durability. Here, we proposed several Fe2O3-based oxygen carriers using MgAl2O4, Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9, and Zr0.8Y0.2O1.9 as supports and investigated their performance for chemical looping hydrogen generation. The support effect on chemical looping hydrogen generation performance was evaluated, and the fundamental insights were investigated in depth. Fe2O3/Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 exhibited a superior performance regarding high hydrogen yield and stable trend over 20 cycles at 750 degrees C. However, hydrogen yield of Fe2O3/Zr0.8Y0.2O1.9 exceeded that of Fe2O3/Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 at higher temperatures (850 degrees C). Characterizations show that Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 exhibits the highest oxygen vacancy concentration, which significantly improves the reduction and reoxidation reactions of Fe2O3, thus leading to an enhanced hydrogen yield. However, the interaction between Fe2O3 and Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 contributed to the increase in Fe2+ concentration, thus decreasing the oxygen capacity during the redox cycle and contributing to the declined hydrogen yield at higher temperatures. This work highlights the potential of Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 to be used as an effective support for Fe2O3 at mid-temperatures. We hope that the support effect in this work can be extended to design and select more active and durable oxygen carriers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000721008900001	35496406

An evolutionary one-dimensional droplet combustion code encompassing relevant physics and detailed chemistry was employed to explore the roles of low-temperature chemistry, O-3 seeding, and dynamic flame structure on burning behaviors. For X-02 = 21% and a range of selective ozone seeding, near-quasi-steady cool flame burning is achieved directly (without requiring hot flame initiation and radiative extinction). Under low oxygen index conditions, but with significant O-3 seeding (X-03 = 5%), a nearly quasisteady cool flame is initially established that then transitions to a dynamically oscillating cool flame burning mode which continues until the droplet is completely consumed. It is found that the oscillation occurs as result of a initial depletion of fuel vapor-oxidizer layer evolving near the droplet surface and its dynamic re-establishment through liquid vaporization and vapor/oxidizer transport. A kinetic analysis indicates that the dynamic competition between the reaction classes- (a) degenerate chain branching and (b) chain termination/propagation - along with continuous fuel and oxygen leakage through the flame location contributes to an oscillatory burning phenomena of ever-increasing amplitude. Analysis based on single full-cycle of oscillatory burning shows that the reaction progression matrices (evolution of heat and species) for QOOH -> chain propagation/termination reactions (here, Q = C7H14-) directly scales with the gas phase temperature field. On the contrary, the QOOH -> degenerate branching reactions undergoes three distinct stages within the same oscillatory cycle. The coupled flame dynamics and kinetics suggest that in the oscillatory burning mode, kinetic processes dynamically cross through conditions characterizing the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) turnover temperature, separating low temperature and NTC kinetic regimes.

Herein, a dual-defect heterojunction system of TiO2 hierarchical microspheres with oxygen vacancies modified with ultrathin MoS2-x nanosheets (MoS2-x @TiO2-OV) is designed for simultaneously degrading pollutants and evolving hydrogen. MoS2- x @TiO2-OV exhibits a dramatically enhanced photocatalytic activity with a H2 evolution rate of 2985.16 mu mol g- 1h- 1. In treating the simulated pharmaceutical wastewater, MoS2- x @TiO2-OV is capable of purifying various refractory contaminants, with the highest H2 evolution rate of 41.59 mu mol g- 1h- 1 during enrofloxacin degradation. While treating the simulated coking wastewater, the catalyst achieves a H2 evolution rate of 102.72 mu mol g- 1h- 1 and a mineralization rate of 50%. Computational studies suggest that the dual-defect is superior for the adsorption of H* and producing.OH ('dual-defect boosted dual-function'). Also, the dual-defect sites significantly boosted the charge-carrier separation and transfer efficiencies. This work highlights the crucial role of defect engineering to develop the energy-recovering wastewater treatment approaches.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000720481100003

The structural and morphological properties of the prepared samples were investigated by XRD, TEM, EDS, XPS, FTIR, Raman, UV-Vis DRS and PL techniques. XRD, XPS and Raman techniques displayed that graphene oxide (GO) was successfully reduced to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) under hydrothermal conditions. Also, the addition of rGO enhanced the visible light absorption, oxygen vacancies, phase transformation of FeVO4 from triclinic to monoclinic phase at high amount of rGO and reduced the band gap energy of FeVO4. The photoactivity of the synthesis catalysts was investigated for the photo-degradation of Malachite green, phenol, Methylene blue and Rhodamine B under natural sunlight. Also, the catalysts were applied in H-2 evolution from water splitting. The results showed that, the rGO amount was proven to be a crucial factor affecting the structural properties and photocatalytic performance of FeVO4.

In this work, engineering of 2D ultrathin and O doping into g-C3N4 was achieved by using thermal gas shocking effect induced via endogenous gases from the urea solution and C/N-steam reforming reaction. The experimental results revealed that the optimal sample exhibited the photo-degradation rates of tetracycline (TC) within 2 h were 87.2%, and the photocatalytic H(2 )evolution rate reached 6.21 mmol h(-1) g(-1). This overwhelming photocatalytic performance is attributed to following factors, including ultrathin thickness results in reduced charge transfer distance, larger specific surface area exposed more active reaction sites, and O doping forms electron-rich centers to promote carrier separation and negative shift of the conduction band for enhanced the reduction potential of photogenerated electrons. This study presents an effective strategy for preparing high active g-C3N4 photocatalysts with optimized modification.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000805959100006

In this work, a MoS2/carbon nanocage hybrid catalyst (MoS2/Co-N-CN2) with a higher density of exposed edge sites and conductivity was developed for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The hybrid catalyst was successfully prepared via confined growth of MoS2 in the porous carbon matrix derived from the metal organic framework ZIF-67. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the hybrid catalyst contained a significantly higher density of terminal sulfur edges than bulk MoS2. The hybrid catalyst exhibited a high catalytic activity for HER and OER, with low onset overpotentials and small Tafel slopes. This enhanced catalytic performance is a direct result of the increased exposed sulfur edge sites, high surface area, and unique synergic effects between MoS2 nanoplates and Co-N-doped porous carbon matrix. Therefore, the hybrid (MoS2/Co-N-CN2) catalyst serves as a highly promising bifunctional catalyst for HER and OER.									26	2	0	0	3	0	26			2168-0485			WOS:000526375000031

The fundamental ways to boost the performance of electrocatalysts are improving the intrinsic activity of each active site and increasing the number of exposed active sites. Herein, we report a novel approach to synthesize ultrafine Ru nanocluster catalysts embedded in a nitrogen-doped carbon framework. To illustrate this strategy, Ru atoms are immobilized in tetra-aminephthalocyanine (RuPc-NH2) by Ru-N-4 bonds and subsequently confined by graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets in space. After pyrolysis treatment, ultrafine Ru nanoclusters (average size 1.03 +/- 0.23 nm) stabilized by an N-doped carbon framework with a 23.7 wt% Ru content (Ru@NG) are prepared. Importantly, Ru@NG shows excellent HER performance with small overpotentials (20.3 mV in 1.0 M KOH and 42.7 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4) at 10 mA cm(-2), a high active site number (3.54 x 10(-3) mol g(-1)) and robust durability both in alkaline and acidic environments. Therefore, this work provides a promising substitute for expensive Pt-based catalysts.									42	2	0	0	1	0	42			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000439283200037

However, quantitative models describing kinetic sulfur isotope fractionations during DSR consider the individual enzymatic reactions as reversible (Rees, 1973). Brunner and Bernasconi (2005) extended this line of thought, and suggested that as long as cell external sulfide (CES) concentrations are high enough, CES may diffuse back across the cytoplasmic cell membrane and may subsequently be re-oxidized to sulfate. Here, we test this hypothesis by measuring the time evolution of the delta(34)S-sulfate signal during DSR in closed system experiments under different levels of sulfide stress (0-20 mM and 0-40 mM total dissolved sulfide). Our results show that the measured delta(34)S-sulfate signal is markedly different in the latter case and that the observed sulfate S-isotope time-evolution is incompatible with a Rayleigh type fractionation model. In contrast, our results are consistent with a sulfate reduction and fractionation model that allows for a cell internal oxidation of dissolved sulfide by a sulfate reducer. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

CV curves (0-1.2 V vs SHE) and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests indicated excellent capacitance behavior, with a specific capacitance (C (s)) of 54.56 mF/cm(2) and a discharge current density of 15.0 mA/cm(2) for IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti, while beta-PbO2/Ti exhibited a negligible C (s) of 8.49 mF/cm(2) and a discharge current density of 3.0 mA/cm(2) in a phenol containing electrolyte. Such discrepant energy storage capacities were inversely related to the polymer formation on the anode surface and the further electrochemical oxidation of the polymer on the IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti electrode under the negative scanning potential as evidenced by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Phenol oxidation and oxygen evolution properties were detected by CV scanning at potentials between 0 and 2.0 V, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was employed to investigate the kinetic mechanism. Experimental data showed negative potential of phenol oxidation and oxygen evolution for IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti compared to that of the beta-PbO2/Ti electrode, attributed to the smaller electrode resistance and charge-transfer resistance of 1.42 and 1.71 V, respectively. Besides, organics with small molecules were detected on these two electrode surfaces under the positive scanning potential.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000388506300023

Much progress has been made toward understanding the discharge mechanism, but the mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on charge (i.e., oxidation) remains less understood. Here, using operando X-ray diffraction, we show that oxidation of electrochemically generated Li2O2 occurs in two stages, but in one step for bulk crystalline (commercial) Li2O2, revealing a fundamental difference in the OER process depending on the nature of the peroxide. For electrochemically generated Li2O2, oxidation proceeds first through a noncrystalline lithium peroxide component, followed at higher potential by the crystalline peroxide via a Li deficient solid solution (Li2-xO2) phase. Anisotropic broadening of the X-ray Li2O2 reflections confirms a platelet crystallite shape. On the basis of the evolution of the broadening during charge, we speculate that the toroid particles are deconstructed one platelet at a time, starting with the smallest sizes that expose more peroxide surface. In the case of in situ charged bulk crystalline Li2O2, the Li vacancies preferentially form on the interlayer position (Li1), which is supported by first-principle calculations and consistent with their lower energy compared to those located next to oxygen (Li2). The small actively oxidizing fraction results in a gradual reduction of the Li2O2 crystallites. The fundamental insight gained in the OER charge mechanism and its relation to the nature of the Li2O2 particles is essential for the design of future electrodes with lower overpotentials, one of the key challenges for high performance Li air batteries.									233	10	0	0	13	1	234			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000345308700032	25341076

Herein, a facile corrosion-etching strategy has been applied to synthesize RuO2 coupled with defective NiFeZn(OH)(x) on NiFe foam (NFF) at room temperature, achieving a D/NFF-Ru-Zn electrocatalyst with abundant structural defects. Benefiting from the abundant exposed defective sites and the synergistic effect between defective NiFeZn(OH)(x) and RuO2, D/NFF-Ru-Zn efficiently improves the poor intrinsic conductivity of NiFe hydroxide and reduces the kinetic energy barrier of the Volmer step, thus accelerating the HER kinetics. The prepared D/NFF-Ru-Zn catalyst demonstrates excellent activity with an overpotential of 90 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), as well as prominent durability of operating at 100 mA cm(-2) for 100 h. Furthermore, integrated with a NiFe-OH electrode, the assembled water splitting device displays a low voltage of 1.67 V at 500 mA cm(-2). Remarkably, the corrosion-etching strategy employed in this work can be extended to other substrates (e.g., Ni foam and Fe foam), providing a potential perspective for designing efficient HER electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000848308500001

Here, water oxidation activities of cobalt (II) complexes CoL1-CoL3 (1-3) with salophen type ligands (N,N'-bis(salicylidene)-4-chloro-1,2-phenylendiamine (H2L1), N,N'-bis(salicylidene)-4-bromo-1,2-phenylendiamine (H2L2) and N,N'-bis(salicylidene)-4-nitro-1,2-phenylendiamine (H2L3)) are studied by electrochemical techniques, FE-SEM images and XRD patterns. Linear sweep voltammetry studies indicate that 2 and 3 have superior activities and only require the overpotential of 316 and 247 mV vs. RHE at current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with Tafel slopes of 75 and 50 mVdec(-1) at pH = 11. Experiments show relationships between the stability of the complexes and their catalytic activity. It is revealed that substituents on ligands affect the catalytic behaviors. Experiments show that in the presence of 2 and 3, the complexed cobalt ions are likely candidates as molecular catalysts for water oxidation. It is speculated that the O-O bond formation occurs by oxidizing the active center of cobalt complexes. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

An efficient moving sectional model is developed accounting for gas phase chemical reactions, coagulation, surface growth and sintering. The model is validated by comparing it against standard sectional solutions and detailed but cumbersome literature models at certain limiting cases (i.e., only coagulation and sintering, only surface growth or only coagulation). The evolution of primary particle size distribution is monitored by rapid thermophoretic sampling and image analysis of transmission electron microscope pictures while the corresponding flame temperature is measured in the presence of particles by Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy. Excellent agreement is obtained between model predictions and data with respect to the evolution of average primary particle diameter and geometric standard deviation without any adjustable parameters until conditions of pure agglomeration of polydisperse particles are established (here, approximately after the first 9 cm above the burner tip). By comparing detailed measured and calculated size distributions, surface reaction appears to be the dominant route for early particle growth at the conditions studied. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposited (PECVD) and sputtered SiO2 was used to compare the characteristic morphology with different oxide layer. With increasing the annealing temperature, the blisters are observed at the temperature of 325degC in O2 atmosphere, while no blisters are formed even at 500degC in N2 and Ar atmosphere. Hydrogen evolution analysis from PECVD SiO2 layer shows a sharp peak near 320degC. From these results, we could suggest that the high gaseous pressure developed by chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen cause the blister formation in PECVD SiO2/Pt/PZT/Pt capacitors.

In this work, we successfully prepared non-precious metal CoB@MoS2 hybrid electrocatalysts for the HER in alkaline media by the reductive growth of cobalt boride nanoparticles (CoB NPs) on the surface of MoS2 nanoflowers (MoS2 NFs). The CoB@MoS2-0.5-300 hybrid showed an HER overpotential of only 146 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 80.9 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH solution. The significantly enhanced HER activity of the hybrid is primarily attributable to the ability of CoB to drive the OER in alkaline solution and improved electrical conductivity of the hybrid electrocatalyst relative to the pristine MoS2. Furthermore, the synthetic strategy used to prepare the CoB@MoS2 electrocatalyst was successfully applied to prepare NiB@MoS2 and FeB@MoS2 hybrid electrocatalysts, which similarly showed very good HER activity in 1.0 M KOH solution. Thus, this work conclusively demonstrates that the introduction of transition metal borides is an effective approach for enhancing the HER performance of MoS2 in alkaline media.									16	2	0	0	1	0	16			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000536643200024	32352096

This work predicts the type-II beta-AsP/g-C6N6 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure as a promising photocatalyst for water splitting using first-principles calculations. Compared with the g-C6N6 monolayer, the beta-AsP/g-C6N6 heterostructure not only can effectively separate photogenerated electron and hole pairs but also shows considerable light absorption and better photocatalyst performances. The optical absorption coefficient of the beta-AsP/g-C6N6 heterostructure has also extremely increased, more than ten times that of the g-C6N6 monolayer. The beta-AsP/g-C6N6 heterostructure with little compression (-2%) could be conducive to the hydrogen evolution reaction with a Gibbs free energy closer to zero (-0.46 eV) compared to monolayers. The oxygen evolution reaction has a low theoretical overpotential of 0.63 V. These results indicate that it exhibits favorable performances as a photocatalyst. This work predicts the possible application of the beta-AsP/g-C6N6 heterostructure as a photocatalyst and expands the scope of renewable energy devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000864811800001	36205148

Our calculations reveal that pristine CdX and ZnX (X = S, Se and Te) have a higher hydrogen adsorption free energy (Delta G(*H)) in the range of 1.07-2.00 eV, indicating very weak *H adsorption and inefficient electrocatalytic activity for the HER. However, it is found that the HER activity of CdX and ZnX (X = S, Se and Te) nanostructures can be effectively enhanced by doping with transition metal (TM) atoms (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Pd and Pt). In particular, Ni-doped CdS and ZnTe, and Cu-doped CdSe, CdTe, ZnS and ZnSe have Delta G(*H) values in the range of -0.03 to 0.09 eV, which is ideally near to zero, indicating their efficient catalytic activity. These results suggest that our work introduces Ni-doped CdS and ZnTe, and Cu-doped CdSe, CdTe, ZnS and ZnSe nanostructures as promising HER catalysts for future energy applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2633-5409		WOS:000809874100001

Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is usually considered as an inert and insulating support; however, the interaction of a single-layer h-BN with an underlying Au(111) substrate promotes its chemical reactivity, resulting in relatively strong binding of the small gold clusters on the h-BN/Au(111) support with the adsorption energies in the range -0.5 to -1.2 eV. It is shown that the most stable gold clusters on the h-BN/Au(111) support are not necessarily the most reactive; stabilization on the surface gold clusters with the different geometries and orientation with respect to the support can form a large variety of energetically favorable H adsorption sites considerably promoting HER activity. The charge transfer between the supported gold clusters and the h-BN/Au(111) surface promotes the catalytic activity of the Au-n@h-BN/Au(111) system for HER. Therefore, h-BN/Au(111) can be considered as a promising support for gold clusters as electrocatalysis.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000613198200017

Several degradation mechanisms that have been reported in the literature are known to result in heterogeneity of ageing, whose effects on performance loss have not been previously investigated. In this work experimental and theoretical methodologies are combined to provide an insight between the effects of heterogeneity of ageing and the evolution of electrochemical impedance spectra. Experimental results collected during a 6000 hours degradation test indicate an increase of cathode charge transfer and mass transport resistances, consistently with cyclic voltammetry that reveals about 60% loss of cathode catalyst active surface. A physical based model is developed and validated to demonstrate that uniform cathode ageing does not to affect the evolution of impedance spectra. On the other side, it is shown that non-uniform ageing of cathode active area improves the agreement with experimental data. The evolution of the polarization curves and impedance spectra recorded during 6000 hours degradation test is critically discussed by including heterogeneity of ageing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

All the five assembled NWs exhibit good stability according to our density functional theory (DFT) calculations: high cohesive energies, almost no imaginary frequencies, structural integrity through a 5 ps molecular dynamics simulation at 300-750 K. These five assembled NWs are wide-bandgap semiconductors, with the indirect/direct bandgaps in the range of 1.04-2.47 eV. Among them, P8B2-I, P8B2-II and P8B6 NWs perfectly satisfy the requirements (bandgaps and band positions) of a good photocatalyst for water splitting, and particularly the P8B2-II NW is a promising photocatalyst candidate for water splitting with high efficiency, because of the different spatial distributions of CBM and VBM, the comparable energy differences (Delta E-1/Delta E-2) between CBM/VBM level and water reduction/oxidation potential, good catalytic performance for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the optical adsorption in visible and UV light region. Our comprehensive studies may be helpful to design new P-based binary nanomaterials with specific application in photocatalyzing water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1040-7278	1572-8862		WOS:000683237500001

Examples of this are their ability to scavenge free radicals and higher vapor pressure. However, distinct properties of energetic PAW decay within the day after its creation in a metastable liquid state. In this work, we report a facile method for persisting its distinct activities by letting as-prepared PAW be quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and letting the frozen PAW (for one month before further measurements) be quickly melted to room temperature in a warm-water bath (called treated PAW). Experimental results indicate that the activity of the higher evaporation rate of treated PAW compared to DI water can be maintained ca. 90% of magnitude, as compared to the as-prepared PAW. Also, its abilities to scavenge free hydroxyl and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals can be maintained at ca. 70 and 80% of magnitudes, respectively. Moreover, this strategy of quickly freezing and melting treatments to PAW on persisting in distinct activity of PAW is effective in oxygen evolution reactions. This promises the stored energy and the distinct property of created liquid PAW being available in water-related fields after long-term storage.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			2470-1343			WOS:000503370500038	31867513

Herein, novel nickel foam (NF) supported porous featherlike NiCoP (PF-NiCoP/NF) nanoarrys are constructed by a successive hydrothermal and phosphidation way. Simultaneously, their three-dimensional (3D) morphology, the holey structure, and the conductive substrate are favorable for the enhanced specific surface area, efficient electron and mass transfer, and exposure of more active sites, and also are beneficial for the release of generated H-2. PF-NiCoP/NF demonstrates high activity and long-term durability in alkaline media (1 M KOH) and real seawater, reaching the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 46 and 287 mV, respectively. Moreover, the faradaic efficiency of 3D PF-NiCoP/NF is as high as 96.5% in real seawater. As expected, PF-NiCoP/NF exhibits superior performance in comparison to those of most of HER electrocatalysts in real seawater and alkaline media. This work may present a new strategy to design a promising electrocatalyst superior to platinum in a wide range of pH and may provide a new idea for electrocatalytic seawater splitting.									56	6	0	0	1	0	60			2574-0962			WOS:000469885300103

Highly efficient and cost-effective catalysts are required to make such an approach practical on a large scale. Recently, a number of amorphous hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts have emerged that show promise in terms of scalability and reactivity, yet remain poorly understood. In this work, we utilize Raman Spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) as a tool to elucidate the structure and function of an amorphous cobalt sulfide (CoSx) catalyst. Ex situ measurements reveal that the as-deposited CoSx catalyst is composed of small clusters in which the cobalt is surrounded by both sulfur and oxygen.,Operando experiments, performed while the CoSx is catalyzing the HER, yield a molecular model in which cobalt is in an octahedral CoS2-like state where the cobalt center is predominantly surrounded by a first shell Of sulfur atoms, which, in turn, are preferentially exposed to electrolyte relative to bulk CoS2. We surmise that these CoS2-like clusters form under cathodic polarization and expose a high density of catalytically active sulfur sites for the HER.									272	17	0	0	26	0	274			0002-7863			WOS:000356753700032	26051104

Properties of as-fired and decomposed fibers were evaluated in order to establish the optimum firing condition, Slower heating diminished the evolution of pyrolytic gas during firing and decomposing. The slow firing yielded the low resistivity because of high content of free carbon in fiber. When fired rapidly, the cracks or pores were formed at the fiber surface. The strength of fiber was dependent upon the evolution of pyrolytic gas, and it is considered to be quite sensitive to the surface defects. The slow firing is effective in maintaining the high level of strength.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1882-0743	1348-6535		WOS:A1996VU87200016

These could serve as alternatives to high-cost Pt-based materials. Herein, a facile and effective microwave-assisted route has been developed to synthesize structurally uniform and electrochemically active pure and transition metal-doped manganese oxide nanoballs (Mn2O3 NBs) for fuel cell applications. The average diameter of pure and doped Mn2O3 NBs was found to be similar to 610 nm and similar to 650 nm, respectively, as estimated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The nanoparticles possess a good degree of crystallinity as evident from the lattice fringes in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The cubic crystal phase was ascertained using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The energy dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) elemental mapping confirms the formation of copper-doped Mn2O3 NBs. The experimental parameter using trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) as the chelating agent to control the nanostructure growth has been adequately addressed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The solid NBs were formed by the self-assembly of very small Mn2O3 nanoparticles as evident from the SEM image. Moreover, the concentration of TOPO was found to be the key factor whose subtle variation can effectively control the size of the as-prepared Mn2O3 NBs. The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge studies demonstrated enhanced electrochemical performance for copper-doped Mn2O3 NBs which is supported by a 5.2 times higher electrochemically active surface area (EASA) in comparison with pure Mn2O3 NBs. Electrochemical investigations indicate that both pure and copper-doped Mn2O3 NBs exhibit a bifunctional catalytic activity toward the four-electron electrochemical reduction as well the evolution of oxygen in alkaline media. Copper doping in Mn2O3 NBs revealed its pronounced impact on the electrocatalytic activity with a high current density for the electrochemical oxygen reduction and evolution reaction. The synthetic approach provides a general platform for fabricating well-defined porous metal oxide nanostructures with prospective applications as low-cost catalysts for alkaline fuel cells.									67	0	0	0	5	0	67			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000371607600017

In situ formed graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is utilized as a sacrificial template for constructing the core-shell Fe3C@NSC electrocatalyst with a highly porous substructure and nanosheet-like morphology. The presence of glucose facilitates the homogeneous distribution of nanoparticles and establishes the nanosheet structure, otherwise agglomeration and formation of nanotubes occur in the Fe3C@NSC electrocatalyst. Optimizing the synthetic conditions generates a highly active ORR electrocatalyst with a unique mesoporous architecture, large surface area, high nitrogen doping level, encapsulated Fe3C nanoparticles in NS co-doped carbon layers and multiple exposed edge active centers. The best performing electrocatalyst displays outstanding ORR performance under alkaline conditions with onset potential and half-wave potential (E-1/2) values of 1.059 and 0.938 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), much higher than those of the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C (20%), and admirable performance in acidic media. In addition, it exhibits 4e(-) selectivity, tolerance toward methanol, and superb durability with zero degradation after 12 000 potential cycles under both alkaline and acidic conditions. These exceptional characteristics make the as-synthesized electrocatalyst one of the top-level non-precious ORR electrocatalysts reported to date.									58	3	0	0	4	0	58			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000476599900031

Granick revisited: Synthesizing evolutionary and ecological evidence for the late origin of bacteriochlorophyll via ghost lineages and horizontal gene transfer								PLOS ONE				16	1					e0239248	10.1371/journal.pone.0239248				JAN 28 2021	2021	Photosynthesis-both oxygenic and more ancient anoxygenic forms-has fueled the bulk of primary productivity on Earth since it first evolved more than 3.4 billion years ago. However, the early evolutionary history of photosynthesis has been challenging to interpret due to the sparse, scattered distribution of metabolic pathways associated with photosynthesis, long timescales of evolution, and poor sampling of the true environmental diversity of photosynthetic bacteria. Here, we reconsider longstanding hypotheses for the evolutionary history of phototrophy by leveraging recent advances in metagenomic sequencing and phylogenetics to analyze relationships among phototrophic organisms and components of their photosynthesis pathways, including reaction centers and individual proteins and complexes involved in the multi-step synthesis of (bacterio)-chlorophyll pigments. We demonstrate that components of the photosynthetic apparatus have undergone extensive, independent histories of horizontal gene transfer. This suggests an evolutionary mode by which modular components of phototrophy are exchanged between diverse taxa in a piecemeal process that has led to biochemical innovation. We hypothesize that the evolution of extant anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria has been spurred by ecological competition and restricted niches following the evolution of oxygenic Cyanobacteria and the accumulation of O-2 in the atmosphere, leading to the relatively late evolution of bacteriochlorophyll pigments and the radiation of diverse crown group anoxygenic phototrophs. This hypothesis expands on the classic "Granick hypothesis" for the stepwise evolution of biochemical pathways, synthesizing recent expansion in our understanding of the diversity of phototrophic organisms as well as their evolving ecological context through Earth history.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			1932-6203			WOS:000635021400005	33507911

The obtained material with an optimized Cu/Co ratio shows much enhanced mass activity and area-specific activity, as well as excellent stability. The electronic structure interaction between Cu and Co, which results in the Co ion binding-energy elevation, is considered to be the origin of high MOR performance. This work promises the great potential of cobalt hydroxide as a novel kind of MOR catalyst and may arouse much interest in exploring more hydroxides as efficient nonprecious-metal electrocatalysts for MOR.									40	3	0	0	1	0	40			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000451100500038	30350941

Here we report a hybrid system consisting of MoS2/reduced graphene oxide (MoS2/RGO) catalyst, Zn(II)-5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-N-methylpyridyl)porphyrin ([ZnTMPyP](4+)) photosensitizer, and triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor for photocatalytic H-2 production under visible-light irradiation. Through optimizing the component proportion of MoS2/RGO catalyst, the [ZnTMPyP]4+MoS2/RGOTEOA photocatalytic system showed the highest H-2 evolution rate of 2560 mu mol h(1) g(1) at pH 7 when the ratio of MoS2 to graphene is 5:1. An apparent quantum yield of 15.2% at 420 nm was observed under optimized reaction conditions. The excellent photocatalytic result can be attributed to the improved charge carrier transfer by graphene which acts as an electron transfer bridge, as demonstrated by photoluminescence quenching and photoluminescence decay studies. It is believed that these findings would open a promising strategy to develop a noble-metal-free and visible-light-responding solar-to-H-2 conversion system.									73	3	0	0	10	0	73			1932-7447			WOS:000415140400012

In order to explore the influence mechanism of TCPE on the characteristics of coal spontaneous combustion, the evolutions of oxygen adsorption capacity and chemical groups of coal under different thermal cracking parameters were measured by experiments. The following research results were obtained: On the whole, the pore and free radical structures of coal are changed after TCPE at low temperature and for a short time. The oxygen adsorption capacity and chemical activity of coal are increased, which leads to the increase of the risk of coal spontaneous combustion. However, when the coal is subjected to long-term high-temperature TCPE, the oxygen absorption capacity, and chemical reactivity are weakened. Ultimately, the risk of coal spontaneous combustion and the intensity of oxygen composite reaction become lower compared with the original state of coal. Based on these findings, it is suggested to consider long-term high-temperature thermal cracking during TCPE in CBM reservoirs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0010-2202	1563-521X		WOS:000659763100001

In this work, MCF were used as the supporter for TiO2 particles loading owing to its thermal stability and suitable pore size. Furthermore, NH4F is easier to afford as compared to traditional organic fluorine reagents. As expected, F-TiO2/MCF demonstrates high photocatalytic activity and stability on pollutant degradation and hydrogen evolution. Under solar light irradiation, the degradation rate of methyl orange (MO) can be up to 93% within 7 min. The outstanding photocatalytic performance of F-TiO2/MCF is ascribed to abundant F atoms filling into oxygen vacancies in TiO2 and high specific surface area. The vast F atoms doping TiO2 lattice are favorable to eliminate defects-induced recombination sites and ensure the excellent photocatalytic activity.					18th National Congress on Catalysis of China (NCC)18th National Congress on Catalysis of China (NCC)	OCT 16-20, 2017OCT 16-20, 2017	Catalysis Soc China; Hebei Univ Technol; China Natl Offshore Oil Corp, Tianjin Res & Design Inst Chem IndCatalysis Soc China; Hebei Univ Technol; China Natl Offshore Oil Corp, Tianjin Res & Design Inst Chem Ind	Tianjin Univ, Tianjin, PEOPLES R CHINATianjin Univ, Tianjin, PEOPLES R CHINA	30	2	0	0	3	0	30			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000459892900039		
J	Sfaira, M; Srhiri, A; Keddam, M; Takenouti, H								Corrosion of a mild steel in agricultural irrigation waters in relation to partially blocked surface								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				44	24			4395	4402		10.1016/S0013-4686(99)00155-3				1999	1999	The corrosion behaviour of a mild steel in agricultural irrigation water was investigated in the reference solution constituted of 0.2 g l(-1) NaCl solution and the inhibiting effect of sulphate ions was examined by addition of 0.27 g l(-1) Na2SO4 to the reference solution. The voltammograms obtained with rotating disc electrode showed a cathodic plateau. This limiting current was due mainly to the reduction of dissolved oxygen. In parallel to this reaction, the hydrogen evolution reaction is also taking place for a higher cathodic polarisation potential. At the corrosion potential, however, the diffusion is riot the profess that determines the corrosion rate. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at the corrosion potential showed three parallel RC circuits linked hierarchically. The corrosion rate in the presence of sulphate ions was 20 times as fast as in the reference solution. That is, the enhancement of galvanic coupling between local cells prevails on the surface blocking effect of sulphate ions revealed by electrohydrodyanamical (EHD) impedance measurements. In fact by EHD impedance we have shown that sulphate ions actually induce the behaviour identified as partially blocking surface. The active surface areas were roughly estimated to correspond to the crystallographic grain size of mild steel used in this study.

Further improvements can be achieved by increasing their electrical conductivity, but scarce attention has been paid to quantify the electroactive sites of the electrocatalyst when this enhancement occurs. In this work, we have studied how the chemical design influences the specific density of electroactive sites in different Au-PBA nanostructures. Thus, we have first obtained and fully characterized a variety of monodisperse core@shell hybrid nanoparticles of Au@PBA (PBA of (NiFeII)-Fe-II and (CoFeII)-Fe-II) with different shell sizes. Their catalytic activity is evaluated by studying the OER, which is compared to pristine PBAs and other Au-PBA heterostructures. By using the coulovoltammetric technique, we have demonstrated that the introduction of 5-10% of Au in weight in the core@shell leads to an increase in the electroactive mass and thus, to a higher density of active sites capable of taking part in the OER. This increase leads to a significant decrease in the onset potential (up to 100 mV) and an increase (up to 420%) in the current density recorded at an overpotential of 350 mV. However, the Tafel slope remains unchanged, suggesting that Au reduces the limiting potential of the catalyst with no variation in the reaction kinetics. These improvements are not observed in other Au-PBA nanostructures mainly due to a lower contact between both compounds and the Au oxidation. Hence, an Au core activates the PBA shell and increases the conductivity of the resulting hybrid, while the PBA shell prevents Au oxidation. The strong synergistic effect existing in the core@shell structure evidences the importance of the chemical design for preparing PBA-based nanostructures exhibiting better electrocatalytic performances and higher electrochemical stabilities.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000674756400001	34477618

Herein, we report MoS2@graphene (MoS2@Gr) heterostructures materials as a promising hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst, which is synthesized via in-situ formation and integration of graphene into the interlayer spacing of MoS2, thereby exposing the HER active edge sites via widening of the interlayer spacing. Compared to the pristine MoS2, the MoS2@Gr exhibits a superior HER activity having an overpotential of 120 mV vs. RHE to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 72 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. In addition, the MoS2@Gr catalyst requires only an overpotential of 170 mV vs. RHE in 1 M KOH electrolyte to drive the HER current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) with a smaller Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1).

Herein, nano-constructed iron sulfide loaded on N-doped graphene foam (Fe7S8/NGF) was obtained by hydrothermal process and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and used as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) and OER (oxygen evolution reaction). The graphene foam with a three-dimensional porous structure not only improves the overall conductivity of the catalyst but also facilitates the in-situ growth of Fe7S8 nanoparticles and exposes more active sites, thereby optimizing mass and electron transfer. Therefore, the synergistic effect of transition metal sulfide and NGF has greatly enhanced its catalytic performance. In 1 M KOH, Fe7S8/NGF bifunctional electrocatalyst has excellent HER (197.8 mV, 10 mA.cm(-2)) and OER (450 mV, 100 mA.cm(-2)) catalytic ability as well as highly stability for long-term operation. Moreover, the Fe7S8/NGF catalyst exhibits excellent ability for overall water splitting, reaching a current density of 100 mA.cm(-2), requires an additional applied voltage of 2.21 V only, and maintains good stability during 12 hours of continuous work.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1452-3981			WOS:000636785000033

Here we show that nanostructured iron (III) oxyhydroxide on nitrogen-doped carbon enables high Faraday efficiency (97.4%) and selectivity to acetic acid (61%) at very-low potential (-0.5 V vs silver/silver chloride). Using a combination of electron microscopy, operando X-ray spectroscopy techniques and density functional theory simulations, we correlate the activity to acetic acid at this potential to the formation of nitrogen-coordinated iron (II) sites as single atoms or polyatomic species at the interface between iron oxyhydroxide and the nitrogen-doped carbon. The evolution of hydrogen is correlated to the formation of metallic iron and observed as dominant reaction path over iron oxyhydroxide on oxygen-doped carbon in the overall range of negative potential investigated, whereas over iron oxyhydroxide on nitrogen-doped carbon it becomes important only at more negative potentials.									140	10	0	0	12	0	142			2041-1723			WOS:000426543800002	29507285

Herein, a self-templated strategy is employed to fabricate 2D porous electrocatalysts of heterometallic phosphides featuring a cage-in-cage superlattice architecture. The as-made heterometallic phosphide electrocatalysts, comprising a layer of close-packed CoFeP nanocages intimately embedded in an interconnected carbon-cage framework, are converted from carbon-coated CoFeO nanocrystal superlattices by one-step phosphidation. Benefiting from the unique hierarchical porous structure and the ability of modulating the Co/Fe molar ratio, such 2D CoFeP @ C cage-in-cage superlattices show remarkable activity and stability for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Moreover, water electrolyzers constructed using CoFeP @ C superlattices as both cathode and anode require a low cell voltage of 1.55 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming most nonprecious metal-based electrocatalysts reported previously. The superior electrocatalytic performance of CoFeP @ C superlattices is revealed by density functional theory calculations. These findings provide new opportunities for developing efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000853912800001

The electrochemical behaviour of Co2+ has been studied in ethylammonium nitrate (EAN) using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The electrodeposition of Co2+ in EAN occurs at -0.95 V vs. Fc(0/+), followed by hydrogen evolution reaction. The electro-oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+ is found to be a reversible process in dried EAN at E-1/2 = 1.47 V vs. Fc(0/+). The presence of water significantly affects the voltammetric behaviour of Co2+ and the subsequent electrodeposition processes. Cobalt oxides nanostructures have been deposited onto glassy carbon and indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates by two routes, (i) controlled-potential deposition of Co, followed by spontaneous air oxidation and (ii) controlled-potential deposition of Co followed by anodic oxidation in the presence of water. SEM, EDX, XRD and XPS reveal that cobalt oxides of different morphologies and chemical compositions are formed on the surface of electrodes. The cobalt oxides films exhibit catalytic activity towards water oxidation reaction in neutral phosphate buffered solution with low overpotentials.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			2046-2069			WOS:000325950600178

This procedure resulted in significant enhancement of photocatalytic activity of the mpg-CNx in water oxidation. The optimal loading gave an oxygen evolution rate of up to approximately 1 mmol O-2 g(cat)(-1) h(-1) under 100 mW cm(-2) visible light illumination in a pH 7 phosphate buffer containing Ag+ or Na2S2O8 as an electron scavenger which was 400 times faster compared with that of the untreated mpg-CNx catalyst. Under visible light illumination and by employing a hole scavenger e. g. methanol, CoPi was converted into a H-2-CoCat HER electrocatalyst which significantly promoted the H-2 generation photocatalytic activities of mpg-CNx. Without any electron/hole scavengers, the mpg-CNx-CoPi-H-2-CoCat composite was able to catalyse the overall water splitting process.									45	7	0	0	4	0	49			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000320268900005

We present here the effect of exposed facets on the photocatalytic features of anatase and rutile TiO2 crystals using first-principle computations based on the density functional theory (DFT). The four possible low-Miller-index (110), (101), (100), and (001) surfaces of each crystalline phase are investigated. The most suitable facets for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER, respectively) are identified on anatase and rutile TiO2 from the combination of the anisotropic redox and charge carrier transport properties. Our study demonstrates the (110) anatase surface as the most suitable candidate for OER, followed by the (101) surface, whereas the (001) anatase surface is predicted as the most suitable candidate for HER For rutile, the two (110) and (101) surfaces are predicted as the most suitable candidates for OER, while no suitable surface candidate is found for HER in line with the experimental observations showing better activity for HER using anatase than rutile. These findings will guide experimentalists to carefully design (110)- and (001)-oriented anatase TiO2 material samples for improved photocatalytic water oxidation and proton reduction.									30	3	0	0	5	0	31			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000499737700023

Herein, a novel gC3N4/g-CN van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure is proposed and its structural, electronic and optical properties are systematically investigated based on first-principles method. The results show that the g-C3N4/g-CN vdW heterostructure is a type-II semiconductor, which satisfies band gap and band edge requirements of the redox potential of water splitting. In addition, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on g-C3N4 side and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on g-CN side can proceed spontaneously in thermodynamics. Most notably, the electronic, thermodynamic and optical properties of the g-C3N4/g-CN vdW heterostructure can be modulated by applying biaxial strain to achieve the purpose of better catalytic water splitting. Also, the good visible-light absorption intensity of the g-C3N4/g-CN vdW heterostructure can also be exhibited without strain and it is much better under strain of -2%. Consequently, these findings suggest that the g-C3N4/g-CN vdW heterostructure has a promising potential as a photocatalyst for water splitting.									26	1	0	0	0	0	26			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000639676500004

We report a gas-diffusion porous photoelectrode consisting of tungsten trioxide (WO3) nanoparticles coated with a proton-conducting polymer electrolyte thin film for visible-light-driven photoelectrochemical water vapor splitting. The gas-electrolyte-solid triple phase boundary enhanced not only the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the WO3 photoanode but also the Faraday efficiency (FE) of oxygen evolution in the gas-phase water oxidation process. The IPCE was 7.5% at an applied voltage of 1.2 V under 453 nm blue light irradiation. The FE of hydrogen evolution in the proton exchange membrane photoelectrochemical cell was close to 100%, and the produced hydrogen was separated from the photoanode reaction by the membrane. A comparison of the gas-phase photoelectrochemical reaction with that in liquid-phase aqueous media confirmed the importance of the triple phase boundary for realizing water vapor splitting.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			2296-2646			WOS:000451956400001	30560121

Electronic structure of batteries materials determines the electrochemical performance, e.g., the potential and sequence of cationic and anionic redox, the voltage and capacity decay mechanism upon electrochemical cycling. It is crucial to detect and control the electronic state evolution of battery materials through advanced experimental characterizations. Synchrotron based soft X-ray spectroscopy stands out as one of the most effective way directly measuring both the occupied and unoccupied states in the vicinity of Fermi level, which is relevant to battery comprehensive performance. As core level spectroscopies, soft X-ray spectroscopy provides direct probe of the relevant transition-metal (TM) 3d states and anion p states in battery materials with elemental, chemical, and orbital sensitivity through excitation from core state to shallow unoccupied state. Quantitative analysis of TM L-edge and anion K-edge soft X-ray spectroscopy provides detailed information about local structural effects, valence, and spin states of battery materials. In this work, we review the soft X-ray spectroscopy of the evolution of electronic state in battery materials. We start with an overview of the main experimental aspects of soft X-ray spectroscopy. We subsequently discuss both cationic and anionic redox in battery materials through soft X-ray spectroscopy, which is meaningful in practice for enhancing the performance of a battery. The recently developed mapping of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (mRIXS) is a powerful probe of battery chemistry with superior sensitivity. The mRIXS is demonstrated as a reliable technique for fingerprinting oxygen redox, and the tool-of-choice to study the fundamental nature of bulk oxygen states.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0251-0790			WOS:000682521000003

We found that the interlayer spacing of the GO membrane gradually decreased as the annealing temperature increased and as time elapsed. Surprisingly, we observed the formation of an intermediate "water-rich" GO layers at 25 degrees C with an interlayer spacing of approximately 15.2 angstrom, which was caused by the intercalation of two additional layers of water into the interlayers of the GO membrane. Moreover, three types of water trapped in GO were clearly distinguished upon isothermal annealing at various temperatures. Below 160 degrees C, the removal of "bulk water" and "confined water" resulted in a smaller interlayer spacing and the preservation of oxygen-containing functional groups. At 160 degrees C or higher, "bound water" was removed and oxygen-containing functional groups were lost, which contributed to the reduction of GO.

We extend this strategy to a bifunctional self-supported electrode for water splitting to achieve a dynamic balance between the HER and OER through a fast, simple and economical fabrication process. The electrocatalytic activities of the self-supported multiphase NiS-NiS2-Ni3S2/NF (m-NiSx/NF) electrodes toward water splitting are obtained and optimized by modulating the quantity of sulfur powder during the reaction procedure. As a result, the self-supported m-NiSx-0.5/NF electrode exhibits overpotentials of 143 mV and 137 mV to afford a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) for the OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution, respectively. Impressively, overall water splitting with 10 mA cm(-2) at a low voltage of 1.46 V is achieved using self-supported m-NiSx-0.5/NF as both the anode and cathode electrodes, surpassing the performance of nearly all the recently reported nonprecious electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									67	4	0	0	2	0	68			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000443116700021

The films have been obtained by coating a thick colloidal solution formed by peptization of freshly prepared metal carbonate precipitate in glacial acetic acid and subsequent drying and sintering at 650 degreesC for 2 h. The substitution of La by Sr in the perovskite lattice does not indicate any significant influence on the rate Of O-2 evolution reaction (OER) in 1M KOH. Values of the Tafel slope and the order for the reaction have been observed to be similar to 2.303RT/F and similar to 1, respectively, regardless of the nature of the oxide catalyst. The apparent electrochemical activation energy (DeltaH(el)(#)) decreases linearly with increasing potential across the oxide/1M KOH interface. Values of the entropy of activation (Ae) for the OER are highly negative. Based on electrode kinetic results, the OER is considered to proceed with the formation of adsorbed OH radical as the intermediate in a fast step followed by its electrochemical interaction to yield physisorbed H2O2 in the slow step.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0376-4710	0975-0975		WOS:000171740000003

Among many kinds of photocatalysts, direct Z-scheme systems have attracted much attention. Here, we propose two-dimensional arsenene/ZrS2(HfS2) heterostructures as potential direct Z-scheme photocatalysts based on density functional theory simulations. Our calculations demonstrate that arsenene/ZrS2(HfS2) heterostructures have type-II band alignments with small band gaps, facilitating spatial separation of photo-generated carriers and enhancing sunlight absorption ability. Meanwhile, interlayer charge transfer induces a built-in electric field, resulting in the band edge positions bending at the interface region. Combined with the closed band edge positions and small interlayer band gaps, the direct Z-scheme charge transfer pathway is confirmed for them. Additionally, both heterostructures show energic, dynamical, and thermal stability based on the calculated results. What is more, under solar irradiation, the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction can be triggered spontaneously on different monolayers with the potential supplied by photo-generated electrons and holes based on the calculated free energy difference (Delta G). Therefore, arsenene/ZrS2 (HfS2) heterostructures may have promising potential as bifunctional photocatalysts for overall water splitting. This work provides valuable guidance for designing the direct Z-scheme photocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000766226700028

Herein, for the first time, we established that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities of NG display definite trends due to its nitrogen configurations, which were selectively generated by using layer-structured montmorillonite (MMT) with different layer distances and functions modulated by Co2+, Ni2+, Na+, and H+ ions. We found that among the three types of N, i.e., pyridine, pyrrolic, and quaternary N, quaternary N is the most active one for HER in a metal-free NG catalyst, whereas with an introduction of trace atomic cobalt, the planar (pyridine and pyrrolic) N becomes the better one. In contrast, when trace atomic Ni is involved to replace the Co, the former results in heavily depressed HER activities for the NG catalyst. Density functional theory calculations further revealed that (i) the carbon atoms are highly activated for HER by the nearby quaternary N but not by planar N and (ii) nickel blocks but cobalt promotes the hydrogen adsorption after coordination with planar N, leading to an excellent HER performance.									54	2	0	0	0	0	55			2380-8195			WOS:000435159000018

Properties of hot carriers are highly tunable, and in this work, we investigate their dependence on the material, size, and environment of spherical metallic nanoparticles. In particular, we carry out theoretical calculations of hot carrier generation rates and energy distributions for six different plasmonic materials (Na, K, Al, Cu, Ag, and Au). The plasmon decay into hot electron-hole pairs is described via Fermi's golden rule using the quasistatic approximation for optical properties and a spherical well potential for the electronic structure. We present results for nanoparticles with diameters up to 40 nm, which are embedded in different dielectric media. We find that small nanoparticles with diameters of 16 nm or less in media with large dielectric constants produce most hot carriers. Among the different materials, Na, K, and Au generate most hot carriers. We also investigate hot carrier-induced water splitting and find that simple-metal nanoparticles are useful for initiating the hydrogen evolution reaction, whereas transition-metal nanoparticles produce dominantly holes for the oxygen evolution reaction.									50	1	0	0	1	1	50			1932-7447			WOS:000430896500054

Here, we demonstrate that similar dendritic structures can be achieved at long growth times without adding hydrogen externally. These shapes are not a result of a surface diffusion controlled growth but of the competing backward reaction (etching), which dominates the growth dynamics at long times due to an in situ rise in the hydrogen partial pressure. We have performed a systematic study on the growth of graphene as a function of time to identify the onset and gradual evolution of graphene shapes caused by etching and then demonstrated that the etching can be stopped by reducing the flow of hydrogen from the feed. In addition, we have found that the etching rate due to the in situ rise in hydrogen is strongly dependent on the confinement (geometrical confinement) of copper foil. Highly etched graphene with dendritic shapes was observed in unconfined copper foil regions while no etching was found in graphene grown in a confined reaction region. This highlights the effect of the dynamic reactant distribution in activating the in situ etching process during growth, which needs to be counteracted or controlled for large scale growth.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2046-2069		WOS:000427502300041	29552339

However, in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), there is a lack of electrocatalysts based transition metals of high-performance and natural-abundance, and thus there is a formidable challenge for large-scale application. Therefore, molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) based catalysts and their composites are regarded as a most promising and replacement noble metal electrocatalyst for the HER in different media about all pH. In this work, the preparation of ultra-fine Mo2C nanoparticles, which uniformly implant into hollow N-doped carbon polyhedrons (Mo2C@HNCPs) by adopting MOF-assisted self-sacrifice template approach, is proposed. Mo2C@HNCPs showcases suitable catalytic activity and feasible stability toward HER in both media such as acidic and alkaline solutions. The as-prepared Mo2C@HNCPs exhibits effective and fast response from the HER region with nearly 0.0 V onset overpotentials, only requiring 89 mV (0.5 M H2SO4 media) and 87 mV (1.0 M KOH media) overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) and cycling stability (<5% performance loss after 10 h). Such distinctive activity of HER is mainly imputed to the poly-dispersion of the ultra-fine Mo2C nanoparticles and its synergistic contribution of rich nitrogen doping, unique hollow morphology, and abundant active sites at the heterostructures.

The evolution of O-2 from 14,0 oxidation, on as -prepared electrodes, results in the opening of large pores that effectively work as gas channels for removing O-2 generated inside the porous structure, thus favouring the reaction penetration deeper into the pores. A serious problem that limits the utilisation of the internal pore surface is the instability of PbO2 towards corrosion at high positive potentials or currents. Occlusion of pores by corrosion products is clearly demonstrated by SEM analysis of electrodes after operation as O-2 evolving anodes. Doping PbO2 with Fe-3 and Co-2 yields anodes that resist corrosion up to relatively high anodic potentials/currents; this extends the anode lifetime by decreasing amorphisation of the electrocatalyst and its partial detachment caused by a high pressure of O-2 formed inside the pores during water electrolysis. This is an important result since stability of electrodes is as important as their electrochemical activity for practical applications. In the domain of high positive potentials, PbO2 doping by Fe3+ and Co-2 results in a significant increase of the current efficiency of ozone generation. The magnitude of the observed increase depends on the individual characteristics of the doping cation and of the electrolyte employed. Possible involvement of higher oxidation states of cobalt and iron in the reaction mechanism is discussed on the basis of published literature.									15	4	0	0	0	0	19			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000374841300036

The latter is inferred to subsequently partially decompose to dioxygen by catalytic chemical reaction at the nanoparticles. At the single particle level, electrochemical particle-electrode impacts point out the rate-determining step and the limiting kinetics of the reaction. Furthermore, particles with a core-shell structure of a Co3O4 core and SiO2 shell are synthesised, and their electrochemical behaviour is studied and compared with bare Co3O4 nanoparticles, suggesting the very likely broken or highly porous state of the silica shell, which is not otherwise easily distinguished, for example, by electron microscopy.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2196-0216			WOS:000519650500027

Combined studies with X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements reveal the encapsulation of metallic FeCo alloy in such carbon nanotubes with a wall thickness of ca. 2.60 nm. Electrochemical measurements show that sulfur codoping with nitrogen dramatically enhances the catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction compared with that of FeCo alloy encapsulated in N-doped only carbon nanotubes, and the sample prepared at a pyrolysis temperature of 800 degrees C is the best one among the series, exhibiting a more positive half-wave potential of +0.838 V, nearly 100% enhancement in kinetic current, a higher operation stability and stronger immunity to the negative impacts of fuel crossover than commercial Pt/C catalysts. The remarkable improvement of catalytic activity is ascribed to the intensified charge transfer from encapsulated FeCo alloy nanoparticles to thin walls of CNTs upon the additional sulfur doping besides nitrogen. The present results highlight the importance of deliberate doping and structuring in the development of more efficient catalysts based on metal nanoparticles encapsulated in CNTs for high-performance electrochemical energy devices.

Developing efficient Pt-based electrocatalysts for the HER to work at all pHs is highly desirable, however, still a significant challenge, especially in alkaline conditions due to sluggish water dissociation and OHad transfer. Here, a new strategy for making a class of amorphous WOx-surface decorated PtNi@Pt dendritic nanowires (WOx-PtNi@Pt DNWs) to achieve highly efficient pH-universal HER electrocatalysis is reported. The as-made WOx-PtNi@Pt DNWs display superior HER performance with the overpotentials of 24, 5, and 22 mV in 0.1 m KOH, 0.1 m HClO4, and 0.5 m phosphate-buffered saline, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The mass activity of WOx-PtNi@Pt DNWs in alkaline conditions is 3.3 mA mu g(Pt)(-1) at an overpotential of 70 mV, among the best in all the reported materials. Theoretical calculations confirm the introduction of WOx to the PtNi DNWs plays a pivotal role in promoting the efficient electron transfer for the alkaline and acidic HER. The activation of the PtNi region within the Pt-Ni-W-O interface is achieved by the WOx induced strain effect, which guarantees the superior performance in the HER.									41	1	0	0	1	0	41			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000594729100001

Recently, a new 2D monolayer material of MoSi2N4 has been successfully synthesized and its semiconducting property and excellent ambient stability have also been demonstrated (Science 2020, 369, 670). Here, a systematic screening of catalysts for HER among N- and Sidefective MoSi2N4-supported single non-precious transition metal (TM) and non-metal (NM) atom catalysts is performed by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Interestingly, the single O/P/Fe/Nb atom doped N-(Si-) defective MoSi2N4 monolayer were found to possess excellent HER performance presenting a nearzero Delta G(H), which is comparable to or even better than the state-of-the-art Pt-based materials. Moreover, the novel HER activities of some TM doped structures were explained by the "states filling" model. The energy level of the first available unoccupied states for accommodating hydrogen drops after the introduction of TM atom, which modulates the hydrogen binding strength. This work opens the door for the application of MoSi2N4 monolayer and other related 2D materials in the field of energy conversion.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000691541200002

The content of Ca in the real flue gas will result in the deactivation of catalysts. In this work, the effect of Ca(OH)(2) on the denitration performance of the Fe-Ce/TiO2 catalyst for SCR reaction was explored. The BET, XRD, XPS, NH3-TPD, Py-IR, UV-Vis DRS, H-2-TPR, and SEM-EDS mapping techniques were used to characterize the evolution of active species and the surface properties over the studied catalysts. The gained results demonstrate that the Ca(OH)(2) results in serious deactivation of Fe-Ce/TiO2 catalyst for NH3-SCR reaction and the degree of deactivation is closely related to the loading of Ca(OH)(2). Such serious deactivation caused by Ca(OH)(2) is attributed to the smaller surface area, the declined redox ability and surface acidity, the lower content of Ce3+ and Fe3+, as well as the less surface adsorbed oxygen species. Moreover, the addition of Ca(OH)(2) leads to poor dispersion of Ce and Fe species over the catalyst surface, which may also be responsible for the fall of the catalytic performance of the catalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1878-5190	1878-5204		WOS:000643170100001

In this work, an Fe-doped NiCoP hybrid hollow nanocage (denoted as Fe-NiCoP) was synthesized through the phosphorization of the product from [Fe(CN)(6)](3-)-intercalated NiCo-LDH (layered double hydroxide), where the original ZIF-67-Co was used as the template. Because of the hollow nanostructure and the synergistic effect between multiple components, the Fe-NiCoP catalyst exhibited promising hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities in 1.0 M KOH with low overpotentials of 147 and 235 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, the Fe-NiCoP catalyst only achieved a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the voltage of 1.60 V. Inspired by the excellent OER performance of the Fe-NiCoP catalyst, a Zn-air battery was built to explore the Fe-NiCoP catalyst for practical application. After 900 successive cycles, the Fe-NiCoP + Pt/C catalysts exhibited excellent cycling stability at 5 mA cm(-2), which was a much stronger performance than that of the RuO2 + Pt/C catalysts. This work provides a practical strategy for the synthesis of high-performance and low-cost electrocatalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				1466-8033		WOS:000649311800001

The reaction mechanism is, however, still not well understood, hindering progress in the use of GO. By combining density functional theory (DFT), ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) calculations, and in situ infrared absorption spectroscopy, the thermal evolution of both carbonyl and ether groups in multilayered GO is shown to vary dramatically upon individual intercalation of methanol, ethanol, and water molecules. In hydrated GO, bare etch holes are generated by thermal annealing, as evidenced by the evolution of carbon dioxide (CO2) molecules. In contrast, the replacement of water by methanol or ethanol prevents defect enlargement during annealing. Furthermore, ethanol is found to repair the etch holes by facilitating the formation of new hexagonal carbon rings.

In this work we report the facile synthesis of metal-free hybrids by integrating graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with nitrogen-and phosphorus-doped nanoporous graphene sheets. A phosphorusdoped metal-free hybrid electrocatalyst (g-C3N4@P-pGr) displayed excellent HER performance with an overpotential of -0.34 V, high exchange current density of 3.33 x 10(-6) A cm(-2), onset potential of 0.076 V, Tafel slope of 90 mV dec(-1), Gibbs free energy of 0.16 eV, and long-term durability comparable to that of well-developed metal catalysts. Tafel slope analysis suggests that the Volmer-Tafel mechanism is the most favorable HER kinetics for these metal-free hybrids. The extraordinary HER performance stems from a strong synergistic effect between the highly exposed active sites generated by the introduction of in-plane pores into graphene and the coupling of g-C3N4.									76	2	0	0	5	0	78			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000366837000011

To date, the exploration of their full scope is thwarted by (i) the lack of synthetic techniques with control over intermetallic coordination, and (ii) the challenging characterization of these materials. Herein, carbon-host functionalization is presented as a strategy to selectively generate Au-Ru dimers and isolated sites by simple incipient wetness impregnation, as corroborated by careful X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis. The distinct catalytic fingerprints are unveiled via the hydrogen evolution reaction, employed as a probe for proton adsorption properties. Intriguingly, the virtually inactive Au atoms enhance the reaction kinetics of their Ru counterparts already when spatially isolated, by shifting the proton adsorption free energy closer to neutrality. Remarkably, the effect is magnified by a factor of 2 in dimers. These results exemplify the relevance of controlling intermetallic coordination for the rational design of bimetallic low-nuclearity catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000761542100001	35224866

Although significant progress has been made recently, it is still challenging to obtain bifunctional electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and durability suitable for seawater electrolysis because of the scarcity of precious metals and inadequate state-of-the-art materials for the overall reaction. The development of high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts is crucial to the commercialization of overall seawater electrolysis and in this review, the mechanism and challenges of seawater electrolysis are introduced. Optimization strategies for different types of non-noble-metal-based electrocatalysts including structural regulation, interface regulation, doping regulation, in situ assembly, alloying, and amorphization are summarized to elucidate the re-lationship among composition, structure, and properties. Finally, the challenge and prospective for fu-ture development of non-noble-metal-based bifunctional catalysts are discussed. This paper aims at providing guidance and insights into the rational design of highly efficient catalytic materials for prac-tical seawater splitting.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

The high activity of this catalyst can be attributed to the facilitated electrolyte penetration, promoted gas release, shortened ionic diffusion length, and abundant catalytic active sites enabled by a unique structure with a shaggy surface and an open space as well as the intrinsic high catalytic activity of NiCo-hydroxysulfide. Considering that neutral hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is more thermodynamically favorable than alkaline HER due to the pH effect, a concept of neutral-alkaline hybrid water splitting enabled by the bifunctional NiCo-CHS NW/CC is further proposed. This hybrid water splitting system exhibits a much lower cell voltage (just 1.43 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) with a large energy-consumption decrease compared to the alkaline water splitting system.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2168-0485			WOS:000720777100021

Soc, A. 120, 59 (1928)] were the first to carry out a systematic series of measurements of the same electrode reaction, hydrogen evolution, on a number of metals. However, they did not have an electrocatalytic attitude and consequently did not directly compare the rate constants from such measurements. The word "electrocatalysis" was first used by Grubb [Low Temperature Hydrocarbons, 17th Annual Power Sources Conference, Atlantic City (1963)] in 1963 in connection with the investigations of fuel cells. However, the first interpretation of electrocatalysis came before that in a famous paper by Horiuti and Polanyi [Acta Physicochini., U.S.S.R. 2, 505 (1935)] and the basic diagram of this paper is given. Here the rate of the reaction is controlled by the heat of activation and there is a relationship between this quantity and heat of adsorption DELTA-DELTA-H(ox) = beta-DELTA-DELTA-H(Ads).This seminal theory of 1935 has played a part in various guises in the development of electrocatalysis till today. In this document, examples of application of this theory will be given in the form of recent progress made and then the discussion will change to a presentation of near future tasks, the presentation ending by an attempt to predict some possible electrocatalytic situations beyond 2050.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0360-3199			WOS:A1992JL13000004

To elucidate this, PAN and poly(acrylonitrile-co-itaconic acid) with higher degree of isotacticity were prepared through template-assisted free-radical polymerization in the presence of MgCl2. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was employed to quantitatively track the structural evolutions of the PAN (co) polymer precursors during their TOS procedures. The improved TOS efficiencies of the precursors were evidenced by high extents of cyclization, high concentrations of cyclized rings and enhanced oxygen uptakes of the isotactic PAN (co) polymers during the TOS procedures. The isotactic PAN (co) polymer precursors also exhibited relatively large heat evolutions with broad exothermic curves in differential scanning calorimetry observations, further suggesting efficient TOS procedures with safer processing conditions. The efficient TOS procedures of the isotactic PAN (co) polymer precursors resulted in carbon materials with high degrees of crystallinity and high amounts of sp(2) clusters, affording much improved electrical conductivities. This study provided knowledge on the structural characteristics of the precursors for carbon materials with pre-designed properties, which is critical for their success in high-end applications.

Although platinum (Pt) is the most efficient catalyst towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), its high cost is a large limitation. Herein, we report a simple self-growth-assisted reduction route for fabricating a coral-like dendritic AgPt alloy nanocatalyst on a carbon support to lower Pt utilization and enhance the electrocatalytic performance. Due to its unique morphological features and alloy nature, the AgPt nanocoral (NCs)/C catalyst with 50 at% Ag shows excellent HER performance in acidic electrolyte with an extremely low overpotential of 16.61 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 19.05 mV dec(-1), which are improved compared to those of a carbon-supported Pt (E-TEK) catalyst. In addition, the AgPt NCs/C catalyst exhibits enhanced reaction kinetics and superior CO-poisoning resistance for the methanol oxidation process. This study not only describes the design of a cost-effective HER catalyst but also provides a robust catalyst for energy conversion technologies.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2633-5409		WOS:000738882100001

H-2 evolution was used as a model reaction to evaluate the photocatalytic properties of Ni/TiO2 materials containing different Ni-oxo species, which are prepared by three methods. Ni nuclearity-dependent H-2 evolution was shown by comparison of H-2 production rates over such Ni/TiO2 photocatalysts. Detailed characterizations clearly revealed the triple role of atomically isolated Ni species as light-harvesting, electron-trapping, and hydrogen-evolving sites in the photocatalytic reaction. The Ti-O-Ni molecular junctions formed at the NiO-TiO2 interface perform the function of p-n heterojunctions and create visible light absorption and photocatalysis. It was well established that visible light photocatalysis follows a physical mechanism of metal-to-metal charge transfer in Ti-O-Ni linkages severing as visible-light chromophores. Hydrogen gas is reduced and evolved at oxygen vacancies of the TiO2 surface. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									56	6	0	0	8	0	57			0021-9517	1090-2694		WOS:000347134100017

Herein, we use a dual-functional metal template to achieve the on-demand control of dispersed active M-N-C sites, porous structures, and surface wettability in a carbon nanofiber catalyst. The resulting engineered carbon nanofibers possess a high surface area (612.2 m(2) g(-1)), greatly improved accessibility to active catalytic sites, excellent surface hydrophilicity, and enhanced Fe(Co)-N-x/C interactions, demonstrating excellent bifunctional catalytic activities for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions with long-term stability. When employed in air electrodes for aqueous rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs), the ZABs show a high specific capacity (740 mA h g(Zn)(-1)), excellent rate capabilities, and, in particular, exceptional cycling stability over 2000 cycles. Furthermore, flexible ZABs fabricated using air electrodes containing this catalyst and a hydrogel electrolyte demonstrate outstanding performance, with a high open circuit potential (1.42 V), large peak power density (188.6 mW cm(-2)), high specific capacity (647 mA h g(Zn)(-1)), excellent round-trip efficiency of >64% over 500 cycles, and performance retention under various mechanical deformation processes. This unique and tunable carbon nanofiber engineering approach can create noble-metal-free high-performance bifunctional oxygen catalysts, outperforming Pt/C-IrO2 and bringing us one step closer to realizing a reliable energy storage solution for future flexible electronics.									25	1	0	0	1	0	25			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000526936600027

Developing active, stable, and low-cost electrocatalysts is important for practical applications with requirements such as scalability and durability. Herein, an efficient method for the electrodeposition of high-activity cobalt iron-phosphorus (CoxFe1-x-P) films as bi-functional electrocatalysts is presented. For films with a cobalt/iron atomic ratio of 1.07, the electrodeposited CoxFe1-x-P films showed outstanding electrocatalytic performance for both the H-2 and O-2 evolution reactions (HER and OER, respectively). In the HER, the overpotential and Tafel slope of the CoxFe1-x-P film on the copper plate were 169 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and 56.9 mV/dec, respectively. In the case of the OER, the CoxFe1-x-P film on dendritic copper exhibited superior performance with an overpotential of 290 mV and a Tafel slope of 39.2 mV/dec. In the two-electrode system consisting of CoxFe1-x-P film on the copper plate without (HER) and with dendritic copper (OER) for full water splitting, the electrodes exhibited a low overpotential of 1.64 V at 10 mA/cm(2) and excellent long-term stability over several days under alkaline conditions.

Herein, we demonstrate a dual-defective Co3O4 nanoarrays (F-Co3O4-x) electrocatalyst with well-modulated electronic structure of Co-centers for greatly enhanced overall water-splitting (OWS). DFT calculations and kinetic analysis disclose that F-doping and O-vacancy can synergistically break the energy barrier limit of water dissociation step for facilitating the production of hydrogen free radical (H*) in alkaline HER. The F-Co3O4-x experimentally exhibits supersmall overpotentials of 77 and 192 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, outperforming the most reported CoOx-based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, F(-)induced surface self-reconstruction is observed during oxygen evolution reaction (OER), in which abundant key intermediates (*OOH) generate with the F-leaching. The obtained F-Co3O4-x as a dual-functional electrocatalyst therefore gives an ultralow cell voltage of 1.56 V at 10 mA cm(-2) with a long-term durability of 120 h in OWS configuration. This work exhibits a rational design of multiple-defect engineered electrocatalysts for high-performance overall water-splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000707037200031

In this work, a three-phase composite electrocatalysts NiFe2O4/Ni@C were prepared via pyrolysis from self-assembled MOF nanosheets aggregates. The excellent electrocatalytic activity of the obtained electrocatalysts with various Ni:Fe ratios is demonstrated. Especially, the NiFe2O4/Ni@C sample with the mole ratio of Ni:Fe = 1:1 can use the overpotential (eta) of 330 and 423 mV to drive 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) respectively. After 80 000 s/22 h, the current density could retained 90% of the initial current density. The excellent activity and stability of the electrocatalysts are attributed to nickel and iron ions with uniform dispersion at atomic level in the NiFe2O4 phase and the synergistic effect of nickel and NiFe2O4 nanoparticles with amorphous carbon atoms or nanoparticles around.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000620497400001	33440356

The mutants were characterized by a reduced quantum efficiency for photosynthetic oxygen evolution, which varied in a pH-dependent manner, a reduced capacity to oxidize artificial donors to photosystem II, and P680+ reduction kinetics (microsecond) that were essentially similar to wild type. In addition, a dark-stable radical was detected by ESR in mutant photosystem II particles but not in wild-type particles. This radical was similar in g value and lineshape to chlorophyll or carotenoid cations but could have arisen from a tyrosine-195 cation. The ability of the photosystem II trap (P680+) to oxidize tyrosine residues suggests that the mutant tyrosine residue could be used as a redox-sensitive probe to investigate the environment around the photosystem II trap.									46	1	0	0	37	0	46			0027-8424			WOS:A1991GK67600054	1656461

The aim of this study is to compare some previously developed mechanisms of thermal cracking and to identify the main elementary reactions and the most sensible ones for tar decomposition in a two-stage process. Evaluation of plasma chemistry is performed by a comparison between experimental data and thermal kinetic predicted results. Distribution analysis of condensable organics shows that for all the representative species, the levels of tars are distinct in the first stage and almost negligible after the plasma treatment. Under the given reaction conditions, the organic cracking products such as methane and C-2-species are completely converted to carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and no soot significantly formed. Oxygen atoms initially formed from CO2 were identified as the major active species involved in the oxidative decomposition of hydrocarbon intermediates and soot precursors. As a result, a two-stage system shows better reforming results, large treatment capacity and almost complete carbon conversion. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A reaction is deemed up- or downregulated if it is constrained to assume flux values significantly above or below its steady-state before the genetic manipulations. The developed framework is demonstrated by studying the overproduction of ethanol in Escherichia coli. Computational results reveal the existence of synergism between reaction deletions and modulations implying that the simultaneous application of both types of genetic manipulations yields the most promising results. For example, the downregulation of phosphoglucomutase in conjunction with the deletion of oxygen uptake and pyruvate formate Lyase yields 99.8% of the maximum theoretical ethanol yield. Conceptually, the proposed strategies redirect both the carbon flux as well as the cofactors to enhance ethanol production in the network. The OptReg framework is a versatile tool for strain design which allows for a broad array of genetic manipulations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, nitrogen-doped ceria (N-CeO2) nanoparticles are prepared and then coupled with nitrogen-doped graphene (N-Gr) to create an active and long-lasting N-CeO2/N-Gr heterocatalyst. Optoelectronic features of N-doping materials (e.g., plasmon) are significantly improved toward the visible-light region, particularly for 3.9% N-CeO2/N-Gr nanocomposites. Namely, the 3.9% N-CeO2 possesses numerous catalytic active defects (N states, oxygen vacancy, and Ce3+ species), leading to a narrow bandgap energy and to the improved plasmonic properties of the ceria host, while the N-Gr preferably serves as an electron scavenger to collect plasmon-generated hot electrons migrating from 3.9% N-CeO2 to drive photocatalytic reactions under the irradiation of visible-light. Resultantly, the 3.9% N-CeO2/N-Gr photocatalyst delivers an impressive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rate of 3.7 mu mol mg(cat)(-1) h(-1) under visible-light, which is 2.0- and 8.2-fold greater than those obtained from 3.9% N-CeO2 and CeO2 ones, respectively. Additionally, the combination of 3.9% N-CeO2 and N-Gr synergistically produces a long-lasting plasmonic HER photocatalyst system. Metal-free plasmonic N-doped oxides supported by N-doped graphene pave a promising pathway for efficient light-to-hydrogen fuel production accordingly.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000639430500001

The effects of sintering temperature on the density, microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of the materials are studied. The dynamic analysis of densification process is carried out, and the interface strengthening mechanism is deeply analyzed. The results show that the addition of SiC can improve the strength and toughness of W. The formation of amorphous SiO2 reduces the sintering temperature on densification of the composites. When the sintering temperature is 1880 degrees C, the relative density and the tensile strength is 99.4%, 431 MPa respectively. On the one hand, the existence of glass phase avoids the formation of harmful interfacial reaction and reduces the possibility of microcracks; On the other hand, it promotes the wetting and bonding between the phases, which forms a dense interface layer after cooling. The formation of the new interface replaces the original weak W-W interface, which enhances the interfacial bonding strength of tungsten matrix. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is used to directly observe the W/W2C/SiO2 three-phase bonding interface and the interface structure.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0263-4368	2213-3917		WOS:000687865600004

In this work, a trimetallic (Cu, Ni, Co) selenide is fabricated in-situ on the nickel-cobalt foam (NCF) modified by the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma (PNCF) with a facile hydrothermal method. The resulting transitionmetal-based selenide (Cu3Se2@CoSe2-NiSe2/PNCF) exhibits excellent catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH, and the overpotentials stimulated with a current density of 10 (j(10)) and 100 (j(100)) mA cm(-2) are similar to 42 and 178 mV in HER process, as well as 240 and 270 mV in OER. Specifically, the electrocatalytic activity of Cu3Se2@CoSe2-NiSe2/PNCF is better than the benchmarked RuO2 for OER in the high current density region (>j(250)). hi addition, the amount of H-2 and O-2 gases for Cu3Se2@CoSe2-NiSe2/PNCF stimulated with h o are similar to 1.52 and 0.9 mmol h(-1), respectively, thus exhibiting higher efficiency than numerous nonprecious catalysts containing transition metals.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2168-0485			WOS:000595489200024

BiVO4 is, however, limited by poor charge separation and slow oxygen evolution dynamics, for which surface modification with oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs) becomes indispensable. Among many OECs, Prussian blue type coordination polymers have lately attracted an escalating research interest attributable to their low cost, chemical robustness and easy synthesis using nontoxic earth-abundant elements. In this study, we report a simple method for efficient surface modification of Zr-doped BiVO4 nanostructured electrodes with an amorphous Ni-Fe based Prussian blue (NiFePB) polymer. The method resulted in a remarkable 10-fold enhancement of photocurrent (3.23 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode RHE) and a low onset potential of 0.208 V versus RHE, which are both records for Prussian blue (PB) type materials. Our coating method results in a (Zr)BiVO4/NiFePB core-shell structure, in which a 1015 nm NiFePB shell makes a superior conformal coating with complete coverage on the (Zr)BiVO4 nanoparticles. The high conformity and amorphous nature of the coating are believed to be key features for the high photocatalytic activity and for a high photocorrosion resistance of the photoanodes during > 50 h of AM1.5 G solar illumination. Our method illustrates the large potential of Prussian blue type materials, when properly coated, as efficient and highly stable OECs.									26	1	0	0	2	0	26			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000457952600089

Herein, we report a facile scalable and one-step electrochemical deposition approach for the development of a self-supported 3D nanoporous S-doped amorphous NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe composite electrode with outstanding OER electrocatalytic activity and robust durability in alkaline media. Benefiting from the 3D nanoporous architectures and their in situ growth on a highly conductive substrate, the novel S-doped NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe composite electrode offers an ideal platform for fast electron transport and efficient mass transport. It also provides abundant active surface area as well as accessible active sites for a catalytic reaction. Impressively, the S-doped composite electrode displays superior OER activity in 1.0 M KOH that compares favorably with the state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst. Low overpotentials of 260 and 285 mV (iR corrected) are required to reach long-term stable current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm(-2) for OER, respectively. The electrolyzer cell obtained by pairing this S-doped composite electrode as an anode with a Ni-Mo based cathode for overall water-splitting works efficiently in both 1.0 M (1.52 V for 10 mA cm(-2) and 1.79 V for 100 mA cm(-2)) and 30 wt% KOH (1.69 V for 100 mA cm(-2)) solutions, with long durability for over 220 h. Such catalyst couple exhibits superior catalytic performance and holds great promise for potential application in electrochemical water splitting.									67	0	0	0	3	0	67			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000423466100023

This review presents materials design strategies for constructing improved electrocatalysts based on MOF precursors/templates, with special emphasis on component manipulation, morphology control, and structure engineering. Guided by these strategies, recently developed MOF-derived materials have exhibited remarkable activity, selectivity, and stability for various energy-conversion processes, manifesting great potential for replacing precious-metal-based catalysts in next-generation energy devices. Existing challenges and opportunities regarding MOF-derived electrocatalysts are also discussed. It is anticipated that by extending current materials design strategies to a wider range of MOF precursors for various energy-related electrocatalytic reactions, significant advances toward achieving highly efficient electrocatalysts can be made.									404	24	0	0	21	1	407			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000423878500004

Herein, we design a facile strategy to fabricate the nickel nanoflakes onto 4-Amino-4H-1,2,4-triazole (ATz) functionalized graphene surface through the amidation reaction (Ni/ATz-G) via wet-chemical method. For the development of nickel nanoflakes, nitrogen atoms of ATz which grafted onto graphene sheets are coordinated to nickel atoms initially, and then the formation of nickel nanoflakes is proceeded via epitaxial film growth. Several instrumental characterizations confirm that the nickel nanoflakes are in the Ni(OH)(2) form. The as prepared catalyst exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity towards the HER while it requires only 48 and 58 mV overpotential to gain current density at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline and acidic media, respectively. Also it shows improved kinetics and higher stability in both media which makes it a promising catalyst for practical application. The coordination in between nitrogen and nickel nanoflakes and the amidation between ATz and graphene (Ni-N-C system) play a key role in not only intrinsic catalytic activity for HER but also high stability through better grafting of nickel nanoflakes active sites onto the graphene.									15	1	0	0	3	0	15			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000525637300064

The evident prior-beta grain boundary, the inside of which is composed of predominant alpha-lath and slight beta-phase, is achieved. The EBF3-manufactured alloy displays a significantly improved corrosion resistance compared to the wrought alloy, especially the XY-plane. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results reveal the formation of a more stable oxide film for the EBF3manufactured alloy due to a higher fraction of phase boundaries induced by the fine alpha-laths; besides, the heterogeneous distribution of compositions between alpha- and beta-phases can be effectively alleviated, resulting in the absence of the strong galvanic corrosion, which has been illustrated combined experiments and ab-initio calculations. The electrochemical analyses indicate that all samples exposed to the artificial seawater exhibit a typical spontaneous passive behavior, deriving from the presence of a compact oxide film, while a active-passive transition behavior is observed in 5 M HCl, stemming from the formation of a non-protective porous oxide film, which is well interpreted using the mixed potential theory. In addition, the oxygen reduction reaction, determined by diffusion and charge-transfer processes, is the predominant cathodic reaction in the artificial seawater, whereas, in 5 M HCl, the cathodic reaction is primarily associated with the hydrogen evolution reaction controlled by the discharge step.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000800379000003

This is the first time that a new growth mechanism of manganese carbonate via an oriented attachment mechanism of crystalline manganese carbonate nanospheres using its ferromagnetic property is revealed. The co-precipitation of divalent metal ions can be employed for the synthesis of metal-doped manganese carbonates. As-synthesized metal carbonates were employed as templates for producing porous metal-doped manganese oxides by calcination at 500-900 degrees C. The retention of template morphologies and metal oxide phases can be controlled by varying the calcination temperature. Doping of manganese oxide by Co2+ and Ni2+ to form a trimetal oxide can improve the catalytic performances for the ORR and OER under alkaline conditions. In addition, the trimetal oxide shows exceptional stabilities of 95.1% and 99.6% relative current retention for the ORR and OER at 40 000 s, respectively. The catalyst produced in this work may be practically used towards the ORR and OER in many systems such as metal-air batteries.									12	1	0	0	1	0	13			2398-4902			WOS:000434241200005

(1998) Biochemistry 37, 3581-3587]. This state was recently assigned to the S-2 state of the OEC [Schansker, G., Goussias, C., Petrouleas, V., and Rutherford, A. W. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 3057-3064]. On the basis of EPR spectroscopy and flash-induced oxygen evolution patterns, we show that a similar reduction process takes place in PSII samples of the thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus at both -30 and 0 degreesC. An EPR multiline signal, very similar but not identical to that of the S-2 state in spinach, was obtained with monomeric and dimeric PSII core complexes from S. elongatus only after incubation at -30 degreesC. The assignment of this EPR multiline signal to the S-2 state is corroborated by measurements of flash-induced oxygen evolution patterns and detailed fits using extended Kok models. The small reproducible shifts of several low-field peak positions of the S-2 EPR multiline signal in S. elongatus compared to spinach suggest that slight differences in the coordination geometry and/or the ligands of the manganese cluster exist between thermophilic cyanobacteria and higher plants.									11	0	0	0	9	0	11			0006-2960			WOS:000180695200022	12549922

After the detailed presentation of the 2D nonstationary model implementing both oxygen and aluminum diffusion, the propagation of the reaction front in an Al/CuO thin film was studied. The model qualitatively reproduces the dependency of the reaction front progression rate spatially as a function of the fuel concentration. Calculations also evidence the inverse evolution of flame front width with respect to the reaction front velocity. A procedure to estimate the heat loss generated by the fact that the reactants and products may vaporize prior to reaction completion was proposed by imposing a flame temperature limit close to Cu vaporization point. This work also shows that microscopic fluctuations in the instantaneous reaction front velocity can be observed for reactant diffusion activation energy ( E-a ) of 125 kJ/mol, before quenching for greater E-a . Finally, we demonstrate the potential of this new 2D nonstationary model to investigate the thermal effect of additives such as metallic impurities in the Al/CuO thin film that can lead to the flame front corrugation at the microscale. The simulations show that a metallic particle acts first to boost the reaction velocity as its high thermal conductivity helps the upfront heating. Then, the particle being also a heat sink, a local slowing down of the front velocity is observed.(c) 2021 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This paper analyzed the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in underground brine of Hadahexiu Salt Lake and the surrounding waters for tracing the origin of the brine. Results indicate that: the mean value of deltaD and delta~(18)O are respectively - 0.53 and 4.01 of the underground brine of Hadahexiu Salt Lake,-36.73 and -5.51 of Heihe River, 1.26 and 2.73 of the Juyan Lake water, -5.30 and - 1.20 %o of local precipitation. The evaporation trend line of the waters in the research area deviates from the global meteoric water line according to the formula deltaD =5.32delta~(18)O - 20.08. The deuterium surplus value d of Heihe River is the highest and the lowest that of the lake water and the underground brine,while the lowest d value displays negative correlation with TDS. The positive values of deltaD and delta~(18)O and the lower d values suggest that the waters in the research area has gone through intensive evaporation along with isotopes exchange reaction of oxidiferous minerals. Hydrogen and oxygen isotope values of the brine and Juyan Lake are comparable, indicating that both are evolved from Heihe River.			内蒙古哈达贺休盐湖蕴藏着较为丰富的地下卤水资源,但对其成因和演化机制尚缺乏充分的认识。采用稳定同位素方法,研究了哈达贺休盐湖地下卤水及其周边水体的氢氧同位素组成特征,并对卤水的成因进行了分析。结果表明:哈达贺休盐湖地下卤水的deltaD和delta~(18)O值平均值分别为-0.53 和4.01,黑河河水的deltaD和delta~(18)O值平均值分别为-36.73 和-5.51,居延海湖水的deltaD和delta~(18)O值平均值分别为1.26 和2.73,当地大气降水的deltaD和delta~(18)O值平均值分别为-5.30和-1.20。研究区水体的蒸发趋势线方程为deltaD =5.32delta~(18)O -20.08,该蒸发线偏离全球大气降水线。黑河河水的氘盈余值(d)最大,湖水和地下卤水d的最小,而且湖水和卤水的d值与TDS呈负相关关系。偏正的deltaD和delta~(18)O值以及较小的d值,表明研究区卤水经历了强烈的蒸发,同时还存在与含氧类矿物的同位素交换反应。卤水和居延海湖水氢氧同位素值分布比较集中,并且接近,二者都由黑河河水演化而来。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1008-858X			CSCD:6975534

In this work, we present a new technique for enhancing alkaline hydrogen evolution through tuning the d-band center energy level. A Cr-doped Fe3C@carbon core-shell structure grown on a N-doped graphitic framework (Cr-Fe3C@C-NGF) is pre-sented, demonstrating high HER activity. Cr-Fe3C@C-NGF with the optimal Cr doping level of 0.81 wt% exhibits an overpotential of 126 mV at 10 mA cm-2, which is substantially lower than that of the pristine Fe3C@C-NGF (257 mV). Experimental results and density functional theory calculations both suggest that Cr doping downshifts the d-band center energy level, which accelerates hydrogen desorption from the Fe sites, thus improving HER performance. This work may open a key avenue for the optimization of Fe3C-based HER electrocatalysts via modulation of the d-band energy level. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The addition of carbonate salts to an aqueous reaction solution has been known to promote stoichiometric O-2 evolution and H2O2 production via H2O oxidation. To elucidate the effect of carbonates, density functional theory calculations are performed to study the photoinduced H2O and H2CO3 oxidation mechanisms on TiO2 and BiVO4. The oxidation reactions proceeded via peroxide intermediates, such as H2O2 for H2O, H2C2O6 for H2CO3, and H2CO4 for the coexistence of H2O and H2CO3 molecules. Regardless of the reactant and metal oxide, the free energy changes in the four proton-coupled electron-transfer (PCET) steps of the oxidation mechanism indicate that the first PCET requires the highest energy input and is the rate-limiting step. All PCET steps of the H2O oxidation, except the second one, are more endergonic than those of the H2CO3 oxidation. The H2O reactant requires a larger energy barrier at the highest energy profile, as well as at the final state, than the H2CO3 reactant. The computational results verify that the adsorbed H2CO3 molecule is easily photo-oxidized compared with the adsorbed H2O molecule, facilitating the formation of the peroxide intermediate and improving O-2 evolution and H2O2 production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000759684500001	35195121

Cytochrome c(6) (1 Fe) is the only redox catalyst linking the cytochrome b(6)-f complex to PS I in most algae; in many cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta cytochrome c(6) and the copper-containing plastocyanin are alternatives, with the availability of iron and copper regulating their relative expression, while higher plants only have plastocyanin. Iron, copper and zinc occur in enzymes that remove active oxygen species and that are in part bound to the thylakoid membrane. These enzymes are ascorbate peroxidase (Fe) and iron-(cyanobacteria, and most algae) and copper-zinc- (some algae; higher plants) superoxide dismutase. Iron-containing NAD(P)H-PQ oxidoreductase in thylakoids of cyanobacteria and many eukaryotes may be involved in cyclic electron transport around PS I and in chlororespiration. Manganese is second to iron in its quantitative role in the thylakoids, with four Mn (and 1 Ca) per PS II involved in O-2 evolution. The roles of the transition metals in redox catalysts can in broad terms be related to their redox chemistry and to their availability to organisms at the time when the pathways evolved. The quantitative roles of these trace metals varies genotypically (e.g. the greater need for iron in thylakoid reactions of cyanobacteria and rhodophytes than in other O-2-evolvers as a result of their lower PS II:PS I ratio) and phenotypically (e.g. as a result of variations in PS II:PS I ratio with the spectral quality of incident radiation).									429	12	1	0	366	3	456			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000081949800002

We herein rationally fabricate Sn4P(3)/Co2P "stalk "- "cap "-typed nanoarrays (Sn4P(3)/Co2P SCNAs) with abundant heterointerfaces and elaborately implanted "caps ". The nanoarrayed structure can substantially enlarge the exposure of active sites and promote the mass/electron transport, thus accelerating the reaction kinetics. Moreover, the purposely grafted "caps " are beneficial to increase the hydrophilicity/aerophobicity, which facilitate the water affinity and release of generated gas bubbles. Accordingly, the obtained Sn4P3/Co2P SCNAs deliver exceptional electrocatalytic performances towards the HER and OER, as reflected by the over potentials of 45.4 and 280.4 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. More impressively, the two-electrode electrolyzer assembled by freestanding Sn4P(3)/Co2P SCNAs requires a cell voltage of 1.56 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits superior stability and full reversibility, holding great potential in practical water electrolysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000788166900002

The intercalation and oxidation reactions of graphite were investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry. In addition, the morphological changes of the graphite anodes at predetermined intervals of time during the electro-oxidation process were examined by scanning electron microscopy. The structural transformation of graphite was systematically characterized by different methods. Results showed that the electro-oxidation process induced oxygen-containing groups (i.e., hydroxyl, epoxide, carbonyl/ketone, and carboxyl groups) into the graphite backbone. Electrolytic graphite oxide presented a heterogeneous, indeterminate, and disordered system composed of crystalline and amorphous phases. The structure and microstructure of nuclear graphite, particularly its cracks and defects, primarily determined its destruction pathway during the electrolytic process. The mechanism of graphite lattice destruction could be attributed to the complicated interplay of water electrolysis, anionic intercalation, and gas evolution. The mechanical force caused by gas eruptions among the graphite lattice is the most important and essential factor favoring disintegration.[GRAPHICS]									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000387350200001

This lithium bismuth oxide crystallizes in the orthorhombic system with the lattice parameters a = 8.8278(3), b = 4.9135(2), and c = 10.6914(3) Angstrom, space group Pccn, and Z = 8. The crystal structure was refined using neutron powder diffraction data giving final R factors of R(WP) = 10.04, R(P) = 7.64, R(E) = 3.88, and R(I) = 4.86%. The LiBiO3 crystal structure is similar to that of LiSbO3. Both structures can be considered as based on an array of hexagonally closed packed oxygen atoms with cations occupying two-thirds of the octahedral sites. In both structures, the LiO6 octahedra share faces to form a continuous string. However, in the LiSbO3 structure SbO6 octahedra each share two edges forming a continuous zigzag chain whereas in the LiBiO3 structure BiO6 octahedra each share one edge only. Thus, the LiBiO3 structure also resembles the cubic KBiO3 structure, both structures being based on a dimer unit of the type Bi2O10 which shares corners forming a network having interstitial alkali cations. On heating to about 300 degrees C, LiBiO3 transforms to LiBiO2 through evolution of oxygen and reduction of Bi5+ to Bi3+.

The synthesized TTP was decorated with transition metal/metal oxide nanoparticles (Cu, Ni, and Cu-Ni). The presence of CuO and NiO nanoparticles on the TTP matrix were confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and the PXRD analysis and different morphologies with modest changes in particle size and porosity were confirmed by FE-SEM and HR-TEM studies. As evidenced by onset potential and current density, the Cu-TTP sample exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the electrochemical carboxylation of propylene oxide in the presence of CO2 and HER, whereas the Ni-TTP sample displayed excellent OER activity. The presence of pyridinic, pyrrolic, and quaternary nitrogen was attributed to the excellent catalytic activity of CuTTP for electrocarboxylation and HER activity, whereas secondary amine bonds and a combination of mechanisms were responsible for the increased OER activity of Ni-TTP the sample, as evidenced by XPS.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000793279600002

In this work, a novel Fe-Ni layered double hydroxide (LDH) material with homogeneous heterostructures is successfully synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal method. Compared with the ordinary Fe-Ni LDH arrays prepared by one step, this structure has a rougher surface, so it has a more extensive active area, thus providing more active sites. Due to the synergistic effect of different elements and more exposure of active sites, the catalytic effect of this material for water splitting is outstanding. The post-optimized FeNi@FeNi electrode exhibits extraordinary OER (oxygen evolution reaction) and HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) performance with OER overpotentials of 193, 231, and 306 mV and HER overpotentials of 127, 173, and 253 mV when the current density is 10, 20, and 50 mA.cm(-2), respectively. The improved electrolytic water performance reveals that the design of homogeneous heterostructures is maybe an alternative route to exploit high-efficiency catalysts and promote the application of nonprecious metal catalytic materials.									38	0	0	0	4	0	38			2168-0485			WOS:000484071600083

Petrographic and chemical analyses reveal that garnet was formed by dehydration melting reaction(s) of titaniferous biotite in an oxidized condition. Elevated oxygen fugacity might have promoted enrichment of Ti-bearing andradite component of garnet porphyroblasts formed during pre- to peak metamorphic condition in appropriate bulk chemistry. During the post-peak cooling history, Ti-bearing components in garnet decomposed to rhombohedral oxide solid solution (ilmenite-hematite). Detailed transmission electron microscopic study of the host garnet and ilmenite solid solution indicates that though there is an overall parallelism of (011) plane of host garnet and (011) plane of ilmenite, structural coherence between the two phases was progressively lost during growth from thin to thick needles. Appropriate cooling rate from high-temperature peak metamorphic condition arguably promoted growth of ilmenite solid solution through reaction-exsolution process within garnet porphyroblasts.

For the oxygen reduction during discharge, platinum (Pt) catalysts are common. During operation, vanadium (V) cations can penetrate through a proton exchange membrane into the water/air half-cell. The aim of the present work is to study whether V compounds are deposited on the Pt surface under operation conditions or whether the V ions influence the stability of Pt in any other way. Thereby, bulk platinum electrodes are compared as a simple model system to carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles via cyclic voltammetry. In the case of bulk platinum, electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance measurements showed no deposition of vanadium compounds but indicated the decrease of the (hydr)oxide layer on Pt above V3+ and VO2+ redox potentials. Cycling 100 times between oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution potentials with and without a heavy V contamination did not lead to significant degradation of the model catalyst and shows no influence of V ions. On the contrary, the nanoparticle-based catalyst significantly degraded during the same stability protocol. The V contamination lowered the degradation in this case.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000360300100004

Depending on conditions for reaction with oxygen, the initially planar Re(11 (2) over bar1) surface evolves sequentially to form zigzag chains consisting of (01 (1) over bar0) and (10 (1) over bar0) facets that coexist with stepped (11 (2) over bar1) plateaus; three-sided pyramids exposing (01 (1) over bar0), (10 (1) over bar0) and (33 (6) over bar4) facets; a faceted surface with five facets including (01 (1) over bar0), (10 (1) over bar0), (11 (2) over bar2)-(2 x 1), (01 (1) over bar1)-(2 x 1) and (10 (1) over bar1)-(2 x 1); and four-sided pyramids exposing {01 (1) over bar0} and {01 (1) over bar1)-(2 x 1) facets. We have observed reversible morphological transitions between the faceted surfaces and discovered that each intermediate facet in the evolutionary chain contains microscopic structural elements of the preceding and following facets, which may provide a natural explanation for the microscopic mass transport pathways in the morphological evolution.

We use a mixed cluster/continuum solvent model with varying number of explicit solvent molecules (n = 4-10) to calculate the solvation free energies (Delta G(solv)*) of Li+ and O-2(-) ions and neutral LiO2, Li2O2, LiO, and Li2O species in acetonitrile solvent. Calculations for complexes with the full first solvation shell around Li+ (n = 4) and O-2(-) (n = 8) show excellent agreement with the solvation free energies obtained using the cluster pair approximation (the error is below 2.0 kcal/mol). The use of the pure continuum model fitted to reproduce the experimental values of Delta G(solv)*(Li+) and Delta G(solv)*(O-2(-)) gives the solvation free energies of various lithium-oxygen species (LixOy; x, y = 1, 2) that are in excellent agreement with the results obtained using mixed cluster/continuum models (n >= 8). This provides a theoretical framework for including solvent effects in the theoretical models of oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in the aprotic Li-air battery.									33	0	0	0	3	0	33			1432-881X	1432-2234		WOS:000307274300008

By using the optical density ratio of the corresponding pixels in the two STXM images, the STXM experimental results indicated that the oxygen is homogeneously distributed in the pristine PAN fibers. During stabilization process, two important reactions occur and change the chemistry of PAN structure. In the skin section of PAN fiber,oxidation converts it into a conjugated and hetero-aromatic structure in the presence of oxygen. While in the core section of PAN fiber,cyclization turns linear PAN into a six-member ring structure due to the absence of oxygen. After treatment, an increase in the oxygen concentration in the skin of the PAN fibers is clearly observed while it remains constant in the core of PAN fibers, clearly demonstrating the diffusion process in the treatment. The propagating velocity of oxygen along the radical direction is about 0.033 mu m/min. This research shows that the STXM is a powerful technique to characterize the internal microstructure of the PAN pre-oxidized fibers, and therefore will help to rationally understand the evaluation mechanism of the skin-core structure.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-3304			WOS:000294090300015

Often, high-oxidation-state, high-energy metal oxo intermediates are proposed as mediators in elementary steps involving O-O bond cleavage and formation, but the mechanisms of these steps are difficult to study because of the fleeting nature of these species. Here we utilized a novel dianionic pentadentate ligand system that enabled a detailed mechanistic investigation of the protonation of a cobalt(III)-cobalt(III) peroxo dimer, a known intermediate in oxygen reduction catalysis to hydrogen peroxide. It was shown that double protonation occurs rapidly and leads to a low-energy O-O bond cleavage step that generates a Co(III) aquo complex and a highly reactive Co(IV) oxyl cation. The latter was probed computationally and experimentally implicated through chemical interception and isotope labeling experiments. In the absence of competing chemical reagents, it dimerizes and eliminates dioxygen in a step highly relevant to O-O bond formation in the oxygen evolution step in water oxidation. Thus, the study demonstrates both facile O-O bond cleavage and formation in the stoichiometric reduction of O-2 to H2O with 2 equiv of Co(II) and suggests a new pathway for selective reduction of O-2 to water via Co(III)-O-O-Co(III) peroxo intermediates.									32	0	0	0	4	0	32			0002-7863			WOS:000451933100018	30398331

Herein, we report novel chrysalis-like hydrophilic-carbon-shell supported abundant metallic Ni nanoparticles (O-C@Ni) as a promising oxygen electrocatalyst toward electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is derived from a unique organic-metal framework (MOF) based core-shell structure. Thanks to the superiorly hydrophilic affinity of oxygen-dopant-rich carbon-shell and the well-designed hollow architecture, this as-obtained O-C@Ni catalysts could deliver excellent ORR activity with a decent half-wave potential of 0.83 V and a small Tafel slope of 76 mV dec(-1), comparable with commercial Pt/C catalysts and being one of the most active transition-metal based ORR electrocatalysts reported. In particular, robust methanol endurance and excellent electrocatalytic stability are evidently observed for O-C@Ni catalysts during a long-term ORR operation, superior to commercial Pt/C catalysts. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy combined with water contact angle analyses reveals that the strong interfacial metal-support effect together with superiorly hydrophilic affinity enable OC@Ni catalysts with promoted catalytic kinetics towards efficient ORR performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000797649400007

However, major obstacles still remain in improving the NRR activity and selectivity, mainly arising from the chemical inertness of N-2 molecule, the sluggish reaction kinetics, and the competition between hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and NRR. The defect engineering can regulate and modify the local coordination environment of electrocatalysts, which could be considered as effective strategies to promote the intrinsic activity. In this review, recent advances on defect engineering of nanostructured electrocatalysts for NRR, including vacancy, doping, single atom, amorphization and high-index facet, are summarized. Particularly, the strategies of defect engineering, the reaction mechanisms, and the reliable NH3 detection methods, are systematically discussed. Finally, the opportunities and challenges towards the rational design and synthesis of advanced electrocatalysts with controlled defects for NRR are proposed.									76	7	0	0	2	0	77			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000581738300038

Theoretically, constructing a metal/metal hydroxide interface with a metal hydroxide acting as a water dissociation promotor and a metal as the subsequent hydrogen adsorption site is expected to accelerate the HER kinetics in neutral media. We found that the intercalation of tungstate into Ni(OH)(2) can tune the electronic structure of the Ni/Ni(OH)(2) interface, decrease the energetic barrier for the Volmer step, and thus optimize the HER performance of Ni/Ni(OH)(2) hybrid. Herein, a heterostructured Ni/Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet array on Cu foam is designed and constructed via a simple hydrothermal and subsequent plasma reduction strategy. The HER performance can be further enhanced by assembling tungstate-intercalated Ni/Ni(OH)(2) hybrid nanosheets on Cu2O nanotube arrays, exhibiting a low overpotential (39 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2)) and excellent stability (48 h).									27	0	0	0	5	0	27			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000612470000009

However, its synthesis normally requires high temperatures (1200-1800 degrees C), thus limiting research carried-out on them. The catalytic properties of the carbonitrides have so far been improved through post-synthesis partial surface oxidation. This makes the entire process of making the desired catalyst cumbersome and complex. In this work, cobalt-modified single-walled titanium carbonitride nanotube (Co@TiC0.25N0.75) is synthesized via solvothermal method followed by solid-solid separation process. The problem of high temperature required for TiCN synthesis is successfully overcome, and a Co doping strategy is used to improve its catalytic performance. Different mass ratios of Co nanoparticles are loaded onto TiC0.25N0.75. It discovers that only a fraction of the Co dissolves at TiC0.25N0.75 lattice due to the solubility limit being similar to 0.98%. The remaining fraction of Co is found at the wall of the TiC0.25N0.75. The Co nanoparticles at the TiC0.25N0.75 wall complement the catalytic activity, while the dissolved Co at its lattice acts as active site modifier by increasing the proportion of Ti 2p(3/2) in the low valence state. In alkaline solution, 10%Co@TiC0.25N0.75 shows appreciable ORR activity with onset and half-wave potential located at 0.85 and 0.73 V respectively; the performance is higher than that of TiN (0.69 and 0.55 V) and single-phase TiC0.25N0.75(0.74 and 0.62 V). The results indicate that a charge transfer occurred between Co and TiC0.25N0.75 due to strong coupling effect. This gives a catalyst with appreciable ORR activity and stability.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000552156600001		
J	Arvidson, RS; Mackenzie, FT; Guidry, M					Arvidson, Rolf/0000-0002-8997-1262			MAGic: A Phanerozoic model for the geochemical cycling of major rock-forming components								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE				306	3			135	190		10.2475/ajs.306.3.135				MAR 2006	2006	A dynamical model (MAGic) is presented that describes the elemental cycling of sedimentary materials involving sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, carbon, oxygen, iron, sulfur and phosphorous through much of the Phanerozoic. The model incorporates the basic reactions controlling atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations, continental and seafloor weathering of silicate and carbonate rocks, net ecosystem productivity, basalt-seawater exchange reactions, precipitation and diagenesis of chemical sediments and authigenic silicates, oxidation-reduction reactions involving carbon, sulfur, and iron, and subduction-decarbonation reactions. Although MAGic contains feedback and forcing functions adapted from the GEOCARB models (Berner, 1991, 1994; Berner and Kothavala, 2001), these functions are incorporated in a reservoir-reaction scheme that is considerably more detailed. Coupled reservoirs include shallow and deep cratonic silicate and carbonate rocks and sediments, seawater, atmosphere, oceanic sediments and basalts, and the shallow mantle. Model results are reasonably consistent with recently published constraints provided by fluid inclusion, isotopic, floral, and mineralogical records. We have used these results to evaluate sensitivity to uncertainties in the history of the earth-ocean-atmosphere system over the past 500 Ma: the advent of pelagic carbonate sedimentation, the importance of burial versus early diagenetic dolomite formation, the importance of reverse weathering, and the relationship of these processes to seafloor spreading rates. Results include a general pattern of dolomite abundance during periods of elevated seafloor spreading and alkalinity production, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations for most of the Phanerozoic similar to those predicted by GEOCARB, and covariance of seawater sulfate to calcium ratios with magnesium to calcium ratios. These trends are broadly consistent with proxies for seawater composition and the mass-age data of the rock record itself.									88	3	0	0	14	0	91			0002-9599			WOS:000238587200001

Recently, it has been studied in the field of CO catalysis by doping transition metallic or non-metallic elements to improve the catalytic ability of ceria, while recent research has demonstrated that many oxides containing cobalt display better electrocatalytic activity. In this study cobalt doped ceria nanoparticles were prepared by homogeneous precipitation method. The electrochemical tests show that the optimum doping molar ratio is 20mol% for ORR and OER catalytic effect. After 10 hours of catalysis, the current density of ORR and OER decrease by about 20% and 5%, respectively, far below the corresponding values when noble metal and undoped cerium oxide nanoparticles were used as catalysts, and it indicated that the prepared catalyst owns good catalytic stability. In addition, XPS and other tests show that the decrease of charge transfer impedance (the improvement of electronic conductivity), the increase of active oxygen species, and the increased oxygen vacancies after doping are main reasons for improved catalytic performance. Therefore, doping cobalt greatly enhanced electrocatalytic properties of ceria nanoparticles are greatly enhanced by doping cobalt, providing guidence for other ionic conductors employed as bifunctional electrocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1000-324X			WOS:000439106600005

However, the polymerization process usually uses a large amount of solvent that cannot be recycled, resulting in solvent waste, cost increase, and environmental pollution, which hinders its wide applications in industry. Inspired by the high polarity and polymerization of formamide (FA), CoFe nanoparticles on nitrogen-carbon nanotubes are synthesized by a FA-sourced recycle strategy, in which the filtrate after one batch of synthesis will be used as solvent, carbon and nitrogen source for the next batch of synthesis, until the filtrate is consumed totally, verifying this procedure is a cost-effective method and without any waste discharge. Besides, the catalysts prepared by each batch of recycle procedure exhibit outstanding and consistent oxygen reduction/evolution catalytic performance and satisfying cycle stability when used as an air electrode in a rechargeable zinc-air battery. This work puts up a simple and clean method for the preparation of metal-nitrogen-carbon electrocatalysts for industrialized use.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000747300000001

Herein, the unique AgPt alloy modified multibranched Au nanostar heterostructures with wider tunable optical properties and desirable activities are precisely fabricated via selective deposition of Ag and Pt. AgPt-tipped Au nanostars have the most remarkable performance in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution (overpotential of 58 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) and methanol oxidation reaction (4.01 A mg(N)(-1)) driven by visible and near-infrared light irradiation, which are mainly ascribed to the effective transfer of plasmon-excited electron-hole pairs. Additionally, the increased system temperature generated by the photothermal effect of Au, larger active area, and modified electronic state also contribute to the enhancement of activity, stability, and tolerance of CO poisoning. As the adverse charge transport pathway, the electrocatalytic performances of AgPt-edged and-covered Au nanostars are inhibited. The experimental results reveal that rationally designed bifunctional plasmonic electrocatalysts which make full use of the synergy of photoelectric, photothermal, and structural effect have promising potential in photoelectric catalytic conversion fields.									29	2	0	0	0	0	30			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000468717900003

Journal of colloid and interface science				628	Pt A			508	518		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.07.150				2022-Dec-15	2022	Obtaining of non-noble metal catalyst with bifunctional effect for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting is highly desired to get high purity hydrogen. Here in, we design and fabricate Cu/Ni bimetallic phosphides with Graphdiyne (GDY) to form hybrid nanomaterial CuNiPx-GDY on Ni foam for the first time. The synergistical effect between GDY and transition metal phosphides, and the atomic scale heterojunctions between Cu3P and Ni2P, effectively accelerate the catalytical process both in HER and OER, resulting in extraordinarily small overpotentials of 178mV and 110mV at 10mA cm-2 for OER and HER in CuNiPx-GDY(1:1) in 1M KOH, respectively. Density functional theory results show that, compared with pure CuNiPx, the introduced GDY can considerably improve the activity of OER and generate different active sites for OER and HER in CuNiPx-GDY(1:1). Thus CuNiPx-GDY(1:1) exhibits good catalytical performance and stability as catalyst for overall water splitting. This study provides a new sight into the structure and catalytic properties of GDY and transition metal phosphides hybrid nanomaterial, and also offers a new way to obtain advanced materials with remarkable catalytic properties.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1095-7103		MEDLINE:35933868	35933868

In this work, a facile and industrially compatible one-pot corrosion strategy for the rapid synthesis of amorphous RuO2-decorated FeOOH nanosheets on iron foam (FF-Na-Ru) within 1 h is reported. Corrosion is a common and inevitable phenomenon that occurs on metal surfaces without electricity input, high temperature, and tedious synthetic procedures. The FF-Na-Ru electrode is superhydrophilic and aerophobic, which guarantees intimate contact with the electrolyte and accelerates the instantaneous escape of produced gas bubbles during the electrocatalytic process. Moreover, the strong electronic interactions between RuO2 and FeOOH promote the electrocatalytic process via dramatically improving the electrochemical interfacial properties. Thus, the FF-Na-Ru electrocatalyst presents excellent catalytic activity towards the HER (30 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and overall water-splitting (230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) in 1 M KOH. The overall water-splitting could be simply powered by sustainable and intermittent sunlight, wind, and thermal energies motivated Stirling engine. Density functional theory calculations confirm that coupling effects between RuO2 and FeOOH are also responsible for promoting the electrocatalytic HER performance.									69	1	0	0	3	0	69			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000621024600001

This self-supported Ni2P/RGO@NF catalyst with favorable 3D hierarchical nanostructure, enhanced electrical conductivity and high density of ultra-small Ni2P (24,000 particles per square micron) shows outstanding bifunctional catalytic performance toward overall water splitting under alkaline and neutral conditions. Notably, the Ni2P/RGO@NF electrode delivers low cell voltage of just 1.58V and 1.68V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline and neutral electrolytes with prominent stability for more than 20 h, respectively. Moreover, ultra-small cobalt phosphide loaded RGO on cobalt foam samples have also been prepared by the same method. Thus, this strategy provides a general way for fabricating self-supported electrocatalysts with ultra-small metal-based nanoparticles, which is scalable and applicable in energy storage and conversion devices.

However, pure flat graphene is catalytically inert in HER. In this work, we investigate the effect of curvature on the improvement in the catalytic activity of pure and doped graphenes. We find that the HER performance can be dramatically improved on wavedgraphene due to localized chemical potential and Pt-analogous activity can be achieved at suitable compression. (1) For pure graphene, the calculated HER performance increases more than 50% as tuned by curvature due to reduced calculated Gibbs free energies. (2) For B- and N-doped graphene, their optimal HER catalytic ability occurs at low curvature conditions. (3) For metal-doped graphene, Mo-doped graphene exhibits excellent catalytic ability in HER at certain compressions. (4) For nitrogen-metal co-doped graphene, N-Ni and N-V co-doped graphenes can be tuned by curvature to show outstanding performance in HER with their exothermal formation energies. Our calculations demonstrate that the curvature plays a vital role in the improved HER activity of graphene and reveal the mechanism behind the improvement, which may provide guidance on the design of novel electrocatalysts for HER.									19	1	0	0	2	0	19			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000449888600019

Methylene blue, commonly used to stain specimens, has been causing serious marine pollution and should be considered for eco-friendly recycling. In this study, methylene blue was chosen as an additive and precursor for N- and S-doped carbon nanoparticles and was dissolved in quinoline (C9H7N) to synthesize N, S co-doped carbon electrocatalysts via plasma engineering. Based on the electrochemical analysis conducted using a rotating ring disk electrode system, compared to the carbon catalyst synthesized from pure quinoline, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance was enhanced by increasing the amount of methylene blue (E (onset) = 0.78 V (vs RHE) at 100% quinoline, 0.79 V (vs RHE) at 1 mM MBQ-G, 0.84 V (vs RHE) at 2 mM MBQ-G, and 0.86 V (vs RHE) at 3 mM MBQ-G). From the electrochemical results, the onset potential (E (onset)), half-wave potential (E (1/2)), and Tafel slope of 3 mM MBQ-G showed the best performance among all the carbon-based catalysts. In addition, the durability properties of 3 mM methylene blue (declined 30 mV after 6000 cycles) is superior to that of the benchmark ORR catalysts of 20 wt.% Pt/C (declined 60 mV after 6000 cycles). Through this study, we have successfully shown the possibility to effectively recycle methylene blue, which often causes marine and water pollution in the dyeing industry, as a useful precursor in carbon-based catalytic materials.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000716132400001

Physicochemical formation conditions of banded iron formations and high-grade iron ores in the region of the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly: Evidence from isotopic data								GEOLOGY OF ORE DEPOSITS				49	2			147	159		10.1134/S1075701507020031				APR 2007	2007	The oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions of minerals from banded iron formations (BIFs) and high-grade ore in the region of the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly (KMA) were determined in order to estimate the temperature of regional metamorphism and the nature of rock-and ore-forming solutions. Magnetite and hematite of primary sedimentary or diagenetic origin have delta O-18 within the range from +2 to 6%. During metamorphism, primary iron oxides, silicates, and carbonates were involved in thermal dissociation and other reactions to form magnetite with delta O-18 = +6 to +11%. As follows from a low delta O-18(av) = -3.5% of mushketovite (magnetite pseudomorphs after hematite) in high-grade ore, this mineral was formed as a product of hematite reduction by organic matter. The comparison of delta O-18 of iron oxides, siderite, and quartz from BIFs formed at different stages of the evolution of the Kursk protogeosyncline revealed specific sedimentation (diagenesis) conditions and metamorphism of the BIFs belonging to the Kursk and Oskol groups. BIF of the Oskol Group is distinguished by a high delta O-18 of magnetite compared to other Proterozoic BIFs. Martite ore differs from host BIF by a low delta O-18 = -0.2 to -5.9%. This implies that oxygen from infiltration water was incorporated into the magnetite lattice during the martite formation. Surface water penetrated to a significant depth through tectonic faults and fractures.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			1075-7015	1555-6476		WOS:000246385400003

The unique behavior of the grain boundaries can be correlated with substantial modifications of the cation concentration at the interfaces, which can be tuned by changing the overall cationic ratio in the films. In this work, we study the electronic properties of La0.8Sr0.2Mn1-yO3 +/-delta thin films with variable Mn content. The influence of the cationic composition on the grain boundary and grain bulk electronic properties is elucidated by studying the manganese valence state evolution using spectroscopy techniques and by confronting the electronic properties of epitaxial and polycrystalline films. Substantial differences in the electronic conduction mechanism are found in the presence of grain boundaries and depending on the manganese content.

Especially challenging is predicting how these particles act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Previous studies have characterized the CCN efficiency for organic compounds in terms of a hygroscopicity parameter, kappa. Here we extend these studies by systematically testing the influence of the number and location of molecular functional groups on the hygroscopicity of organic aerosols. Organic compounds synthesized via gas-phase and liquid-phase reactions were characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with scanning flow CCN analysis and thermal desorption particle beam mass spectrometry. These experiments quantified changes in kappa with the addition of one or more functional groups to otherwise similar molecules. The increase in kappa per group decreased in the following order: hydroxyl >> carboxyl > hydroperoxide > nitrate >> methylene (where nitrate and methylene produced negative effects, and hydroperoxide and nitrate groups produced the smallest absolute effects). Our results contribute to a mechanistic understanding of chemical aging and will help guide input and parametrization choices in models relying on simplified treatments such as the atomic oxygen:carbon ratio to predict the evolution of organic aerosol hygroscopicity.									72	2	0	0	20	0	73			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000341229300030	25118824

In this work we apply near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) to study in operando the electrooxidation of a nanoparticulated Pt electrode integrated in a membrane-electrode assembly of a high temperature proton-exchange membrane under water and water/oxygen ambient. Three types of surface oxides/hydroxides gradually develop on the Pt surface depending on the applied potential at +0.9, + 2.5, and +3.7 eV relative to the 4f peak of metal Pt and were attributed to the formation of adsorbed O/OH, PtO, and PtO2, respectively. The presence of O-2 in the gas-phase results in the increase of the extent of surface oxidation, and in the growth of the contribution of the PtO2 oxide. Depth profiling studies, in conjunction with quantitative simulations, allowed us to propose a tentative mechanism of the Pt oxidation at high anodic polarization, consisting of adsorption of O/OH followed by nucleation of PtO/PtO2 oxides and their subsequent three-dimensional growth.									61	1	1	0	2	0	62			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000380735300046

To this end, small pure manganese oxide and calcium-doped manganese oxide model complexes saturated with water-derived ligands are investigated in this work. Density functional theory calculations are performed to investigate the water oxidation process on Mn-2(mu-OH)(mu-O)(H2O)(3)(OH)(5) (Mn2O4 center dot 6H(2)O) and CaMnO(mu-OH)(2)(H2O)(5)(OH)(2)(CaMnO3 center dot 7H(2)O) complexes. Many reaction pathways are considered, and the three lowest energy water oxidation mechanisms on CaMnO3 center dot 7H(2)O have highest reaction energy steps of 1.37, 1.67, and 1.81 eV compared to the highest reaction energy step of 2.25 eV for the lowest energy mechanism of the pure Mn2O center dot 6H(2)O complex. Doping of the manganese dimer complex with calcium decreases the highest reaction energy of the water oxidation process. Consequently, the inclusion of calcium appears to improve the catalyst's efficiency for water splitting.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000477785700009	31241935

All the five antibiotics cannot be detected after 90 min photocatalytic degradation by ZnIn2S4. The calculated pseudo-first-order constants (k(r)) were in the order of tetracycline hydrochloride (0.0858 min(-1)) > erythromycin (0.0846 min(-1)) > lincomycin hydrochloride (0.0285 min(-1)). However, degradation of rifampicin and chloramphenicol cannot be described by pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results indicated that the main reactive oxygen species in this study was superoxide radical (Oil and minor active species was hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot). Thirty-four, thirty, twenty, sixteen and eighteen kinds of intermediate species were identified by LCMS-IT-TOF during the 180 min photocatalytic degradation of rifampicin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, lincomycin hydrochloride and tetracycline hydrochloride, respectively. The proposed photocatalytic degradation pathways provided detailed evolution process of five antibiotics, which would be meaningful for the researches on transformation behavior of antibiotics.

However, several vital problems still hinder the commercialization of PEMFCs. The foremost issue is the high cost compared to the contenders, deriving from both the high consumption of Pt catalysts and low service life under practical operations. In this review, deeper investigations on how to further lower the cost of PEMFCs show the importance of understanding and engineering the multiphase transport processes in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). The definitions, rules, numerical simulations, and experimental validations of various mass transfer processes across the MEA are introduced to provide a holistic evaluation and enable optimization to improve the cell performance and reliability. In addition, because the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction in the cathode catalyst layer (CCL) requires most of the Pt catalysts, the oxygen/water-related multiphase transfer in CCLs is taken as a focus for detailed analysis. Several successful strategies, such as triple-phase boundary engineering, graded design, and novel ordered three-dimensional structure construction, are proven to be promising in greatly reducing the Pt consumption in the CCL and facilitating the microscopic multiphase transfer processes of the MEA. With optimized engineering of the electrode structure and configuration inside the MEA, the mass transfer resistances can be minimized to give the best operating conditions for electrochemical reactions to occur in the catalyst layers. Finally, the main challenges and some perspectives for developing advanced MEAs with lower cost in high-performance and reliable PEMFCs are provided.									24	3	0	0	0	0	25			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000563095800006		
C	Ugarte, S; Metghalchi, M; Keck, JC			ASME					Methanol oxidation induction times using the rate-controlled constrained-equilibrium method								ENERGY CONVERSION AND RESOURCES - 2003								107	116						2003	2003	Methanol oxidation has been modeled using the Rate-Controlled Constrained-Equilibrium method (RCCE). In this method, composition of the system is determined by constraints rather than by species. Since the number of constraints can be much smaller than the number of species present, the number of rate equations required to describe the time evolution of the system can be considerably reduced. In the present paper, C, chemistry with 29 species and 140 reactions has been used to investigate the oxidation of stoichiometric methanol/oxygen mixture at constant energy and volume. Three fixed elemental constraints: elemental carbon, elemental oxygen and elemental hydrogen and from one to nine variable constraints: moles of fuel, total number of moles, moles of free oxygen, moles of free valence, moles of fuel radical, moles of formaldehyde H2CO, moles of HCO, moles of CO and moles of CH3O were used. The four to twelve rate equations for the constraint potentials (LaGrange multipliers conjugate to the constraints) were integrated for a wide range of initial temperatures and pressures. As expected, the RCCE calculations gave correct equilibrium values in all cases. Only 8 constraints were required to give reasonable agreement with detailed calculations. Results of using 9 constraints showed compared very well to those of the detailed calculations at all conditions. For this system, ignition delay times and major species concentrations were within 0.5% to 5% of the values given by detailed calculations. Adding up to 12 constraints improved the accuracy of the minor species mole fractions at early times, but only had a little effect on the ignition delay times. RCCE calculations reduced the time required for input and output of data in 25% and 10% when using 8 and 9 constraints respectively. In addition, RCCE calculations gave valuable insight into the important reaction paths and rate-limiting reactions involved in methanol oxidation.

The dispersed coal particles of 65-74 mu m are injected into an optical Hencken flat-flame burner by a novel deagglomeration feeder. Three kinds of pulverized coals from different ranks, Hulunbel lignite, high-ash-fusion bituminous and low-ash-fusion bituminous, are considered. The normalized visible light signal intensity, deleting the background noise, is established to characterize the ignition delay of coal particle streams. Firstly, the prevalent transition from heterogeneous ignition to hetero-homogeneous ignition due to ambience temperature is observed. The pure homogeneous ignition rarely occurs, with an exception under high temperature and low oxygen for high-volatile coal. By comparing time scales between pyrolysis and heating processes, the competition of the volatile evolution and heterogeneous surface reaction are discussed. Then, the effects of ambience temperature, oxygen mole fraction and coal rank on the characteristic ignition delay are examined. Finally, the transient mode is developed, which not only well interprets the observed ignition transition phenomena, but also approximately predicts a variation of heterogeneous ignition time as a function of oxygen fraction.

Copper matte with a mass fraction of Cu of 59 pet was mixed by Ar gas blowing during preheating. The matte was oxidized at 1523 and 1673 K by bubbling Ar + O-2 gas through a submerged nozzle. The effects of melt temperature and input oxygen content on the oxidation rate of matte and the volatilization rate of minor elements in copper matte are discussed. The competition reaction composed of the oxygen dissolution into matte and SO2 gas evolution rate results in the preferential oxidation of FeS in copper matte. The desulfurization rate of matte and the volatilization of minor elements in copper matte were primarily controlled by the mass-transfer rate through the gas film boundary layer around rising gas bubbles. The As, Pb, and Bi were significantly removed during Ar gas blowing with the volatilization rates of Bi and Pb markedly increasing with the melt temperature. However, the dependences of the volatilization rates on the input oxygen partial pressure were affected in a complicated way by the effects of the melt temperature and the reduced amount of exhaust gas.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000222939500006

Overall water splitting utilizing NiAl-LDH-based binary and ternary nanocomposites has been extensively investigated. The synthesized binary and ternary nanocomposites were characterized via XRD, FTIR, SEM, HRTEM, XPS, UV-DRS, and photoelectrochemical measurements. The surface wettability properties of the prepared nanocomposites were measured via contact angle measurements. The application of the NiAl-LDH/g-C3N4/Ag3PO4 ternary nanocomposite was investigated for photocatalytic overall water splitting under light irradiation. In this work, we found that in the presence of Ag3PO4, the evolution of H-2 and O-2 is high over LCN30, and 2.8- fold (O-2) and 1.4-fold (H-2) activity increases can be obtained compared with the use of LCN30 alone. It is proposed that Ag3PO4 is involved in the O-2 evolution reaction during water oxidation and g-C3N4 is involved in overall water splitting. Our work not only reports overall water splitting using NiAl-LDH-based nanocomposites but it also provides experimental evidence for understanding the possible reaction process and the mechanism of photocatalytic water splitting. Photoelectrochemical measurements confirmed the better H-2 and O-2 evolution abilities of NiAl-LDH/g-C3N4/Ag3PO4 in comparison with NiAl LDH, g-C3N4, Ag3PO4, and LCN30. The observed improvement in the gas evolution properties of NiAl LDH in the presence of Ag3PO4 is due to the formation of a dual direct Z-scheme, which allows for the easier and faster separation of charge carriers. More importantly, the LCNAP5 heterostructure shows high levels of H-2 and O-2 evolution, which are significantly enhanced compared with LCN30 and pure NiAl LDH.									15	1	0	0	1	0	15			2516-0230			WOS:000637218000024	36133087

In the present work, space-confined iron nanoparticles in a 3D nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide-carbon nanotube (rGO-CNT) framework (Fe-NCNTs/NG) were synthesized by pyrolysis of a compound comprising urea, anhydrous ferric chloride (FeCl3) and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) in the presence of graphene oxide (GO). Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were grown from urea under the catalysis of iron before the pyrolysis to obtain Fe-NCNTs/NG. Nitrogen was introduced into the rGO-CNT framework from urea and NH4Cl in the pyrolysis process at a temperature of 700/800/900/1000 degrees C. XRD, SEM, HRTEM and XPS techniques were employed to characterize Fe-NCNTs/NG and showed iron and/or Fe3O4 nanoparticles are confined in the 3D nitrogen-doped rGO-CNT framework. The electrochemical test results demonstrate that as-prepared Fe-NCNTs/NG can conduct better catalytic performances than Pt/C and IrO2 in the aspects of a higher half-wave potential and a lower overpotential. Specifically, the best catalytic performance of Fe-NCNTs/NG was achieved when it was prepared by a 30:1 mass ratio of urea to FeCl3 and pyrolyzed at a temperature of 900 degrees C. Furthermore, a home-made zinc-air battery loading a Fe-NCNTs/NG electrode showed better charge-discharge stability and higher power density than a Pt/C loaded zinc-air battery. The present work demonstrates that the Fe-NCNTs/NG framework is promising to be an alternative to Pt/C and/or IrO2 in the rechargeable zinc-air battery industry.									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			1387-1811	1873-3093		WOS:000527322200029

In this work, we present CO intercalation under a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) overlayer on Ru(0001) at room temperature, observed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy. Critical factors influencing the interfacial process have been investigated, including CO partial pressure, h-BN coverage, and oxygen pre-adsorption on the Ru surface. It has been identified that CO adsorption on the bare Ru surface region plays an important role in CO intercalation. Comparative studies of CO intercalation at h-BN/Ru(0001) and graphene/Ru(0001) interfaces indicate that CO starts to intercalate h-BN overlayers more easily than graphene. Temperature-programmed CO desorption experiments from h-BN/CO/Ru(0001) and graphene/CO/Ru(0001) surfaces reveal a similar confinement effect of the 2D cover on CO adsorption, which results in a more abrupt and quick CO desorption in comparison with the CO/Ru(0001) surface.									11	2	0	0	1	0	11			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000382766300014	27530273

Several observations support the hypothesis that this is due to the formation of a quencher in the light-harvesting antennae. The relationship between quenching of the maximum fluorescence yield F(m) and the dark-level fluorescence yield F0 fits theoretical predictions for antenna quenching, while the decrease in photochemical quantum yield is proportional to the decrease in F(v)/F(m) (where F(v) = F(m) - F0. The number of functional reaction centres appears to be unchanged. No change in redox dependence of charge separation can be detected, suggesting that no damage of the reaction centre occurs. It is suggested that the quencher is formed by the oxidation of some species. Consistent with this, quenching is inhibited by the removal of oxygen. Aerobic quenching can be observed in mutants lacking either the outer light-harvesting complex LHII or both the reaction centre and the inner light-harvesting complex LHI indicative of quenching throughout the light-harvesting apparatus. Under anaerobic conditions there is still some light-dependent inhibition of quantum yield of charge separation by a distinct process that does not effect F(v)/F(m). The mechanism of this process is unknown.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			1011-1344			WOS:A1992JA11800005

Herein we report a novel Au incorporation strategy to boost the HER catalytic performance of CoP. As a proof of concept, heterostructured Au/CoP nanoparticles dispersed on nitrogen-doped carbon with unique porosity, denoted as Au/CoP@NC-3, are synthesized by thermal treatment of Au-nanoparticle-incorporated ZIF-67 precursor. It shows excellent HER activity as well as good durability in acidic and alkaline condition, respectively, greatly outperforming its Au-free analogue, namely, CoP@NC. In-depth analysis suggests that the improved HER activity of Au/CoP@NC-3 is attributed to the presence of Au nanoparticles which enlarge the electrochemical active surface areas and adjust the electronic structure of active CoP species to enhance the water adsorption and optimize H adsorption for the accelerated HER process.									31	2	0	0	2	0	31			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526583500059	32202754

Iron oxide reduction with hydrogen has been widely investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The HyDR process includes multiple types of chemical reactions, solid state and defect-mediated diffusion (of oxygen and hydrogen species), several phase transformations, as well as massive volume shrinkage and mechanical stress buildup. However, studies focusing on the chemo-mechanical interplay during the reduction reaction influenced by microstructure are sparse. In this work, a chemo-mechanically coupled phase-field (PF) model has been developed to explore the interplay between phase transformation, chemical reaction, species diffusion, large elasto-plastic deformation and microstructure evolution. Energetic constitutive relations of the model are based on the system free energy which is calibrated with the help of a thermodynamic database. The model has been first applied to the classical core-shell (wustite-iron) structure. Simulations show that the phase transformation from wustite to alpha-iron can result in high stresses and rapidly decelerating reaction kinetics. Mechanical stresses create elastic energy in the system, an effect which can negatively influence the phase transformations, thus causing slow reaction kinetics and low metallization. However, if the elastic stress becomes comparatively high, it can shift the shape of the free energy from a double-well to a single-well case, speed up the transformation and result in a higher reduction degree compared to the low-stress double well case. The model has been applied to simulate an experimentally characterized iron oxide specimen with its complex microstructure. The observed microstructure evolution during reduction is well predicted by the model. The simulation results also show that isolated pores in the microstructure are filled with water vapor during reduction, which can influence the local reaction atmosphere and dynamics.(C) 2022 Acta Materialia Inc.

Different from the study of traditional high active noble metal catalysts, this review systematically summarizes recent developments on non-noble metal (Fe, Co, Cu, Ni, Mn and Mo) ORR catalysts prepared by various MOFs carbonization in different metal centers. The effects of synthesis strategies and pyrolysis conditions on the catalyst properties are discussed. Meanwhile, the key parameters of catalytic performances (including active sites, dispersed state and specific surface area) are discussed and the prospect is presented. It is expected that this review will provide effective guidance for future studies on carbonized non-noble MOFs for ORR electrochemical catalyst.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000644291800001

The mechanism of the confined space alloying, that is, the controlled alloying of bimetallic precursors with different compositions (i.e., Pt3Ni, PtNi, and PtNi3) within the HGS mesoporous shell, was examined in detail. It was found that the presence of platinum during the reduction step, as well as the application of high annealing temperatures (at least 850 degrees C for 3.Sh in Ar), are necessary conditions to achieve the complete encapsulation and the full stability of the catalysts. The evolution of the activity, the electrochemical surface area, and the residual alloy composition of the Pt-Ni@HGS catalysts was thoroughly monitored (at the macro- and nanoscale level) under different degradation conditions. After the initial activation, the embedded Pt-Ni nanoparticles (3-4 nm in size) yield mass activities that are 2- to 3.5-fold higher than that of pure Pt@HGS (depending on the alloy composition). Most importantly, it is demonstrated that under the normal operation range of an ORR catalyst in PEM-FCs (potential excursions between 0.4 and 1.0 V-RHE) both the nanoparticle-related degradation pathways (particle agglomeration) and dealloying phenomena are effectively suppressed, irrespectively of the alloy composition. Thus, the initial enhanced activity is completely maintained over an extended degradation protocol. In addition, owing to the peculiar configuration of the catalysts consisting of space-confined nanoparticles, it was possible to elucidate the impact of the dealloying process (as a function of alloy composition and severity of the degradation protocols) separately from other parallel phenomena, providing valuable insight into this elusive degradation mechanism.									46	2	0	0	1	0	47			2155-5435			WOS:000389399400008

Depending on the oxygen partial pressure in the discharge gas, we have obtained either crystallized or amorphous thin films, with different morphologies. These two kinds of thin films having different electrochemical behavior, an extensive XPS study was carried out. The main redox processes and their reversibility occurring during the 1st, 10th, and 30th discharge-charge cycles were discussed in relation with the electrochemical properties. Our results have revealed a good reversibility of the redox process for amorphous thin films and degradation for crystallized ones, in agreement with the discharge capacity evolution. Furthermore, the growth of a surface layer between the cathode and the liquid electrolyte was evidenced upon the discharge as well as its partial dissolution upon the charge. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The similar to 0.8-nm-thick (Al,Mg)-oxide film grown at 300 K is fully amorphous. A gradual development of long-range order in the oxide film sets in for thickening (AI,Mg)-oxide films of relatively high Mg content at T >= 475 K. The amorphous-to-crystalline transition proceeds by a phase separation: still predominantly amorphous oxide regions exist next to crystallized oxide regions, which are constituted of an MgO-type of oxide phase with a face-centered-cubic oxygen sublattice and an average lattice parameter of 4.146 +/- 0.1 angstrom.									12	2	0	0	0	0	13			0884-2914			WOS:000277189500011

FeS2 NWs demonstrated the best PEF performance among different iron sulfide crystalline phases (pyrite, pyrrhotite and mackinawite). The FeS2 NWs/Ti3C2 (FeS2:Ti3C2 = 2:1) cathode exhibited the highest PEF degradation efficiency of 97.6% for SMT (10 mg/L) within 80 min. Diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) indicated the superior light absorption of FeS2 due to the narrow band gap, and Ti3C2 further improved the light utilization of the composite by separating the photogenerated charge carriers and broadening the light absorption region. Photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) demonstrated the low resistance and rapid charge transfer of FeS2 NWs. Meanwhile, the conductivity of the composite was enhanced by the introduction of Ti3C2, which was ascribed to the promoted electron migration and prolonged carrier lifetime. The FeS2 NWs/Ti3C2 cathode showed excellent recyclability of preserving 92.8% of initial performance after five cycles due to the rapid Fe3+/Fe2+ cycling. Excellent selectivity was also revealed for the FeS2 NWs/Ti3C2 cathode toward two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway (n = 2.34), ensuring constant H2O2 generation. The radical scavenging experiment also demonstrated that the main oxidant in PEF system was center dot OH. This work paves the way for the novel design and synthesis of highly efficient PEF cathodes.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729813400004

The Ir/TiC electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was prepared by chemical reduction and deposition with ultrasonic dispersion. The diameter of the Ir particles deposited on the TiC support is 10-40 nm. The Ir/TiC catalyst has a pore volume of 0.1425 cm(3) g(-1), which is about two times as high as that of the corresponding unsupported In Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis indicate that the Ir particles are nearly uniformly deposited on the surface of the TiC and exhibit remarkably fine variable crystallites and crystal lattice defects, which enhance the density of active sites and greatly improves the catalytic activity of the Ir/TiC catalyst. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) reveal that the peak current density at 1.5 V versus SCE on the Ir/TiC is about nine times of that for the unsupported Ir black catalyst and potentiostatic analysis shows that the charge passed by the Ir/TiC after 600 s at 1.3 V versus SCE is about 15 times of that for the unsupported Ir catalyst. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shows that the electrochemical polarization impedance of the Ir/TiC catalyst is about 50 Omega cm(2) per 0.02 mg as compared to 150 Omega cm(2) of the Ir black in the range of high frequency. The diffusion polarization impedances of the Ir/TiC form a semicircle and those of the Ir black are close to a straight line with a phase angle of 45 degrees in the range of low frequency. Thus, the catalytic activity of the Ir/TiC for the OER is significantly higher than that of the unsupported Ir catalyst. The TiC support is chemically and electrochemically stable in the whole range of experimental potentials. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This paper studied the local distribution characteristics of OH on oxy-fuel combustion of heavy oil during the ignition and stable combustion processes. During the ignition process, we observed the generation and evolution of fire kernel, and got the flame propagation velocity. During the stable combustion process, the results showed that the OH distribution and its relative signal intensity were influenced by the oxygen concentration, excess air coefficient, gas flow, reaction atmosphere, oil mist scattering, incident laser energy and laser sheet position. In the same reaction atmosphere, the ranges of OH dense distribution and the high temperature area increased as O-2 concentration increased. In the same O-2 concentration, both the ranges of OH dense distribution and the high temperature area in O-2/N-2 were larger than that in O-2/CO2. In 29% O-2/71% CO2, the flame shape was similar to combust in air, while the OH relative signal intensity and its volatility were much larger than that in air. In the same combustion condition, the location of high concentration of OH relative concentration field lagged behind the high temperature area. The results further reveal the differences between the conventional and oxy-fuel combustion. (C) 2020 Energy Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Low-cost CuFe2O4 spinel has been widely researched as an electrocatalyst in electrochemical sensors and catalysis. Nevertheless, the low utilization of active sites in bulk CuFe2O4 and the poor electro conductivity of CuFe2O4 invariably restrict its upgrade in catalytic efficiency. Herein, by utilizing the facile electro-spinning technique and without involving any template or surfactant, we successfully design three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically porous architecture woven by abundant ultrafine CuFe2O4 crystal-coupled porous carbon nanowires (denoted as CuFe2O4/PCFs). Characterization results verify the 3D net-like textural structures of CuFe2O4/PCFs. Especially, the hierarchically porous structure, high surface area, and abundant carbon edges boost the uniform dispersion of tiny CuFe2O4 crystals; these obviously promote the amounts of electrochemically available CuFe2O4 active sites while decreasing the mass transport resistance of CuFe2O4/PCFs in electrocatalytic processes. Meanwhile, introducing carbon matrices can drastically enhance the electrical conductivity of CuFe2O4/PCF nanowires. All these advances in structural and physical performances truly make tremendous progress for CuFe2O4/PCFs for H2O2 reduction and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis compared with bulk CuFe2O4. For instance, the CuFe2O4/PCF catalyst exhibits a high sensitivity of 69.18 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), low detection limit of 1.20 mu M and wide linear range of 0.11-22.0 mM for H2O2 sensing. Meanwhile, the CuFe2O4/PCF catalyst just needs a potential value of 1.589 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) to achieve the OER catalysis current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, it only shows a small Tafel slope of 89.34 mV dec(-1) for the OER as well. Our catalyst design strategy of CuFe2O4/PCF nanowires not only demonstrates the successful design of a novel high-efficiency non-noble-metal catalyst for both OER and H2O2 reduction catalysis but also affords a new methodology for boosting the electrocatalytic abilities of spinel-type hybrid materials by designing a 3D structure and improving conductivity.

However, its practical application is seriously limited by some problems such as high charging and discharging overpotential. Metal palladium as a catalyst can simultaneously reduce the charging and discharging overpotential in Li-O-2 batteries by enhancing catalytic activity of air electrode, but its catalytical mechanism is insufficient. Here, using first-principles calculations, a three-phase interface model which consists of Pd/O-2/Li2O2 is constructed to explore the mechanism of charge and discharge reaction. The result indicates that the Pd/O substrate enhances its adsorption of LiO2 by promoting charge transfer between substrate and Li2O2, thereby accelerating discharge product formed on the electrode surface, and effectively reducing the charging overpotential by 0.43 V.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1000-324X			WOS:000449505700014

Nevertheless, the widespread use of such oxygen-related anionic redox is still precluded because of the oxygen release and the correlated irreversible structural transformations and voltage fade. To fundamentally unravel the related mechanism, we have investigated the corresponding anionic redox process based on a new P3-type layered material Na0.5Mg0.15Al0.2Mn0.65O2. Here, we prove an excellent structural stability via the operando/ex situ structural evolution within this cathode and further elucidate the complete anionic/cationic redox activity via both surface-sensitive (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and bulk-sensitive (X-ray absorption spectroscopy) spectroscopies. Moreover, based on the characterization of the ex situ state to the operando evolution for the whole anionic redox process by Raman and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, the nature of the reversible oxygen redox chemistry is clarified. Meanwhile, the origin of a small portion irreversible oxygen release generated upon the first charging and its resulting impact on subsequent processes are also fully illuminated. These insights provide guidelines for future designing of anionic redox-based high-energy-density cathodes in lithium/sodium-ion batteries.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000566662000045	32803951

Examples of atom displacements in two metamorphic terranes of the Canadian Precambrian Shield are then examined, as follows. (i) In a high-grade metamorphic terrane in the Mid-Proterozoic Grenville Province (Otter Lake Area), Mg concentration gradients about dolomite microcrystals in calcite and Na gradients about albite microcrystals in K-feldspar are viewed as stranded Mg-Ca and Na-K interdiffusion gradients, formed by exsolution during slow cooling from similar to 700 to similar to 400 degrees C. (ii) In the Archean Slave Province (Yellowknife area), the crystallization of sillimanite, near andalusite but within crystals of quartz, possibly occurred by coupled Al-Si and oxygen-vacancy interdiffusion in quartz at similar to 550 degrees C. And the crystallization of garnet from chlorite occurred by the two-way crystal-boundary diffusion of several kinds of atoms across distances ranging to 3mm. (iii) In the Otter Lake area, the crystallization of orthopyroxene-hornblende-spinel reaction zones at boundaries between crystals of olivine and plagioclase in metagabbro, evidently occurred by the mechanism of interstitial diffusion, that transported Mg, Fe, Mn and O atoms across the reaction zone from olivine to the plagioclase-(hornblende+spinel) boundary, and Si, Al, Ca and Na atoms from plagioclase to the olivine-orthopyroxene boundary, accompanied by NaSi-CaAl interdiffusion in plagioclase, and the addition of hydrogen and minor Ti, Zn, F, Cl and K from beyond the reaction zone. Also, centimetric reaction zones, with abundant biotite and plagioclase, at boundaries between K-feldspar gneiss and deformed amphibolite dykes, evidently formed by the reaction, strained hornblende (in amphibolite)+K-feldspar (in gneiss)biotite (in amphibolite)+plagioclase (in gneiss), with crystal-boundary diffusion of (Na+Ca) atoms and of K atoms across the reaction zone.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0263-4929	1525-1314		WOS:000344322700005

Herein, a series of low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts including Fe/C, Fe-NPCNs, FeCo-NPCNs, and FeCo-CNTs are prepared by simply carbonizing the mixture of Fe-based metal-organic frameworks (FeMIL-53), melamine, and CoCl2.6 H2O with different contents. Structure and electrocatalytic performance of the as-fabricated four samples are systematically investigated and the FeCo-NPCNs catalyst with a structure of FeCo nanoparticles uniformly embedded 3D porous N-doped carbon nanonetwork exhibits the highest electrochemical activity with a positive half-wave potential of 0.87 V vs. RHE for ORR and a low overpotential of 240 mV vs. RHE for OER with a Delta E of 0.60 V at 10 mA cm-2, together with excellent stability and methanol tolerance, even outperforming the noble-metal-based Pt/C-RuO2 catalysts. Besides, the results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the boosted intrinsic activity due to the reduced energy barrier both for ORR and OER. Furthermore, the assembled aqueous rechargeable Zn-air battery with FeCoNPCNs catalyst manifests a large power density of 161.2 mW cm-2, a low charge-discharge gap of 0.78 V, and long-term ability. Likewise, the flexible solid-state Zn-air battery with FeCo-NPCNs catalyst also demonstrates high round-trip efficiency and excellent durability under various bending angles. This work may serve as a reference to designing advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts with 3D porous carbon nanonetworks for rechargeable Zn-air batteries.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000807376500003

The changes of gas evolution during the pretreatment process of CBC with oxygen in the atmosphere, and the strengthening effects of the co-pyrolysis of pre-treated coal sample and corn stalk mixed in equal proportion on the pyrolysis products under different carrier gases were studied in this paper. With the increase of the pretreatment temperature, more gas products were obtained than superheated steam from the pretreatment in nitrogen, while yield of gases such as CO2 and CO were much higher with oxygen in the atmosphere and the yield of CO2 increased most. The effects of pretreatment on the destruction of the caking property enhanced as the pretreatment temperature increased with oxygen in the atmosphere, which was beneficial to coal sample pyrolysis reaction, resulting in a 7.01% lower pyrolysis char yield than raw coal char. The equal proportion co-pyrolysis had a synergistic promoting effect on the formation of H-2, CO2 and CH4. Compared with other carrier gases, light tar content increased significantly in the mixed carrier gas of CH4 + CO2, while the improvement in tar quality should be attributed to the fact that content of phenol oil and anthracene oil increased and the content of asphaltene decreased obviously.

Fe-N-C moieties exhibit an optimal performance in the ORR although a synthetic strategy for their production still remains a challenging matter of catalysis and materials science. Herein, an original and general protocol for the preparation of high-density and discrete Fe-N-C-based single-atom catalysts has been proposed starting from cheap and food-grade raw components. The rational combination of chelating citrate ions with the ancillary monodentate thiocyanate (SCN-) ligand has established an "open gate" for water-soluble iron ions to be accommodated in the form of Fe-N-C moieties within the final C-N networks. Although recent findings in the field of electrocatalysis have pointed out the often beneficial synergistic action between isolated and metallic iron species or iron carbides and their protecting C-N shells, the poor selectivity on the nature of the final Fe species in N-doped C-networks remains a matter of debate and does not shed light on the effective nature of the active species in the process. The highly metal-loaded catalysts in the form of highly dispersed Fe-N-C moieties prepared with the synthetic protocol described in the paper have been tested as electrocatalysts in the ORR, showing electrocatalytic performance under an alkaline environment that ranks among the highest reported so far for related Fe single-atom catalysts (Fe-SACs) of the state-of-the-art.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000674927200048

In this work, we explore from first principles the connection between these different aspects of C-doped hBN. We find the formation of graphene islands covering unequal number of B and N sites in hBN to be energetically plausible. They possess a net non-zero magnetic moment and are also found to be substantially more chemically active than their nonmagnetic counterparts covering equal number of B and N sites. On-site Coulomb repulsion between electrons, known to be responsible for magnetism in bipartite lattices such as graphene and hBN, is also found to play a central role in chemical activation of not only the C atoms at the zigzag interface of magnetic graphene islands and hBN but also boron (B) sites in the immediate hBN neighborhood. However, such activated B or C due to substitution at the B site, which is energetically more favorable than that at the N site, has been reported to be unfavorable for the ORR. Advantageously, we find that the activation of C at B sites moderates systematically with increasing size of graphene islands, paving the way for abundance of efficient catalytic sites at the edges of magnetic graphene islands covering more B sites than N sites. Accordingly, as an alternate to precious metals for electrodes, we propose a class of graphene-hBN hybrids with lattices of magnetic graphene islands embedded in hBN, which can be metallic.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1932-7447			WOS:000475537500025

The approach could bundle the following distinct features: (i) commercially available melamine as both carbon and nitrogen bi-functional sources; (ii) scalably prepared CoAl-LDH precursor chosen to play a triple role in catalyzing the formation of N-CNTs and serving the electroactive Co nanoparticles, as well as in facilitating the growth of long N-CNTs owing to the confinement effect of the non-active Al2O3 matrix formed; (iii) an alternative to prepare one-dimensional length-and-performance-tunable N-CNTs, which are obtained typically by using catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) of two gaseous carbon and nitrogen resources on the surface of an LDH layer. The long Co@N-CNTs exhibits the highly enhanced electrocatalytic activity and stability for ORR (onset potential at 929 mV, half-wave potential at 849 mV vs. RHE, and limited current density at 6.0 mA cm(-2)). The CoAl-LDH precursor-based approach may open up a simple and feasible alternative to design and produce low-cost electrocatalysts for fuel cells. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The electrocatalytic splitting of water to molecular hydrogen via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) provides an appealing solution for producing high-purity hydrogen, but low-cost and highly active electrocatalysts are required for HER. Among currently investigated HER electrocatalysts, metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived nanocomposites constructed from transition metals (TMs)/TM compounds (TMCs) and carbon materials offer extremely promising and attractive HER activities because of their unique properties, such as tunable compositions, readily regulated electronic structures, controllable morphologies, and diverse configuration. Herein, this article provides a comprehensive overview of MOF-derived nanocomposites as HER electrocatalysts for water splitting. It begins with the introduction of the fundamentals of electrocatalytic HER. Afterwards, several ingeniously designed strategies for improved MOF-derived HER electrocatalysts are meticulously summarized and discussed, with special emphasis on the component manipulation of the TMs/TMCs, carbon matrix modifications, morphology tuning and electrode configuration engineering. Finally, future perspectives on the development of these nanocomposites as HER electrocatalysts are proposed.									102	8	0	0	6	0	103			0079-6425	1873-2208		WOS:000502885100002

Catalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a bottleneck of this process. However, the sluggish OER kinetics and the utilization of precious metal catalysts are key obstacles in the broad deployment of this energy technology. We report the preparation and use of an inexpensive GrMoS(2)SC(8)Ni nanocomposite material as a highly effective OER catalyst in an alkaline electrolyte. Experimental investigations have shown that improvements can be realized in the catalytic performance of Ni metal if it is a component of the composite material. We propose an explanation for these enhancements based on a hydrogen acceptor concept. This concept comprises the stabilization of an *-OOH intermediate, which effectively lowers the potential needed for breaking bonds on the surface. Herein, an inexpensive immobilized SC8 layer was used as the nanoreactor to synthesize metallic Ni nanoparticles (NPs) through an in situ redox process. The process was applied to form immobilized NPs on flat and curved 2D surfaces. The outstanding OER performance of Ni NPs could be attributed to their large surface area, efficient mass and charge transport, and high structural stability arising from the unique SC8 cage structure, built on the GrMoS(2) substrate. The GrMoS(2)SC(8)Ni nanocomposite shows the highest activity, exhibiting a 214 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (equivalent to 10% efficiency of solarto-fuel conversion) and a Tafel slope of 31 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution. It further demonstrates high stability as there is no apparent OER activity loss (based on a chronoamperometry test) or particle aggregation (based on SEM image observation) after a 10 h anodization test. The facile preparation method and high efficiency and durability enable this electrocatalyst to be a promising candidate for future large-scale applications in water splitting. Thus, this work opens a new avenue toward the development of highly efficient, inexpensive OER catalysts.									10	0	1	0	0	0	10			2398-4902			WOS:000422787100012

The activity make-over in this case is found to be originated from a controlled interplay of the favourable modulations achieved in terms of electrical conductivity, more exposure of the edge planes of MoS2 and a promotional role played by the coexistence of Co(OH)(2) in the proximity of MoS2. Co(OH)(2)-MoS2/rGO displays an oxygen reduction onset potential of 0.855 V and a half wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.731 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M KOH solution, which are much higher than those of the corresponding values (0.708 and 0.349 V, respectively) displayed by the as synthesized pristine MoS2 (P-MoS2) under identical experimental conditions. The Tafel slope corresponding to oxygen reduction for Co(OH)(2)-MoS2/rGO is estimated to be 63 mV dec(-1) compared to 68 mV dec(-1) displayed by the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. The estimated number of electrons transferred during oxygen reduction for Co(OH)(2)-MoS2/rGO is in the range of 3.2-3.6 in the potential range of 0.77 V to 0.07 V, which again stands out as valid evidence on the much favourable mode of oxygen reduction accomplished by the system compared to its pristine counterpart. Overall, the present study, thus, demonstrates a viable strategy of tackling the inherent limitations, such as low electrical conductivity and limited access to the active sites, faced by the layered structures like MoS2 to position them among the group of potential Pt-free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction.									33	0	0	0	0	0	33			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000362662100024	26399300

The key challenge in this field of research is to design and engineer cost-effective, green, and efficient photocatalysts. Recently, carbon-based photocatalysts have attracted huge interest for visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution reactions due to their high chemical stability, excellent electrical conductivity, and tunable surface characteristics. Here, a critical review on how various carbon-based materials such as carbon nitride, conjugated polymers, metal-organic frameworks, functionalized carbon quantum dots, and graphene derivatives emerged as next-generation photocatalysts for hydrogen production in the last five years is provided. We also highlight how the size-modulation and functionalization of nano-carbon-based materials with active species can lead to improved photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the potential of carbon dots and graphene-derivatives as noble metal-free co-catalysts and solid electron mediators in hydrogen evolution reaction under visible light illumination is discussed. The review finally elaborates the research gap and future perspectives, paving the way for new research to develop efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen production.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0196-8904	1879-2227		WOS:000737138900001

The Co-OECs are active when residing at two oxidation levels above an all-Co(III) resting state. This doubly oxidized Co(IV)(2) state may be captured in a Co(III)(2)(IV)(2) cubane. We demonstrate that the Co(III)(2)(IV)(2) cubane may be electrochemically generated and the electronic properties of this unique high-valent state may be probed by in situ spectroscopy. Intervalence charge-transfer (IVCT) bands in the near-IR are observed for the Co(III)(2)(IV)(2) cubane, and spectroscopic analysis together with electrochemical kinetics measurements reveal a larger reorganization energy and a smaller electron transfer rate constant for the doubly versus singly oxidized cubane. Spectroelectrochemical X-ray absorption data further reveal systematic spectral changes with successive oxidations from the cubane resting state. Electronic structure calculations correlated to experimental data suggest that this state is best represented as a localized, antiferromagnetically coupled Co(IV)(2) dimer. The exchange coupling in the cofacial Co(IV)(2) site allows for parallels to be drawn between the electronic structure of the Co4O4 cubane model system and the high-valent active site of the Co-OEC, with specific emphasis on the manifestation of a doubly oxidized Co(IV)(2) center on O-O bond formation.									73	0	0	0	14	0	73			0027-8424			WOS:000398789800038	28348217

Trade-offs in energy allocation within individuals in turn form the basis for life-history theory. Here we describe tests of the influences of temperature, developmental environment, and genetic background on measures of growth efficiency and resting metabolic rate in an ectothermic vertebrate, the western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans). After raising captive-born snakes from divergent life-history ecotypes on thermal regimes mimicking natural habitat differences (2 x 2 experimental design of ecotype and thermal environment), we measured oxygen consumption rate at temperatures spanning the activity range of this species. We found ecotypic differences in the reaction norms of snakes across the measured range of temperatures and a temperature-dependent allometric relationship between mass and metabolic rate predicted by the metabolic-level boundaries hypothesis. Additionally, we present evidence of within-individual trade-offs between growth efficiency and resting metabolic rate, as predicted by classic life-history theory. These observations help illuminate the ultimate and proximate factors that underlie variation in these interrelated physiological and life-history traits.									21	0	0	0	21	0	21			1522-2152	1537-5293		WOS:000359247700008	26658251

Herein, spinel CoFe2O4 (CFO) nanoparticles (NPs) were successfully in situ generated onto nitrogen-doped activated carbon by a hydrothermal-assisted annealing assembly method. The synergistic effect between CFO and N-AC in the CFO@N-AC nanocomposites take advantages of a large surface area, the less total resistance, fast electron transport and the excellent electrocatalytical activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) from both the N-AC and CFO. The mechanism of oxygen reduction for CFO@N-AC catalyst is a direct four-electron pathway. The as-acquired CFO@N-AC nanocomposites serve as the air-cathode catalyst in single chamber MFCs. The performance of MFCs is markedly enhanced utilizing the CFO@N-AC material, with the maximum power density measured to be 1770.8 +/- 15.0 mW m(-2), which is 2.39 times higher than that of the control AC. The superior catalytic performance make the low-cost CFO@N-AC possess a promising outlook for the practical application of MFCs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

By virtue of their unique textural features, such as large specific surface area, 3D cross-linked porous framework, homogeneous distribution of Pt nanoparticles, and excellent electron conductivity, the resulting Pt/graphene-MoS2 architectures possess multifunctional catalytic activities toward hydrogen evolution and methanol oxidation reactions, accompanied by high durability and strong poison tolerance, which significantly outperform those for conventional Pt/carbon black, Pt/graphene, and Pt/MoS2 catalysts. It is believed that such a simple bottom-up design concept can open up new possibilities for the up-scale synthesis of various 3D hybrid architectures with metals or metal oxides for energy-related applications.

The influence of the current density on the composition of the deposits and the current efficiencies for the electrodeposition processes are determined. Preliminary data indicate that addition of formic acid to the electroplating bath improves the current efficiency for electrodeposition. Electrocatalytic activities of the heat-treated plated materials are investigated by dc polarisation and ac impedance techniques for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 M NaOH solution at 298 K. Steady-state polarisation curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data show that improved catalytic activities for the HER are due to an increase in the effective surface area, a change in surface features upon heat treatment, the partial contribution of the Pt component, and the electrocatalytic synergism with Fe imposed by the Ce co-deposit. Cathodic potentiostatic measurements for medium time operation indicate that the electroplated materials are stable even in moderately aggressive alkaline solutions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report that the low molecular weight protein encoded by the psbJ gene is an intrinsic component of the PSII complex. Fluorescence kinetics, oxygen flash yield, and thermoluminescence measurements indicate that inactivation of the psbJ gene in Synechocystis 6803 cells and tobacco chloroplasts lowers PSII-mediated oxygen evolution activity and increases the lifetime of the reduced primary acceptor Q(A)(-) (more than a 100-fold in the tobacco Delta psbJ mutant). The decay of the oxidized S-2,S-3 states of the oxygen-evolving complex is considerably accelerated, and the oscillations of the Q(B)(-)/S-2,S-3 recombination with the number of exciting flashes are damped. Thus, PSII can be assembled in the absence of PsbJ. However, the forward electron flow from Q(A)(-) to plastoquinone and back electron flow to the oxidized Mn cluster of the donor side are deregulated in the absence of PsbJ, thereby affecting the efficiency of PSII electron flow following the charge separation process.									44	1	0	0	42	0	47			0021-9258			WOS:000171925600144	11546758

While cyclic species are believed to be important secondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursors, the specific role of cyclic moieties (particularly for species with multiple or fused rings) remains uncertain. Here we examine the yields and composition of SOA formed from the reaction of OH with a series of C10 (cyclo)alkanes, with 0-3 rings, in order to better understand the role of multiple cyclic moieties on aerosol formation pathways. A chamber oxidation technique using high, sustained OH radical concentrations was used to simulate long reaction times in the atmosphere. This aging technique leads to higher yields than in previously reported chamber experiments. Yields were highest for cyclic and polycyclic precursors, though yield exhibited little dependence on number of rings. However, the oxygen-to-carbon ratio of the SOA was highest for the polycyclic precursors. These trends are consistent with aerosol formation requiring two generations of oxidation and 3-4 oxygen-containing functional groups in order to condense. Cyclic, unbranched structures are protected from fragmentation during the first oxidation step, with C C bond scission instead leading to ring opening, efficient functionalization, and high SOA yields. Fragmentation may occur during subsequent oxidation steps, limiting yields by forming volatile products. Polycyclic structures can undergo multiple ring opening reactions, but do not have markedly higher yields, likely due to enhanced fragmentation in the second oxidation step. By contrast, C C bond scission for the linear and branched structures leads to fragmentation prior to condensation, resulting in low SOA yields. The results highlight the key roles of multigenerational chemistry and susceptibility to fragmentation in the formation and evolution of SOA									36	3	0	0	15	0	38			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000341229300035	25093758

The major bottleneck for electrocatalytic hydrogen production is still exists as the reported catalysts, mainly noble metal based, are extremely costly. Thus the fabrication of cheap and noble metal free electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) is still seeking. Here, a simplistic method is developed for the synthesis of carbon assimilated molybdenum carbide (beta-Mo2C) hollow sphere which showed effective electrocatalysis for HER. The synthesis of desired beta-Mo2C-C hollow sphere is based on high temperature carbothermal reduction (800 degrees C in 10%-H-2/N-2 atmosphere) of carbon incorporated MoO2 spheres. The synthesized beta-Mo2C-with an optimal carbon loading reaches 10 mA/cm(-2) current density at a low overpotential of 146 mV with a small tafel slope of 90 mV dec(-1) for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4. The improved catalytic performance, long-term stability make beta-Mo2C-C hollow sphere an auspicious HER electrocatalyst. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Lattice hydroxide anions in metal hydroxides are primarily responsible for observing such an enhanced HER activity in alkali that facilitate water dissociation and assist the first step, the hydrogen adsorption. Unfortunately, their poor electronic conductivity had been an issue of concern that significantly lowered its activity. Interesting advancements were made when heterostructured hydroxide materials with a metallic and or a semiconducting phase were found to overcome this pitfall. However, in the midst of recently evolving metal chalcogenide and phosphide based HER catalysts, significant developments made in the field of metal hydroxides and their heterostructures catalysed alkaline HER and their superiority have unfortunately been given negligible attention. This review, unlike others, begins with the question of why alkaline HER is difficult and will take the reader through evaluation perspectives, trends in metals hydroxides and their heterostructures catalysed HER, an understanding of how alkaline HER works on different interfaces, what must be the research directions of this field in near future, and eventually summarizes why metal hydroxides and their heterostructures are inevitable for energy-efficient alkaline HER.									81	3	0	0	2	0	81			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000618974200001	33411383

In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that the as-prepared catalyst was entirely transformed into ultrathin Ni NSs under alkaline reductive conditions. The in-situ-generated catalysts exhibited superior activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with an overpotential of 80 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2). Studies revealed that the large-area ultrathin Ni NSs served as active sites for H-2 generation, and the trace sulfur adsorbed on the Ni surface promoted water dissociation. This work has developed a templating approach for preparing highly active HER electrocatalysts and identified the real active sites under electrocatalytic conditions.									158	7	0	0	19	0	158			2451-9294			WOS:000408622000016

The ultrafast mechanism creates excited electronic states of nitrogen, which then dissociate molecular oxygen through quenching reactions, with the remaining energy dissipated as heat. Optical and electrical diagnostic techniques have been applied to provide a self-consistent set of experimental data for a reference test-case with well-defined discharge and gas conditions. The pulses have a duration of 10 ns, an amplitude of 5.7 kV, a repetition frequency of 10 kHz and the pin-to-pin electrodes are separated by 4 mm. We present measurements of the gas temperature during and after the discharge using optical emission spectroscopy of the second positive system of nitrogen, spatially resolved profiles of the absolute densities of excited electronic states, determined using Abel-inverted spectra of the first and second positive systems of nitrogen, as well as the temporal evolution of the absolute densities of N-2(A), N-2(B), N-2(C), electrons and atomic oxygen. These measurements are synchronized with electrical measurements of pulse current, voltage, and energy. The discharge is found to dissociate about 50% of molecular oxygen and to produce a temperature increase of about 900 K within 20 ns, corresponding to an ultrafast heating rate of about 5 x 10(10) Ks(-1). Comparisons with numerical simulations show good agreement with the measurements and validate the ultrafast mechanism. About 35% of the electric energy deposited into the gas goes into O-2 dissociation, and about 21% into gas heating. Finally, the dissociative quenching rates of N-2(B) and N-2(C) with O-2 at 2200 K were measured and found to be 2.8(+/- 0.6) x 10(-10) cm(3) s(-1) and 5.8(+/- 0.9) x 10(-10) cm(3) s(-1), respectively. Combining these measurements with the literature values at 300 K, we propose a functional temperature dependence in the range 300-2200 K of 3.0 x 10(-10)(T/300)(0.3) cm(3) s(-1) for the C state, and a constant value of 3.0 x 10(-10) cm(3) s(-1) for the B state.									147	6	0	0	0	0	150			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000326956800011

However, four-electron-driven oxidation half-reaction showing slow kinetics, accompanying with insufficient light absorption and rapid carrier combination in photocatalysts leads to low solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency. Here, we report amorphous cobalt phosphide (Co-P)-supported black phosphorus nanosheets employed as photocatalysts can simultaneously address these issues. The nanosheets exhibit robust hydrogen evolution from pure water (pH = 6.8) without bias and hole scavengers, achieving an apparent quantum efficiency of 42.55% at 430 nm and energy conversion efficiency of over 5.4% at 353 K. This photocatalytic activity is attributed to extremely efficient utilization of solar energy (similar to 75% of solar energy) by black phosphorus nanosheets and high-carrier separation efficiency by amorphous Co-P. The hybrid material design realizes efficient solar-to-chemical energy conversion in suspension, demonstrating the potential of black phosphorus-based materials as catalysts for solar hydrogen production.									194	15	0	0	21	0	197			2041-1723			WOS:000429689800020	29643347

A three-day electrochemical test protocol is applied in an alkaline half-cell at 298 K and 353 K to examine the catalytic activity and initial degradation mechanisms in the hydrogen evolution reaction. It is found, that the surface enhancement and the stability of the electrode significantly depends on the process gas. Molybdenum is degraded at the beginning of the test protocol, but it is shown that higher concentrations are not necessarily required for an increase performance. The highest catalytic activity on an electrode alloyed with molybdenum under nitrogen emerges in a steady state operation at 353 K. An overpotential of 135 mV at-100 mA cm-2 is measured.

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of both the composition and preparation methodology of these electrodes in the electrooxidation of the organic pollutants 4-chlorophenol and its by-products. Electrolyses were carried out using a filter press-type flow cell and monitored by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), total organic carbon (TOC), and chloride analyses. Besides CO2, the by-products formed in the reactions were 1,4-benzoquinone, 4-chlorocatechol, and hydroquinone, as well as oxalic, maleic, malic, malonic, and succinic acids. The electrocatalytic efficiency with respect to the degradation of by-products was evaluated through the electrooxidation of 1,4-benzoquinone and oxalic acid (OA).The anodes investigated in this work are very promising for the degradation of pollutants because of their excellent efficiency concerning the consumption of 4-chlorophenol and its by-products, although the mineralization of the starting material is not complete. The cleavage of the aromatic ring occurs preferentially in the case of electrodes prepared by decomposition of inorganic precursors due to their larger electrochemically active area and electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, OA oxidation is favored on Ti/Ru0.3Sn0.7O2 prepared through decomposition of PPM.									51	6	0	0	9	5	54			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000246150100006

However, owing to difficulties in measuring the flux values, evaluation of metabolic fluxes has not been an integral part of the most metabolic studies. Flux values for metabolites of glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and hexose monophosphate (HMP) pathway were obtained for batch and glucose-limited continuous cultures of Bacillus subtilis by combining the information from the stoichiometry of key biosynthetic reactions with the experimental data on concentrations of glucose and metabolic by products, CO2 evolution, and oxygen uptake rates. The results indicate that (1) the metabolic fluxes and energetic yield as well as the extent of flux mismatch in metabolic activity of glycolysis and the TCA cycle reactions can be accurately quantified; (2) the flux through the TCA cycle in continuous culture is much in excess of cell energetic and biosynthetic demands for precursors; (3) for the range of growth rates examined the TCA cycle flux increases almost in proportion to growth rate and is significantly repressed only at very high growth rates of batch cultures; and (4) for continuous cultures the isocitrate dehydrogenase catalyzed reaction of the TCA cycle is the major source of the reduced form of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) used in biosynthesis.

The kinetic coefficients describing the O-2-reduction mechanism are the O-ion diffusion (D-chem) and the O-surface exchange coefficients (k(chem)). These parameters are strongly dependent on the nature of the material, both on its bulk and surface atomic and electronic structures. This review discusses the method for obtaining the kinetic coefficients through the combination of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with focused ion-beam 3D tomography measurements on porous electrodes (3DT-EIS). The data, together with oxygen non-stoichiometry thermodynamic data, is analysed using the Adler-Lane-Steele model for macro-homogeneous porous electrodes. The results for different families of oxides are compared: single- and double-layered perovskites with O-vacancies defects, based on La-Sr cobalt ferrites (La0.6Sr0.4Co1-xFexO3-delta,x= 0.2 and 0.8) and La/Pr-Ba cobaltites (La0.5-xPrxBa0.5CoO3-delta,x= 0.0, 0.2 and 0.5), as well as Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates (Nd2NiO4 +delta) with O-interstitial defects. The analysis of the evolution of molar surface exchange rates with oxygen partial pressure provides information about the mechanisms limiting the O-2-surface reaction, which generally isdissociative adsorptionordissociation-limited. At 700 degrees C in air, the La-Ba cobaltite structures, La0.5-xPrxBa0.5CoO3-delta, feature the most active surfaces (k(chem)0.5-1 10(-2)cm.s(-1)), followed by the nickelate Nd(2)NiO(4 +delta)and the La-Sr cobalt ferrites, withk(chem)1-5 10(-5)cm.s(-1). The diffusion coefficientsD(chem)are higher for cubic perovskites than for the layered ones. For La(0.6)Sr(0.4)Co(0.8)Fe(0.2)O(3-delta)and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta,D(chem)is 2.6 10(-6)cm(2).s(-1)and 5.4 10(-7)cm(2).s(-1), respectively. These values are comparable toD(chem)= 1.2 10(-6)cm(2).s(-1), observed for La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-delta. The layered structure drastically reduces the O-ion bulk diffusion, e.g.D-chem= 1.3 10(-8)cm(2).s(-1)for the Pr(0.5)Ba(0.5)CoO(3-delta)double perovskite andD(chem)2 10(-7)cm(2).s(-1)for Nd2NiO4 +delta. Finally, the analysis of the time evolution of the electrodes shows that the surface cation segregation affects both the O-ion bulk diffusion and the surface exchange rates.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2515-7655			WOS:000576550500001

In this work, Mo2C-embedded nitrogen doped porous carbon nanosheets (Mo2C@2D-NPCs) were successfully achieved with the help of a convenient interfacial strategy. As a HER electrocatalyst in alkaline solution, Mo2C@2D-NPC exhibited an extremely low onset potential of similar to 0 mV and a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of similar to 45 mV, which is much lower than the values of most reported HER electrocatalysts and comparable to the noble metal catalyst Pt. In addition, the Tafel slope and the exchange current density of Mo2C@2D-NPC were 46 mV decade(-1) and 1.14 X 10(-3) A cm(-2), respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art metal-carbide-based electrocatalysts in alkaline media. Such excellent HER activity was attributed to the rich Mo2C/NPC heterostructures and synergistic contribution of nitrogen doping, outstanding conductivity of graphene, and abundant active sites at the heterostructures.									304	16	0	0	13	0	306			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000400233200052	28291319

It was shown that during anodic electrodeposition of iridium oxide film (1) coulombic efficiency decreases with increasing anodic potential, being only 3% atE = 0.7 V vs. SCE and 26% atE = 0.62 V vs. SCE. A pair of peaks corresponding to the transition Ir(III)-oxide/Ir(IV)-oxide was present on the CVs recorded in 0.5 M H2SO4. While cycling pure Ir thin layer in the solution of 0.5 M H2SO4 from - 0.25 to 1.20 V (2) up to 100 cycles, typical CV response was characterized with the prepeak and a pair of peaks corresponding to the Ir(III)/Ir(IV)-oxide transition. With the increase of cycles number to 150, additional peak at potential of 1.0 V appeared. This peak was formed on the account of pair of peaks corresponding to the Ir(III)/Ir(IV)-oxide transition. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was investigated at both iridium oxide films. It was shown that the Tafel slope for the OER was similar to 40 mV dec(-1)for the first polarization curve, confirming that the rds was a reaction S-OH -> S-O-ads + H++ e(-). As the number of recorded polarization curves increased, the activity of both types of iridium oxide films decreased, due to dissolution of iridium oxide films at the potentials of the OER. It is shown that anodically electrodeposited iridium oxide film is more active for the OER than that obtained by cycling electrodeposited iridium layer. However, both iridium oxide films exhibited insufficient stability.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000567743900001		
J	Chen, Zongkun; Wang, Xingkun; Kessler, Sascha; Fan, Qiqi; Huang, Minghua; Coelfen, Helmut								Synthesis of hierarchical transition metal oxyhydroxides in aqueous solution at ambient temperature and their application as OER electrocatalysts								JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY				71				89	97		10.1016/j.jechem.2022.02.0422095-4956				AUG 2022	2022	First-row (3d) transition metal oxyhydroxides have attracted increasing attention due to their various advantages. Although investigating the oxidation mechanism and processing such materials into hierarchical architectures are greatly desired for their further development, it remains unclear how the oxidation state change occurs, and efforts to produce hierarchical oxyhydroxides in compliance with high ecological and economic standards have progressed slowly. Here, we describe a facile one-step coprecipitation route for the preparation of hierarchical CoOOH, NiOOH and MnOOH, which involves the diffusion of NH3 originating from ammonium hydroxide solution into an aqueous solution containing metal ion salts and K2S2O8. Comprehensive characterizations by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and in situ pH measurement demonstrated that K2S2O8 induces the oxidation state change of metal ion species after the start of hydrolysis. Meanwhile, it was found that, benefiting from the OH- concentration gradient created by the NH3 diffusion method and the suitable growth environment provided by the presence of K2S2O8 (high nucleation rate and secondary nucleation), the formation of hierarchical oxyhydroxide structures can be realized in aqueous solution at ambient temperature without the use of heat energy and additional structure-directing agents. The hierarchical CoOOH structures are performed as the electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media, which exhibit good activity with an overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a low Tafel slope of 59.6 mV dec-1, outperforming many congeneric electrocatalysts. Overall, our study not only provides important insights to understand the formation mechanism of hierarchical oxyhydroxides, but also opens up new opportunities for the preparation of hierarchical oxyhydroxides via a facile, green and low-cost method.

This work demonstrates that single-atom-sized Ni-N(4)sites embedded in three-dimensional and hierarchically structured carbon (NiN4-C) exhibit a high catalytic activity for the ORR under alkaline conditions, in which their activity is better than, or at least as high as, that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. The catalyst is synthesized by simply pyrolyzing a mixture of nickel salt and EMIM-dca (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide). The product comprises many single Ni atom active sites (the content of Ni atoms in the catalyst is similar to 4.2 +/- 0.4 wt% as estimated by ICP-OES), in which each Ni atom is coordinated with four N atoms through the formation of a Ni-N(4)planar configuration. Both theoretical simulations and electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the catalyst has a high 4e(-)selectivity,i.e., it facilitates an effective 4e(-)ORR with a limiting 2e(-)reaction. Moreover, when it is integrated into a Zn-air battery, the catalyst shows a maximum power density of similar to 95 mW cm(-2), similar to the power density of Pt/C catalysts. The results are helpful for understanding and analyzing the catalytically active sites of carbon-supported single metal atom catalysts.									37	3	0	0	0	0	38			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000555361700012

Evaluated by photodegradation of Rhodamine B and Methyl Orange, the O-mpg-C3N4 photocatalyst exhibits higher photocatalytic degradation efficiency, which is attributed to the added active spots, shorter electronic transmission distance and wider range of light absorption. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared catalysts didn't decrease significantly after five photodegradation cycles, showing a high photocatalytic stability.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000488954800042

However, inherent low conductivity and unsatisfactory cycle performance limit its further application. In this work, doping at the V site does not destroy the crystal structure of lithium vanadate but also increases the lattice volume. Moreover, the increased content of oxygen defect in the presence of redox reaction effectively improves the electrochemical properties of lithium vanadate. At the same time, the enhancement of hydrophilicity effectively improves the migration rate of ions. Among all LiLaxV3-xO8 samples, LiLa0.01V2.99O8 (LVO-La-10) demonstrates better rate and cycle performance. LVO-La-10 delivers specific discharge capacities of 93.5 mAh g1 at 0.5 C, and 42.8 mAh g-1 at 7 C, which is 17.4 and 16.7 mAh g-1 larger than that of lithium vanadate, respectively. Moreover, the capacity retention rate of LVO-La-10 (87.8%) is still higher than that of lithium vanadate (75.8%) at the rate of 0.2 C after 100 cycles. This work exhibits that increasing the lattice volume and oxygen defect of lithium vanadate effectively improves its electrochemical performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000837002700001

They probably sample the baked, heterogeneous, melt-depleted mantle of a large, once-chondritic parent body that was broken up catastrophically while still young and hot. Heterogeneity in the parent body is inferred from a considerable "slope-1" variation from one meteorite to another in oxygen isotopes (-2.5& < Delta O-17 < -0.2 parts per thousand), which correlates with both molar FeO/MgO (range 0.03-0.35) and molar FeO/MnO (range 3-57), i.e.,Delta O-17 correlates with the redox state. No consensus has yet emerged on the cause of these correlated trends. One view favors their inheritance via silicates from hot nebular (preaccretion) processes. Another invokes smelting (reduction of FeO by C in the hot parent body). Here, guided mainly by similar trends among equilibrated ordinary and R chondrites, studies of their unequilibrated counterparts, and work on other primitive achondrites, we propose a new model for ureilites in which the parent body accreted nebular ice with high-Delta O-17, Mg-rich silicates with low Delta O-17, and varying amounts of metallic iron. Water from the thawing ice then oxidized the metal yielding secondary FeO-bearing minerals with high-Delta O-17 that, with metamorphism, became incorporated into the ureilite silicates. FeO/MgO, FeO/MnO, and Delta O-17 correlate because they rose in unison by amounts that varied spatially, depending on the local amount of metal that was oxidized. We suggest that the parent body was so large (radius >> 100 km) that smelting was inhibited and that carbon played a passive role in ureilite evolution. Although ureilites are regarded as complicated meteorites, we believe our analysis explains their mass-independent oxygen isotope trend and related FeO variation through well-understood processes and enlightens our understanding of the evolution of early planetesimals from cold, wet bodies to hot, dry ones.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1086-9379	1945-5100		WOS:000400591600008

Some important issues in electrochemistry of carbon steel in simulated concrete pore water Part 1-theoretical issues								CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				46	2			98	103		10.1179/1743278211Y.0000000002				APR 2011	2011	A model of the annulus between the carbon steel overpack and the stainless steel liner of a supercontainer of the type proposed by ONDRAF/NIRAS for the disposal of high level nuclear waste in a boom clay repository is described. The model seeks to calculate the corrosion potentials of the outer surface of the carbon steel overpack and the inner surface of the stainless steel liner as the overpack surface temperature decays exponentially with time (0-300 years). In the initial state, it is assumed that the pore water in the cementitious fill in the annulus is saturated with oxygen and that the concentration of hydrogen is zero. As time increases, the temperature at the overpack external surface decreases exponentially, and oxygen is consumed at the overpack outer and liner inner surfaces, resulting in a fall in the corrosion potential at each surface, as estimated using mixed potential models. Once the corrosion potentials reach sufficiently negative values, hydrogen evolution becomes a viable cathodic reaction, resulting in the gradual build-up of hydrogen in the annulus. Eventually, the corrosion potential versus time data will be used to predict the form of corrosion that occurs on both the overpack outer and the liner inner surfaces as well as the pressure change due to the consumption of oxygen and the build-up of hydrogen. Further development of the model requires the measurement of values for important model parameters, most notably the passive current density of the steel, the kinetic parameters for hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction and the parameters contained in the point defect model for the passive state. The latter are being obtained by optimising the point defect model on experimental electrochemical impedance spectroscopic data. Eventually, these data will be used in models that are being developed to predict the corrosion of the carbon steel overpack over the entire storage horizon of 10 000 years. Details of the experimental studies are given in an accompanying paper.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			1478-422X			WOS:000290090900004

Non-noble Fe3O4 catalyst owns outstanding conductivity and its octahedral Fe sites can markedly promote water dissociation. However, it lacks active centers on the surface, resulting in its poor activity when used as a catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, an electron redistribution strategy is proposed by introducing Ni sites onto the surface of Fe3O4 (Ni/Fe3O4). The abundant delocalized electrons, derived from the electronic interaction of Ni and Fe3O4 species, significantly optimize the electronic structure of the Ni/ Fe3O4 catalyst, leading to its improved adsorption behavior. This Ni/Fe3O4 catalyst exhibits remarkable bifunctional activity, steadily outputting 1000 mA cm(-2) at the low overpotential of 387 mV for HER and 338 mV for OER, respectively. Using Ni/Fe3O4 as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting reaction exhibits the optimal performance with outstanding stability, obtaining a current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) at 1.98 V, much superior to a Pt/C||IrO2 cell. Experimental analysis and theoretical calcu-lations collectively corroborate that the electron redistribution of Fe3O4 is activated by coupling Ni species, leading to the promoted HER and OER kinetics. This electron redistribution strategy provides an effective method to activate transition metal-based catalysts which are promising to be utilized as supe-rior electrocatalysts for the industrial overall water splitting reaction.

This paper reports the synthesis of three-dimensionally ordered macroporous iron phosphide self-supported structure on carbon cloth (3DOM-FeP/CC) through an electrostatic self-assembly method along with heat-treatment and phosphidation. The resultant 3DOM-FeP/CC catalyst combined the advantages of the interconnected ordered macropores, the self-supported structure and the highly-conductive carbon substrate, which endowed the catalyst with substantial accessible active sites, abundant mass transport channels for electrolyte/products, and convenient electron transfer pathways. As a result, the 3DOM-FeP/CC catalyst exhibited outstanding catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction in acid electrolyte, providing a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 68 mV with a small Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1).

XPS and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the substituted Ni2+ ions were preferentially located at the octahedral (Oh) sites in the zinc ferrite spinel lattice, rather than the tetrahedral (Td) sites. When the amount of substituted Ni2+ was >0.6 mol, the crystal structure was converted to an inverse spinel structure. Ni2+ substitution resulted in the formation of oxygen vacancies in the spinel lattice. With Ni2+ substitution, the bandgap state changes from direct to indirect. The TRPL, IMVS, and IMPS analyses revealed the carrier diffusion length, e(-)/h(+) recombination time, and charge transport rate for the Zn1-xNixFe2O4 inverse spinel. The electrons excited from the valence bands (VBs) to the CBs (O 2p -> Fe3+ 3d) moved to Ni2+ 3d (Fe3+ 3d -> Ni2+ 3d) and, subsequently, the longer carrier diffusion length suppressed e(-)/h(+) recombination. Eventually, an optimum hydrogen production of 19.2 mu mol g(-1) was achieved using the Zn0.4Ni0.6Fe2.0O4 catalyst for a 10 h-hydrogen evolution reaction in neutral water splitting, without any sacrificial agent under visible light; Zn0.4Ni0.6Fe2.0O4 exhibited a four-fold improvement compared to ZnFe2O4. The material did not significantly deteriorate the catalytic performance, even after six regeneration experiments, and the catalyst material was separated using a magnet after the reaction. Thus, the goal of this study was to develop a simple, eco-friendly, and efficient catalyst via partial cation substitution in the spinel structure.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000663798300001

Herein, reported is an activity correlation with catalysts, electronic structure, in order to clarify the origin of reactivity for a series of transition metals supported on nitrogen-doped graphene as SACs for HER by a combination of density functional theory calculations and electrochemical measurements. Only few of the transition metals (e.g., Co, Cr, Fe, Rh, and V) as SACs show good catalytic activity toward HER as their Gibbs free energies are varied between the range of -0.20 to 0.30 eV but among which Co-SAC exhibits the highest electrochemical activity at 0.13 eV. Electronic structure studies show that the energy states of active valence d(z)(2) orbitals and their resulting antibonding state determine the catalytic activity for HER. The fact that the antibonding state orbital is neither completely empty nor fully filled in the case of Co-SAC is the main reason for its ideal hydrogen adsorption energy. Moreover, the electrochemical measurement shows that Co-SAC exhibits a superior hydrogen evolution activity over Ni-SAC and W-SAC, confirming the theoretical calculation. This systematic study gives a fundamental understanding about the design of highly efficient SACs for HER.									167	13	0	0	7	0	167			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000461062900006

However, insufficient hydrogen and oxygen production activity at industry-relevant current densities and long-term catalyst stability on the electrode surface prevent this approach from industrial translation. This work resolves these challenges by advancing the promising, yet far-from-successful attempts to sprout bimetallic electrocatalytic nanostructures directly from electrode frames. For the first time, we utilize magnetic-field-focused, atmospheric-pressure plasma jets in oxygen-argon gas mixtures to successfully induce the nanointerfaced bimetallic NiCo hydroxide and oxide catalyst phases. After a simple hydrothermal treatment in pure water, NiCo bimetallic hydroxide nanosheets are densely covered with strongly bonded bimetallic NiCo oxide nanoparticles which ensure high catalytic activity evidenced by the low overpotentials for both HER and OER for delivering a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) (j(100)) of only 306 and 484 mV, respectively. The electrode-emerged nanointerfaced NiCo hydroxide-oxide bimetallic system (NiCo2O4-NiCo(OH)(x)) shows an ultrastable electrocatalytic performance under a high current density of j(200), which only decays 5.8% and 6.3% for HER and OER processes within 100 h. The competitive H-2 and O-2 production rates are about 1.27 and 0.69 mmol h(-1) cm(-2) (near to 2:1, under j10 conditions), meeting a nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency. Furthermore, the theory calculation indicates that the Ni and Co sites of NiCo2O4-NiCo(OH) x are the catalytic centers for the HER process. Our new plasma-enabled approach for the controlled production of bimetallic hydroxide-oxide active nanointerfaced systems is generic and is potentially suitable for diverse materials systems and applications well beyond electrocatalysis.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000703995900043	34519473

Herein, we propose CoMoP NF in lower valence states by thorough phosphorization which improves the adhesion of the catalysts on substrate and facilitates the Volmer step. The CoMoP@NF can reach 39 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), 119 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), and a low Tafel slope of 73.3 mV per decade. The decline of i-t test in 10 h at similar to 370 mA cm(-2) is only 1 mA cm(-2). Theoretical calculations confirm the rational design of CoMoP whose Delta G(H)*. is as low as 0.15 and -0.01 eV corresponding to (013) and (211) facets, respectively. Electrons transfer from Co to Mo results in middle d band center of CoMoP that promotes H adsorption and desorption. This concept could provide valuable insights into the design of other catalysts for HER and beyond. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Measurements were carried out with circularly polarized gamma- ray beams at energies: E gamma = 9.08, 9.38, 9.58, 9.78, 10.08, 10.38 and 10.68 MeV. We have begun the process of extracting complete angular distributions for the O-16 (gamma, alpha)C-12 reaction and the C-12(gamma, 3 alpha) reaction ( eventually with energy bins of approximately 100 keV) in order to determine the values of S-E1, S-E2 and the mixing phase phi(12) of the O-16 (gamma, alpha) C-12 reaction. The rate of carbon formation at high temperatures ( T > 3 GK) was suggested to increase due to contributions from a higher lying 2 + state.

For high performance, the catalyst nanoparticles must form charge-carrier-selective contacts with the underlying light-absorbing semiconductor, facilitating either hole or electron transfer while inhibiting collection of the opposite carrier. Despite the key role played by such selective contacts in photoelectrochemical energy conversion and storage, the underlying nanoscale interfaces are poorly understood because direct measurement of their properties is challenging, especially under operating conditions. Using an n-Si/Ni photoanode model system and potential-sensing atomic force microscopy, we measure interfacial electron-transfer processes and map the photovoltage generated during photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution at nanoscopic semiconductor/catalyst interfaces. We discover interfaces where the selectivity of low-Schottky-barrier n-Si/Ni contacts for holes is enhanced via a nanoscale size-dependent pinch-off effect produced when surrounding high-barrier regions develop during device operation. These results thus demonstrate (1) the ability to make nanoscale operando measurements of contact properties under practical photoelectrochemical conditions and (2) a design principle to control the flow of electrons and holes across semiconductor/catalyst junctions that is broadly relevant to different photoelectrochemical devices.									55	1	0	0	6	0	54			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000511170100016	31591528

Here we solve numerically a reaction-diffusion equation to determine the Li2O2 deposition profiles in a model porous cathode in the absence and presence of discrete catalytic sites, considering five commonly used electrolytes. We implement a greedy optimization algorithm to maximize the cathode capacity before pore clogging by optimal positioning of the discrete catalysts along the pore. The results indicate that, under the assumption of equal electrochemical stability, a maximal theoretical capacity is limited by the oxygen solubility and diffusivity in each electrolyte in the absence of catalysts and vary widely in the five cases considered. However, optimal catalyst distributions can effectively compensate for these differences, suggesting a rational way of designing cathode structures with high performances according to the required operation conditions.

For this reason, density functional theory has been used to understand the optical, electronic and chemical properties of this material at an atomistic level. Bulk doping can be used to reduce the band gap, and to increase photoabsorption and charge mobility. Charge transport takes place through adiabatic polaron hopping. The stable (0001) surface has a stoichiometric termination when exposed to oxygen, it becomes hydroxylated in water, and it has an oxygen-rich termination under illumination in a photoelectrochemical setup. On the oxygen-rich termination, surface states are present that might act as recombination centres for electrons and holes. On the contrary, on the hydroxylated termination surface states appear only on reaction intermediates. The intrinsic surface states disappear in the presence of an overlayer of gallium oxide. The reaction of water oxidation is assumed to proceed by four proton-coupled electron transfers and it is shown to involve a nucleophilic attack with the formation of an OOH group. Calculated overpotentials are in the range of 0.5-0.6 V. Open questions and future research directions are briefly discussed.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000413570200001	29057752

Characterization of tri-metallic catalyst was performed by electrochemical methods of cyclic voltammetry and CO stripping voltammetry, while its activity for HER was tested by linear sweep voltammetry in 0.1 M NaOH. Rh@Pd/Pt(poly) catalyst has shown superior catalytic activity for HER with respect to initial Pt(poly) and both corresponding bimetallic Pd/Pt(poly) and Rh/Pt(poly) electrodes. This was explained by a strong synergistic electronic interaction between three metals in close contact induced at a number of different active sites across the surface of tri-metallic catalyst, which results with lowering of the binding energy for the adsorption of H intermediate species.

In this work, carbon-incorporated Co/Co2P microspheres (Co/Co2P@C) as a novel Mott-Schottky catalyst were synthesized successfully via carbonization and gradual phosphorization of Co based metal-organic frameworks. The unique merits, including Mott-Schottky effect at the interface formed between metal Co and semiconductor Co2P, the incorporated carbon-layer on the surface and the spherical structure endow Co/Co2P@C with favorable electrical conductivity, preferable kinetics and long-term stability when it was evaluated as electrocatalyst for HER in wide-pH range. As a result, the Co/Co2P@C with the optimized phosphorization degree delivers a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the low overpotential of 192 and 158 mV in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively, with a remarkable stability (CV cycling for 3000 cycles and continuous electrolysis at the overpotential of 200 mV for 48 h). Therefore, the as-designed Co/Co2P@C should be one of the most promising catalysts for HER application. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Electrochemical methods were used to elucidate the overpotential value, the charge transfer resistance and the double layer capacity. Structural properties of the electrode surface were determined with SEM, XRD and XPS analyses. Thus, a correlation between electrochemical and structural parameters was found. In this context, we report on a cyclic voltammetric activation procedure which causes a significant increase of the surface area of Fe-based electrodes leading to a boost in effective activity of the activated electrodes. It was found that the intrinsic activity of activated Fe-based electrodes is very high due to the formation of a nanocrystalline surface layer. In contrast, the activation procedure influences only the intrinsic activity of the Ni electrodes without the formation of a porous surface layer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Part of the challenge is that any comprehensive mechanism may have to describe processes on timescales from femtoseconds (interfacial electron transfer) to milliseconds (ion diffusion). Here we separate these timescales using a femtosecond perturbation approach: we collect cyclic voltammograms from several Pt electrodes with and without femtosecond laser irradiation. We find that laser irradiation at biases near hydrogen evolution lowers the barrier for H-2 generation, while in the H under potential deposition range it induces partial charge transfer along the Pt-H bond and interfacial dipole (re)arrangement. The trend in ultrafast partial charge transfer we measure, Pt(111)<Pt(100)<Pt(110)<< Pt microelectrode, is the same as for H-2 generation suggesting insight into both ultrafast electron transfer and slow double layer structural change is required to describe the HER mechanism.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2196-0216			WOS:000476572700008

The particle size effects were explored in the range 0.1-20 mu m, providing a new insight into the micro-structural evolution of the particles as a function of their size, and into the 'mechanical' resistance upon important volume change upon phase transformation of these anodes. For small particles, the failure of the battery comes from an electrochemical sintering that compacts the whole electrode, which results in its cracking. The particles keep their integrity when the discharge is stopped at a voltage 0.1 V, which corresponds to the chemical composition Li12Si7, while the particles are known to crack at deeper discharge up to Li22Si5. Replacing the Si particles by SiO particles in an attempt to avoid these structural effects did not help, because of the different chemical reactions during cycling, with the loss of oxygen.

Thus, decoupled water electrolysis is desired to avoid the problems. Motivated by the above, spatially decoupled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is demonstrated in this work, leveraging a redox targeting-based flow battery employing iron triethanolamine (Fe(III)TEA)-K2MnO4 couple. This system spatially separates HER from the electrode compartment. Sustained hydrogen is achieved by reaction between regenerated Fe(II)TEA and water in the negative electrolyte storage tank. The Faradaic efficiency of the decoupled HER is 70% and keeps stable upon prolonged operation. The onset overpotential of HER is 24 mV which is lower than previous studies. We anticipate the approach presented in this work would offer an alternative solution to water electrolysis for scalable and safe hydrogen production with improved gas purity.

In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) has been used to investigate the evolution of the BST films on different surfaces-during both deposition and postannealing processes; First, the optical constants of the BST films in the photon energy range of 1.5-4.5 eV were determined by SE analysis on crystallized BST films;deposited on MgO single crystal substrates, The interfaces in BST/Si and BST/SiO2/Si structure were examined by SE and Auger electron spectroscopy depth profiles. Subcutaneous oxidation in the BST/Ir structure was:: observed by in situ SE during both ion beam sputter deposition and postdeposition annealing in oxygen at 700 degrees C. A study of the thermal stability of the Ir/TiN/SiO2/Si structure in oxygen at 700 degrees C was carried out using in situ SE. The oxidation of Ir was confirmed by x-ray diffraction. The surface composition and morphology evolution after oxidation were investigated by time of flight mass spectroscopy of recoiled ions (TOF-MSRI) and atomic force microscopy. It has been found that Ti from the underlying TiN barrier layer diffused through-the Ir layer onto the surface and thereupon became oxidized. It was also shown that the surface roughness increases with increasing oxidation time. The implications of the instability of Ir/TiN/SiO2/Si structure on the performance of capacitor; devices based on this substrate are discussed. It has been, shown that a combination of in situ SE and TOF-MSRI provides a powerful methodology for in situ monitoring of complex oxide film growth and postannealing processes.

Here, a facile and effective approach to the design and construction of two-dimensional MoS2 and WS2 interleaved nanowalls with maximum exposures of active edges on silk-derived N-doped carbon fibers (SNCF) was demonstrated. The morphological evolutions of the MoS2 and WS2 nanocrystals on the SNCF from crescent-like nanosheets to an interleaved nanowall network can be obtained by adjusting the concentrations of the Mo and W precursors. These robust MoS2/SNCF and WS2/SNCF electrocatalysts exhibit prominent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities with onset potentials of -40 and -96 mV and Tafel slopes of 60 and 66 mV dec(-1), respectively. The overpotentials (eta) at j = -10 mA cm(-2) for MoS2/SNCF and WS2/SNCF are -102 and -157 mV, respectively. In addition, MoS2/SNCF and WS2/SNCF are both able to sustain continuous HER operation for 10 h under working conditions with only a slight degradation in current densities, implying excellent durability and a prospect for practical applications.

Benefiting from the unique structural characteristic of open-framework and abundant step atoms, Ni2P-HNTs/NF achieves 10 mA cm(-2) at 91 mV (vs. RHE) for the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction and 18 mV (vs. RHE) for the anodic HzOR in a three electrode system, respectively. The corresponding two-electrode hydrazine electrolyzer produces 10 mA cm(-2) with a total voltage of only 152 mV for ultra-pure hydrogen production, highlighting a cost-effective and energy-saving water electrolysis mode.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000540759000013	32432270

We investigate the pathway and the kinetic barrier for the adiabatic reaction going from the hole polaron localized in BiVO4 to the dehydrogenation of the adsorbed water molecule at the interface. The reaction is found to involve the H2O center dot+ radical cation as an intermediate, to have a kinetic barrier of 0.7 eV, and to be initiated by the electron transfer. The calculated kinetic barrier is in good agreement with experiment and is consistent with the slow hole transfer kinetics observed at the surface of BiVO4. To characterize the structural changes occurring during this process, we analyze the O-H distances for three relevant water molecules. We also examine the Wannier functions around the O atom of the adsorbate involved in the reaction to reveal the changes in the electronic structure during the hole hopping. The projected density of states of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals allows us to identify the atomic orbitals that are primarily involved in the reaction. We expect that the proposed reaction mechanism generally holds when the surface coverage is dominated by molecularly adsorbed water.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000870016200001

In this respect, dihydrogen (H-2) has been considered in the last decades as an efficient energy carrier and much effort has been directed to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report on the efficiency of iron-based 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrins containing carboxylate groups in different positions (ortho, meta and para of the meso-substituted aryl groups of the porphyrin backbone) as molecular catalysts for the HER. The iron-based porphyrin containing the carboxylic acids in the ortho position was found completely inactive in the HER. Furthermore, besides stereoelectronic control, the subtle differences observed in the cyclic voltammograms (CV) as well as those associated with the electrocatalytic activity might involve a previously neglected ion-pair interaction between the carboxylate groups of the porphyrin scaffold and the chloride anions belonging to the proton source, which highlights the relevance of ion-pair contacts remote from the active center for this type of catalytic system.									17	0	0	0	1	0	16			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000460322700021

However, the efficiency of renewable energy conversion into biochemicals is yet to be improved in MES. In this study, molybdenum-doped bismuth vanadate was deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (FTO/BiVO4/Mo) to serve as MES photoanode for efficient solar energy harvesting and reduction of overpotential for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By applying a fixed bias of 3 V to MES systems under 0.5 sun illumination, a more negative cathode potential (-0.72 +/- 0.03 V vs. SHE versus -0.38 +/- 0.03 V vs. SHE in the dark) was achieved owing to the reduced OER over potential at FTO/BiVO4/Mo photoanode, which led to a 25% increase in current density and 46-fold increase in acetate production rate. Higher electron recovery (similar to 62%) and excellent stability (7 days) were also observed in MES reactors with sun illumination on FTO/BiVO4/Mo photoanode. Based on acetate production and energy input from simulated sunlight, 0.97 +/- 0.19% solar energy was theoretically converted into acetate, which is one of the highest conversion efficiencies ever reported in hybrid MES systems. These results demonstrate that integrating FTO/BiVO4/Mo photoanode with MES systems could significantly enhance the solar-to-biochemical conversion efficiency by lowering the energy requirement for initiating the anodic OER and maintaining the negative cathode potential, which enables MES technology to be economically more viable for renewable energy storage and CO2 valorization.									11	3	0	0	6	0	13			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000595047800004

However, facile designing and fabricating robust and cheap electrodes derived from earth-abundant materials is a great challenge. This work reports the synthesis of vanadium sulfide (VS2) micro-flowered structure via solvent-assisted hydrothermal method using ethylene glycol as an additive in the aqueous-based reaction medium, which has imparted a significant effect on the morphology and the crystallinity of the VS2. In addition, in contrast to the VS2 electrode fabricated in a pure aqueous medium, the ethylene glycol mediated VS2 electrode upon coupling as a cathode and anode in an HER||UOR vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)-based three-electrode configuration demonstrates a significantly reduced overall urea decomposition potential of 1.38 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) as compared to the conventional water-splitting of 1.75 V vs RHE. The obtained high-performance electrocatalytic activity on UOR and HER can be ascribed to the influence of ethylene glycol solvent, particularly on VS2 growth, morphology, and crystallinity, favoring the formation of abundant catalytic sites with facile electrolyte diffusion and electrolysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000745928800001

Mono-layered graphene has been synthesized through low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), whereas multi-layered graphene has been synthesized by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD). Copper foil is used as the substrate. The graphene layer on Cu foil subsequently transferred on to silicon photoabsorber using poly(methyl-2-methylpropenoate) (PMMA). At the initial linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) scan, LPCVD-synthesized graphene-Si (LPCVD-Si) electrode showed an onset potential of -0.65 V and photocurrent of -4.31 mA cm(-2) (at -0.385 V). On the contrary, the onset potential and photocurrent of APCVD-prepared graphene-Si (APCVD-Si) photocathode are -0.36 V and -28.28 mA cm(-2) (at -0.385 V), respectively. After the 130th LSV scan, the onset potential and photocurrent of LPCVD-Si improved to -0.39 V and -13.28 mA cm(-2) (at -0.385 V), respectively.

The resulting 3D hierarchical Al-FeCoNi2/Ni/NF electrode affords the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at a cell voltage of 1.73 V, compared to that (1.81 V) of Pt/ NF parallel to IrO2/NF electrode-pair setting, in neutral PBS buffer at 25 degrees C. As an alkaline electrolyzer, the Al-FeCoNi2/Ni/NF electrode-pair device requires the voltage of 1.73 and 1.97 V to achieve the current density of 100 and 500 mA/cm(2) in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution at 25 degrees C, respectively. At 80 degrees C, the anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzer employing bifunctional Al-FeCoNi2/Ni/NF electrodes is demonstrated to deliver the current densities of 0.5 A/cm(2) (at a cell voltage of 2.00 V) in 1 M PBS and 2.0 A/cm(2) (at a cell voltage of 1.82 V) in 1 M KOH electrolytes, respectively. Material and kinetic studies of Al-FeCoNi2 reveal that the keys for the observed activity/stability are ascribed to (a) the proposed charge-polarized [Al delta+/(Fe delta+CoNi delta-)-Ni-0] motif (evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)/ X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy), facilitating interfacial electron transfer from metallic core to the catalytic shell, (b) the increased defects/disorders concentrating on the surface-adsorbed intermediates (characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure), (c) the facile dissociation of the adsorbed water into H+ and OH- promoted by Al3+ dopant electrochemically on the catalyst surface (kinetic isotope effect result), (d) the upshift of d-band center and the increased work function induced by the hard nature of Al3+ dopant (evidenced by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy/XPS/L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy), optimizing the binding energy of M-H*/M-O* intermediates (M = Fe, Co, and Ni), and (e) the good stability caused by redox-resistant nature of Al3+ dopant at a high current density (1 A/cm(2)) in the AEM electrolyzer. That is, Al-0-FeCoNi metallic core and Al3+-doped spinel/(oxy)hydroxide shells work in concert to optimize the electrical conductivity and electronic structure of Al-FeCoNi2 nanoparticles for hydrogen evolution reaction/oxygen evolution reaction kinetics in neutral/alkaline electrolytes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000822459900001

Pure metal single crystals and well-characterized bulk alloys have been used quite successfully as models for real (commercial) electrocatalysts. Given the sheer volume of all work in electrocatalysis that is on fuel cell reactions, we will focus on electrocatalysts for fuel cells. Since Pt is the model fuel cell electrocatalyst, we will focus entirely on studies of pure Pt and Pt bimetallic alloys. The electrode reactions discussed include hydrogen oxidation/evolution, oxygen reduction, and the electrooxidation of carbon monoxide, formic acid, and methanol. Surface spectroscopies emphasized are FTIR, STM/AFM and surface X-ray scattering (SXS). The discussion focuses on the relation between the energetics of adsorption of intermediates and the reaction pathway and kinetics, and how the energetics and kinetics relate to the extrinsic properties of the model system, e.g. surface structure and/or composition. Finally, we conclude by discussing the limitations that are reached by using pure metal single crystals and well-characterized bulk alloys as models for real catalysts, and suggest some directions for developing more realistic systems.

The electrolysis of water to generate hydrogen and oxygen as a fuel are challenging renewable energy technology. To develop a highly efficient low-cost non-noble metal-based catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is essential and urgent need. Thus, the present work describes a facile synthetic approach to develop suitable cost effective electrocatalyst for water splitting application. It deals one-pot synthesis of low-cost transition metal based ternary metal sulphide (BMS) CuCo2S4, CuMn2S4, CuNi2S4, and CuZn2S4 microspheres as electrocatalyst to generate hydrogen from water. The physical characterization of synthesized electrocatalyst were performed by powder x-ray diffractometer (PXRD) and Raman spectroscopy. The morphological characterization of synthesized electrocatalyst were done by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) however the elemental mapping analysis was done by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The electrochemical measurements were performed in 0.5 M H2SO4 acidic medium on 3-electrode polymer electrolyser membrane water (PEMW) system. The lowest onset and overpotential values have been observed as 61 and 79 mV, respectively in the case of CuCo2S4 micro-sphere. However, the Tafel slope values of CuCo2S4, CuMn2S4, CuNi2S4, and CuZn2S4 electrocatalysts were calculated 121, 115, 102 and 41 mV respectively. On the basis of obtained electrochemical characterization results, CuCo2S4 has been revealed better electrocatalyst under acidic media. This study opens a new direction to consider low-cost transition metal based ternary microspheres as electrocatalyst to produce hydrogen during water electrolysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000810494700001

TMP nanostructures prepared typically by introducing additional conventional phosphorus sources are suggested as promising durable and low-cost electrocatalysts. Herein, an eco-efficient guest/host precursor-based synthesis route is demonstrated to prepare doped Co2P scaffolded within echinus-like carbon ((M0.2Co0.8)(2)P@C, M = Fe and Ni) as electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. (Fe0.2Co0.8)(2)P@C is derived by directly pyrolyzing a precursor of sodium dodecyl phosphate-intercalated CoFe-layered double hydroxide (CoFe-LDH), without introducing any additional phosphorus source. Electrocatalytic testing shows that (Fe0.2Co0.8)(2)P@C requires overpotentials of 290 and 130 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER) in an alkaline electrolyte, respectively. Furthermore, a different (Ni0.2Co0.8)(2)P@C composite, obtained only by altering a NiCo-LDH host, exhibits better electrocatalytic activities than those of Fe-doped (Fe0.2Co0.8)(2)P@C. In particular, the (No0.2Co0.8)(2)P@C||(Ni0.2Co0.8)(2)P@C electrolyzer affords a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at a decent voltage of 1.62 V for overall water splitting. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) observations show the oxyhydroxide layer formed on the surface, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Fe-/Ni-doping lowers the Gibbs free energy barrier for the OER and the HER, both underpinning the enhancements.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000574599500020	32930311

It is imperative yet challenging to search low-cost, high-efficiency, and long-durability electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in energy conversion devices. Herein, three-dimensional low-cost Co3Fe7 nanoparticles/nitrogen, manganese-codoped porous carbon (Co3Fe7/N, Mn-PC) was synthesized with the mixture of dicyandiamide, cobalt (II) tetramethoxyphenylporphyrin (Co(II)TMOPP), hemin, and manganese acetate by one-step pyrolysis and then acid etching. The resultant Co3Fe7/N, Mn-PC exhibited excellent durability and prominent ORR activity with more positive onset potential (E-onset, 0.98 V) and half-wave potential (E-1/2, 0.87 V) in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, coupled with strong methanol resistance. The pyrolysis temperature and optimal balance of graphite with pyridine-nitrogen are of significance for the ORR performance. The prepared Co3Fe7/N, Mn-PC displayed excellent ORR performance over commercial Pt/C in the identical environment. It was ascribed to the uniform 3D architecture, Mn- and N-doping effects by finely adjusting the electronic structures, coupled with the synergistic catalytic effects of multi-compositions and multi-active sites. This work provides some constructive guidelines for preparation of low-cost and high-efficiency ORR electrocatalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

J	Busch, Michael; Wildlock, Mats; Simic, Nina; Ahlberg, Elisabet					Ahlberg, Elisabet/0000-0002-4946-4979			Can We Replace Cr(VI) as a Homogeneous Catalyst in the Chlorate Process?								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				126	24			10061	10072		10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c02717		JUN 2022		JUN 23 2022	2022	The chemistry of hypochlorous acid in the presence of metal impurities is of high importance for many areas of chemistry ranging from water purification and disinfection to sea water splitting and the electrosynthesis of chlorate. The production of chlorate comprises one of the most important electrochemical processes and relies on the Cr(VI) catalyzed transformation of HOCI to chlorate. Since the use of Cr(VI) has been restricted in the European Union due to its toxicity, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity, alternative catalysts need to be developed. Building on the recently identified mechanism for the chromate catalyzed oxidation of HOCI to chlorate, we performed a screening for potential alternative catalysts using density functional theory modeling. Based on these results, a volcano plot, which combines all previously reported reaction paths, was constructed and the thermodynamic limitations were identified. Our results indicate that, in principle, many materials are able to catalyze the chlorate formation at much higher rates. However, in practice, the reaction is limited by the strong correlation between the pKa of the active site and the activity and the limitation to pH neutral conditions. This renders chromate, despite its overall poor performance, effectively the most active material. Furthermore, we show that none of the remaining considered molecules is able to replace Cr(VI) as the homogeneous catalyst due to side reactions or process limitations. Thus, these results will have a significant impact in the political decision of banning Cr(VI) in the chlorate process and also clearly show that alternative approaches for chlorate synthesis need to be developed if Cr(VI) is to be removed from the process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000818995700001

However, the roles and effects of the insulator on the PEC reactions have not been clearly understood, in particular, for the nanoelectrocatalyst integrated semiconductor. In this study, we investigated the effects and ability of insulator material and thickness in terms of the stability and performance for PEC alkaline water reduction reaction by integrating nanocrystalline NiOx electrocatalyst/insulator/p-Si photocathodes. This was clearly understood by comparing the stability and performance of amorphous TiOx and SiO2. We demonstrated that the a-TiOx with low barrier height for electron transfer relative to that for hole transfer shows the ability for selective collection of photogenerated minority charge (electron) carriers. This enables a high open circuit potential while minimizing the kinetic overpotential required for electron transfer. The a-TiOx also renders excellent passivation ability for the Si surface defects, minimizing the recombination loss. In addition to these PEC performance improvements, the ability to protect completely the Si surface against corrosive electrolyte permeating through the nanocrystalline NiOx ensures long-term stability. All these abilities were maximized by optimizing the thickness of the a-TiOx (10 nm), thereby enabling the sustainable generation of a photocurrent of 10 mA/cm(2) at a high potential level of 0.3 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode). These results present design guidelines for the insulator along with methods to determine the effects of the insulator on PEC responses.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2574-0962			WOS:000510104700113

Compared with the direct calcination of mixture precursor, we obtained well-crystallized CoCuMnOx sample with high purity and sizes of 5-20 nm. Mixed valence states of transition metal elements are revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which is a desirable feature for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst. Moreover, we further investigated the electrochemical performance of CoCuMoOx for the ORR by cyclic voltammetry, rotating disk electrode and chronoamperometry test in alkaline medium. It is revealed that CoCuMoOx exhibits both outstanding catalytic activity and super stability, which are important properties for an excellent catalyst. As a result, the CoCuMoOx holds high potential as a suitable candidate for ORR catalysts of alkaline fuel cell because of its low-cost and high-efficiency.									63	6	0	0	3	0	63			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000471996400130

In this work, we present a facile template-free strategy for the synthesis of Fe,Co-N-doped porous carbon (Fe,Co-NPC) with a hierarchical porous feature. The Fe,Co-NPC was obtained by hydrothermal polymerization of o-phenylenediamine and citric acid in the presence of Fe salt and Co salt, and subsequent thermal treatment at elevated temperatures. The selective use of citric acid and Co(NO3)(2) plays a critical role in facilitating the in situ formation of a hierarchically porous carbon architecture with high surface area. The Fe,Co-NPC obtained at the pyrolysis temperature of 800 degrees C (Fe,Co-NPC-800) is demonstrated to be a highly active electro-catalyst for the ORR, with an onset potential and half-wave potential comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst in both acidic and alkaline solutions. Moreover, it also exhibits much higher stability and better methanol tolerance than commercial Pt/C. The results demonstrate that the obtained Fe,Co-NPC is a promising candidate for practical electrocatalytic applications with a simple preparation scheme and enhanced performance.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2196-0216			WOS:000410498700029

Controllable and precise surface engineering of electrocatalysts is the key challenge to enhance their performance. Herein, we demonstrate an ion-exchange strategy to produce cobalt phosphide nanowires which have a conductive core and a thickness-controlled surface layer with sulfur dopants, phosphorus vacancies, and amorphous domains. They are applied for hydrogen evolution reaction with high stability, achieving a current density of 100 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of 114 mV. Based on both comprehensive state-of-the-art experimental characterizations and theoretical investigations, the excellent catalytic performance is attributed to increased active sites, facilitated charge transfer and transport, as well as weakened H adsorption and strengthened H2O adsorption due to the synergistic effects of S dopants and P vacancies.									24	2	0	0	4	0	24			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000595105600002

The formed surface oxidation layer, which is likely to further restructure under reaction conditions, alters the chemical properties of the pristine material but has not been well studied. In this work, we for the first time use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to quantify the natural surface oxidation of transition metal phosphide and sulfide nanoparticles and employ a simplified Deal-Grove model to analyze the kinetics. We show that CoS2 oxidizes faster than CoS whereas CoP2 is more difficult to oxidize compared to CoP, and there exists an inverse correlation between the surface oxidation rate and the Co-S/P distance in the pristine structure. More inclusive investigation unveils different types of surface oxidation behavior: CoS, NiS and FeS are limited by their reactivity with oxygen; CoS2 is the most reactive and its oxidation is governed by oxygen diffusion; CoP2 is influenced by both reactivity and diffusion; CoP, Ni2P, Cu3P and MoP exhibit high initial oxidation degrees and the kinetics are not well-defined; MoS2 is largely stable against oxidation.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000593557800003

With HTT increase from 600 to 900 degrees C, the surface area gradually decreased 30.6 to 6.0 m(2) g(-1), while impurity phase was not detected for all HTrs. The specific activity for the oxygen reduction reaction was analyzed to increase with HTT up to 45.8 +/- 6.4 mu A cm(-2) at 0.8 V vs. RHE, which could be correlated with the Mn e(g) filling increase from 052 (600 degrees C) to 0.70 (900 degrees C). Therefore, the mass activity, which equals to the product of specific activity and surface area, showed maximum value (6.33 +/- 0.63 A g(-1)) at HIT of 700 degrees C. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the flow electrode slurry is poorly conductive and resulting in the high ions transport resistance, which restricts its desalination efficiency. In this work, a novel FCDI system was constructed by using the porous nickel foam (NFM) as the current collector, and its desalination performance was enhanced via the assistance of electro-catalytic water splitting. In detail, the functionalized current collectors (NFM-Co3O4 with enhanced oxygen evolution activity and NFM-Co(OH)(2) with enhanced hydrogen evolution activity) were prepared through a two-step procedure of electrodeposition and subsequently anodic reaction/cathodic reaction. A desalination efficiency of 90.22% was obtained by the FCDI system adopted functionalized NFM (F-NFM-FCDI) after 100 min operation at applied voltage of 2.0 V, which was much higher than that of the FCDI system adopted bare NFM (NFM-FCDI, 65.37%). Moreover, F-NFM-FCDI system possessed higher charge efficiency (CE) of 81.24% and lower normalized energy consumption (NEC) of 237.54 J.mmol(-1) under this condition. Mechanism analysis demonstrated that the enhancement on the desalination performance of F-NFM-FCDI system was attributed to the improved conductivity in flow-electrode chamber, which was due to the increase in the concentration of H+ and OH- caused by the enhanced electm-catalytic water splitting reaction during charging. In summary, this work provided a novel and facile strategy to improve the desalination performance of FCDI system by coupling with electro-catalytic water splitting.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000707261500009		
J	Nakano, Anna; Nakano, Jinichiro; Bennett, James								Real-time high temperature investigations of an individual natural hematite ore particle for chemical looping oxygen exchange								APPLIED ENERGY				268						114926	10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114926				JUN 15 2020	2020	In chemical looping reactors, oxygen carrier's physical and chemical properties may be continuously modified in response to reduction-oxidation (redox) cycling, affecting the oxygen exchange ability and therefore overall energy efficiency. Reports currently available on hematite's high temperature redox behaviors have been based primarily on 'bulk' material testing in thermogravimetric units or fixed-bed/fluidized bed reactors, followed by post analysis. While 'bulk' based analysis effectively provides valuable information on oxygen exchange efficiency as a whole, interpretation of oxygen carrying behaviors occurring in an 'individual' particle caused by local particle alterations would be complicated. The present work discusses oxygen exchange behaviors of an 'individual' hematite particle based on real-time surface morphology changes subjected to redox cycling. Inoperando observations were made possible by utilizing a custom-made high temperature fixed-bed reactor equipped to the confocal scanning laser microscope. The present technique revealed a unique particle expansion behavior that followed a zig-zag (up-down) pattern corresponding to each reduction and oxidation. After 10 redox cycles with 20 consecutive gas exposures, the overall volume was more than doubled, the surface area increased by 25%, and roughness increased by 4 times, resulting in meaningful alterations in the oxygen exchange capability. Reduction-oxidation transformation kinetics was accerelated at each cycle with a directional growth of the product layer over the particle surface; 1 s was long enough for a surface oxidation boundary to travel approximate to 385 mu m after the 1st cycle. The surface transformation kinetics was of 2 dimensional growth in early cycles, which quickly became 3 dimensional growth in later cycles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000537357800068		
J	Cardenas, R; Cetina, R; LagunezOtero, J; Reyes, L								Ab initio and semiempirical studies on the transition structure of the Baeyer and Villiger rearrangement. The reaction of acetone with performic acid								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A				101	2			192	200		10.1021/jp960527r				JAN 9 1997	1997	Ab initio and semiempirical calculations have been performed on the reaction mechanism of the Baeyer-Villiger reaction of acetone and performic acid. They focus, at the rate-limiting step (RLS), on the structures, energies, Mulliken charges, and what we refer to as evolution of the bond orders. The geometries of the Criegee intermediate, the methyl group migration transition state structure (TSs), and the product were found and optimized with the HF/4-21G, the HF/4-31G, and the HF/6-31G** basis sets of double-zeta quality in the ab initio methodology. AM 1, PM3, and MNDO were used in the semiempirical calculations. The correlation energies were also evaluated at the MP2/6-31G//HF/4-31G and MP2/6-31G** level of theory. A discussion dealing with the nature of the transition state structure (TSs) and its determination is presented, observing that irrespective of the method of calculation, the topology of the TSs and the general orientation of the transition vectors are invariant. From the calculations in vacuo, by using novel methodology, we find two reactive cycles: a central one, where the oxygen bonds break in close synchronicity with the methyl group migration, and a secondary one, where a proton is transferred. This proton seems to have protected the carbonyl oxygen from the attack of the methyl group. Scanning the movement of the proton, we can observe the effect that it produces on the atoms belonging to the reactive cycles and, interestingly, the lack of effect on those that do not belong to it. Finally, by using elliptic coordinates, we see that the atoms constituting both of the reactive cycles are found on ellipsoidal surfaces where the reactive centers are the foci.									30	0	0	0	4	0	30			1089-5639			WOS:A1997WL08200015

Herein, we design an electrocatalyst with active sites of isolated Co atoms coordinated with four sulfur atoms supported on N-doped carbon frameworks (Co1-S4/NC), confirmed by high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscope (HADDF-STEM) and synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. The Co1-S4/NC possesses higher hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic activity than other Co species and exceptional stability, which exhibits a small Tafel slope of 60 mV dec-1 and a low overpotential of 114 mV at 10 mA cm-2 during the HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Furthermore, through in situ X-ray absorption spectrum tests and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we reveal the catalytic mechanism of Co1-S4 moieties and find that the increasing number of sulfur atoms in the Co coordination environment leads to a substantial reduction of the theoretical HER overpotential. This work may point a new direction for the synthesis, performance regulation, and practical application of single-metal-atom catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000869694000001	36183270

The proposed technique can decrease carbon dioxide (CO2.) emissions. However, the oxidation and corrosion of the catalysts and gas diffusion layer (GDL) of the anode side remain challenging problems. The carbon fiber is used as the gas diffusion layer for PEM water electrolysis owing to its low density and porosity as well as its good conductivity even under low compression. Noble metal catalysts are coated with a micro-protective layer (MPL) on one side of the gas diffusion layer to extend the lifetime of PEM water electrolysis. The lifetime can reach over 2000 h at high current density (1400 mA cm(-2)) that is ten times longer than that of a sample coated only with carbon black (XC-72) as the microporous layer. The proposed micro-protective layer can transform active oxygen species to harmless oxygen gas and increase the catalyst's resistance to corrosion and oxidation during water electrolysis.

The two half-reactions of water splitting, that is, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), take place kinetically fast in solutions with completely different pH values. Enabling HER and OER to simultaneously occur under kinetically favorable conditions while using exclusively low-cost, earth-abundant electrocatalysts is highly desirable but remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that using a bipolar membrane (BPM) we can accomplish HER in a strongly acidic solution and OER in a strongly basic solution, with bifunctional self-supported cobalt-nickel phosphide nanowire electrodes to catalyze both reactions. Such asymmetric acid/alkaline water electrolysis can be achieved at 1.567V to deliver a current density of 10mA/cm(2) with ca. 100% Faradaic efficiency. Moreover, using an "irregular" BPM with unintentional crossover the voltage needed to afford 10mA/cm(2) can be reduced to 0.847V, due to the assistance of electrochemical neutralization between acid and alkaline. Furthermore, we show that BPM-based asymmetric water electrolysis can be accomplished in a circulated single-cell electrolyzer delivering 10mA/cm(2) at 1.550V and splitting water very stably for at least 25hours, and that water electrolysis is enabled by a solar panel operating at 0.908V (@13mA/cm(2)), using an "irregular" BPM. BPM-based asymmetric water electrolysis is a promising alternative to conventional proton and anion exchange membrane water electrolysis.									42	0	0	0	2	0	42				2637-9368		WOS:000669751300009

Herein, we report the preparation of surface-vacancy-rich PtFe interconnected nanowires as an excellent ORR catalyst. When utilized in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes, this hierarchically structured catalyst shows high mass activities at 0.9 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) (alkaline electrolyte: 3.65 A mg(Pt)(-1) and acid: 1.10 A mg(Pt)(-1)), high half-wave potential (alkaline electrolyte: 0.959 V vs. RHE and acid electrolyte: 0.924 V vs. RHE), and high stability (almost no activity loss after 10 000-cycle accelerated durability testing). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the presence of vacancies on the Pt-skin provides rich active ORR sites that can weaken the bonding strength and adsorption of O-containing intermediates. This paper presents a facile strategy to assemble efficient hierarchically structured electrocatalysts with rich surface defects for devices such as fuel cells.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000653085000001

The role of the oxygen-containing functional group on the surface of GO with different oxidation degrees have been studied for obtaining MoSx/GO with excellent electrochemical activity for HER. The electrochemical measurements show that MoSx/GO using the medium degree of oxidation of GO as matrix exhibits best electrocatalytic activity for HER with a small overpotential of similar to 195 mV at the current density of 20 mA cm(-2). A tafel slope of similar to 47.7 mV per decade is obtained for MoSx/GO modified electrode. The turnover frequency per active site is calculated. Both the amount of active sites for HER and conductivity of the electrocatalyst have been greatly improved owing to the good dispersion and conductivity provided by GO matrix. Therefore, this work suggested that choosing GO with suitable oxidation degree as support is the key for synthesizing MoSx based electrocatalysts with enhanced HER activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS				5	8			9938	9951		10.1021/acsaem.2c01604		AUG 2022		AUG 22 2022	2022	The anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) limits the process' overall hydrogen production efficiency. Studies show that nickel-iron (NiFe)-based catalysts show excellent activity toward the OER. In anode catalyst layers, electrocatalysts must be paired with anion exchange ionomers (AEI) to bind the catalyst and conduct hydroxide ions. This work covers the first investigation of the commercial Aemion AEI with a non-noble-metal Ni90Fe10 nanoparticle anode catalyst for applications in AEMWE. The effects of Aemion are also studied for the first time in a three-electrode cell and compared to the commercial Fumion and Nafion ionomers. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) results show that Aemion distinctly interacts with NiFe to suppress the Ni(OH)2/NiOOH transition peak current by 39% (vs 11 and 17% for Nafion and Fumion, respectively), thus decreasing the OER activity of NiFe with a high overpotential of 369 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH). This effect was not alleviated by prolonged CV cycling, preconditioning the electrode in KOH, stabilizing the electrode deposition, or modifying the Aemion solvent. NiFe anode catalytic layers were also prepared for AEMWE testing with varying amounts of Aemion (7, 15, 25, and 35 wt %). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the catalyst layers show catalyst-rich and ionomer-rich phases, each becoming more prominent with increasing ionomer. AEMWE testing shows that 7 wt % Aemion is the best ionomer loading, achieving a cell voltage of 1.941 V at 0.4 A cm-2 in 1 M KOH at 50 & DEG;C, 62 mV higher than our previously optimized 15 wt % Fumion anode. While less performing than Fumion, Ni90Fe10 with 7 wt % Aemion is more stable over time. Ex situ Raman spectroscopy of the spent 7 wt % Aemion electrode supports the CV results, where the electrode remains mostly in the Ni(OH)(2) phase after polarization.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000839420200001

Bimetal atom catalysts are an appealing strategy in virtue of the synergistic interaction of neighboring metal atoms, which can further improve the intrinsic HER activity beyond SACs. However, the rational design of these systems remains conceptually challenging and requires in-depth research both experimentally and theoretically. Here, we develop a dual-atom catalyst (DAC) consisting of O-coordinated W-Mo heterodimer embedded in N-doped graphene (WiMoi-NG), which is synthesized by controllable self-assembly and nitridation processes. In W1Mo1-NG, the O-bridged W-Mo atoms are anchored in NG vacancies through oxygen atoms with W-O-Mo-O-C configuration, resulting in stable and finely distribution. The W1Mo1-NG DAC enables Pt-like activity and ultrahigh stability for HER in pH-universal electrolyte. The electron delocalization of W-O-Mo-O-C configuration provides optimal adsorption strength of H and boosts the HER kinetics, thereby notably promoting the intrinsic activity.									121	2	0	0	9	0	122			2375-2548			WOS:000540787200042	32548271

However, the rational preparation of heterostructures with highly active heterosurfaces remains a challenge because of the difficulty in component tuning, morphology control, and active site determination. Herein, a novel heterostructure based on a combination of RuMo nanoalloys and hexagonal N-doped carbon nanosheets is designed and synthesized. In this protocol, metal-containing anions and layered double hydroxides are employed to control the components and morphology of heterostructures, respectively. Accordingly, the as-made RuMo-nanoalloys-embedded hexagonal porous carbon nanosheets are promising for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), resulting in an extremely small overpotential (18 mV), an ultralow Tafel slope (25 mV dec(-1)), and a high turnover frequency (3.57 H(2)s(-1)) in alkaline media, outperforming current Ru-based electrocatalysts. First-principle calculations based on typical 2D N-doped carbon/RuMo nanoalloys heterostructures demonstrate that introducing N and Mo atoms into C and Ru lattices, respectively, triggers electron accumulation/depletion regions at the heterosurface and consequently reduces the energy barrier for the HER. This work presents a convenient method for rational fabrication of carbon-metal heterostructures for highly efficient electrocatalysis.									79	2	0	0	4	0	79			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000577326900001	33063406

Electrocatalytic properties related to synergetic materials are defined. Based on the equations of the equilibrium between different types of active-sites, the effect of the active-site concentrations on the electrocatalytic properties for the HER and ORR is analysed. The equations related to the variation of the rate of reactions with the active-site concentration are presented. The dependence of the active-site concentration on the physical parameters of the support, the dispersive elements and the composite materials are indicated and the corresponding expressions are shown. The improvement in the electrocatalytic properties for the HER composite materials was then studied using the concept of surface active-sites and their related expressions. The dependence of the electrocatalytic properties of composite materials on active-site concentration, the energy levels of the supports the dispersive elements and the reaction rate is analysed.

To avoid the catalytic interference of alkali metal salts, the demineralized coal obtained from the raw coal sample was employed for the investigation in this research. The effects of reaction temperature (T-r) and H2O concentration, which were two vital factors affecting coal combustion characteristics, on the emission characteristics of fuel-N during the combustion process were also taken into consideration. Isothermal combustion tests performed under different O-2/H2O conditions (Tr: 1073 and 1473 K; O-2: 30%; H2O: 0, 3.5, 8.5, 15, 20, and 30 vol %) indicated that relatively high concentrations of N2O, HCN, and NH3 were measured in the O-2/H2O combustion of the coal sample. With the increase of Tr and H2O concentration, more fuel-N would be released in the devolatilization/volatile oxidation stage of the reaction. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results of chars after devolatilization indicated that most of the N-5 decomposed into HCN or converted to N-6 or N-Q in the early reaction stage at high temperatures and that N-Q was the dominated form of a nitrogen-containing functional group (C(N)) existing on the char particle surface. The reducibility of the chars after O-2/H2O devolatilization played vital roles in reducing the emission of NO during the whole O-2/H2O combustion process.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000476693400044

Simulations were performed over wide temperature ranges both for heat up at 300-2100 K and for NVT at 500-2100 K with a large lignin model, which contained 15920 atoms and was constructed based on Adler's softwood lignin model. By utilizing the relatively continuous observation for pyrolysate evolution in slow heat up simulations, three stages for lignin pyrolysis are proposed by pyrolysate fractions. The underlying mechanisms for the three stages are revealed by analyzing the species structure evolution and the reactions of linkages, aryl units, propyl chains, and methoxy substituents. Stage I is characterized with the complete decomposition of source lignin molecules at low temperatures dominated by breaking of alpha-O-4 and beta-O-4 linkages. The temperature in stage II is relatively high where cracking of all the linkages occurs, accompanied by conversion of propyl chains and methoxy substituents. Stage III mapping to high temperature shows the formation of heavy pyrolysates by recombination reactions of five-, six-, or seven-membered aliphatic rings. The heterocyclic oxygen-containing rings are revealed as important intermediates for the aryl monomer ring opening into aliphatic rings of five-membered, seven-membered, or even larger. The pathways for small molecule formation observed in this work are broadly in agreement with the literature. This work demonstrates a new methodology for investigating the overall behaviors and the underlying complex mechanisms of lignin pyrolysis.									83	5	0	0	3	0	86			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000374804400065		
J	JOHNSON, KE; WU, PK; SANDER, M; ENGEL, T								THE MESOSCOPIC AND MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURAL CONSEQUENCES FROM DECOMPOSITION AND DESORPTION OF ULTRATHIN OXIDE LAYERS ON SI(100) STUDIED BY SCANNING-TUNNELING-MICROSCOPY								SURFACE SCIENCE				290	3			213	231		10.1016/0039-6028(93)90705-O				JUN 20 1993	1993	The spatially inhomogeneous decomposition and desorption reaction of oxide layers with coverage 1-0.3 monolayers (ML) from a silicon (100) surface has been studied using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). After desorption, microscopic changes to the (2 x 1) reconstruction produce two variations on the dimer row reconstruction with decreased surface atom density. A (2 x n) vacancy chain reconstruction and a c(4 x 4) incomplete row reconstruction were observed; a structure for the latter is proposed. Both reconstructions are metastable, reforming the (2 x 1) reconstruction upon heating. At greater length scales during desorption from an initial 1.0 ML coverage, the mesoscopic changes to the surface structure include pitting and roughening, with up to a measured 20 fold increase in the edge density as compared to the clean Si(100) surface.These structural changes suggest a reaction mechanism involving a substantial rearrangement of the substrate silicon. From an initial 1.0 ML oxygen coverage, using measured void size distributions at total desorption levels of 13% and below - before voids have begun to coalesce - the evolution of void sizes during initial desorption can be followed. A mechanism for desorption is proposed in which silicon atoms must diffuse from adjacent clean surface area to the oxide boundary, producing a reactive complex from which SiO is desorbed. Void growth rates derived from two rate limiting cases for this desorption reaction mechanism can be compared to measured results. We show that the measured void area evolution is consistent with a reaction mechanism where the rate limiting step for monolayer desorption is the promotion of a silicon atom in a lattice site to a mobile monomer within the void.									45	0	0	0	2	0	45			0039-6028			WOS:A1993LJ32400006

The preparations differ in the content of cytochrome b(559) redox potential forms. Difference absorption spectra showed that the presence of Cu (II) induced the oxidation of the high-potential form of cytochrome b(559) in the dark. Addition of hydroquinone reduced the total oxidized high-potential form of cytochrome b(559) present in Cu (II)-treated PSII membranes indicating that no conversion to the low-potential form took place. Spectroscopic determinations of cytochrome b(559) during photoinhibitory treatment showed slower kinetics of Cu (II) effect on cytochrome b(559) in comparison with the rapid loss of oxygen evolution activity in the same conditions. This result indicates that cytochrome b(559) is affected after PSII centres are photoinhibited. The high-potential form was more sensitive to toxic Cu (II) action than the low-potential form under illumination at pH 6.0. The content of the high-potential form of cytochrome b(559) was completely lost; however, the low-potential content was unaffected in these conditions. This loss did not involve cytochrome protein degradation. The results are discussed in terms of different binding properties of the heme iron to the protonated or unprotonated histidine ligand in the high-potential and low-potential forms of cytochrome b(559), respectively.									16	1	1	0	15	1	19			0031-9317	1399-3054		WOS:000220135100019	15032831

However, there are other reactions relating to the kinetics of HOR and ORR, i.e. hydrogen adsorption and oxide formation reactions. Development of the PEMFC catalyst (mostly use Pt) requires kinetic understanding of these reactions taking place at electrodes. In present study, the HOR, ORR, hydrogen adsorption, and oxide formation taking place at Pt/H2SO4 interface were kinetically investigated in the whole potential range. Mechanistic study was performed by establishing kinetic equations from the proposed mechanism, derived to the Faradaic current density and impedance in order to fit to the experimental results. Fitting results indicated that the HOR has more kinetic activity on the Pt(110) than Pt(100) sites with the rate constants of 1.60 and 1.20 s(-1), respectively. For the Pt oxidation/reduction process, fitting results showed the fast reaction rate of ORR compared with the Pt oxidation. Additionally from the impedance fitting, the electrical parameters (solution resistance, capacitance, Warburg coefficient, constant phase element parameter) of the electrode reactions were determined to complete the interpretation of the reaction mechanisms. This study demonstrated the acquisition of the mathematical model to predict the kinetic information of an electrochemical reaction. The model can be used to predict the electrochemical behavior of any electrochemical reactions, which is benefit for the design of an electrocatalyst. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In this study, we designed and synthesized cobalt and nitrogen supported on mesoporous hollow carbon hemisphere (Co/N/HCHs) nanocomposites by a facile and economical approach. Semisphere-shaped mesoporous hollow carbon is self-generated using silica particles as template, followed by a pyrolysis-etching process; and exhibits high electrical conductivity and high specific surface. The unique porous structure of carbon provides significant number of the abundant defective sites and shortens the mass transfer pathway, leading to a greatly enhanced electrocatalytic activity with mainly 4e(-) reduction. Moreover, the synergistic effects of large electrochemically active areas and good electrical conductivity, resulting from the introduction of Co and N heteroatom, are the main reason for displaying outstanding ORR activity with a high half-wave potential of 0.8 V and the electron transfer numbers of 3.89. Furthermore, an excellent long-term stability (the current density retention of 87.0%) and superb methanol tolerance in alkaline medium are achieved. Undoubtedly, this demonstrates a potential way to strategically design the non-precious metal doped carbon catalysts for wider practical applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

This pathway proceeds via a dissociative transition state where the C-O bond cleavage precedes C1-C6 bond formation. The alternative Au(I) coordination at the vinyl pi-system produces a more stable but less reactive complex. The two least stable modes of coordination at the allenyl pi-system display reactivity that is intermediate between that of the Au(I)-oxygen and the Au(I)-vinyl ether complexes. The unusual electronic features of the four potential energy surfaces (PESs) associated with the four possible mechanisms were probed with intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations in conjunction with nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS(0)) evaluation of aromaticity of the transient structures. The development of aromatic character along the "6-endo" reaction path is modulated via Au-complexation to the extent where both the cyclic intermediate and the associated fragmentation transition state do not correspond to stationary points at the reaction potential energy surface. This analysis explains why the calculated PES for cyclization promoted by coordination of gold(I) to allenyl moiety lacks a discernible intermediate despite proceeding via a highly asynchronous transition state with characteristics of a stepwise "cyclization-mediated" process. Although reaction barriers can be strongly modified by aryl substituents of varying electronic demand, direct comparison of experimental and computational substituent effects is complicated by formation of Au-complexes with the Lewis-basic sites of the substrates.									37	0	0	0	10	0	37			0022-3263			WOS:000315707500044	23167800

Role of surface impurities in alumina samples on the recombination of oxygen atoms at high temperature								5th European Workshop on Thermal Protection Systems and Hot Structures								8 pp.	8 pp.						2006	2006	Simulations tests under atmospheric re-entry conditions are necessary to select new generation of thermal protection material for space vehicles. High temperature and low-pressure air plasma are of crucial importance to reproduce earth entry phase for spacecrafts. The MESOX set-up, that main parts are the solar radiation concentrator and the microwave-induced plasma, is an appropriate device for experiments in extreme environment. Furthermore, microwave low-pressure plasmas are very efficient sources for exciting species and high electron density production. Hence such non-equilibrium plasma together with the high temperatures and low pressures undergone by space vehicles as they get in contact with the dense layers of the atmosphere are well reproduced by the MESOX setup. New ceramic materials are necessary for the design of primary heat shields for future reusable space vehicles. The main part of the heat flux transferred to the thermal protection system of the space vehicle during the reentry phase is due to the catalytic heterogeneous recombination of oxygen atoms that is an exothermic reaction. This paper deals with some experimental results for the recombination efficiency gamma of oxygen atoms reaction and its corresponding accommodation coefficient beta on alumina surfaces using a multi-scale approach. Optical emission spectroscopy and calorimetry techniques are used to determine respectively the relative concentration profile of oxygen atoms and the heat flux transferred onto the surface. Experimental results of the recombination coefficient gamma are presented for three kind of poly crystalline alumina in the temperature range 800-2400 K at 200 Pa total pressure of air (subsonic flow). The three samples differ essentially from their impurities (sintering additives).

However, development of low-cost electrocatalyst as a replacement for Pt and RuO2 for both Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) remains a significant challenge for the production of hydrogen at a larger scale. This study presents the synthesis of non-noble metal-based lanthanum doped copper oxide nanoparticles as a potential bi-functional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in alkaline electrolyte. The optimized 1% lanthanum (La) doped CuO electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding OER and HER activity in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte posting a potential of 1.552 V vs RHE for OER and-0.173 V vs RHE for HER at a current density of similar to 10 mAcm(-2). Significantly, the functional bi-catalyst exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.6 V to achieve overall water splitting at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) along with long-term stability of 13.5 h for a cell voltage of 2.25 V at a constant current density of 30 mAcm(-2) with only 20% initial current lose after 13.5 h. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of the rare-earth element onto CuO nanoparticles has made it a viable high-end non noble electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.

Despite the promise of hydrogen gas as a new energy resource, the environmentally friendly design of viable catalysts with good morphological and size control remains a continual challenge. Of the many classes of available catalysts, metal phosphides are a low-cost and potentially accessible option as catalysts for this reaction, in comparison to the traditionally used precious-metal catalysts. However, the synthesis of metal phosphide nanomaterials currently involves the use of highly reactive phosphorus sources at high temperatures in organic solvents. Herein, we demonstrate the application of sodium phosphide as an excellent solid-state phosphorus source for the synthesis of nickel phosphide nanoparticles below 3 nm in diameter, a size range previously unheard of for the mechanochemical synthesis of metal phosphides. These nanoparticles in turn showed success for the hydrogen evolution reaction, using graphitic carbon nitride as a photocatalytic support, generating 233.9 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) of hydrogen, using broad spectrum light at room temperature after only 3 h, and being readily recyclable and reusable, without any decrease in reactivity. This mechanochemical method shows a mass intensity (MI) value over 2.5 times lower than those of traditionally used solution-based methods, even after workup and washing of the product. Upon scaling up the reaction to a 2.5 g scale, we were able to further improve the MI to 3 times lower than those of traditional solvent-based methods, while the energy demand was reduced over 18-fold.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			2168-0485			WOS:000562983600016

In this work, the Mn-doped Co3O4 porous nanosheets with 5.6 times higher response than pristine Co3O4 and short response/recovery time (55/30 s) for 100 ppm toluene gas is synthesized. More importantly, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) is conducted to investigate the gas-solid interfacial sensing mechanism over 3-Mn-Co3O4. The interfacial reaction species have been monitored, such as methylbenzene, benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, benzoic acid, carbon monoxide, and water molecule. These species originate from the elementary and overall reactions during toluene gas sensing. The dynamic evolution of surface species could be divided into three stages of adsorption reaction, reaction balance, and desorption reaction. Furthermore, combined with the density function theory simulation calculation, the gas-solid interfacial sensing mechanism over 3-Mn-Co3O4 is proposed. Toluene molecule reacts with the surface active oxygen species resulting in the occurrence of a series of elementary reactions and the generation of intermediates. The products of overall reaction are CO2 and H2O during gas sensing. Our work implements a meaningful exploration of in situ DRIFTS in gas-sensing field and provides a distinctive view to understand the gas-soild interfacial gas-sensing mechanism.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				0925-4005		WOS:000744535900005		
J	Hamdani, S; North, P; Mowlavi, N; Raboud, D; Mermilliod, JC								Chemical abundances in seven red giants of NGC 2360 and NGC 2447								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				360	2			509	519						AUG 10 2000	2000	Chemical abundances of about fifteen elements from oxygen to europium are measured in seven red giants of the two open clusters NGC 2360 and NGC 2447. The effective temperatures of the giants are determined spectroscopically by taking advantage of their known masses (similar to 2 M. in NGC 2360 and similar to 3 M. in NGC 2447) and bolometric magnitudes.The average iron abundances we obtain for the two clusters are [Fe/H]=0.07 for NGC 2360 and [Fe/H]=0.03 for NGC 2447.Evolutionary stellar model calculations are performed in the mass range 1 - 4 M. in order to analyze the surface Na and O abundances predicted after the first dredge-up. The sodium abundance shows a well defined correlation with stellar mass in the 2 - 3 M. range. The agreement between our Na abundance determinations in NGC 2360 and our model predictions at 2 M. is very good. In contrast, the overabundance in one of the three stars in NGC 2447 exceeds that predicted at 3 M. by similar to 0.08 dex, which is significant compared to the observational error bars. The effects of core overshooting, convection prescription, metallicity and nuclear reaction rates on the Na surface predictions of our models are investigated.An oxygen deficiency relative to iron by 0.2 dex is measured in our stars, in disagreement with our model predictions. Assuming that the Sun is 0.1-0.3 dex enriched in oxygen relative to neighbor stars could explain the discrepancy.									33	0	0	0	0	0	33			0004-6361			WOS:000089331400014

To examine these effects, several geopolymer samples were synthesized from two alkaline solutions and four metakaolins. The structural evolution of the formed geopolymers was investigated using FTIR spectroscopy and pH values during the material formation. The mechanical properties were measured using compression tests. The results show that the type and amount of siliceous species and non-bridging oxygen atoms control the alkaline solution reactivity. The effect of the metakaolin reactivity is more significant when it is activated with a poorly reactive alkaline solution. However, the alkaline solution governs the reaction when it is highly reactive. Therefore, the extent of depolymerization of the alkaline solution and the reactivity of metakaolin are crucial parameters that control the rate of polycondensation and the compressive strengths of geopolymer materials.

Biomass photorefinery is an emerging technology platform where biomass or its derivatives are employed as hole (h+) scavengers during photocatalysis, which not only reduces the thermodynamic barrier of the energy-demanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER, Delta E degrees =-1.23 V) in water splitting to favor H2 generation, but also endows the potential of biomass valorization. This review provides an in-depth comprehensive overview of the co-production of H2 and value-added biochemicals via lignocellulosic biomass photoreforming, with the special focuses on catalyst's struc-ture and photocatalytic system design. The photocatalyst structure is mainly elaborated from its band gap, morphology and size, crystal phase, cocatalyst and surface group modification. Among them, the band gap structure is crucial for the regulation of catalyst redox ability, which determines the high selectivity of photo -catalyst to generate the desired biochemicals. As well as the catalytic system such as pH, solvent, the concen-tration of catalyst and substrates, and the reaction temperature, matter much to enhance the solubility of lignocellulose and the accessibility of catalysts to substrates. The performance of using raw and pretreated biomass as h+ scavengers to boost H2 production as well as insights into their valorization pathways are deeply discussed. Future perspectives and challenges for the further advancement of biomass photoreforming tech-nologies are given at the end of this review.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000862145400004

The structural evolution and corresponding dynamics of NiAu bimetallic nanoparticles under ambient conditions are investigated using in situ Cs-corrected STEM and DFT calculations. During oxidization, the Au component promotes dissociation of oxygen and initiates Ni oxidization, which simultaneously drives the migration of Au atoms, thus yielding multi-shell structures (denoted by Ni@Au@NiO). The subsequent hydrogen reduction induces surface reconstruction, forming fcc-NiAu clusters. After several cycles of catalyzing CO oxidization, both inverse Au segregation and Ni recrystallization occur, which are ascribed to exothermic excitation. The results of this study can help researchers understand the evolutionary behaviors of the bimetallic nanoparticles under ambient conditions as well as optimize the structural design of bimetallic catalysts.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000344997500084	25230836

From our research, it is found that the Fe impurity in the KOH electrolyte plays an important role in achieving high OER performance. The heterostructure caused by the partial phase transformation of CoxNiyCH can enhance the conductivity and stability along with providing more effective active sites.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2052-1553			WOS:000767321500001

These corrosion processes are studied by quartz microbalance experiments, impedance measurements, transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy observations, carried out on sprayed SnO2 layers. Localized corrosion phenomena are observed and related to the reaction of radical species with the oxide surface. The extent and the morphology of the attack is shown to depend on the doping (F, Sb) of the SnO2 electrodes, the solution pH, and the concentration of chloride ions. It is also shown that because of corrosion the conduction band energy level is shifted toward much more positive potentials, allowing the SnO2 electrode to be activated for oxygen evolution.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			0013-4651			WOS:A1996TW97400021

In both cases, the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a key reaction, particularly at near-neutral pH. This study addresses the kinetic aspects of the HER in buffered near-neutral pH conditions using a variety of electrode materials (W, Ni, Pt, Au, and Cu) over a wide temperature range (299-346 K). When the overall performance was summarized with respect to the binding energy of the reaction intermediate species, a classic volcano-shaped relationship was obtained. Interestingly, the temperature sensitivity analysis disclosed that smaller activation energies did not always lead to higher performance in 1.5 mol L-1 K-phosphate solution (pH 5.8). Detailed analysis of the temperature- and potential-dependent parameters revealed that smaller activation energies coincided with smaller values of the pre-exponential factor in the Arrhenius' equation (associated with the entropy of activation). Due to the trade-off relationship of enthalpy entropy compensation in the current system, the conventional approach of mixing elements of lower and higher binding energies to the intermediate species failed: even though Ni Cu showed lower apparent activation energy, its activity toward the HER was between that of Ni and Cu due to the lowered entropy of activation. This study demonstrates the unrevealed fundamental aspects of the HER in buffered near-neutral condition, which contributes to the rational development of efficient energy and material conversion systems.									31	0	0	0	3	0	31			1932-7447			WOS:000386640800031

However, the development of earth-abundant non-noble-metal catalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction, with excellent activity and stability, remains a great challenge. In this work, the coupled hybrids of beta-Mo2C nanoparticles and porous N-doped carbon nanoplates is successfully constructed by the one-pot solution-free strategy. The hybrids exhibits high electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction with a small overpotential of 116 mV and 187 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Furthermore, the hybrids have excellent stability in not only acidic solutions but also basic solutions. The superior activity and remarkable stability originated from the N-doped carbon nanoplates supplying enough surface area, the ultrafine beta-Mo2C nanoparticles providing sufficient electrocatalytic active sites, the mesoporous structure facilitating the charge/mass transportation, and the coupling effect dropping the adsorption free energy of hydrogen. This work presents a simple and effective approach to prepare molybdenum-based materials with excellent electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen production. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

It is known that the cooperative coupling of appropriate non-noble metals exhibits excellent HER performance than a single component. Herein, an Mn-doped NiCoP flower-like electrocatalyst with self-assembled nanosheets on a nickel foam is synthesized via successive hydrothermal methods, followed by low temperature phosphidation. The as-synthesized Mn-NiCoP presents extraordinarily high catalytic activity and robust chemical stability towards the hydrogen evolution reaction in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Benefiting from the dual modulation of the morphology structure and chemical compositions, Mn-NiCoP/NF achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 37 mV for HER in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Moreover, it only requires overpotentials of 67 mV and 142 mV to deliver current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 50 mA cm(-2) in a 1 M KOH solution, respectively. Remarkably, it holds enhanced stability in 1 M KOH, maintaining HER activity for at least 120 h with negligible overpotential decay. The highly efficient and stable Mn-NiCoP electrocatalyst is valuable in applications relevant to energy storage.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000661962300001	34132316

At the same time, the rate of photosynthetic oxygen evolution in the presence of 30-200 mu M CuSO4 was reduced by no more than 20-30% of control and up to 50% of the control Delta pH value was retained. The results allow us to suppose that, in the presence of copper ions: 1) electron transport in PS2 is inhibited at the level of the secondary quinone acceptor Q(B) whose photoreduction is accompanied by proton uptake from external medium; and 2) an alternative pathway of electron transfer to terminal acceptor is activated, which provides the photooxidation of water and the formation of transmembrane proton gradient.									1	0	0	0	2	0	3			0006-3029	0006-3509		WOS:000251955600010	18225656

Schrauzers early isolation of a phosphine-stabilized [H-Co-III(dmgH)(2)P(nBu)(3)] complex has long provided circumstantial support for the plausible intermediacy of Co(III)-H species in HER by cobaloximes in solution. Our investigation of this complex has led to a reassignment of its structure as [Co-II(dmgH)(2)P(nBu)(3)], a complex that contains no hydride ligand and dimerizes to form an unsupported CoCo bond in the solid state. A paramagnetic S = 3/2 impurity that forms during the synthesis of [Co-II(dmgH)(2)P(nBu)(3)] when exposed to adventitious oxygen has also been characterized. This impurity features a H-1 NMR resonance at -5.06 ppm that was recently but erroneously attributed to the hydride resonance of [H-Co-III(dmgH)(2)P(nBu)(3)]. We draw attention to this reassignment because of its relevance to cobaloxime hydrides and HER catalysis and because Schrauzers hydridocobaloxime is often cited as the primary example of a bona fide hydride that can be isolated and characterized on this widely studied HER platform.									62	0	0	0	12	1	62			0002-7863			WOS:000353177100043	25798900

However, the short lifetime of the Pt-based binary alloy catalyst remains a significant gap between lab-scale and real-device evaluation systems, calling for the development of catalysts that do not have stability issues. Among the various catalyst systems developed as alternatives to Pt-based binary alloy catalysts, Pt-based ternary systems with an additional element to the binary systems seem to provide the much-awaited answer toward enhanced catalyst stability. Here, this progress report focuses on fundamental challenges of industrial fuel cell applications and provides broad and balanced insights on remarkable progress to date. Finally, it presents several perspectives on ideal ternary system design of efficient and robust Pt-based electrocatalysts and guidance for future development beyond the academic level.									31	1	0	0	1	0	31			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000572920800001

Unlike well-studied Bronsted acid sites for acid-catalyzed reactions, the pending question about the effectiveness and role of Lewis acid sites derived from framework-associated and/or extra-framework aluminum in selective oxidation reactions remains unanswered. Herein, tri-coordinated Al was rationally constructed via precisely tailoring acid-treatment time for ultra-stable Y zeolite, which was associated with Lewis acidity. This Lewis acid sites rather than extra-framework related Lewis acid sites were confirmed to be the catalytic active sites for oxidative desulfurization with hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. Additionally, the Al evolution mechanism and physicochemical properties for dealumination-derived samples were systematically investigated via series of techniques. The most possible tri-coordinated Al micro-structure with Lewis acidity was verified by density functional theory calculations. More importantly, the superoxide and hydroxyl radical were both the active oxygen species during the catalytic reactions. This work discloses the decisive effectiveness of framework-associated Al species with Lewis acidity in zeolites to oxidative desulfurization and paves a straightforward way for rationally designing Lewis acidic Al-zeolite catalysts.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000632996200003

The obtained activated carbon nanosheets show a multilayer sheet-like morphology with a highly porous nature and possess a very high surface area of similar to 2338 m(2) g(-1). The physiochemical analysis reveals that the catalytically active sites are associated with the prepared activated carbon nanosheets. The as-prepared activated carbon material employs as a potential metal-free electrocatalyst for H-2 production under acidic electrolyte, exhibiting superior electrocatalytic performance with a less negative onset potential of 0.08 V Vs. RHE with low over-potential (eta) response, small Tafel slope, and long-term stability. The enhanced HER activity of the developed activated carbon is attributed to high BET specific surface area, high porous nature and two-dimensional structure, employing as an encouraging impeccable metal-free HER catalyst. For the first time, we have successfully analysed and reporting an excellent electrocatalytic activity towards H-2 production by activated carbon derived from peanut shell biomass.					5th International Conference on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICONN)5th International Conference on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICONN)	JAN 28-30, 2019JAN 28-30, 2019		SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Chennai, INDIASRM Inst Sci & Technol, Chennai, INDIA	22	3	0	0	3	0	24			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000474530600078

The magnetron was equipped with a titanium target and operated in 'poisoned' mode at a frequency of 100 Hz with a pulse width of 100 mu s for a range of oxygen partial pressures, pO(2) /p(total) = 0.0-0.5. In the initial afterglow, the density of the principle negative ion in the discharge (O-) was of the order of 10(16)m(-3) for all conditions. The O- concentration was found to decay slowly with characteristic decay times between 585 mu s and 1.2 ms over the oxygen partial pressure range. Electron densities were observed to fall more rapidly, resulting in long-lived highly electronegative afterglow plasmas where the ratio, alpha = n(-)/ne, was found to reach values up to 672(+/- 100) for the highest O-2 partial pressure. By comparing results to a simple plasma-chemical model, we speculate that with increased pO2 /ptotal ratio, more O(-)ions are formed in the afterglow via dissociative electron attachment to highly excited metastable oxygen molecules, with the latter being formed during the active phase of the discharge. After approximately 2.5 ms into the off-time, the afterglow degenerates into an ion-ion plasma and negative ions are free to impinge upon the chamber walls and grounded substrates with flux densities of the order of 10(18)m(-2) s(-1), which is around 10% of the positive ion flux measured during the on-time. This illustrates the potential importance of the long afterglow in reactive HiPIMS, which can act as a steady source of low energy O-ions to a growing thin film at the substrate during periods of reduced positive ion bombardment.									25	1	0	0	0	0	25			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000337722000008

However, the Li2MnO3 activation pathway and the CEI formation process are still controversial. Here, the first-cycle properties of xLi(2)MnO(3)-(1-x) LiNi0.3Co0.3Mn0.4O2 (x = 0, 0.5, 1) cathode materials were studied with an in situ electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM). The results demonstrate that a synergistic effect between the layered Li2MnO3 and LiNi0.3Co0.3Mn0.4O2 structures can significantly affect the activation pathway of Li1.2Ni0.12Co0.12Mn0.56O2, leading to an extra-high capacity. It is demonstrated that Li2MnO3 activation in Li-rich materials is dominated by electrochemical decomposition (oxygen redox), which is different from the activation process of pure Li2MnO3 governed by chemical decomposition (Li2O evolution). CEI evolution is closely related to Li+ extraction/insertion. The valence state variation of the metal ions (Ni, Co, Mn) in Li-rich materials can promote CEI formation. This study is of significance for understanding and designing Li-rich cathode-based batteries.									23	6	0	0	1	0	24			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000466988800116	30951277

Cost-efficient generation of hydrogen from water splitting through electrocatalysis holds tremendous promise for clean energy. Central to electrocatalysis are efficient and robust electrocatalysts composed of earth-abundant elements, which are urgently needed for realizing low-cost and high-performance energy conversion devices. Transition metal compounds (TMCs) are a group of attractive noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The incorporation of foreign nonmetal atoms into TMCs is a way of controllable disorder engineering and modification of their electronic structure, and thus may realize the synergistic modulations of both activity and conductivity for efficient HER performance. In the last few years, the interest in binary-nonmetal TMCs as an efficient HER electrocatalyst has grown exponentially owing to their fascinating electronic structure and chemical properties. Here, we sum up the recent developments of binary-nonmetal TMCs in HER electrocatalysis from the viewpoint of their tunable physicochemical properties. In addition, we identify major challenges ahead in this area and refine viable strategies and future research directions that will effectively address the said challenges.									115	6	0	0	3	0	114			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000397608000002

As a result, the spatially heterogeneous concentrations of an analyte of interest can be converted in real time into a map of sample reactivity. However, this can only be achieved upon optimization of the analytical performance ensuring adequate sensitivity. Here, we present the evaluation and optimized operation of the SBECM for the detection of small changes in local O-2 concentrations. Parameters for achieving an improved sensitivity as well as possibilities for improving the signal-to-noise ratio in the optical signal readout are evaluated. The capability of the SBECM for O-2 detection is shown at controlled conditions by recording the topography of a patterned sample and monitoring O-2 evolution from a photoelectrocatalyst material.

Electrochemical methods have become increasingly recognized as capable of achieving these goals, and "impact" electrochemistry, with the advantages associated with dynamic nanoelectrodes, has recently emerged as a prime candidate for the recovery of metals from solution. In this report, the nanoimpact technique is used to generate carbon-supported palladium catalysts from low-concentration palladium(II) chloride solutions (i.e., a waste stream mimic) as a proof of concept. Subsequently, the catalytic properties of this material in both synthesis (Suzuki coupling reaction) and electrocatalysis (hydrogen evolution) are demonstrated. Transient reductive impact signals are shown and analyzed at potentials negative of +0.4 V (vs SCE) corresponding to the onset of palladium deposition in traditional voltammetry. Direct evidence of Pd modification was obtained through characterization by environmental scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis of impacted particles. This showed the formation of deposits of Pd0 partially covering the 50 nm carbon black particles with approximately 14% Pd (wt %) under the conditions used. This material was then used to demonstrate the conversion of iodobenzene into its biphenyl product (confirmed through nuclear magnetic resonance) and the successful production of hydrogen as an electrocatalyst under acidic conditions (under cyclic voltammetry).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000866446100001	36179328

However, the studies on the application of the photocatalytically degraded dye-polluted water and the multi-purpose use of one type of catalyst have remained sparse. In this report, we try to demonstrate a concept of multiple and cyclic application of materials and resources in environmentally relevant catalyst reactions. A magnetic composite catalyst prepared from exfoliated titania nanosheets, graphene, the magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, and a polyelectrolyte enabled such a cyclic application. The composite catalyst decomposed a methylene blue-polluted water under visible light, and then the catalyst was collected and removed from the treated water using a magnet. The photocatalytically treated water was then used to prepare the electrolyte in electrochemical reductive reactions and presented superior electrochemical performance compared with the dye-polluted water. The composite catalyst was once again used as the cathode catalyst in the electrochemical reaction. Each component in the composite catalyst was indispensable in its catalytic activity, but each component played different roles in the photochemical, magnetic recycling, and electrochemical processes. We expect the report inspire the study on the multi-functional catalyst and cyclic use of the catalytically cleaned water, which should contribute for the environmental and energy remedy from a novel perspective.									14	0	0	0	4	0	14			2045-2322			WOS:000411648500070	28947830

It involves the binding of two water molecules, the removal of four electrons and four protons from the Mn-complex/substrate-water entity, O-O bond formation, and dioxygen release. Basic aspects of the reaction cycle of the Mn complex of PSII are discussed: (1) Kok's classical S-state cycle and the corresponding experimental paradigm; (2) recent observations on the (still) enigmatic S-4 state; (3) sequence and characteristics of electron transfer and proton release; (4) a basic nine-step reaction cycle involving eight steps of alternating deprotonation and oxidation of the Mn-complex prior to O-O bond formation and dioxygen release; (5) the energetic constraints of water oxidation in PSII and their mechanistic consequences. In the second part it is considered how the suggested nine-step reaction cycle possibly is realized at the atomic level: (i) studies on synthetic Mn complexes suggest that deprotonation of mu-hydroxo bridges or formation of new mu-oxo bridges could facilitate successive oxidation steps without prohibitive potential increase. (ii) Current structural models of the PSII Mn complex derived from X-ray absorption spectroscopy and/or protein crystallography are discussed. (iii) Structural and oxidation-state changes of the Mn complex are related to the basic nine-step reaction cycle. (iv) As a framework for mechanistic models at the atomic level, we propose that water is oxidized only after the accumulation of four bases which function as proton acceptors in the dioxygen formation step.

If found, the genuine solution will go a long way to shift the paradigm from the current fossil-based economy to hydrogen-based one. The article at hand prima facie focuses on one of the most promising solutions to the aforementioned problem namely water splitting-more specifically so by harnessing the electrochemical properties of the material. While many options exist to furnish electricity for carrying out the water splitting but the cost compatibility with the other contemporary candidates poses the real bottleneck. The idea over here is to efficiently utilize the hitherto non-conventional methods of energy generation to efficiently and cost effectively achieves water splitting for the subsequent applications. As regards the current trends in water splitting, recent advances include carrying out water splitting by incorporating the visible portion alone from the available light. The resulting hydrogen may then subsequently be employed as a fuel input for different applications. Routes ranging from using advanced catalysis and even artificial photosynthesis are also being considered.					1st International Conference on Sustainable Energy and Environmental Challenges (SEEC)1st International Conference on Sustainable Energy and Environmental Challenges (SEEC)	FEB 26-28, 2017FEB 26-28, 2017	Int Soc Energy & Environm Sustainabil; Ctr Innovat & Appl Bioprocessing; Govt India, Dept Sci & Technol; TSI; Tesscorn; AVL; Horiba; SpringerInt Soc Energy & Environm Sustainabil; Ctr Innovat & Appl Bioprocessing; Govt India, Dept Sci & Technol; TSI; Tesscorn; AVL; Horiba; Springer	Mohali, INDIAMohali, INDIA	7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2522-8366	2522-8374	978-981-10-7551-3; 978-981-10-7550-6	WOS:000436596200008

In this field, substantial progress has been witnessed during the past years, and self-standing electrode represents a remarkable milestone. A series of problems associated with common powder catalysts, including insufficient active sites exposure, limited mass transfer, easily peeling off, etc., can be solved by the construction of self-standing electrode. However, there is still room for further performance enhancement. Therefore, the latest achievements and challenges on the design of advanced self-standing electrodes for water electrolysis is summarized in this review. Firstly, we outline the methods for controllable synthesis of self-standing electrodes. Then, particular attention is paid to the adopted strategies for tuning the structure and surface electron configuration of the electrodes, as well as the related performance enhancement mechanisms. Finally, remaining challenges and future perspectives for development of advanced self-standing electrodes for water electrolysis are concluded.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2196-0216			WOS:000782518900001

Pt-based nanowires have better durability and catalytic activity. Hollow nanowires reduce Pt consumption and thus save cost. In this paper, PtCo hollow nanowires with well-controlled ultrathin wall thicknesses of 2-4 nm have been synthesized by electrospinning, annealing and dealloying. To the best of our knowledge, these are the thinnest walls yet achieved by the use of electrospinning. The mechanism of hollow nanowire evolution is studied. It is found that the reduction temperature is crucial for the retention of the hollow structure.

In this study, dopamine served as both carbon-nitrogen source and green reagent, which cannot only form N-doped carbon layers encasing metal nanoparticles through high-temperature roasting but also co-reduce metal ions to form NiPd alloy. The rGO@NiPd@NC nanocomposite exhibits enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with a small overpotential of 56 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope approaching 33 mV dec(-1) in acidic aqueous media, which are similar to the HER activity of commercial Pt/C catalyst (52 mV at j = 10 mA cm(-2); Tafel slope, 31 mV dec(-1)). Additionally, the electrocatalyst which reveals excellent electrochemical stability is reflected in that the polarization curve shows negligible difference after 1000 cycles and the current density only slightly decreases within 20 h test, providing more possibilities for practical application in the future.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000504156600001		
J	Fu, Xiaowei; He, Zhijun; Zhang, Junhong								Catalytic Effect of Alkali Metals on the Gasification Dissolution Reaction and Deep Reaction Behavior of Metallurgical Cokes								ACS OMEGA											10.1021/acsomega.2c04716		OCT 2022			2022	In this paper, the deep reaction behaviors of tamping and top-charging cokes with different K2CO3 and Na2CO3 contents were investigated and the evolution of the functional group structure and the carbon structure of coke with the extension of the deep reaction was clarified. The results showed that the deep reaction gasification of coke steadily increased with the K2CO3 and Na2CO3 content. However, the catalytic effect of different contents of K2CO3 seemed to be stronger than that of different contents of Na2CO3. Meanwhile, the catalytic effect of alkali metals on the gasification reaction of tamping coke was more significant. The gasification dissolution of coke gradually decreased from the outside to the inside of the particle with the extension of the deep reaction, while the catalytic effect of K2CO3 and Na2CO3 seemed to be more dramatic on surface of the coke particle. In contrast, the gasification dissolution reaction on the surface of tamping coke was more severe; consequently, the surface pore area of tamping coke was much higher than that of top-charging coke. According to the variations in the functional group structure of cokes, aromatic hydrocarbon gradually became the dominant functional group in the coke structure with the extension of the deep reaction. The above variation led to a gradual decrease in the reactivity of coke, though the decomposition reactions of oxygen-containing functional groups in coke were promoted to some extent by the addition of K2CO3. With the extension of the deep reaction of coke, amorphous carbon was gradually transformed into sequential carbon.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-1343			WOS:000876182000001

Herein, we report on a unique strategy to prepare Fe-Co-N-C-x (x refers to the pyrolysis temperature) electrocatalysts which involves anion-exchange of [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) into a cationic Co-II-based metal-organic framework precursor prior to heat treatment. Fe-Co-N-C-900 exhibits an optimal ORR catalytic performance in an alkaline electrolyte with an onset potential (E-onset: 0.97 V) and half-wave potential (E-1/2: 0.86 V) comparable to that of commercial Pt/C (E-onset=1.02 V; E-1/2=0.88 V), which outperforms the corresponding Co-N-C-900 sample (E-onset=0.92 V; E-1/2=0.84 V) derived from the same MOF precursor without anion-exchange modification. This is the first example of Fe-Co-N-C electrocatalysts fabricated from a cationic Co-II-based MOF precursor that dopes the Fe element via anion-exchange, and our current work provides a new entrance towards MOF-derived transition-metal (e.g. Fe or Co) and nitrogen-codoped carbon electrocatalysts with excellent ORR activity.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000462924600010	30724472

A wide variety of sulfides already achieve impressive catalysis, but further development could be enabled by an understanding of the relative activities of different sulfur sites. To contribute towards a better understanding, the small molecule dimer [Mo2O2S8](2-), which is rich in terminal and unsaturated sulfur, has been investigated for HER. Homogeneous catalysis has been attempted in acidified DMF but is precluded by electrodeposition. The resulting deposit ultimately proves to be an active heterogeneous HER catalyst in aqueous acid and is compared to dropcasts of the molecular dimer which are also HER catalysts. XPS elucidates the end structures of the electrodeposits and dropcasts showing a shift away from molecular features in both cases. Investigation of HER performance reveals that the activity of both dimer-based heterogeneous catalysts lags behind that of other reported molybdenum sulfides. However, detailed performance comparisons allow for consideration of key design parameters. Density functional theory calculations are presented for the reduced molecular dimer as well as possible molecular catalytic pathways. These give insight into the cathodic structural transformations of the dimer as well as the observation of heterogeneous but not homogeneous catalysis.[GRAPHICS].									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2523-3963	2523-3971		WOS:000532834300106

Small palladium nanoparticle were homogeneously anchored onto Mn3O4@rGO substrate through the reduction of palladium salt. The interpenetrating network architecture of Mn3O4@rGO greatly inhibited the aggregation of 2D sheets of Mn3O4 and rGO, and the open 3D orientation of the Mn3O4 rGO hybrid nanosheets on the electrode facilitated both mass transport and electron transfer as well as maximally exposed active sites. The introduction of Mn3O4 enhanced the structural and electrochemical stability of rGO. The as-synthesized Pd/Mn3O4 rGO hybrid was employed as an electrocatalyst for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The electrocatalyst showed a low overpotential of 20 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 48.2 mV dec(-1), and a large exchange current density of 0.59 mA cm(-2). Importantly, the catalyst possessed superior durability with 85.87% of catalytic activity after a long-time test (10 h).

When complex oxides are engineered as thin films, their chemical and physical properties can be modified to be markedly different from their bulk form, providing additional degrees of freedom in materials design. In this review, we survey the landscape of strain-induced design of complex oxides in the context of oxygen electrocatalysis and ferroelectricity. First, we identify the role of strain in influencing oxide electronic properties, driven by the combination of modification of B-O bond length and octahedral distortion in perovskites. We describe electronic structure parameters, such as the O 2p-band center, that quantitatively capture these electronic changes, highlighting the broad influence of the O 2p-band center on surface reactivity (oxygen adsorption and dissociation energy) and bulk defect energetics (oxygen vacancy formation and migration energy). Motivated by the promise of the influence of strain on material properties relevant for oxygen electrocatalysis and ferroelectricity, we describe the advances in state-of-the-art thin-film fabrication and characterization that have enabled a high degree of experimental control in realizing strain effects in oxide thin-film systems. In oxygen electrocatalysis, leveraging strain has not only resulted in activity enhancements relative to bulk unstrained material systems but also revealed mechanistic influences of oxide phenomena, such as bulk defect chemistry and transfer kinetics, on electrochemical processes. Similarly for ferroelectric properties, strain engineering can both enhance polarization in known ferroelectrics and induce ferroelectricity in material systems that would be otherwise non-ferroelectric in bulk. Based on understanding of a diverse range of perovskite functionalities, we offer perspectives on how further coupling of strain, oxygen electrocatalysis, and ferroelectricity opens up pathways toward the emergence of novel device design features with dynamic control of increasing complex chemical and high-performance electronic processes.									110	3	0	0	3	0	111			1369-7021	1873-4103		WOS:000499663200020

Here, we report a universal strategy for the fabrication of single-atom (Cu, Co, and Fe) incorporated hollow nano-spheroids of nitrogen-deficient carbon nitride frameworks (CuSA@HNCNx. The interconnected three-dimensional 3D porous and hollow robust single-atom spheroid frameworks display a high surface area of 1286 m(2) g(-1), favorable electronic structure, local chemical coordination, effective density of active sites (Cu-N-x pyridinic, graphitic C-N etc.), and mass transport pathways. The obtained CuSA@HNCNx exhibited outstanding bifunctional reversible electrocatalytic activity and robustness for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR half-wave potential of 0.91 V, OER overpotential of 1.55 V at 10 mA cm(-2), Delta E = 0.64 V, 5000 cycles), outperforming benchmarked Pt/C and RuO2. Electrocatalytic activity towards ORR/OER was analyzed by n-band center correlation using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, reversible alkaline Zn-air batteries with the designed CuSA@HNCNx cathode illustrated a high power 212 mW cm(-2), high energy density 1031 Wh kg(zn)(-1), and excellent discharge-charge cycle life of 1800 cycles for 300 h @10 mA cm(-2) with voltaic efficiency of 64.51 %. Notably, all-solid-state flexible ZABs showed long cycle life of 250 h with 1500 cycles at 25 mA cm(-2) with efficiency of 66.31 %. This unique strategy offers controlled design of entangled single-atom frameworks as advanced cathodes for next-generation energy storage technology.									65	6	0	0	5	0	66			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000521513300019

Porous phosphorized CoNi2S4 yolk-shell spheres (P-CoNi2S4 YSSs) were rationally designed and synthesized by a combined hydrothermal sulfidation and gas-phase phosphorization strategy. Benefiting from the strengthened Ni3+/Ni2+ couple, enhanced electronic conductivity, and hollow structure, the P-CoNi2S4 YSSs exhibit excellent activity and durability towards hydrogen/oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions in alkaline solution, affording low potentials of -0.135 V, 1.512 V, and 1.306 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Remarkably, when used as the anode and cathode simultaneously, the P-CoNi2S4 catalyst merely requires a cell voltage of 1.544 V in water splitting and 1.402 V in urea electrolysis to attain 10 mA cm(-2) with excellent durability for 100 h, outperforming most of the reported nickel-based sulfides and even noble-metal-based electrocatalysts. This work promotes the application of sulfides in electrochemical hydrogen production and provides a feasible approach for urea-rich wastewater treatment.									54	0	0	0	4	0	54			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000694648200001	34351663

In this work, a facile one-step method was put forward to synthesize WC/NC composite. Due to the couple effect of KCl/NaCl salt and dicyandiamide, pure WC phase was obtained at 900 degrees C. Meanwhile, KCl/NaCl salt eliminated the runaway pyrolysis expansion of glucose. Besides contributing to the special surface area, dicyandiamide as N source significantly alleviated W mass loss trigged by KCl/NaCl salt and ensured the appropriate WC content in WC/NC composite. As a HER electrocatalyst in acid media, WC/NC composite exhibits the small overpotential of 156 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the low Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1), as well as the robust stability. This work offers a feasible option to fabricate low-cost and effective transition metal carbide electrocatalysts on a large-scale for hydrogen evolution reaction.

At first, inverse opal macroporous Sb doped SnO2 (ATO) microparticles with defined pore size, composition, and open-porous morphology are synthesized that reach a conductivity of approximate to 3.6 S cm(-1) and are further used as catalyst support. ATO-supported iridium catalysts with a controlled amount of active material are prepared by solvothermal reduction of an IrOx colloid in the presence of the porous ATO particles, whereby homogeneous coating of the complete outer and inner surface of the particles with nanodispersed metallic Ir is achieved. Thermal oxidation leads to the formation of ATO-supported IrO2 nanoparticles with a void volume fraction of approximate to 89% calculated for catalyst thin films based on scanning transmission electron microscope tomography data and microparticle size distribution. A remarkably low Ir bulk density of approximate to 0.08 g cm(-3) for this supported oxide catalyst architecture with 25 wt% Ir is determined. This highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction catalyst reaches a current density of 63 A g(Ir)(-1) at an overpotential of 300 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode, significantly exceeding a commercial TiO2-supported IrO2 reference catalyst under the same measurement conditions.									66	0	0	0	2	0	66			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000492384200001

Films possess nanocrystalline walls and feature locally ordered pores of about 16 rim diameter. Analysis of the film properties by SEM, TEM, EDX, XPS, SAXS, XRD, and BET along the thermal treatment that succeeds dipcoating shows that the polymer template is removed by calcination between 200 and 300 degrees C, accompanied by uniaxial shrinkage of film and pore system perpendicular to the substrate. Treating the film in excess of 450 degrees C leads to further growth of crystallite size and loss of surface area progressing gradually with increasing calcination temperature. Templated IrO2 films conditioned at 450 degrees C show substantially reduced electrocatalytic overpotentials (efficiency increases) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared to those of untemplated coatings. Pore templating thus enables direct control over surface catalytic properties of iridium oxide.									135	3	0	0	7	0	136			0897-4756			WOS:000292417600013

Within this context, mixed-metal oxides have recently emerged as the highest performing OER catalysts. Their structural and compositional modification to further boost their activity is crucial to the wide-spread use of electrolysis technologies. In this work, we investigated a series of mixed-metal F-containing materials as OER catalysts to probe possible benefits of the high electronegativity of fluoride ions. We found that crystalline hydrated fluorides, CoFe2F8(H2O)(2) and NiFe2F8(H2O)(2), and amorphous oxyfluorides, NiFe2F4.4O1.8 and CoFe2F6.6O0.7, feature excellent activity (overpotential for 10 mA cm(-2) as low as 270 mV) and stability (extended performance for >250 hours with similar to 40 mV activity loss) for the OER in alkaline electrolyte. Subsequent electroanalytical and spectroscopic characterization hinted that the electronic structure modulation conferred by the fluoride ions aided their reactivity. Finally, the best catalyst of the set, NiFe2F4.4O1.8, was applied as anode in an electrolyzer comprised solely of earth-abundant materials, which carried out overall water splitting at 1.65 V at 10 mA cm(-2).									29	4	0	0	0	0	30			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000490984300025	32055307

The electrode can attain an anodic current density of 20 mAcm(-2) at a low overpotential of 338 mV, comparable to that of state-of-the-art RuO2 nanocatalysts supported on CP (CP/RuO2) with the same catalyst loading. Significantly, CP@Ni(OH)(2) shows much better long-term stability than CP/RuO2 upon continuous galvano-static electrolysis, particularly at a high industry-relevant current density such as 100 mAcm(-2). CP@Ni(OH)(2) can sustain water oxidation at 100 mAcm (2) for 50 h without any degradation, whereas the performance of CP/RuO2 is much poorer and deteriorates gradually over time. CP@Ni(OH)(2) electrodes hold substantial promise for use as low-costing water oxidation anodes in electrolyzers.									73	1	0	0	2	0	73			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000398188200008	28052617

In this organic-rich aquifer, we observe both oxygen reducing zones and iron reducing zones whose boundaries are roughly constant over time. To investigate the apparent steady state between solute fluxes and redox reaction rates, we develop a reactive transport model of carbon oxidation. We use a "quasi-kinetic," "partial-equilibrium" approach to modeling redox reactions, a hybrid approach between traditional equilibrium approaches and fully kinetic approaches that require large computer resources. Our model suggests that observed trends in redox sensitive elements can only be explained by oxidation rates that are both dependent on the predominant electron acceptor and are spatially variable, Our coupled models provide field-based estimates of redox kinetics, which are otherwise difficult to obtain in hydrologically complex systems.									28	0	0	0	8	0	28			0043-1397			WOS:000077393000030

Intensive interest has been mainly focused on designing MoS2 nanostructures with large amounts of active edge sites and fast charge transfer. Here we report the synthesis of vanadium and nitrogen co-doped MoS2 on reduced graphene oxide with new defect sites on the basal/edge planes and expanded interlayer spacing, which shows remarkable catalytic merits with an extremely low overpotential of 68 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1). Its performance is superior to most current MoS2 electrocatalysts. In addition to the charge transfer benefits of the RGO substrate, the vanadium and nitrogen dopants trigger defect sites on the basal/edge planes, and an optimized electronic structure and expanded interlayer distance are also responsible for the enhancement in catalysis. This contribution may offer a potential way to design advanced MoS2 catalysts by modulating the defect sites and interlayer distance for efficient electrochemical water splitting.									29	2	0	0	2	0	29			2052-1553			WOS:000445217200002

The clean AuNPs transform the electrocatalytic inert HOPG into an active surface for hydrogen peroxide electroreduction, causing a lowering of the cathodic overpotential of 0.25 V with respect to the Au(111) surface. Compared to the plain gold substrates, the nanostructures promote only a slight increase in the hydrogen evolution reaction. In a second modification step a similar to 1 nm thick melanin-iron coating is electrochemically formed around the AuNPs. This ultrathin melanin-iron coating largely improves the catalytic activity of the bare AuNPs for both hydrogen peroxide electroreduction and hydrogen evolution reaction. This strategy, which integrates electrochemistry and nanotechnology, can be applied to the preparation of efficient "naked'' AuNPs and organic-iron capped AuNPs catalysts.									17	0	0	0	3	0	17			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000289306900053	21321759

However, the limited stability of silicon in acidic electrolyte requires the use of protection strategies coupled with catalysts. Herein, spin coating is used as a versatile method to directly coat silicon photoanodes with an IrOx oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, reducing the processing complexity compared to conventional fabrication schemes. Biphasic strontium chloride/iridium oxide (SrCl2:IrOx) catalysts are also developed, and both catalysts form photoactive junctions with silicon and demonstrate high photoanode activity. The iridium oxide photoanode displays a photocurrent onset at 1.06 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), while the SrCl2:IrOx photoanode onsets earlier at 0.96 V vs RHE. The differing potentials are consistent with the observed photovoltages of 0.43 and 0.53 V for the IrOx and SrCl2:IrOx, respectively. By measuring the oxidation of a reversible redox couple, Fe(CN)(6)(3-/4-), we compare the charge carrier extraction of the devices and show that the addition of SrCl2 to the IrOx catalyst improves the silicon-electrolyte interface compared to pure IrOx. However, the durability of the strontium-containing photoanode remains a challenge, with its photocurrent density decreasing by 90% over 4 h. The IrOx photoanode, on the other hand, maintained a stable photocurrent density over this timescale. Characterization of the as-prepared and post-tested material structure via Auger electron spectroscopy identifies catalyst film cracking and delamination as the primary failure modes. We propose that improvements to catalyst adhesion should further the viability of spin coating as a technique for photoanode preparation.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000512216900070	31971770

Simultaneous growth of the YFeO3 and Y3Fe5O12 ternary phases was observed on Y2O3-Fe2O3 couples, whereas only the YFeO3 phase grows on YFeO3-Y3Fe5O12 and Y2O3-gas-Fe2O3 couples. The growth rates were determined by layer thickness measurements on couples reacted at 1220, 1300 and 1352 degrees C in air and at 1403 degrees C in oxygen for limes ranging from 8 to 256 h. The growth kinetics is parabolic in all cases. Based on a model for growth of multiple layers, the intrinsic parabolic growth constants were calculated from the apparent experimental rate constants. In the case of Y3Fe5O12 growth, the intrinsic rate constants were compared with those predicted by Wagner's theory. The probable mechanism is the equidirectional coupled diffusion of O2- and Y3+ ions. Gas phase transport of iron, in the form of Fe(OH)(2), becomes important above 1300 degrees C.

Herein, we report reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/Ag/Fe-doped TiO2 that has been successfully prepared using a simple process. The resulting composites were characterized by a wide range of physicochemical techniques. The photocatalytic activities of the composite materials were studied under visible light supplied by a 35 W Xe arc lamp. The rGO/Ag/Fe-doped TiO2 composite demonstrated excellent degradation of methylene blue (MB) in 150 min and 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) in 210 min under visible light irradiation, and trapping experiments were carried out to explain the mechanism of photocatalytic activity. Moreover, electrochemical studies were carried out to demonstrate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity on rGO/Ag/Fe-doped TiO2 in 1 M of H2SO4 electrolyte, with a scan rate of 50 mV s(-1). The reductions in overpotential are due to the d-orbital splitting in Fe-doped TiO2 and rGO as an electron collector and transporter.									36	0	0	0	6	0	36				2046-2069		WOS:000425034000037	35540418

The hollow structure of PtNix alloy was confirmed by TEM and STEM. Photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction was performed for PtNix/CdS catalyst under 300 W Xe lamp (lambda >= 420 nm). It is noteworthy that PtNi0.5/CdS shows the highest hydrogen evolution activity of 2.9 mmol/h with QE = 51.24% at 420 nm, which is higher than that of situ-photodeposited Pt onto CdS (0.57 mmol/h). The enhancement of hydrogen evolution performance of PtNi0.5/CdS could be attributed to the porous shell and hollow structure of PtNi0.5 NPs, as well as the strong electronic coupling effect between Pt and Ni. Besides, the sheet structure of CdS in some degree promoted the hydrogen production rate. Therefore, the PtNix HNPs could be a promising cocatalyst of CdS for solar driven hydrogen evolution.

Also, the rapid depletion of fossil fuels leads to an energy crisis & environmental concern, because of this, economic stress is created for the people of the world. To overcome these, water splitting is sustainable and renewable energy, but it requires active electrocatalysts. The nanostructure material morphology characterization was investigated by the, XRD, EDS, SEM, HRTEM, EELS chemical composition maps through & XPS which properly reveal the nanocomposite materials morphology strongly aggregates. The materials exhibit outstanding OER response as compared to Co3O4 & manganese sulfide due to the synergetic effect produced in the composite materials including fast charge transport from MoSOX, active sites & high density of Co3O4, which accelerates the OER kinetics. Between the composites, Co3O4-MoSOX with the greatest amount of Co3O4 (S4 0.7g) content owns the lower overpotential to produce OER kinetics & having a 60 mV dec(-1) and Tafel slope of as compared to other material. Further, for the exchange of current density of 2.97 x 10(-3)A/cm(2) & it is extremely durable for 45 h. The EIS ensure the fast charge transport for the extra addition of pristine S4 (0.7g) in the composite, which potentially enhanced the production of the OER kinetics activity. In this regard transition metal oxide especially, Co3O4 is promising material, but it requires certain strategies to improve its catalytic kinetics activity & stability for the full water splitting. Keeping these challenges, the proposed study is of great concern to economical and societal needs, which can lead to a boost in the electrochemical applications in particular oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, rapid efforts must be made to realize the nonprecious catalysts for water splitting and equality compete with the world in the hydrogen/electron economy.

A set of experiments were preformed in order to study the effect of operating conditions (current density, residence time, hydrodynamics and chloride concentration) on distribution and concentration of electrolysis by-products. As a comparison experiments were also performed using a commercial DSA anode. A simple mathematical model was formulated, and the model predictions agree with the experimental data in a wide range of experimental conditions. The results of this work showed that at low chloride concentrations electrolysis with BDD anode produce a mixture of powerful oxidant: low current density, high mass transfer conditions and low residence time were found as optimal conditions to maximize the concentration of oxidants and minimize the concentration of chlorates. The proposed reaction mechanism may also justify the controversial effect of chloride ions in wastewater treatments: the electrolysis carried out with BDD anodes and electrolyte containing chloride concentration higher 1 g/L could meet the target of the process only if the active chlorine is effective in oxidation of the pollutant that must be removed.

In the present study, the stabilizing effect of argon dilution in acetylene/oxygen detonations is investigated numerically by detailed numerical simulations of one-dimensional time-dependent pulsating detonations with a realistic seven-step chemistry model. The results show that heavy argon dilution in the mixture leads to single-frequency small-amplitude regular oscillations of the shock front pressure. As the dilution is decreased, the detonations become unstable, characterized by larger amplitude oscillations. The stabilizing role of argon is further investigated by analyzing the reaction zone structure of the steady Zeldovich-Von Neumann-Doring detonation with varying degrees of argon dilution. For the same characteristic induction lengths, the dilution with argon leads to lower temperatures in the reaction zone and slower exothermic reaction rates, thus rendering the reaction zone structure less temperature sensitive and more stable to hydrodynamic fluctuations.The present unsteady numerical simulations also indicate that with argon dilution less than approximately 70%, a one-dimensional time-dependent detonation cannot self-propagate. Below this limit, due to the low-velocity excursions of the pulsating leading shock, the reactions are quenched and detonation failure occurs. This fundamental limit reveals that a one-dimensional shock-induced ignition mechanism in an unstable detonation is insufficient to account for the ignition and propagation mechanism in multidimensional detonations. These observations are consistent with recent experiments performed in porous wall tubes where, as the transverse waves were eliminated, the detonation could not self-sustain in the one-dimensional limit. The experimental stability limit, at which the transverse waves begin to play the dominant role, also corresponding to the loss of regularity in the cellular pattern, agrees very well with the stability limit determined numerically in the present study.					29th International Combustion Symposium29th International Combustion Symposium	JUL 21-26, 2002JUL 21-26, 2002		HOKKAIDO UNIV, SAPPORO, JAPANHOKKAIDO UNIV, SAPPORO, JAPAN	56	7	1	0	0	0	63			1540-7489	1873-2704		WOS:000182866500172

The characterization results showed that the precursor (hexagonal Zn-5(OH)(8)Cl-2 center dot 2H(2)O disk) played a key role in the morphology evolution of ZnO during the early stage of the growth process and that the disks tended to stack together layer by layer in both directions (up and down) to form prismoid, prism and pyramid structures with the increase in pH value from 7 to 10. After calcination, the corresponding hexagonal ZnO microstructures were obtained. This structure evolution resulted in the weakening dominance of the (0001) plane in the total exposed crystal facets. Furthermore, despite the similar specific surface areas of the four hexagonal ZnO microstructures, the gas sensing properties of the sensors based on these microstructures deteriorated sequentially. At a working temperature of 330 degrees C, the ZnO disk with the most exposed (0001) plane showed the highest gas response toward ethanol, which was nearly 2, 3, and 6 times higher than those of the prismoid, prism and pyramid structures, respectively. This superior gas sensing performance strongly depends on the predominantly exposed polar facets (0001), which can provide more active sites for oxygen adsorption and subsequent reaction with the detected gas than other apolar facets. It demonstrates that the (0001) crystal facet plays a significant role in the gas sensing behavior of ZnO. This research will bring some inspiration to researchers for the fabrication of a high performance ZnO gas sensor as well as other metal oxides.									75	2	1	0	4	0	77			1466-8033			WOS:000339627700032

They can be developed from metal organic frameworks (MOFs) with abundant structure-variety, in which a controlled pyrolysis is desired to rationalize nanostructure and maximize catalytic activity. Herein, the efficient regulation is proposed for the first time on the carbon-shell of MOFs-derived Co@NC nanocomposites via varying temperature and flow-rate during pyrolysis, enabling the good accessibility and the electronic optimization of active Co cores. With moderated temperature and flow-rate, the resulting ultrathin carbon-shell, on the one hand, renders Co cores easily accessible to electrolytes and, on the other hand, promotes the electronic penetration to optimize metallic Co active sites. As expected, the optimal Co@NC affords the benchmarking performance of noble-metal-free electrocatalysts in hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions, featured by the low overpotentials, the striking kinetic metrics, and the outstanding long-term stability. Elucidating the feasibility to design efficient electrocatalysts via controlled MOFs pyrolysis, this work will open up new opportunities for the development of cost-effective materials in the energy field.									46	2	0	0	3	0	46			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000414506600024	29028301

Formate and syngas are two typical products of electrochemical CO2 reduction, and the coproduction of these two products will maximize the energy efficiency of CO2 conversion. However, few works have successfully achieved the cogeneration of formate and syngas. This paper describes a novel strategy to maximize the efficiency of CO2 conversion through coproduction of formate and syngas on ultrasmall SnO2 nanodots (NDs) homogeneously anchored on carbon nanotubes (CNT#SnO2 NDs) electrodes. The CNT#SnO2 NDs not only decreased the adsorption energy of *OCHO but also reduced the adsorption energy difference of *COOH and *H. High energy efficiency toward formate and adjustable H-2/CO ratio were obtained over a broad potential window with long-term stability. In addition, CNT#SnO2 NDs and Ir foil were coupled together to construct an electrolyzer for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (CO2ERR-OER), which also produced formate and syngas with 24 h stability. A promising approach is presented for the electrochemical CO2 conversion in fuel production.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000524303200001	32175685

The assembly of the Mn4O5Ca requires light and involves a sequential process called photoactivation. This process harnesses the charge-separation of the photochemical reaction center and the coordination environment provided by the amino acid side chains of the protein to oxidize and organize the incoming manganese ions to form the oxo-bridged metal cluster capable of H2O-oxidation. Although most aspects of this assembly process remain poorly understood, recent advances in the elucidation of the crystal structure of the fully assembled cyanobacterial PSII complex help in the interpretation of the rich history of experiments designed to understand this process. Moreover, recent insights on the structure and stability of the constituent ions of the Mn4CaO5 cluster may guide future experiments. Here we consider the literature and suggest possible models of assembly including one involving single Mn2+ oxidation site for all Mn but requiring ion relocation.									57	0	0	0	39	0	57			1664-462X			WOS:000375246500001	27200051

The Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5 were got by typical oxygen evolution model coating ingredient(mole ratio of Ir to Ta was 7:3) and the sides of Titanium were examined by using electrochemical workstation.This text results indicated that the interfacial thickness varied from 462nm to 792nm with the increase of holding time and increased from 396nm to 1.25mum with temperature rising. Under the same condition of hot-pressing diffusion welding,the thickness of diffusion interface layer with aluminum sheets by previous cold rolling (1.25mum) is thicker than non-cold rolling(924nm),increasing by 35.28%. Ti-AI laminated composite anodes by using hot-pressing diffusion welding showed better performances than the industrial titanium.The oxygen evolution anode showed the best performance by holding at 833 K for 2h under the pressure of 6MPa.This will play a role in the energy saving.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1022-6680			INSPEC:12776607

However, current strategies are largely restricted to intrinsically layered materials. Herein, a combinatorial self-regulating acid etching and topotactic transformation strategy is developed to unprecedentedly prepare vertically stacked ultrathin 2D nonlayered nickel selenide nanosheets. Due to the inhibited hydrolyzation under acidic conditions, the self-regulating acid etching results in ultrathin layered nickel hydroxides (two layers). The ultrathin structure allows limited epitaxial extension during selenization, i. e., the nondestructive topotactic transformation, enabling facile artificial engineering of hydroxide foundation frameworks into ultrathin nonlayered selenides. Consequently, the exquisite nonlayered nickel selenide affords high turnover frequencies, electrochemical surface areas, exchange current densities, and low Tafel slopes, as well as facilitating charge transfer toward both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. Thus, the kinetically favorable bifunctional electrocatalyst delivers advanced and robust overall water splitting activities in alkaline intermediates. The integrated methodology may open up a new pathway for designing other highly active 2D nonlayered electrocatalysts.									166	8	0	0	10	0	167			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000435713600013

In this work, we report a single-atom Fe-1/NC catalyst, where the Fe-N-x moiety works as the active site, for high-efficiency alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Fe-1/NC electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 111 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), with a Tafel slope of 86.1 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that, under the working states, the Fe- support interaction weakened as the Fe-N coordination number and Fe oxidation state decreased. As such, the evolved single-atom Fe site with more d electrons provides a favorable structure for boosting HER performance. This work gives insight into the structural evolution of the active site under the alkaline HER and provides a strategy for the design of non-noble metal electrocatalysts.									19	0	0	0	0	0	17			1948-7185			WOS:000563737900032	32787221

The metallic 1T'-MoS2 phase, which is stabilized via the adsorption or intercalation of small molecules or cations such as Li, shows exceptionally high HER activity, comparable to that of noble metals, but the effect of cation adsorption on HER performance has not yet been resolved. Here we investigate in detail the effect of Li adsorption and intercalation on the proton reduction properties of MoS2. By combining spectroscopy methods (infrared of adsorbed NO, Li-7 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, and X-ray photoemission and absorption) with catalytic activity measurements and theoretical modeling, we infer that the enhanced HER performance of LixMoS2 is predominantly due to the catalytic promotion of edge sites by Li.									28	0	0	0	2	0	28			2380-8195			WOS:000475827900031	31328171

By contrast, LixCoO2, LixNiO2 and LixMn2O4 (x<1) are metastable and liberate oxygen when they are heated in air or in inert gas. The temperature at which oxygen evolution occurs depends on x and on the material. Using thermal gravimetric analysis and mass spectrometry, we have studied the thermal decomposition of these materials in inert gas. We find that the nickel materials are least stable, the manganese compounds are most stable, and that the cobalt compounds show intermediate behaviour. These results have important consequences for the safety of Li-ion cells, and suggest that cells using LiMn2O4 as the cathode should be safer than those using LiNiO2 or LiCoO2.									608	44	1	0	7	0	643			0167-2738			WOS:A1994PE55900009

In this study, sub-nanometer "raft"-like PtNx clusters were synthesized on a TiO2 support, and the significant enhancement effects of the Pt-N coordination structure on the performance of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are demonstrated. In acidic media, the PtNx catalyst display a superior HER activity (37.5 A mg(-1) Pt) and turnover frequencies (37.9H(2) s(-1)) at overpotential of 50 mV; outperforming commercial Pt/C by a factor of 13.3 and 3.9, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results reveal that the charge transfer occur from the N to the neighboring Pt atoms when the hydrogen is adsorbed on N atoms; such a charge redistribution within Pt-N coordination structure leads to a smaller H* free energies on the activated N atoms, and is believed to account for the higher HER activity.									32	4	0	0	2	0	33			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000560077800008

In particular, efficient catalysts for the demanding oxygen evolution reaction present a major challenge. As a contribution to this field, tailored mesoporous hard template materials based on manganese phthalocyanine were prepared. The preparation method proved to be crucial to achieve suitable physicochemical properties as a basis for high catalytic activity. The materials show overpotentials between 490 and 590 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) This can be mainly attributed to efficient graphitization, high Mn dispersion and tailored oxidation states.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000428087400003

It was found that after 1 h immersion at 1350 degrees C in a stagnant molten slag, the CaO and MgO in doloma react with SiO2 and FeO in the slag forming dicalcium silicate (2CaO.SiO2 or C2S), MgO-rich magnesiowustite ((Fe,Mg)O), and dicalcium ferrite (2CaO.Fe2O3 or C2F). The formation of (Fe,Mg)O and C2F breaks up the C2S layer, leaving it discontinuous. Similar reactions take place in dolomite, but at a later stage of dissolution since they are retarded by the intermediate decomposition of dolomite in which rapid CO2 gas evolution quenches the resulting C2S layer and forms a fap between the resulting doloma and slag. A more complete and continuous dicalcium silicate layer was observed in dolomite compared with doloma.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			0967-9782			WOS:000085062600001

Deficiency in B-O bond covalency induced by lattice distortion severely restricts the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance for ABO(3)-type perovskite oxides. Herein, a rearrangement of hybridization mode for B-O bond is used to tune the overlap of the electron cloud between B 3d and O 2p through A-stie doping with larger radius ions. The B-O bond covalency is strengthened with a B-O-B bond angle recovered from intrinsic structural distortion. As a result, the adsorption and the reduction process for O-2 on the oxide surface can be promoted via shifting the O-2p band center toward the Fermi Level. Simultaneously, the spin electrons in the Mn 3d orbit become more parallel. It will lead to a high electrical conductivity by the enhanced double exchange process and thereof mitigate the ORR efficiency loss. Further density functional theory calculation reveals that a flat [BO2] plane will make contribution to the charge transfer process from lattice oxygen to adsorbed oxygen (mediated with B ions). Through such exploration of the effect of crystal structure on the electronic state of perovskite oxides, a novel insight into design of highly active ORR catalysts is offered.									28	1	0	0	0	0	28			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000477762400008	30427576

Generation and transport of liquid-phase reactive species due to plasma-liquid interaction								2016 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)								1 pp.	1 pp.		10.1109/PLASMA.2016.7534294				2016	2016	Summary form only given. Medical applications of atmospheric-pressure plasmas (APP s) in ambient air at room temperature have been widely studied because of APPs' ability to provide reactive oxygen / nitro gen species (RONS) to living tissues. Although the effectiveness of plasma-based therapies for some types of medical treatments has been widely reported, it has not been clear yet how such plasmas interact with living cells and tissues and what specific chemical spices contribute to the observed therapeutic effects. In an attempt to address such questions, we have performed numerical simulations of chemical reactions and transport of reactive species in liquid exposed to a low-temperature APP. The governing equations that we have employed for this study are reaction-diffusion-advection equations coupled with Poisson equation. For the sake of simplicity, we only consider pure water as the solvent. The rate constants, mobilities, and diffusion coefficients are obtained from the literature. The gaseous species are given as boundary conditions and time evolution of the concentrations of these chemical species in pure water is solved numerically as functions of the depth in o ne dimension. In addition to the case where the water surface is irradiated by a plasma, we have also experimentally examined the case where a plasma is generated in water by nano-second high voltage discharges. The results of both numerical simulations and discharge experiments will be presented.					2016 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)2016 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)	19-23 June 201619-23 June 2016		Banff, AB, CanadaBanff, AB, Canada	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-1-4673-9601-1	INSPEC:16211666

Here, an efficient strategy was established for the concurrent H-2 production and oxidative alcohols refining into value-added formate by utilizing self-supported Ni2P-CoP bifunctional electrocatalysts. Benefiting from high intrinsic activity, abundant active sites, and synergistic promoting effects of bimetallic phosphides, the constructed two-electrode electrolyzer required a cell voltage of around 1.3 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), which is more than 200 mV lower than that of pure water splitting. Moreover, simultaneous productions of H-2 with near-unity conversion efficiency and formate at high faradaic efficiencies of 99.8 and 89.6 % oxidatively produced from methanol and glycerol, respectively, were achieved with excellent durability.

The results involving the effects of laser beam power and scan rate are examined. Voltammetric anodic charge was maximized by the combination of 15 W beampower, focal distance of 210 mm and beam scan rate of 35 mm s(-1). By cycling potential between 0.2 and 1.1 V vs SCE the oxide coating behaved as a capacitor capable of being charged and discharged reversibly and the cathodic/anodic charge ratio remained close to one.

The results of voltammetries show that with all the electrode materials, in the potential region before oxygen evolution, the oxidation of MO involves simple electrode transfer that produces a polymeric film that deactivates the electrode surface, as confirmed by Fourier Transform Infrared Reflection-Absorption Spectroscopy (FTIRRAS) analysis. A very different behaviour was observed among the electrodes in the region of water decomposition. While BDD and PbO2 regained their initial activity by simple polarisation at 2.3 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE) due to the production of high amount of hydroxyl radicals that destroy the polymeric film, TiRuSnO2, GC and gold cannot be completely reactivated, because they have a low overpotential for oxygen evolution, and this secondary reaction is favoured over polymer mineralization. The results of bulk electrolysis showed that after 3 h of polarisation at 10 mA cm(-2), complete colour and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal were obtained only with BDD anode. Using PbO2 MO was oxidised but a residual COD remains in the solution, while TiRuSnO2 permitted only a partial oxidation of MO.									38	1	0	0	6	1	39			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000362335900031

This requires days or even weeks of high temperature treatment, and consumption of large amounts of energy. We employed spark-plasma sintering, an engineering technique that is used for high-speed consolidation of powders with a pulsed electric current passing through the sample to carry out the fluorination of niobium oxide in minute intervals. The approach saves time and large amounts of waste energy. Moreover, it allows the preparation of fluorinated niobium oxides on a gram scale using poly(tetrafluoroethylene) ((R) Teflon) scrap and without toxic chemicals. The synthesis can be upscaled easily to the kg range with appropriate sintering equipment. Finally, NbO2F and Nb3O7F prepared by spark plasma sintering show significant photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) oxygen evolution from water in terms of photocurrent density and incident photon-to-current efficiency (% IPCE), whereas NbO2F and Nb3O7F prepared by conventional high temperature chemistry show little to no PEC response.

The heat from the laser raised the bulk temperature of the sample through heat transfer from the hot electron to the crystal lattice of the material, which then led to the melting of the top layer of the film. This process resulted in the hot melt reacting ambient oxygen, which in turn oxidized the surface of molybdenum coating. The topological study and morphology of the oxidized film was conducted using high-resolution scanning electron microscope, with micrographs taken in both the cross-sectional geometry and normal incidence to the electron beam. The molybdenum oxide nanorods were clearly observed and the x-ray diffraction patterns showed the diffraction peaks due to molybdenum oxide. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, Ni0.85Se, MoS2 and their composite Ni0.85Se/MoS2 with different mole ratios are prepared successfully, as electrocatalysts to catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water splitting. The result shows that MoS2/Ni0.85Se with a molar ratio of Mo/Ni = 30 (denoted as M30) has the best catalytic performance towards HER, with the lowest overpotential of 118 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), smallest Tafel slope of 49 mV.dec(-1) among all the synthesized materials. Long-term electrochemical testing shows that M30 has good stability for HER over at least 30 h. These results maybe due to the large electrochemical active surface area and high conductivity. This work shows that transition metal selenides and sulfides can form effective electrocatalyst for HER. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This reaction was analyzed in alkaline and acid media by a non-linear regression procedure together with mechanistic considerations. The derivations of the kinetic equations were based on a Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism with a different rate determining step for each surface. On Pt/Ni electrodes an apparent activation energy of 56 kJ mol(-1) was obtained while on Pt/Hg this value increases up to 204 kJ mol(-1). Such difference was analyzed as a change in the nature of the activated complex formed as intermediate of the reaction. The greater affinity existing between H and Ni facilitates the adsorption step on Ni surfaces, resulting in the Heyrovsky step to be the rate determining one, with an activated complex of the type (Ni-H...H...OH)*. On Hg, the adsorption is more difficult and the Volmer step becomes determining with the species (Hg...H...H2O+)* being the activated complex. The rate constant values for each step were determined by a non-linear regression procedure. In this work, the utilization of ultramicroelectrodes and the special methodology used to conditioning the surface brought important contributions to the interpretation of experimental results by avoiding the influence of ohmic drop and bubbles evolution on the surface, thus increasing the reproducibility of the experiments.

The electrochemical measurements indicate that the Ni3S2-Co9S8/NCA as a quintessential electrocatalyst exhibits excellent OER performance, which has outperformed most transition metal sulfide (TMS) catalysts in alkaline environments, as attested with a lower overpotential of 337 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a smaller Tafel slope of 77 mV dec(-1). Meanwhile, a Zn-air battery based on Ni3S2-Co9S8/NCA + Pt/C achieves a large power density of up to 256 mW cm(-2) (and 193 mW cm(-2)), small charge/discharge voltage gap, and good cycling stability, notably better than the conventional RuO2 + Pt/C-based Zn-air batteries. These excellent electrocatalytic properties are mainly attributed to the distinct hierarchical porous structure and interfacial synergy between the Ni3S2 and Co9S8 nanoparticle structure with rich defects, facilitating the mass transport and high graphitization degree beneficial for electron mobility. It is envisioned that the research provides a novel approach for the exploration of marine biomass as an electrocatalyst.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0743-7463			WOS:000812031900001	35650513

Here, a hybrid of nitrogen-doped carbon encapsulated Mo2C nanodots on Ti3C2Tx MXene (Mo2C/Ti3C2Tx@NC) is developed through in situ polymerization of dopamine and a Mo precursor on the Ti3C2Tx MXene surface. During the annealing treatment, the polydopamine plays multiple roles in forming N-doped carbon, confining MoO42- ions into ultrasmall Mo2C nanodots, and stabilizing the MXene flakes against spontaneous oxidation. The as-synthesized hybrid exhibits excellent HER activity in acidic electrolyte with an overpotential of 53 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability over 30 hours. The combination of experiments and simulations demonstrates that pyridinic N-doped carbon coated Mo2C nanodots serve as the active sites and Ti3C2Tx MXene facilitates the charge transfer, synergistically contributing to the superior HER performance.									89	4	0	0	7	0	89			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000526936600008

Effects of nanostructured nickel hydroxide powder on the electrochemical performance of pasted nickel electrodes								Chinese Journal of Power Sources				28	3			170	2, 176						March 2004	2004	Nanostructured nickel hydroxide powder had been synthesized by an aqueous solution chemical precipitation method, and the structural characteristics of the synthesized material were analyzed by SEM, XRD and BET. The pasted foam-nickel electrodes had been prepared with a mixture of the nanostructured and spherical Ni (OH)2 powders as the active material. Constant current charge/discharge tests, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to characterize the electrochemical performances of the pasted nickel electrodes. The experimental results show that in comparison with that of the spherical Ni (OH)2 electrode, the nickel electrodes with the addition of the nanostructured Ni-(OH)2 exhibit better performances in the charge efficiency, discharge specific capacity, active material utilization, discharge voltage, resistance to swelling with cycling and high-rate capability. These superior performances can be attributed to the higher reaction activity, lower electrochemical impedance and higher oxygen evolution potential for the nanostructured nickel hydroxide electrodes.									1	3	0	0	0	0	3			1002-087X			INSPEC:8215825

Si is the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust and can absorb a significant fraction of the solar spectrum while presenting little toxicity risk, making it an attractive material for photocatalytic H(2)production. Hydrogen-terminated mesoporous Si (mp-Si) nanoparticles can be utilized to effectively drive the hydrogen evolution reaction using UV-to-visible light. In this work, the response of the photocatalytic activity of mp-Si nanoparticles to a series of HF acid treatments was investigated. A two-step magnesiothermic reduction method was used to prepare crystalline mp-Si nanoparticles with a specific surface area of 573 m(2)g(-1). The HF etching process was optimized as a function of the amount of acid added and the reaction time. The reaction time did not influence the H(2)evolution rate substantially. However, the amount of HF used did have a significant effect on the photocatalytic activity. In the presence of >= 1.0 mL HF acid per 0.010 g of Si, morphological damage was observed using electron microscopy. N(2)adsorption measurements indicated that the pore size and surface area were also altered. Solution-phase(19)F{H-1} NMR studies indicated the formation of SiF(5)(-)and SiF(6)(2-)when larger volumes of HF were used. Both factors, morphological damage and the presence of byproducts in the pores, likely result in a lowering of the photocatalytic H(2)evolution rate. Under the optimized HF treatment conditions (0.5 mL of HF per 0.010 g of Si), a H(2)evolution rate of 1398 +/- 30 mu mol g(-1)h(-1)was observed.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000547895100011	32108185

Herein, we report a novel and environmentally friendly strategy for synthesis of graphene-wrapped iron carbide (Fe7C3) nanoparticles supported on hierarchical fibrous N-doped graphene with open-mesoporous structures (Fe7C3/NG) by simply annealing the mixture of melamine, iron (II) phthalocyanine (FePc) and Fe2O3. The effects of the pyrolysis temperature and the molar ratio of FePc to melamine were critically examined in the controls. Remarkably, the Fe7C3/NG obtained at 800 degrees C (i.e. Fe7C3/NG-800) manifested the forward shifts in the onset potential (0.98 V) and half-wave potential (0.85 V) with respective to commercial Pt/C (50 wt%) in 0.1 M KOH, coupled with the great enhancement in the durability (still remained 92.11% of its initial current density even after 40,000 s) and strong methanol tolerance.

Designing and constructing non-noble metal composite bifunctional electrocatalysts for promoting both the cathodic hydrogen evolution (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reactions (OER) is clearly of great importance for EWS. Thus, the chemical composition and morphology of cobalt-nickel bimetal phosphide (Ni, Co)2P nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube hollow microspheres (NCNHMs) can regulate the redox-active sites and enhance the electron transfer, resulting in superior splitting efficiency. Contributing to the synergistic effects between highly active Co-Ni bimetal phosphide NPs and NCNHMs, the obtained Co-Ni bimetal phosphide/NCNHMs display remarkable electrochemical performance for water splitting compared with Ni2P/NCNHMs. Therefore, the Ni1.4Co0.6P/NCNHMs catalysts achieved through a nitriding-phosphidation strategy derived from a hollow Ni-1.4-Co-0.6-based metal organic framework (MOF) exhibit superior HER catalytic activity (87.9 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) tested in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 64.4 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) tested in 1 M KOH) and OER catalytic activity (320.0 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) tested in 1 M KOH). The Ni1.4Co0.6P/NCNHMs deliver excellent water-splitting catalytic activity (1.55 V at 10 mA cm(-2) tested in 1 M KOH), which is competitive with that of current non-noble metal electrocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations and related experimental results suggest that the electron transfer from Co doping and coating with NCNHMs improves the electronic states, which would enhance the binding strength with H-bonds and then promote the electrocatalytic activity.									22	1	0	0	3	0	22			1948-7185			WOS:000537432500024	32320249

From the calculation we can see the catalytic ability has an opposite trend with the adsorption capacity. H coverage was found to affect WN catalytic activity obviously, however has no effect on MoN and WC. Comparing with the experiments, we inferred that although the top site has the strongest potential catalytic ability, the actual catalytic site for HER is hollow1 site. Some specific transition metal doping (Ni > Fe > Mn > W for MoN, Fe > Co for WN, Ni > Co > Fe> Mn for WC) may indirectly improve the HER catalytic performance. It is worth noting that applying a certain strain (e.g. 2.5% tensile strain for MoN, 5% compressive strain for WN, WC) is helpful for improving the HER catalytic performance. Our work is instructive for HER catalyst development in terms of doping and strain. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Porous conducting polymers are attractive materials which not only provide a high surface area for electrocatalysis but also absorb light which can be harnessed in photoelectrocatalysis. Here, a novel and inexpensive electrochemical approach is developed to obtain nanoporous conducting copolymers with tunable light absorbance and porosity. By fine-tuning the copolymer composition and upon heat treatment, an excellent electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was achieved in alkaline solution with an overpotential of just 77 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Such an overpotential is remarkably low compared with other reported values for polymers in an alkaline medium. The nanoporous copolymer developed here shows a great promise of using metal-free electrocatalysts and brings about new avenues for exploitation of these porous conducting polymers.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000525335700001

Journal of functional biomaterials				2	4			414	24		10.3390/jfb2040414				2011 Dec 16	2011	OxyVita Hb is a new generation hemoglobin based oxygen carrier (HBOC) produced through modification of a zero-linked polymerization mechanism using activators which incorporate cross-linked bovine tetramer hemoglobin into "super-polymeric" macromolecules (Average molecular weight = 17 MDa) for the purpose of oxygen delivery when whole blood or packed red cells are not available. This molecular design approach was generated in order to address several fundamental biochemical and physiological weaknesses of previous generations of HBOCs. Observation during pre-clinical and clinical studies provided evidence that these early generation acellular HBOCs were directly associated with loss of retention within the circulatory system, extravasation across endothelial tissue membranes due to their small molecular size leading to arterial and venous vasoconstriction with coupled increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP). The inherent increase in molecular size and structural stability of the OxyVita Hb is a direct response to addressing these serious weaknesses that have occurred during the evolution of HBOC development within the past two decades. The nature of the zero-linked synthetic route eliminates any chemical linkers remaining in the product, eliminating side reaction concerns, such as reversibility and decomposition due to weak chemical bonds, dependency on temperature and pressure, and residual toxicity.									9	0	0	0	6	0	9			2079-4983			MEDLINE:24956452	24956452

Herein, we present a powerful approach to boost the HER performance of porous PdIr bimetallene through N-doping, which can effectively modulate the electronic structure and induce the strain effect of the designed N-doped porous PdIr bimetallene (N-PdIr bimetallene). The porous N-PdIr bimetallene exhibits superior all-pH HER activity and stability. To generate a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the required overpotential for the porous N-PdIr bimetallene is 26, 34 and 59 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M KOH and 1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS), respectively, which outperform those of commercial Pt/C. The proposed N-doping approach is a very powerful strategy for boosting metallene electrocatalytic performance, beyond the HER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000768720400001

Novel hydrogen-doped SrSnO3 perovskite with excellent optoelectronic properties as a potential photocatalyst for water splitting								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				47	42			18321	18333		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.04.055				MAY 15 2022	2022	Developing and designing novel electrodes for photocatalytic water splitting using computational analysis has become a crucial interest recently through bulk and surface calculations of the investigated materials. Doping wide band gap metal oxides has proven to be an efficient method for optical properties enhancement and band gap engineering. Herein, first-principles calculations were employed to investigate the possibility to engi-neer the optical and structural properties of SrSnO3 perovskite as a potential catalyst for photo-driven hydrogen production. Specifically, the synergistic effect of hydrogen doping and oxygen vacancies (OV) on the optoelectronic properties of SrSnO(3 )was for the first time investigated and discussed in detail. The interstitial hydrogen defects (Hi) are energetically favorable compared with the substitutional hydrogen defects. Mono-and co-hydrogen occupied oxygen vacancies sites were further examined. Interstitial hydrogen doping was found to introduce a shallow defect state below the conduction band minimum (CBM) forming a band tailing and increasing the dielectric constant. Thus, it could be used in gate dielectric applications. The created defect states upon doping were found to depend directly on the defect site and the defect concentration. At high concentration of oxygen vacancies defect, the HOV-OV structural configuration showed localized and shallow defect states with a band gap of 1.3 eV below the CBM. It also considerably increased the dielectric constant with optical absorption enhancement, compared to the pristine SrSnO(3 )counterpart. With optimum Gibbs free energy of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and theo-retical band gap straddling of the oxygen and hydrogen evolution potentials, low exciton binding energy, and high permittivity, the HOV-OV structure is an ideal novel candidate catalyst for photocatalytic water splitting.

Here, we report a rational design of air cathode using a cobalt nitride (Co4N) functionalized carbon nanofiber (CNF) membrane as current collector-catalyst integrated air cathode. Brush-like Co4N nanorods are uniformly anchored on conductive electrospun CNF papers via hydrothermal growth of Co(OH)F nanorods followed by nitridation step. Co4N-decorated CNF (Co4N/CNF) cathode exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with outstanding stability for over 177 cycles in Li-O-2 cells. During cycling, metallic Co4N nanorods provide sufficient accessible reaction sites as well as facile electron transport pathway throughout the continuously networked CNF. Furthermore, thin oxide layer (<10 nm) formed on the surface of Co4N nanorods promote reversible formation/decomposition of film-type Li2O2, leading to significant reduction in overpotential gap (similar to 1.23 V at 700 mAh g(-3)). Moreover, pouch-type Li-air cells using Co4N/CNF cathode stably operated in real air atmosphere even under 180 degrees bending. The results demonstrate that the favorable formation/decomposition of reaction products and mediation of side reactions are hugely governed by the suitable surface chemistry and tailored structure of cathode materials, which are essential for real Li-air battery applications.									176	6	0	0	9	0	176			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000423495200014	29178775

In the present study, we examined the catalytic activity of Ru-based cocatalysts for IO3- reduction to improve the efficiency of O-2 evolution on a TaON photocatalyst under visible light with an IO3- acceptor, which is an important half component in Z-scheme water splitting systems. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses and electrochemical measurements revealed that the calcination temperature in the loading of Ru species from aqueous RuCl3 significantly affected the catalytic activity for the reduction of IO3-. Calcination at or below 200 degrees C produced Ru(OH) xCly species that drastically enhanced the reduction of IO3-, whereas that at 300 degrees C generated conventional RuO2 that showed lower activity for IO3- reduction than Ru(OH) xCly but considerably enhanced the water oxidation. Coloading the Ru(OH) xCly and Co cation species as water oxidation cocatalysts significantly improved O-2 evolution on the TaON photocatalyst by more than a factor of two compared to that loaded with only the conventional RuO2 cocatalyst. This suggests the effectiveness of co-loading two different cocatalysts that are independently optimized for reduction and oxidation.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2398-4902			WOS:000422783100008

Herein, bimetallic CuCo2S4 nanosheets were created by a new molecular precursor route. The optimal CuCo2S4 catalyst demonstrates superior performance to catalyze the OER with excellent stability, which was confirmed by the low overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. The catalytic activity can be maintained for at least 40 h. The catalyst after the OER was then detected. The results indicate that S-doped CoOOH/CuO nanosheets formed on the catalyst surface during the OER may act as the catalytic active substance. Furthermore, when employed as an air cathode in a Zn-air battery, it reveals a high open-cycle potential of 1.38 V and a peak power density of 123.9 mW cm(-2). The performance of the rechargeable Zn-air battery is close to that fabricated with commercial precious metal-based electrocatalysts. These findings would furnish some guidelines for the design, development, and applications of bimetallic sulfide electrocatalysts for the OER.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000648429200063	33861926

Herein, we develop a facile and universal strategy, quenching, to precisely tailor the surface chemistry of metal oxide nanocatalysts by rapidly cooling them in a salt solution. Taking NiMoO4 nanocatalysts an example, we successfully produce the quenched nanocatalysts offering a greatly reduced oxygen evolution reaction ( OER) overpotential by 85 mV and 135 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2) respectively. Through detailed characterization studies, we establish that quenching induces the formation of numerous disordered stepped surfaces and the near-surface metal ions doping, thus regulating the local electronic structures and coordination environments of Ni, Mo, which promotes the formation of the dualsite active and thereby affords a low energy pathway for OER. This quenching strategy is also successfully applied to a number of other metal oxides, such as spinel-type Co3O4, Fe2O3, LaMnO3, and CoSnO3, with similar surface modifications and gains in OER activity. Our finding provides a new inspiration to activate metal oxide catalysts and extends the use of quenching chemistry in catalysis.									30	0	0	0	0	0	30			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000696018700018	34449218

Here, a nanostructured RuO2/Co3O4-RuCo-EO electrode is designed via magnetron sputtering combined with electrochemical oxidation for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline medium. The optimized RuO2/Co3O4-RuCo-EO electrode with a Ru loading of 0.064 mg cm(-2) exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 220 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 59.9 mV dec(-1) for the OER. Compared with RuO2 prepared by thermal decomposition, its overpotential is reduced by 82 mV. Meanwhile, compared with RuO2 prepared by magnetron sputtering, the overpotential is also reduced by 74 mV. Furthermore, compared with the RuO2/Ru with core-shell structure (eta = 244 mV), the overpotential is still decreased by 24 mV. Therefore, the RuO2/Co3O4-RuCo-EO electrode has excellent OER activity. There are two reasons for the improvement of the OER activity. On the one hand, the core-shell structure is conducive to electron transport, and on the other hand, the addition of Co adjusts the electronic structure of Ru.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000634931200001	35423785

However, developing highly active catalysts for OER at near-neutral pH is desirable for many photoelectrochemical/electrochemical devices. In this paper, we systematically studied the activity and stability of well-known perovskite oxides for OER at pH 7. Previous activity descriptors established for perovskite oxides at pH 13, such as having an eg occupancy close to unity or having an O p-band center close to Fermi level, were shown to scale with OER activity at pH 7. Stability was a greater challenge at pH 7 than at pH 13, where two different modes of instability were identified from combined transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory analyses. Perovskites with O p-band close to Fermi level showed leaching of A-site atoms and surface amorphization under all overpotentials examined at pH 7, while those with O p-band far from Fermi level were stable under low OER current/potential but became unstable at high current/potential accompanied by leaching of B-site atoms. Therefore, efforts are needed to enhance the activity and stability of perovskites against A-site or B-site loss if used at neutral pH.									89	0	0	0	4	0	89			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000360448300015	26271910

Herein, we find that an unconventional p-d orbital coupling exists in the interface between the N-C layer and CoP of the core-shell structured N-C@CoP, leading to a near-zero hydrogen adsorption energy of 0.16 eV. The doped N heteroatoms in carbon layer decrease the electrons on the adjacent C atoms, thus activating these C atoms as active sites for HER. Moreover, the activated three carbon atoms can interact with the Co atom in CoP, resulting in electron transfer from the p-orbital of C to the d-orbital of Co. Under this p-d orbital interaction, the N-C@CoP exhibits a eta 10 value of 35 mV and excellent long-term durability, which rivals the commercial Pt/C catalyst. This work provides a unique avenue for the design of composite catalysts with strong interaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000806375900005

Ripples parallel to the laser polarization direction were found by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy to form for laser pulses ranging from 50 to 1000, whereas flower-like structures appeared for laser pulses of 104 and above. Analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed formation of indium and phosphorus oxides on the irradiated surface and the amounts of oxides increased with increasing number of laser pulses. The oxide formation is attributed to chemical reaction between the ultrafast laser ablation plume and oxygen in air, and formation of the flower-like structures is shown to be related to deposition of the oxides on the irradiated surface.

In this paper, for the first time, we develop a series of semiconducting D-A CMPs with various sulfur and nitrogen contents and degrees of conjugation for effective photocatalytic H-2 and O-2 generation from water. Here, we used a carbazole (Cz) moiety as the donor, and pyrene (Py), triphenyltriazine (TPT), benzothiadiazole (BT), and thiazolylthiazole (TzTz) as the acceptors. The resulting D-A CMPs had large surface areas (up to 1530 m(2) g(-1)) and high thermal stabilities (T-d10: up to 623. degrees C; char yield: up to 83 wt%). Moreover, the Cz-TzTz CMP provided an excellent hydrogen evolution rate (HER), reaching 15.3 mmol g(-1) h(-1) in the presence of ascorbic acid as the sacrificial electron donor, but without the need for an additional Pt co-catalyst. Interestingly, the Cz-TPT CMP provided an excellent oxygen evolution rate (OER) of 3.38 mmol g(-1) h(-1) when using AgNO3 as a sacrificial electron acceptor; this value is competitive with those of most previously reported organic photocatalysts. These highly active CMP-based photocatalysts appear to be useful materials for solar energy harvesting and conversion.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000861974900001

Since the pioneering work of Kellogg in 1950, the transition from conventional electrolysis to the CGDE regime has been generally associated with excessive ohmic heating at the working electrode, disregarding basic principles of electrochemical kinetics. Here we attempt to address this controversy by investigating of a CGDE process at a Fe-13% Cr anode in aqueous solutions of (NH4)(2)SO4 using an original method of in-situ impedance spectroscopy combined with voltammetric, gravimetric, chemical analysis and optical emission spectroscopy techniques. The study reveals three characteristic relaxation processes representing charge transfer through the surface oxide-hydroxide layer, the presence of which is confirmed by Glow Discharge Optical Emission and Raman Spectroscopies, and adsorption-desorption behaviour which we identify with oxo- and peroxo-intermediates of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) coupled with anodic metal dissolution. We explain the transition to CGDE by the OER pathway change from direct recombination of two terminally coordinated oxides to a single-site route involving early peroxide formation. This change triggers electrochemical luminescence which proceeds via a co-reactant mechanism involving fragments of metastable peroxide structures and metal cations at the active sites on the anode surface that produce electrically excited intermediates prone to radiative relaxation. Our results undermine existing CGDE theories whilst emphasising common bases in behaviour of conventional and plasma-assisted electro-chemical systems, thus providing far-reaching implications for understanding, development and practical use of electrolytic plasma processes.

In this work, we report the preparation of Ni2P embedded Ni-MOF nanosheets supported on nickel foam through partial phosphidation (Ni2P@Ni-MOF/NF). The self-supporting Ni2P@Ni-MOF/NF was directly tested as electrode for urea electrolysis. When served as anode for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), it only demands 1.41 V (vs RHE) to deliver a current of 100 mA cm(-2). And the overpotential of Ni2P@Ni-MOF/NF to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction HER was only 66 mV, remarkably lower than Ni2P/NF (133 mV). The exceptional electrochemical performance was attributed to the unique structure of Ni2P@Ni-MOF and the well exposed surface of Ni2P. Furthermore, the Ni2P@Ni-MOF/NF demonstrated outstanding longevity for both HER and UOR. The electrolyzer constructed with Ni2P@Ni-MOF/NF as bifunctional electrode can attain a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage as low as 1.65 V.

The valence band edge of WO3 located at similar to 3 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), which can offer enough potential to kinetically oxidize water for oxygen evolution reaction. However, water oxidation reaction kinetics is sluggish when only WO3 is used as the photoanode. It is highly desirable to use cocatalyst to promote the kinetics. MnOx loaded on the WO3 photoanode through photodeposition methods improves the photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance. A maximum photocurrent density of composite photoanode is achieved with a deposition time of 3 min, which is higher than that of pristine WO3 photoanode around 40%. MnO2 is not only a cocatalyst for water splitting but also for improving oxidation selectivity. We tried to use two means to load MnO on WO3 photoanode material. It is observed that loading a moderate amount of MnO on the WO3 by photodeposition can promote the performance of the WO3 photoanode.

However, it is often limited by slow kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction. Herein, a dual transition metal-based metal-organic frameworks (MOF) cocatalyst, Fe@Ni-MOF, is introduced into a titanium-doped hematite (Fe2O3:Ti) photoanode. The combination of Ni and Fe can optimize the filling of 3d orbitals. Moreover, the introduction of Fe donates electrons to Ni in the MOF structure, thus, suppressing the irreversible (long-life-time) oxidation of Ni2+ into Ni3+. The resulting Fe@Ni-MOF/Fe2O3:Ti photoanode exhibits similar to threefold enhancement in the photocurrent density at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Kinetic analysis of the PEC water oxidation processes indicates that this performance improvement is primarily due to modulating the charge transfer efficiency of hematite photoanode. Further results show that a single transition metal-based MOF cocatalyst, Ni-MOF, exhibits slow charge transfer in spite of a reduction in surface charge recombination, resulting in a smaller charge transfer efficiency. These findings provide new insights for the development of photoelectrodes decorated with MOFs.									26	1	0	0	2	0	26				2198-3844		WOS:000583844900001	33304764

We use a luminescent back reflector (LBR) capable of photon upconversion (UC) to improve the light harvesting capabilities of Mo:BiVO4 photoelectrodes. The LBR is prepared by dispersing the organic dye pair meso-tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphine palladium and perylene capable of triplet-triplet annhilation-based UC in a polymer film. The LBR converts the wavelengths of 600-650nm corresponding to the sub-band gap of Mo:BiVO4 and the wavelengths of 350-450nm that are not sufficiently absorbed in Mo:BiVO4 to a wavelength that can be absorbed by a Mo:BiVO4 photoelectrode. The LBR improves the water splitting reaction of Mo:BiVO4 photoelectrodes by 17%, and consequently, the Mo:BiVO4/LBR exhibits a photocurrent density of 5.25mAcm(-2) at 1.23V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. The Mo:BiVO4/LBR exhibits hydrogen/oxygen evolution corresponding to the increased photocurrent density and long-term operational stability for the water splitting reaction.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000476423300007	30937999

The ZnGeN2-ZnO solid solution photocatalyst shows photocatalytic activity under visible irradiation. This paper deals with results of photocatalytic reactions over the (Zn1+xGe)(N2Ox) photocatalyst for overall water splitting. The photocatalyst shows high rates for overall water splitting under visible irradiation, with notable deactivation with time. This study focuses on measuring rates for H-2 and O-2 evolution to elucidate the cause of the deactivation. Our results showed negligible changes in the structure and the composition of the photocatalyst after the photocatalytic reaction, and thus the changes undetectable by the techniques employed should be the cause of deactivation. This paper also discusses two strategies to improve the photocatalytic activity: metal doping in the oxynitride formulation and post-calcination after nitridation. Several characterization carried out in this study led us to conclude, at the current point, that the improvement of photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the reduction in the number of defects in the photocatalyst materials.									39	1	0	0	5	0	39			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000271714800015	19904433

Hydrogen production via electrochemical water splitting is one of the key solutions that can meet this demand. Today 3d transition metal based nanomaterials offer a huge opportunity in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) via electrochemical water splitting. Herein, we report an easy and convenient synthesis route for designing the novel tetradentate phosphonate ligand based metal-organic framework (MOF, H8L-Co-crystal). The material has been characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD), powder XRD, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and explored in the HER from various mediums including seawater. This single crystal belongs to the monoclinic phase having C2/c space group, with unit cell parameters a = 29.364(8) (angstrom), b = 12.204(4) (angstrom), c = 9.925(3) (angstrom), a = 90 degrees = gamma, ss = 97.405 degrees (CCDC no. 1922964) and the unit cell volume = 3527.04 angstrom(3). The material H8L-Co-crystal shows very good catalytic activity towards H-2 evolution with a low overpotential of 243 mV at a current density 10 mA/cm(2) as well as a low Tafel slope of 102 mV/dec in acidic medium, which is comparable to commercial HER catalysts, and one of the best among non-postsynthetically modified MOFs. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) data have been measured to explain the high hydrogen evolution rate in different mediums. Density functional theory (DFT) study based on first-principle calculations provides a very useful understanding about the structurecatalytic property relationship and reveals the role of surface active sites toward electrochemical HER.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1528-7483	1528-7505		WOS:000648580100006

It exhibits a nanostructure of Co-Nd2O3 hybrid nanoparticles coated with NC shells. The introduced Nd2O3 is beneficial to obtain high ratios of O vacancy/total O and graphitic-N/total N and modify the Lewis acidic property of Co-Nd2O3/NC-700, thus benefiting the OER activity. Besides, not only high Co2+/total Co and pyridinic-N/total N ratios, but also the enhanced Lewis base property is achieved after the introduction of Nd2O3, which is favorable for the ORR activity. As a result, the optimal Co-Nd2O3/NC-700 exhibits the enhanced OER/ORR activity. Especially, the OER activity is remarkably improved, thus leading to the excellent bifunctional catalytic activity with low Delta E of similar to 0.86 V. Furthermore, the Zn-air battery with Co-Nd2O3/NC-700 shows a high specific capacity of similar to 613.6 mA h g(Zn)(-1) and superior charge-discharge cycling durability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000632018500008

Herein, bimetallic phosphides are encapsulated into graphitized carbon to construct a C@NiCoP composite nanoarray using bimetallic metal-organic framework (MOF) as a self-sacrificial template. The resulting C@NiCoP exhibits superior performance for pH-universal electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), particularly representing a low overpotential of 46.3 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 44.1 mV dec(-1) in alkaline media. The structural characterizations combined with theoretical calculation demonstrate that tailored electronic structure from bimetal atoms and the synergistic effect with graphitized carbon layer could jointly optimize the adsorption ability of hydrogen on active sites in HER process, and enhance the electrical conductivity as well. In addition, the carbon layer served as a protecting shell also prevents highly dispersed NiCoP components from agglomeration and/or loss in harsh media, finally improving the durability. This work thus provides a new insight into optimizing activity and stability of pH-universal electrocatalysts by the nanostructural design and electronic structure modulation.

J	Mills, T.J.; Laskowski, F.A.L.; Dette, C.; Nellist, M.R.; Fuding Lin; Boettcher, S.W.								The role of surface states in electrocatalyst-modified semiconductor photoelectrodes: theory and simulations [arXiv]								arXiv								19 pp.	19 pp.						10 July 2017	2017	In the last several years, there has been a wealth of studies to clarify the role of thin layers of electrocatalysts on semiconducting photoelectrodes to the efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It has been shown that the addition of a thin oxide overlayer in many cases cathodically shifts the potential of photocurrent onset and/or increases the maximum photocurrent, leading to greater collection efficiencies beneficial for OER. However, the origin of this enhancement is not well understood. Here, we present a model relying on analytical expressions rather than differential equations to investigate the role of surface states in electrocatalyst-modified semiconductor photoelectrodes. Without catalyst overlayer, we find that if surface states are screened, meaning charged surface states are electronically neutralized via nearby solution ions, no Helmholtz potential is generated and photoelectrodes exhibit good performance. In contrast, if the surface states are unscreened, an additional Helmholtz potential forms decreasing the amount of band bending and resulting in poor performance. In the presence of a catalyst overlayer, there is a strong dependence on how the surface states interact with the catalyst. Catalysts in series with surface states can increase the effective rate of transfer from surface states to solution, leading to an increase in total current while catalysts that act in parallel with surface states can increase the open circuit voltage or photovoltage. Both series and parallel catalyst effects operate in tandem in real devices, leading to an increase in current and/or photovoltage, depending on the relevant exchange currents. This model does not only help to understand the role of surface states in charge transfer and ultimately efficiencies in photoelectrochemical systems but also allows facile application for other researchers.									0	0	0		0	0	0						INSPEC:17366983

Films of SWCNTs and commercial platinum (Pt) black were sequentially cast on a carbon fiber electrode (CFE) using a simple electrophoretic deposition procedure. Scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy showed that the nanotubes and the platinum retained their nanostructure morphology on the carbon fiber surface. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed that the carbon nanotube-based electrodes exhibited an order of magnitude lower charge-transfer reaction resistance (R-ct) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) than did the commercial carbon black (CB)-based electrodes. The proton exchange membrane (PEM) assembly fabricated using the CFE/SWCNT/Pt electrodes was evaluated using a fuel cell testing unit operating with H-2 and H-2 as input fuels at 25 and 60 degrees C. The maximum power density obtained using CFE/SWCNT/Pt electrodes as both the anode and the cathode was similar to 20% better than that using the CFE/CB/Pt electrodes.									192	4	0	0	8	0	201			0743-7463			WOS:000231550000059	16114961

The experiments used a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and low energy electron diffraction to examine the time evolution of surface carbon species during diamond growth. Samples were transferred under vacuum from the filament-assisted diamond growth chamber to an attached ultrahigh vacuum analytical chamber. Our results indicate that diamond nucleates on platinum and nickel by pre-deposition of graphitic carbon precursors. Defect sites in these graphite deposits contain the nucleation sites for diamond. These nucleation sites are sensitive to the presence of gas phase oxygen species; therefore, addition of oxygen to the gas phase suppresses diamond nucleation by elimination of the nucleation sites but does not suppress growth of existing diamond. Our results demonstrate at least one mechanism whereby diamond can nucleate on metallic substrates such as platinum and nickel.

J	Denissenkov, PA; Herwig, F								The abundance evolution of oxygen, sodium, and magnesium in extremely metal poor intermediate-mass stars: Implications for the self-pollution scenario in globular clusters								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				590	2			L99	L102		10.1086/376748				JUN 20 2003	2003	We present full stellar evolution and parametric models of the surface abundance evolution of O-16, Ne-22, Na-23 and the magnesium isotopes in an extremely metal poor intermediate- mass star (M-ZAMS = 5 M., where ZAMS stands for the zero- age main sequence, and Z = 0.0001). O-16 and Ne-22 and are injected into the envelope by the third dredge-up following thermal pulses on the asymptotic giant branch. These species and the initially present Mg-24 are depleted by hot bottom burning (HBB) during the interpulse phase. As a result, Na-23, Mg-25, and Mg-26 are enhanced. If the HBB temperatures are sufficiently high for this process to deplete oxygen efficiently, Na-23 is first produced and then depleted during the interpulse phase. Although the simultaneous depletion of O-16 and enhancement of Na-23 is possible, the required fine-tuning of the dredge-up and HBB casts some doubt on the robustness of this process as the origin of the O-Na anticorrelation observed in globular cluster stars. However, a very robust prediction of our models are low Mg-24/Mg-25 and Mg-24/Mg-26 ratios whenever significant O-16 depletion can be achieved. This seems to be in stark contrast to recent observations of the magnesium isotopic ratios in the globular cluster NGC 6752.									88	1	0	0	0	0	88			0004-637X			WOS:000183459600009

Therefore, the chemical potential driving force can be recast as an electric potential difference. Conversely, the application of an electric field across a metal/silicate interface is capable of driving chemical reactions. To explore the electrochemical behavior of a core/mantle-like boundary, the behavior of a liquid sulfide/silicate boundary in the presence of an externally applied electric potential difference was examined experimentally. The physical and chemical responses of this electrified interface include: (1) reaction zones containing new oxide phases at the similar to 1 V level, (2) unusual partitioning of highly siderophile elements at similar to 100 mV, (3) electrowetting at 10-100 mV, and (4) valence changes, indicating oxygen fugacity perturbations, at a level of similar to 1-10 mu V. An equivalent circuit diagram representing the experimental results is introduced, and extended to processes at the Earth's core/mantle boundary. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wu, Zhuofu; Zhang, Sitong; Wang, Xiaojun; Cai, Can; Chen, Guang; Ma, Li								Nitroxide-Modified Protein-Incorporated Nanoflowers with Dual Enzyme-Like Activities								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE				15				263	273		10.2147/IJN.S220718				2020	2020	Purpose: Combined superoxide dismutase (SOD)/catalase mimetics have attracted much attention because of their efficacy against reactive oxygen species-associated diseases; however, their application is often limited owing to their poor stability and the absence of favorable grafting sites. To address this, we developed a new class of SOD/catalase mimetics based on hybrid nanoflowers, which exhibit superior stability and possess the desired grafting sites for drugs and endogenous molecules.Methods: In this work, for the first time, we used polynitroxylated human serum albumin (PNA) to mediate the formation of hybrid copper-based nanoflowers. H2O2 depletion and O-2 evolution assays were first performed to determine the catalase-like activity of the hybrid nanoflowers. Next, the xanthine oxidase/cytochrome c method was used to assay the SOD-like activity of the nanoflowers. Further characteristics of the nanoflowers were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Operational stability was assessed via the reusability assay.Results: The H2O2 depletion and O-2 evolution assays indicated that PNA-incorporated nanoflowers have genuine catalase-like activity. Kinetic analysis revealed that the reactions of the incorporated nanoflowers with H2O2 not only obey Michaelis-Menton kinetics, but that the nanoflowers also possess a higher affinity for H2O2 than that of native catalase. The FTIR spectra corroborated the presence of PNA in the hybrid nanoflowers, while the EPR spectra confirmed the intermolecular interaction of nitroxides bound to the human serum albumin incorporated into the nanoflowers. The remarkable operational reproducibility of the hybrid nanoflowers in catalase-like and SOD-like reactions was verified across successive batches.Conclusion: Herein, a comparison of Michaelis constants showed that the hybrid nanoflower, a catalase mimetics, outperforms the native catalase. Acting as a "better-than-nature" enzyme mimetics, the hybrid nanoflower with superior stability and desired ligand grafting sites will find widespread utilization in the medical sciences.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			1178-2013			WOS:000507383200001	32021179

The differing spin states of the OER reactants and products is one of the factors that slows OER kinetics. Thus, spin conservation plays a crucial role in enhancing OER performance. In this work, ferromagnetic (FM)-antiferromagnetic (AFM) Fe3O4@Ni(OH)(2) core-shell catalysts are designed. The interfacial FM-AFM coupling of these catalysts facilitates selective removal of electrons with spin direction opposing the magnetic moment of FM core, improving OER kinetics. The shell thickness is found critical in retaining the coupling effect for OER enhancement. The magnetic domain structure of the FM core also plays a critical role. With a multiple domain core, the applied magnetic field aligns the magnetic domains, optimizing the electron transport process. A significant enhancement of OER activity is observed for the multiple domain core catalysts. With a single-domain FM core with ordered magnetic dipoles, the spin-selective electron transport with minimal scattering is facilitated even without an applied magnetic field. A magnetism/OER activity model therefore hypothesizes that depends on two main parameters: interfacial spin coupling and domain structure. These findings provide new design principles for active OER catalysts.									17	0	0	0	1	0	16			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000693169700001	34473843

Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) hybrid of graphene hollow nanospheres-supported ruthenium phosphides through a nanosphere-directed templating approach is developed. As expected, when evaluated as an electrocatalyst for the HER, the resultant composite exhibits excellent catalytic performance over a wide pH range due to the synergistic effects of the unique structure and composition. Particularly, the catalyst shows a low overpotential of 25.5 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 34.4 mV dec(-1), as well as long-term operational stability for 10 h in basic conditions, which is superior to all other reported HER catalysts, including commercial 20% Pt-C. More importantly, this work provides new options for the design of 3D hollow graphene nanospheres supported transition metal phosphides as high-performance electrocatalysts for large-scale hydrogen production.

Herein, we demonstrate a rational design and synthesis of a N-doped graphitic carbon material from a N-rich MOF as the superior support for dispersion of platinum. The in-situ doped N atoms play an important role in harvesting and anchoring platinum through the electrochemical process. Compared with carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide, the as-prepared carbon material exhibits exceptional HER performance after platinum decoration with low onset overpotential, small Tafel slope, and high stability in acidic solution. DFT calculations indicate that the superior electrocatalytic activity and high platinum harvesting efficiency is due to the strong interaction between doped N sites and platinum atom, which facilitates the electron transport and hydrogen evolution process.

Electrodeposition provides a feasible route for preparing freestanding OER electrodes with high active site utilization, fast mass transport and a simple fabrication process, which is highly attractive from both academic and commercial points of view. This minireview focuses on the recent electrodeposition strategies for metal (hydro)oxide design and water oxidation applications. First, the intrinsic advantages of electrodeposition in comparison with traditional technologies are introduced. Then, the unique properties and underlying principles of electrodeposited metal (hydro)oxides in the OER are unveiled. In parallel, illustrative examples of the latest advances in materials structural design, controllable synthesis, and mechanism understanding through the electrochemical synthesis of (hydro)oxides are presented. Finally, the latest representative OER mechanism and electrodeposition routes for OER catalysts are briefly overviewed. Such observations provide new insights into freestanding (hydro)oxides electrodes preparedviaelectrodeposition, which show significant practical application potential in water splitting devices. We hope that this review will provide inspiration for researchers and stimulate the development of water splitting technology.									53	1	0	0	2	0	52			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000577727000005	34094316

Unlike traditional programmed heat treatment, this microwave-assisted method decomposed the MOF into separated metal and carbon- and nitrogen-containing gases rather than aggregated metal and carbon composites during the initial thermal transformation stages. This change ensured the effective control of the subsequent formation process of carbon on the surface of metal and led to the formation of well-dispersed M@NC with monolayer/few-layer NC. Moreover, the graphene substrate promoted the full exposure of all active monolayer/few-layer NC, and thus the obtained FeNi@NC/graphene displays the best electrocatalytic properties for the oxygen evolution reaction of all of the previously reported M@NC based catalysts, including the lowest overpotential (261 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte (1 M KOH), the smallest Tafel slope (40 mV dec(-1)) and excellent durability for at least 120 h.									39	5	0	0	4	0	39			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000444554100016	30210776

Oxygen evolution with a high turnover frequency of 11.09 s(-1) and a low onset overpotential of only 580 mV is achieved in neutral phosphate buffer solution, and [Cu-II(H2L)](2+) is confirmed as an efficient molecular water oxidation catalyst with long-term stability. The results of electrochemical tests provide evidence that the Cu center undergoes a water nucleophilic attack process and participates in the catalytic cycle. The subsequent one-step proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process of the Cu center and the two-step PCET process of the ligand are both critical for efficient water oxidation. This work indicates that the ligand assisted catalytic cycle is a favorable method for the accumulation of intermediate species that account for electrochemical water oxidation.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000693596000001

A MLG of 32 nm (similar to 90 layer) was reduced to 12 nm (similar to 30 layer) in 60 s with sheet resistance of 550 Omega/square and transmittance of 83%. The geometrical dimensions, optical transmittance and sheet resistance evolution of the films during the treatment process are investigated. The method suggested in this paper yields controllability of the MLG film thickness and the electrical and optical properties after the transfer process and device fabrication, which has great potentials for transparent conductive electrode applications.

Therefore, highly efficient electrocatalysts are required for ORR and Zn-air batteries. Herein, Co-SrCO3/N-doped carbon (NC) hybrid electrocatalysts were developed through the pyrolysis of a bimetal precursor (Co, Sr). The hybrid electrocatalysts with core-shell configuration include the outer NC shells and the inner inorganic nanoparticles (SrCO3 with surface SrO and metallic Co). The outer NC shells had direct contributions to the ORR processes, whereas the inner inorganic nanoparticles had indirect contributions, both of which were investigated in detail, especially the important roles of SrCO3 with surface SrO. Together with high surface content of doped N, high charge transfer efficiency, high BET surface area, and greater surface SrO of SrCO3, the optimized CoSrCO3/ NC-600 possesses high ORR activity, high selectivity of the apparent 4e(-) pathway, and excellent durability. The Zn-air battery with Co-SrCO3/NC-600 also shows high battery performance. This study provides a new protocol for developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for the ORR and Zn-air batteries, through using alkaline earth metal based materials.									15	1	0	0	1	0	15			2052-1553			WOS:000403440100020

In this regard, various ratios of nitric acid/sulfuric acid were tested for functionalization of CNTs. The ethylene glycol reduction method was applied to deposit the hybrid electrocatalyst nanoparticles on FCNTs. It was revealed that the combination of FCNTs, as the support catalyst, with hybrid platinum and transition metals, accelerated the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by passing through the four-electron pathway which was due to the high crystallinity and aspect ratio, low defect density and unique electrical conductivity of CNTs and Pt-transition metals alloys. As a result, the power density profoundly enhanced (up to 237%) while the charge transfer resistance reduced, compared to Pt-C 10%wt commercial catalyst. This study demonstrated the excellent performance of FCNTs decorated Pt-Ni-Fe electrocatalyst can be considered as a good candidate for the future of the catalyst layer in PEMFC.

Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectra, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses indicated the binary NiPd nanoparticles good dispersed on nitrogen-doped graphene sheet (NiPd NPs/N-GR) under a unique core-shell nanostructure with high interaction, thereby creating massive catalytic sites and boosting the activity towards ORR in alkaline medium. The electrochemical measurements showed the onset and half-wave potential of the NiPd NPs/N-GR were +0.961 and +0.82 V, respectively, indicating a comparable catalytic behavior to a commercial Pt/C product (20 wt%). In addition, such catalyst also exhibited superior stability and methanol tolerance ability to Pt/C. The achieved superiorities of the NiPd NPs/N-GR imply that this material is potential to replace Pt-based catalysts in for ORR applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The POM has four targeted functions in this hybrid material: it reduces H2PtCl6 to Pt NPs, stabilizes the Pt NPs, induces a strong electrostatic association of the negatively charged Pt NPs with the protonated NH2-MIL-53 sites on the particle surfaces, and facilitates the catalytic reduction reaction itself. The NH2-MIL-53 in this work protects the light sensitive 2-aminoterephthalate groups in the pores from oxidation by the POMs, while the surface protonated NH2 units on the MOF particle surfaces strongly bind the negatively charged POM-stabilized Pt NPs.									72	6	0	0	6	0	73			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000374790700023

DEPENDENCE ON WHITE-DWARF MASS								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				448	2			807	821		10.1086/176009				AUG 1 1995	1995	Hydrodynamic studies have been performed of accretion onto 1.00 M., 1.25 M., and 1.35 M. oxygen-neon-magnesium (ONeMg) white dwarfs at a rate of 10(17) g s(-1). The material from the companion star is expected to be of solar composition but is assumed to be mixed with material from the underlying white dwarf during accretion, such that the accumulating envelope material is enriched in oxygen, neon, and magnesium to fifty percent by mass. A new, expanded nuclear reaction network, utilizing up-to-date reaction rates and including 78 nuclei up to Ca-40, has been used in combination with the hydrodynamics for the first time in this study.We again find that the outbursts become more violent as the assumed white dwarf mass is increased. Burning temperatures, nuclear energy generation rates, and ejecta velocities all increase significantly with mass. A peak burning temperature of 356 x 10(6) K is reached in the 1.35 M. sequence, allowing significant nucleosynthesis of intermediate-mass elements to occur. We find that as we increase the white dwarf mass, the abundance of Al-26 decreases (by about a factor of 3 for our range of white dwarf masses), and the abundances of Na-22 and the majority of nuclei in the Si-Ca range increase significantly (by 2 orders of magnitude or greater). Our simulations indicate that nova outbursts which occur on ONeMg white dwarfs having a mass of 1.25 M. or greater produce sufficient amounts of Na-22 such that gamma-rays from the decay of Na-22 should be detectable with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, if the nova is nearby (D similar to 1 kpc). Our simulations also confirm that nova outbursts occurring on ONeMg white dwarfs are an important source of Al-26 nuclei in the Galaxy. We further examine whether such outbursts can fully account for the reported similar to 3 M. of Al-26 needed to explain the Galactic 1.809 MeV gamma-ray line emissions. We estimate that a minimum mass of 1.2 M. for ONeMg white dwarfs in binaries is needed in order for nova outbursts to be able to produce the observed similar to 3 M. of Al-26 over the mean lifetime of this nucleus. However, this estimate is based on the particular initial conditions we have chosen for the sequence of models presented in this paper, and on the assumption that the production of cataclysmic variables with ONeMg white dwarfs is not significantly less than that assumed for CO white dwarfs in the same mass range.									133	2	0	0	0	0	133			0004-637X			WOS:A1995RK72200033

Among them, a representative catalyst, termed FeCo-NCps, possesses highly active M-N-x-C sites, a superhigh specific surface area and a structure with abundant defects, displaying excellent bifunctional performance in both ORR and OER in 0.1 M KOH. Furthermore, a home-made rechargeable Zn-air battery was constructed using FeCo-NCps as the air cathode, delivering an excellent energy conversion efficiency (with an extremely high energy density of 922 W h kg(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2)). This work not only provides a scalable and sustainable method to produce low-cost and highly efficient ORR/OER catalysts, but also highlights the great value of the rational design of biomass-derived nanocarbons for advanced energy materials.									90	9	0	0	4	0	90			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472219400008

Although studies on the mammalian proteins have elucidated aspects of Ngb and Cygb biophysics and indicated potential functions, the properties of non-mammalian Ngbs and Cygbs are largely uncharacterized. We have expressed the recombinant zebrafish proteins Ngb, Cygb1, and Cygb2 in Escherichia coli and characterized their nitrite reduction rates, spectral properties, autoxidation rate constants, redox potentials and lipid binding properties. The three zebrafish proteins can catalyze the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide with a broad range of reaction rate constants. (Ngb, 0.68 +/- 0.04 M-1 s(-1); Cygb1, 28.6 +/- 3.1 M-1 s(-1); Cygb2, 0.94 +/- 0.18 M-1 s(-1)). We observe that zebrafish Ngb and Cygb2 have comparable spectral features to those of human Ngb and Cygb, consistent with a six coordinate heme, whereas unexpectedly Cygb1 has a five-coordinate heme, a slower autoxidation and in general has properties more akin to oxygen transport proteins. In agreement with a possible oxygen carrier and nitrite reductase role, we detect mRNA transcript for Cygb1 but not Cygb2 or Ngb in zebrafish blood. Unlike human Cygb, neither of the zebrafish globins binds oleic acid with high affinity. This finding suggests that lipid binding may be a trait acquired later during evolution and not an ancestral property of cytoglobins. Altogether, our results uncover unexpected properties of zebrafish globins and reveal the pivotal role of cytoglobins in the transition of heme globins from six-coordinate to five-coordinate oxygen carriers and nitrite reductases.

Herein, we demonstrate that infrared (IR) irradiating oxide catalysts improve the evolution efficiency of H-2 and O-2 gases by approximately 3.4 times that of the conventional method. This indicates that the IR oxide catalysts contribute to lowering the energy required to break the interatomic covalent bonds in the water molecule (H2O) through stretching and bending vibrations, thus facilitating the efficient evolution of H-2 and O-2 gases. A comparison between the IR oxide catalysts and a catalyst-free 6 M KOH solution showed that the former requires a shorter duration (11 min) compared to the 37 min required by the catalyst-free 6 M KOH solution for the evolution of 500 cc of O-2 and H-2 gases. For the system containing the IR oxide catalyst, the power consumption was 6 Wh for 1 L of H-2 gas evolution, whereas the catalyst-free system consumed 23 Wh of power.

In this work, porous Ni-Co-P nanosheet arrays were supported on carbon fiber cloth with an ultrathin film thickness of only similar to 62 nm. The cross-linked porous nanosheet structure greatly increases the interface area of electrolytes and catalysts. The superhydrophilic and aerophobic nature is advantageous to interface contact and bubble detachment. These characteristics encourage Ni-Co-P nanosheets to maintain high performance under the condition of low active substance loading. For example, the Ni-Co-P shows superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performances in both alkaline and acidic media, especially in alkaline conditions, which delivers a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) at a low overpotential of 57 mV along with the Tafel slope of 69 mV dec(-1). This work provides a direction for the development of low-cost and efficient non-noble metal electrocatalysts with ultralow load contents. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Though nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon shells have been widely used to improve the electrode performances in energy storage devices (e.g., lithium ion batteries), they have attracted less attention in energy-related electrocatalysis. Here we report the synthesis of nitrogen-enriched core shell structured cobalt carbon nanoparticles dispersed on graphene sheets and we investigate their HER performances in both acidic and basic media. These catalysts exhibit excellent durability and HER activities with onset over-potentials as low as similar to 70 mV in both acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) and alkaline (0.1 M NaOH) electrolytes, and the overpotentials needed to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) are determined to be 265 mV in acid and 337 mV in base, further demonstrating their potential to replace Pt-based catalysts. Control experiments reveal that the active sites for HER might come from the synergistic effects between the cobalt nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped carbon.									156	4	0	0	5	1	158			1944-8244			WOS:000353607100032	25826236

Our newly developed technique has the distinct features of sustainable and widely available niacin as a bi-functional source of both carbon and nitrogen, whereas the iron catalyst is cheap and the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust. The results of the electrochemical tests show that our newly developed iron impregnated NCNT anchored on reduced graphene substrate (Fe@NCNT-rGO) catalyst exhibit: a positive half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.75 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode), four-electron pathway, and better methanol tolerance when compared to commercial 20% Pt/C. When applied as adsorbent for arsenic removal, our newly discovered NCNT-Fe illustrate the efficient and effective removal of arsenic across a wide range of pH values.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5				1996-1944		WOS:000529875600204	32260368

R.Br., and compared with the C(3) Species Sonchus oleraceus L. Patterns of CO(2) assimilation during phase IV of CAM were as predicted for Rubisco-mediated atmospheric CO(2) uptake in both CAM plants. The high energetic demand during decarboxylation (phase III) was reflected in a high, CO(2)-insensitive rate of gross O(2) evolution. Uptake of external CO(2) was significant during phase III and was not saturated at 1.5% CO(2). Gross oxygen uptake in the light was CO(2) sensitive in H. carnosa during phases III and IV, which suggests Rubisco oxygenase activity, Oxygen consumption comprised around 33% linear electron transport in K. daigremontiana during phase III (7.5 mu mol O(2) m(-2) s(-1) at saturating CO(2)), but we cannot yet distinguish whether this involves the Mehler reaction or TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation during deacidification. CO(2) assimilation was saturated at 0.2% CO(2) when the epidermis was removed in K. daigremontiana, suggesting a large stomatal and mesophyll resistance to CO(2) diffusion. A linear relationship was obtained between the quantum yield of gross O(2) evolution and the quantum efficiency of PSII.									59	0	0	0	58	0	62			0310-7841			WOS:000072877900007

Herein, a cost-effective bifunctional catalyst, Ru/N-doped Carbon@WO3-W2C (Ru/NC@WOC), was developed via co-precipitation and polyol reduction. Ru/NC@WOC showed superior HOR/HER activity in alkaline solution in comparison with commercial Pt/C. HOR electrochemical tests showed that the mass activity at 0.05 V (1.96 mA mu gRu-1 ) and exchange-current density were 7.5 and 1.2 times that of Pt/C. Additionality, Ru/NC@WOC exhibited up 30-fold HOR activity in mass activity compared with benchmark Ru/C. Moreover, it also displayed exceptional electrocatalytic HER with overpotentials of 31 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 119 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), surpassing Pt/C, benchmark Ru/C, and most of the previously reported electrocatalysts. The outstanding catalytic activity of Ru/NC@WOC probably arises from the synergy between Ru and NC@WOC matrix, suitable hydrogen binding energy, and highly conductive substrate. Thus, this work may pave a new avenue to fabricate low-cost bifunctional HOR/HER catalysts for alkaline fuel cells and water electrolyzer.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000662788400001	34076948

Nevertheless, methods for WT management are limited to the particulation of WTs for their use as a modifier in asphalt and concrete and burning WTs to obtain thermal energy in a power plant. Therefore, we designed a new approach to recycle WTs into valuable resources. We demonstrated the upcycling of WTs into affordable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts by utilizing all components, including carbon black, rubber, and Fe particles. Under thermal oxidation, rubbers were transformed into cross-linked and stable structures and subsequently converted to carbonized rubbers on further heat treatment. In addition, heat treatment under ammonia gas flow enlarged the pore size of the WT-derived catalysts and provided nitrogen functional groups. Structural and textural analyses confirmed that the carbonized rubbers rendered an increase in the number of active sites for the ORR. Furthermore, it was revealed that the Fe particles survived thermal oxidation and also acted as active sites for the ORR, promoting catalytic activity. Our N-doped catalyst with Fe exhibited ORR activity comparable to that of a Pt/C catalyst. Therefore, we believe that our approach of envisioning upcycling pathways is an effective solution for the management of WTs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000715071600001

A challenge for optimizing the ORR catalytic activities of these electrocatalysts is to tune their local structures and chemical compositions in a rational and controlled way that can achieve the synergistic function of each factor. Herein, we report a tandem synthetic strategy that integrates multiple contributing factors into an N-doped carbon. With an N-containing MOF (ZIF-8) as the precursor, carbonization at higher temperatures leads to a higher degree of graphitization. Subsequent NH3 etching of this highly graphitic carbon enabled the introduction of a higher content of pyridine-N sites and higher porosity. By optimizing these three factors, the resultant carbon materials displayed ORR activity that was far superior to that of carbon derived from a one-step pyrolysis. The onset potential of 0.955V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and the half-wave potential of 0.835V versus RHE are among the top ranks of metal-free ORR catalysts and are comparable to commercial Pt/C (20wt%) catalysts. Kinetic studies revealed lower H2O2 yields, higher electron-transfer numbers, and lower Tafel slopes for these carbon materials compared with that derived from a one-step carbonization. These findings verify the effectiveness of this tandem synthetic strategy to enhance the ORR activity of N-doped carbon materials.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000434075200009	29573580

Among these, the most successful results so far were obtained using shaped PtNi alloy nanoparticles, preferably with PtNi(111) facets. However, these nanoparticles typically suffer from much lower activity after the durability tests due to the leaching out of the surface Ni during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which leads to the disappearance of the activity-enhancing effect caused by electronic structure modification. Here, we showed that halide treatment of the octahedral PtNi nanoparticles could significantly enhance their durability. Halides are adsorbed on surface Ni more strongly than on surface Pt, and the surface halides are found to preserve the surface Ni that induces the ORR activity enhancement. Especially, Br can preserve the surface Ni effectively. Durability testing by repeating cyclic voltammetry 10,000 times in the 0.6-1.1 V range showed that the mass activity decreased by 52.6% for the as prepared PtNi octahedral nanoparticles, whereas the mass activity decreased by only 15.0% for the Br-treated PtNi nanoparticles. The simple treatment significantly enhanced the long-term stability of the highly active PtNi alloy nano-octahedra. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, IBO of Si, Ge, Si1-xGex was investigated experimentally as a function of ion energy from 100 eV to 1 keV. The results show a strong dependence of the materials properties such as phase formation, stoichiometry, and thickness upon the ion energy. To investigate the kinetics of IBO and to account for the observed relationship between ion energy and films properties, three models were successively developed taking progressively into account: (1) ion implantation and sputtering (model IS), (2) replacement and relocation events, i.e., ion beam mixing effects (model ISR) and (3) oxygen diffusion (model ISRD). The simulation results show that the model IS based only on implantation and sputtering cannot explain the oxide thickness dependence upon ion energy observed experimentally, but can give qualitative information on the phases formed by IBO. Ion beam mixing effects in the model ISR lead to spatial redistribution of the elements in compound targets and account for the evolution of stoichiometry as a function of depth. Thermal and point defect mediated diffusion of free oxygen and the strong driving force for oxidation must be considered to account for the observed thicknesses, sharp interfaces and kinetics of IBO growth in three stages.					38TH NATIONAL SYMP OF THE AMERICAN VACUUM SOC38TH NATIONAL SYMP OF THE AMERICAN VACUUM SOC	NOV 10-15, 1991NOV 10-15, 1991	AMER VACUUM SOCAMER VACUUM SOC	SEATTLE, WASEATTLE, WA	22	0	0	0	0	0	22			0734-2101			WOS:A1992JE68100026

The results indicate that the surface oxygen vacancy concentration of Zn0.5CeZrOx composite oxides can be markedly elevated by preparation through a sol-gel method with glucose as the complexing agent and calcination at 500 degrees C; a higher surface oxygen vacancy concentration leads to a higher space-time yield of methanol for syngas conversion over the Zn0.5CeZrOx oxide. When combined with SAPO-34 molecular sieves, the bifunctional Zn0.5CeZrOx/SAPO-34 catalyst with high surface oxygen vacancy concentration also exhibits a high space-time yield of light olefins (ethene to butenes) in the synthesis of olefins directly from syngas. With the help of in situ DRIFTS, it can be concluded that the surface oxygen vacancies on the ZnCeZrO oxide play an important role in the catalytic conversion of syngas. The abundant surface oxygen vacancies on Zn0.5CeZrOx can improve the formation of methanol-related intermediates from the syngas over the Zn0.5CeZrOx moiety, promote the evolution of these intermediates into the olefin products over the SAPO-34 moiety, and then enhance the overall capacity of the bifunctional Zn0.5CeZrOx/SAPO-34 composite catalyst in STO.									12	1	0	0	1	0	13			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000609012400028		
J	Ebina, M; Yamashita, T								Weak light-induced oxygen consumption observed during photoreactivation is coupled to the recovery of oxygen evolving activity								PLANT AND CELL PHYSIOLOGY				37	8			1059	1065		10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a029054				DEC 1996	1996	During photoreactivation of the O-2-evolving center in Tris-inactivated/Mn-depleted thylakoids, a slow O-2-consumption occurred. This O-2-consumption became detectable when the O-2-evolving activity of thylakoids was inactivated by Tris-treatment and decreased as photoreactivation proceeded. The O-2-consumption and photoreactivation similarly required Mn2+ at mu M levels in addition to PSII electron donors and shared several common characteristics. Stimulation of O-2-consumption and photoreactivation by these cofactors were always accompanied by enhancement in chlorophyll fluorescence induction, suggesting the involvement of a Mehler-type reaction in photoreactivation. Although the electron transport due to this O-2-consumption was rapid enough to oxidize 4 Mn2+ ions to reconstitute the tetranuclear Mn-cluster in each O-2-evolving center in a few seconds, actual recovery of O-2-evolving activity occurred more slowly in a few minutes. It was inferred that photoreactivation in Tris-inactivated thylakoids is not a simple photooxidation of Mn2+ but involves more complicated processes which are coupled to the Mehler-type electron transport from PSII to oxygen via PSI.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0032-0781			WOS:A1996VY11200004

Three different materials, with a nominal Fe2O3 amount of 10 wt%, 30 wt% and 50 wt%, were evaluated. Characterization techniques such as N-2 adsorption, XRD and STEM-EDX were applied to study the evolution of morphological and crystallographic properties. XRD results show that Fe is incorporated in the MgAl2O4 lattice of the as prepared materials, yielding a Mg-Fe-Al-O spinel structure. After redox cycling, part of Fe still remains within the spinel. The results of redox cycling reveal superior properties for 10Fe(2)O(3)-MgAl2O4, exhibiting stability in terms of morphology and, with an average space-time yield of 700 mmol(CO) s(-1) kg(Fe)(-1), the highest activity among the OSMs studied. However, 50Fe(2)O(3)-MgAl2O4 performs best in terms of overall CO yield, i e. 0.6 mol CO kg(OSM)(-1), more than twofold higher compared to 10Fe(2)O(3)-MgAl2O4 and 30Fe(2)O(3)-MgAl2O4 even after 1000 cycles. Deactivation through sintering occurs in all three materials, though to a lesser extent for 10Fe(2)O(3)-MgAl2O4. Phase transformation to a MgxFe1-xO phase predominantly causes a loss of oxygen storage capacity in 30Fe(2)O(3)-MgAl2O4 and 50Fe(2)O(3)-MgAl2O4.									20	1	0	0	0	0	21			2212-9820	2212-9839		WOS:000456488700005

Au nanoparticles (3.1-3.3 nm) were deposited on the three Co3O4 entities, which were achieved to obtain specific Au-Co3O4 interfaces. A detailed comparison was made on the basis of their unique interfacial structures and catalytic behaviors. H-2-TPR and XPS investigations revealed the important variations in reactivity of surface oxygen, surface Co3+/Co2+ ratio, evolution of surface oxygen vacancies as well as Au oxidation state upon Au loading and pretreatments. The enhanced CO oxidation by Au deposition, and particularly He-and in situ-pretreatments, has been elucidated in light of the structural specialties associated with the three facets of Co3O4 substrates and the corresponding Au-Co3O4 interfaces. The consequent activity enhancement for Co3O4 substrate and Au-Co3O4 interface was verified: (001) > (112) > (111), and Au/(112) > Au/(001) > Au/(111). The results of Au/h-Co3O4 also suggest that both Au cluster and Co3O4 structural feature can have a profound effect on the catalytic behaviour of generated interface. The present study extends the insights into the interface-dependent CO oxidation over the controllably prepared Au-Co3O4 interfacial structures.									28	1	0	0	2	0	28			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000373608400036

However, large overpotentials of oxygen-evolving reaction (OER) is a key bottleneck for practical application. Thus, water-oxidizing electrocatalysts with low cost and high efficiency should be developed. Here, 5 nm-sized Mn3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) are synthesized by a hydrothermal method, which is appropriate for large-scale production. To further improve their performance, various 3d transition metal elements are successfully doped in Mn3O4 NPs. Ni-doped Mn3O4 NPs exhibit the highest efficiency among the Mn3O4 NPs doped with various elements. Based on structural analysis, the Ni-doping process leads to the lattice distortion of their tetragonal spinel structure and it strongly correlates with the enhancement of OER activity. The overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is 524 and 458 mV for pristine and 5 at% doped Mn3O4 NPs under neutral condition. The heteroatom-doping process in sub-10 nm-sized nanocatalysts is expected to be a promising methodology to induce distorted structure related to active species.

HPLC analysis, total organic carbon (TOC) and ionic chromatography have been used to evaluate the oxidation and the mineralization of the treated aqueous solutions. The results of the cyclic voltammetries have shown that, in the case of Pt and Ti-Ru oxides a decrease in current density in the oxygen evolution region can be observed in the presence of urea, due to the blockage of the electrode active oxygen evolution sites as a consequence of the reversible adsorption of urea. Instead, a notable increase in the current density has been observed in the region of the oxygen evolution for the BDD and antimony-doped tin oxide electrodes, in the presence of urea, indicating that the oxidation of urea involves hydroxyl radicals.The bulk electrolysis tests have shown that the complete removal of urea and TOC can only be achieved using a boron-doped diamond and that Pt, the Ti-Ru oxide and antimony-doped tin oxide only permit a partial oxidation of urea. On the basis of the TOC evolution and the identification of the organic intermediates and inorganic ions released during the treatment, a total mineralization has been proposed. Finally, electrolysis has been performed in the presence of chloride ions, which act as oxidation mediator, and a comparison has been done between direct and mediated electro-oxidation.

Redox reactions at suitable electrodes near the water splitting potential can increase the working potential. Here, we demonstrate a kinetic approach for expanding the voltage window of aqueous asymmetric super capacitors using in situ activated Mn3O4 and VO2 electrodes. The underlying mechanism indicates a specific potential of similar to 1 V vs Ag/AgCl for the oxidation of Mn4+-to-Mn7+ at the positive electrode and similar to -0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl for the reduction of V3+-to-V2+ at the negative electrode, which limits oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively. The as-fabricated aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor exhibited a working voltage of 2.2 V with a high-energy density of 42.7 Wh/kg and a power density of similar to 1.1 kW/kg. This mechanism improves the voltage window and energy and power densities.									121	4	0	0	4	0	121			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000443525600101	30044606

Herein, a flexible and free-standing carbon fiber membrane immobilized with atomically dispersed Fe-N-4/C catalysts (Fe/SNCFs-NH3) is synthesized and used as air cathode for ZABs. The intertwined fibers with hierarchical nanopores facilitate the gas transportation, electrolyte infiltration and electron transfer. The large specific surface area exposes a high concentration of Fe-N-4/C sites embedded in the carbon matrix. Modulation of local atomic configurations by sulfur doping in Fe/SNCFs-NH3 catalyst leads to excellent ORR and enhanced OER activities. The as-synthesized Fe/SNCFs-NH3 catalyst demonstrates a positive half-wave potential of 0.89 V and a small Tafel slope of 70.82 mV dec(-1), outperforming the commercial Pt/C (0.86 V/94.74 mV dec(-1)) and most reported M-N-x/C (M = Fe, Co, Ni) catalysts. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations uncover the crucial role of S doping in regulating ORR and OER activities. The liquid-state ZABs with Fe/SNCFs-NH3 catalyst as air cathode deliver a large peak power density of 255.84 mW cm(-2) and long-term cycle durability over 1000 h. Solid-state ZAB shows stable cycling at various flat/bent/flat states, demonstrating great prospects in flexible electronic device applications.									39	0	0	0	0	0	39			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000729434100001	34787336

In this paper, mesoporous carbon based materials with 5.3 at% of N and 7.1 at% of S are synthesized (defined as porous-S-N-C). The solid core mesoporous shell silica as template results in mesoporous structure of the porous-S-N-C which favors mass transfer and higher doping (both increase by similar to 20%) and exposing of active N and S atoms. The electrochemical characterization results show that the mesoporous structure and the S modification favor much to the N-C based catalysts in catalyzing ORR. Typically, the porous-S-N-C has a 3.99 electron transfer number at 0.4 V, and higher ORR efficiency, much better CO tolerance, much better methanol tolerance and much higher electrochemical stability than commercial Pt/C. This novel method of improving the contents of doped and exposed N and S atoms is imagined to be applied to preparation of other high-content-heteroatom doped materials.

However, the commercialization of PEMFC technology has been greatly hindered by certain challenges, mainly the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction at the cathode and the high cost of Pt-based cathode catalysts, the latter presently accounting for over 55% of the total PEMFC cost. To overcome the limited stability of state-of-the-art Pt/C, Pt and Pt-alloy catalysts supported on modified carbon materials have garnered significant interest in recent years. It is therefore timely to compile a review that focuses on Pt and Pt-alloy catalysts supported on modified carbon materials, examining their current R&D status, applications, challenges, and future prospects. This review provides a systematic and comprehensive survey of current Pt and Pt-alloy PEMFC cathode catalysts in terms of materials selection and design, synthesis methods, and structural features, emphasizing how these various aspects relate to the catalysts' physicochemical characterization and performance, and with the aim of shedding light on the future direction of PEMFC research.

Recently, as one of nonprecious metal catalysts (NPMCs), the MC@N-C (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Mo, W) catalysts, especially for Fe3C encased in carbon layer (denoted as Fe3C@N-C) have emerged as promising replacements for costly Pt-based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This review highlights the synthetic strategies undertaken such as hard template, soft template, and template-free methods for deriving enhancements in electrocatalytic activity and durability. It also provides a comparison on the synthetic methods and catalytic performance and points out issues in the ORR measurements and activity comparison. In addition, understanding of the proposed active sites and corresponding mechanisms for ORR are covered. The recent advances shed light on contributions of morphology, hierarchical pore structures, density and dispersion of active sites, and synergistic effects of multiple active sites, which endow Fe3C@N-C electrocatalysts with enhanced ORR performance. These interesting effects are attained as a result of increased exposure and accessibility of the active sites to O-2 molecules, faster charge and mass transfer, and finally, protection of active sites by carbon shells. Finally, the challenges and perspectives to further improve performance of Fe3C@N-C are discussed.									40	3	0	0	4	0	41			2366-9608			WOS:000496847900001

However, the overall efficiency of water splitting is limited by the effectiveness of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the high energy barrier of the 4e(-) process. The key to addressing this challenge is the development of high-performing catalysts. Transition-metal hydroxides with high intrinsic activity and stability have been widely studied for this purpose. Herein, we report a gelatin-induced structure-directing strategy for the preparation of a butterfly-like FeNi/Ni heterostructure (FeNi/Ni HS) with excellent catalytic performance. The electronic interactions between Ni2+ and Fe3+ are evident both in the mixed-metal "torso" region and at the "torso/wing" interface with increasing Ni3+ as a result of electron transfer from Ni2+ to Fe3+ mediated by the oxo bridge. The amount of Ni3+ also increases in the "wings", which is believed to be a consequence of charge balancing between Ni and O ions due to the presence of Ni vacancies upon formation of the heterostructure. The high-valence Ni3+ with enhanced Lewis acidity helps strengthen the binding with OH- to afford oxygen-containing intermediates, thus accelerating the OER process. Direct evidence of FeNi/Ni HS facilitating the formation of the Ni-OOH intermediate was provided by in situ Raman studies; the intermediate was produced at lower oxidation potentials than when Ni-2(CO3)(OH)(2) was used as the reference. The Co congener (FeCo/Co HS), prepared in a similar fashion, also showed excellent catalytic performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000834526100001	36093013

Although many substrate-supported nanostructured electrocatalysts present attractive performance at small currents, they cannot sustain industry-level high current densities for long-term operation. Herein, by chemically organizing nanoscale electrocatalysts into a macroscopic substrate-free metallic alloy aerogel, this NiFe-based nano-catalyst achieves 1000-h durability at industrial-level current densities, with exceptionally high activities of 500 mA at the overpotential of only 281 mV. This NiFe alloy aerogel is constructed by a magnetic-field assisted growth and assembly of ferromagnetic NiFe nanoparticles, in which nanowires are loosely crosslinked by metallic joints. This alloy aerogel shows a high electric conductivity of 500 S m(-1), structural stability for more than 1.5 years in alkaline electrolyte, and almost complete recovery after compression exceeding 50% strain for 1000 cycles. The excellent mechanical stability of this metallic aerogel behaves as the key contributor to the superior electrocatalytic stability under industrially relevant conditions. This work offers a paradigm for electrode design for the practical application of nano-catalysts in industrial alkaline water electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000842179700001	35980943

Interconnected particles (40 nm) of Ba0.6Sr0.4Co0.79Fe0.21O2.67 (BSCF) are decorated by 10-50 wt % Ni0.6Fe0.4(OH)(x) [NiFe] layered double hydroxide (LDH) sheets via polyethylenimine linkage. This composite renders modulation of surface charges through Coulombic interaction and provides a leeway for electron mobility between the two components, which bestows relief to the BSCF surface from oxidative degradation. NiFe-LDH (25 wt %) bound to BSCF (BSCF/NiFe-25) is found to be the optimized bifunctional composite after considering the total overpotential of oxygen evolution and reduction reactions. With BSCF/NiFe-25 at the air electrode of a prototype rechargeable Zn-air battery, a low discharge charge voltage gap (1.16 V at 10 mA cm(-2)), unaltered cyclic stability over 100 h, and an energy density of 776.3 mW.h.g(Zn)(-1) are achieved. BSCF/NiFe-25 outperforms BSCF and is comparable to 20% Pt/C-RuO2 cathodes in all the standard figures of merit. Our work presents a general strategy to circumvent the reconstructions of perovskite oxide surface under oxidative potentials, by creating highly active, stable, and inexpensive bifunctional composite electrocatalysts for future electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices.									27	0	0	0	1	0	26			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000489001900038	31490056

Recently, the water oxidation catalyzed by potassium ferrate (K2FeO4) was investigated on the basis of experimental kinetic isotope effect analysis assisted by density functional calculations, revealing the intramolecular oxo-coupling mechanism within a di-iron(VI) intermediate, or diferrate [Sarma et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2012, 134, 15371]. Here, we report a detailed examination of this diferrate-mediated O-O bond formation using scalable multireference electronic structure theory. High-dimensional correlated many-electron wave functions beyond the one-electron picture were computed using the ab initio density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method along the O-O bond formation pathway. The necessity of using large active space arises from the description of complex electronic interactions and varying redox states both associated with two-center antiferromagnetic multivalent iron-oxo coupling. Dynamic correlation effects on top of the active space DMRG wave functions were additively accounted for by complete active space second-order perturbation (CASPT2) and multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) based methods, which were recently introduced by our group. These multireference methods were capable of handling the double shell effects in the extended active space treatment. The calculations with an active space of 36 electrons in 32 orbitals, which is far over conventional limitation, provide a quantitatively reliable prediction of potential energy profiles and confirmed the viability of the direct oxo coupling. The bonding nature of Fe-O and dual bonding character of O-O are discussed using natural orbitals.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000337122000018	24686771

The electrical conductivity was measured by 4-probe dc-conductivity measurement while abruptly changing oxygen partial pressure (pO(2)) in [-2.25 <= log(pO(2)/atm)<=-0.65] range at a fixed water vapor pressure (pH(2)O), and changing the pH(2)O in [-3.15 <= log(pH(2)O/atm) <=-2.35] range in air. The consequent evolution of the electrical conductivity is recorded as a function of time, at different temperatures in 800-950 degrees C range and the transient behavior during the re-equilibration process is analyzed. During the oxidation/reduction at a fixed pH(2)O, the electrical conductivity showed monotonic relaxation behavior by ambipolar diffusion of V-0(center dot center dot) and H-i(center dot), and the conductivity relaxation process was governed only by the diffusivity of oxygen and the approach to the equilibrium became faster at the higher pH(2)O and higher temperature. On the other hand, during the hydration/dehydration process at a fixed pO(2), a non-monotonic relaxation behavior was observed due to the decoupled diffusion of H and O components with the mediation of holes, thus confirming the non-monotonic twofold relaxation in mixed perovslcite-type oxide BCN18. The values of surface exchange coefficients and diffusivities of oxygen and hydrogen were calculated from Fick's second law by nonlinear least squire fitting of the conductivity data.

The PdCrOx/SrTiO3 samples were synthesized by a photodeposition method under UV light irradiation (lambda > 300 nm) for various time periods (0-5 h). The fine structure and valence state of the Pd species of PdCrOx nanoparticles were varied from Pd oxide to a mixture of metallic Pd and oxidized Pd species with an increase in the irradiation time. The overall water-splitting activity of PdCrOx was strongly dependent on the photoirradiation time during deposition. Although longer photoirradiation time during preparation did not influence the H-2 evolution activity of PdCrOx/SrTiO3 from aqueous methanol solution, it was effective in suppressing the O-2 photoreduction activity, which is one of the backward reactions during overall water splitting.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16				2073-4344		WOS:000459732000059

Here, MoxCoxC (mainly below 20 nm in size) confined in uniform carbon polyhedrons (MoxCoxC@C) was synthesized based on trapping [PMo12O40](3-) (PMo12) clusters into pre-synthesized, uniform ZIF-67 (PMo/ZIF-67). The opening of the windows (0.34 nm) of ZIF-67 cages through heating is essential to allow the trapping of PMo12 into the cages. This trapping route provides a new method to successfully combine POMs and MOFs that can not be effectively combined via traditional POMOF-based (simultaneous assembly) routes. It also has advantages in controlling the uniformity and components of the materials. The size matching of PMo12 (1 nm) and the cages (1.16 nm) of ZIF-67 enables effective contact of the Co and Mo sources, thus giving small-sized MoxCoxC protected by carbon via calcination. The optimized catalysts showed good performance for water splitting with a low 10 of 83 mV (295 mV) for the hydrogen (oxygen) evolution reaction, which is superior to those derived from ZIF-67 and precursors from POMOF-based routes. Our results also indicated that the HER activity is determined by the kind of BTMC, and the activity for the OER is relative to the oxygen-containing species formed during the initial OER test.									140	10	0	0	7	0	141			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000434243300003	29910925

Herein, we employed a one-pot boriding strategy to turn the spent LiNiCoMnO2 batteries into magnetic mixed metallic borides (NiCoMnBs) for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A metal ion recovery rate of 99.91%, 99.92%, and 99.84% has been achieved for Ni, Co and Mn, respectively. The optimized catalyst demonstrates a highly competitive OER activity, and only an overpotential of 372 mV is required to drive the high current density of 500 mA cm(-2), surpassing many other Ni, Co, Mn mono-, bi- or tri-metallic OER catalysts as well as the commercial RuO2 catalyst. Detailed mechanism studies suggest that the superior OER performance is mainly ascribed to B etching induced in situ generation of the core@shell structured tri-metal borides@(oxy)hydroxides nanostructures during the water oxidation process. Fast charge-transfer kinetics and the hierarchical amorphous/nanocrystalline structure with rich catalytic active sites are also aiding the high activity. The boriding strategy reported here can be further applied to synergistically recycle and regenerate efficient electroactive materials from other metal-rich wastes for achieving a sustainable energy future.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000683072800001

Here we present a series of cobaltite perovskite LaCoO(3)particles which have been doped with 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30% of Sr(2+)and have been synthesized by a combined sol-gel and molten-salt synthesis procedure, which provides a regular morphology of the particles. These Sr2+-doped LaCoO(3)particles have been characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Moreover, these Sr(2+)doped LaCoO(3)particles have been demonstrated as efficient catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) based on the measured specific capacitance, total charge, most accessible charge, electrochemically active surface area, and roughness factor using rotating disk and rotating ring-disk electrode techniques. The 30% Sr2+-doped LaCoO(3)sample shows enhanced electrocatalytic OER activity in 0.5 M H(2)SO(4)media compared to the LaCoO(3)samples doped with 0, 5, 10, and 20% Sr2+. Among all five LaCoO(3)samples, the doped LaCoO(3)samples demonstrate better OER activity than the undoped sample.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2296-8016			WOS:000575150800001

In previous studies, the morphology evolution of the VG films synthesized by the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process has been investigated. This work focuses on the impact of the morphologies of the VG films on photocatalytic properties. Three morphologies of the VG films, VG with porous graphene (VG-P), 'forest-like' graphene (VG-F), and 'wall-like' vertical graphene (VG-W), are fabricated and the photodegradation properties are investigated. In order to enhance the photodegradation property of the VG films, the surface of the VG films with different morphologies is treated with oxygen plasma, in which the oxygen plasma treated VG-P, VG-F, and VGW are named as VG-P-O, VG-F-O, and VG-W-O, respectively. As a result, the VG-P-O shows the best degradation performance of 82.6% for methylene blue and 86.7% for methyl orange, which is attributed to the desirable porous structure and the modified hydrophilicity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000772634500001

Herein, 2D porous Pt nanosheets composed by interweaved ultrathin nanowires are successfully fabricated via a facile NaCl-templated process. Controlled experiments demonstrate that the adoption of NaCl and appropriate ratio of NaCl and Pt precursor are indispensable for the formation of porous Pt nanosheets. Impressively, the cost-effective NaCl template can be recyclable through a simple recrystallization procedure, which may greatly reduce the synthetic cost. By virtue of their structural merits, including high porosity, 2D anisotropy and abundant defects, the resultant porous Pt nanosheets exhibit superior activity and enhanced stability towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to the commercial Pt black in alkaline medium. The present study not only offers a high-performance electrocatalyst for fuel cell devices, but also provides a new perspective toward the rational synthesis of 2D noble metal nanosheets with high porosity and diverse functionalities.

J	Abdel-Basset, R; Bader, KP								Physiological analyses of the hydrogen gas exchange in cyanobacteria								JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY				43	2			146	151		10.1016/S1011-1344(98)00097-9				MAY 15 1998	1998	Mass spectrometric analysis of the light-induced hydrogen gas exchange in the cyanobacteria Oscillatoria chalybea, Synechocystis PCC 6803, Synechococcus PCC 6301 (Synechococcus leopoliensis; Anacystis nidulans) and Synechococcus elongatus has been carried out by direct detection of molecular hydrogen at m/e = 2 in the HID collector of a 'delta' mass spectrometer. The time curves of the signals reveal an initial outburst of hydrogen at the onset of light, with a subsequent superimposition of a hydrogen uptake in the case of Oscillatoria chalybea. With in vivo cultures of Synechocystis PCC 6803, which have not been shown to photoevolve molecular hydrogen so far, we are able to measure very small but clearly detectable evolution and uptake signals. The principal qualitative features of the transition from hydrogen evolution to uptake during the illumination period in the cases of Oscillatoria chalybea and Synechocystis PCC 6803 are about identical, Upon addition of increasing concentrations of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), an increased stable hydrogen photoevolution shows up with the hydrogen uptake being completely suppressed. In the case of Oscillatoria chalybea this effect is obtained with 5 mu M CCCP, whereas with Synechocystis PCC 6803 generally higher CCC concentrations are required to stabilize the hydrogen evolution over time. However, in the presence of CCCP the hydrogen evolution from Synechocystis PCC 6803 (which is nearly negligible in the controls without additions) reaches values very similar to those observed with Oscillatoria chalybea. The stimulatory effect of CCCP is clearly distinct from an uncoupling of electron transport and photophosphorylation. as the addition of ammonium chloride inhibits hydrogen evolution but exerts the expected effect of stimulation of photosynthetic oxygen evolution. However, modification of the pH value of the reaction buffer results in a clear dependency of the hydrogen gas exchange on the external proton concentration. Basic pH values at about >9 diminish the gas exchange signal as a whole. Acidic pH at about 4-5 substantially increases the evolution and decreases the uptake part of the gas exchange signals, Thus, ar a pH of 4.4, the hydrogen gas exchange signal largely corresponds to the one observed with a assay at pH 7.5 but in the presence of CCCP, When the cyanobacterial reaction assays are flushed with pure nitrogen or with N-2/CO2 (1%), the hydrogen evolution rates are by no means decreased; in some cases the hydrogen photoevolution appeals rather to be stimulated by the presence of CO2 in the flushing gas. Concomitant recording of the light-induced carbon dioxide reveals a strong initial CO2 uptake which is substantially diminished within the first minute of illumination. Thus, mass spectrometric analysis of the light-induced carbon dioxide gas exchange favours the CO2 concentrating mechanism discussed for cyanobacteria rather than the light activation of a dark inactive Calvin cycle.

In this study, we demonstrated an appealing non-equilibrium growth model to give sub-2 nm CuO clusters not from the growth of nuclei but from the top-down growth of metastable bulk crystals. These CuO clusters have high density and intriguingly uniform orientation, and are atomically scattered on an inactive ultrathin AlOOH substrate, which has been driven by the lattice matching between the CuO clusters and the utlrathin AlOOH substrate. The catalytic activity of CuO clusters, with the hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol as a model reaction, proved to be extremely efficient and showed a rate constant of 130.0 s(-1) g(-1), outperforming the commercial Pd/C catalysts and reported state-of-the-art noble-metal catalysts (1.89-117.2 s(-1) g(-1)). These clusters have abundant interfacial oxygen vacancies (OVs) whose concentration can be regulated, and the OVs are found to be essential, according to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, in reducing the energy barrier of catalytic reduction and significantly boosting the catalytic reaction. These findings could add to the library of crystals downsized to the atomic level and demonstrate how engineering point defects on the sub-nanometer materials help design high-efficient catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000758367800001	35188512

The formation of the Cu2O/Cu metal/semiconductor core structure played a key role in increasing the conductivity and facilitated the fast charge transfer process during the electrochemical reaction. Engineering the chemical coupling of the active CoO shell provided a large surface roughness to the benefit of abundant adsorbed active OH- species for the OER. The synergetic effect of the fast charge transfer cores and active shells enhanced the OER. By adjusting the raw ratio of Cu/Co to 1/2, Cu2O/Cu@CoO exhibited the lowest overpotential of 330 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2). This facile chemical method, which coupled CoO nanoparticles with Cu2O/Cu hollow spheres, could pave the way for controlling the fabrication of other core-shell binary transition metal oxide heterogeneous catalysts in electrochemical applications.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2052-1553			WOS:000475394700003

Specifically, development of a new type of energy-saving materials with convenient method is regarded as the current bottleneck. Herein, an innovative strategy based on amino trimethylene phosphonic acid (ATMP) as chelating agent for cobalt-metaphosphate coordination polymer is reported to one-pot synthesis of a novel precursor in methanol for ORR electrocatalyst. Carbonization of the precursor at 900 degrees C at N-2 atmosphere results in the feasible formation of cobalt metaphosphate based composite (Co(PO3)(2)/NC). A further step in the thermal cleavage at 650 degrees C at air for 4 h, Co(PO3)(2)/NC can be finally transformed into inorganic Co(PO3)(2). Advanced spectroscopic techniques and density function theory (DFT) calculations are applied to confirm the main catalytically active center and the physical properties of Co(PO3)(2)/NC. This obtained Co(PO3)(2)/NC nanocomposite exhibits superior electrocatalysis to Co(PO3)(2) with an enhanced onset potential (0.906 V vs. RHE) and diffusion limiting current (5.062 mA cm(2)), which are roughly close to those of commercial 20% Pt/C (0.916 V, 5.200 mA cm(2)).

In this paper, we have studied the superior effect of methanol and aniline hydrochloride on photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by cactus-type bpydc@Fe2O3/TiO2 hybrid nanomaterials from solar water splitting. The bandgap of TiO2 has been tuned by the composite formation using organic bpydc and inorganic Fe2O3 nanomaterials. The studied heterojunction significantly suppresses the photogenerated charge recombination rate has been proved by the photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). The addition of methanol remarkably enhances the hydrogen evolution rate which serves as a sacrificial agent. The effect of proton sources on photocatalytic performance has been studied in detail. In the optimized system, the addition of aniline hydrochloride as a proton source has shown the highest rate of hydrogen generation (30.4 mL/h). This fundamental study along with the proposed mechanism based on several influences on the production of hydrogen from solar water splitting may open up new insights into the architectural design of photocatalysts for effective solar energy conversion.

How to construct an effective photocarrier transmission route in Fe2O3 has become an important bottleneck for enhancing OER performance. Herein, we exploit a core-shell nanorod structure loaded with FeCo Prussian blue (FCP) to boost the water oxidation kinetics and charge transfer efficiency for the first time. As expected, the optimal gamma-Fe2O3/alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode exhibits a remarkable photocurrent density of 2.4 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE; when a cocatalyst FCP is introduced as a hole-transport layer, it shows a photocurrent density of 3.5 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is 8.7 times higher than that of the pure alpha-Fe2O3. The outstanding photochemical performance could be attributed to the highest separation efficiency. A further study on the carrier lifetime was performed and clarified that the photocarrier lifetime of the gamma-Fe2O3/alpha-Fe2O3/FCP photoanode is prolonged (similar to 50.64 ps) as compared to that of the pure alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode (similar to 21.00 ps) using femtosecond time-resolved absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS). This work successfully explains the photocatalytic water oxidation mechanism in the gamma-Fe2O3/alpha-Fe2O3/FCP photoanode and provides an effective insight into designing a photocarrier delivery channel for the outstanding water oxidation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000720967700001

Here, we report a method of tuning structure of PtCu3 alloy nanoparticle by annealing in different atmospheres. The detailed analyses showed that evolution of surface structure and phase structure of PtCu3 alloy nanoparticles heat-treated in N2 atmosphere and N2/H2 mixed atmosphere are mainly as follows: (1) when heat-treated in N2, the crystal phase of PtCu3 has undergone a transformation from disordered PtCu3 alloy to ordered PtCu3 alloy and then to disordered PtCu3 alloy with the increase of holding time from 30 min to 90 min; (2) when heat-treated in H2/N2, a Pt-rich surface is formed on the Pt -Cu nanoparticles due to Pt segregation induced by H2 adsorption. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that both PtCu3/C-N2 electrocatalysts prepared in N2 and PtCu3/CN2/H2 electrocatalysts prepared in H2/N2 exhibit enhanced mass activities toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) relative to Pt/C electrocatalyst in acidic media. In particular, when the holding time is 90 min, the obtained PtCu3/C-N2/H2 electrocatalysts with Pt-rich surface showed highest mass activity of 435 mA/mgPt (at 0.9 V vs. RHE), which is four times greater than that of Pt/C catalyst (20 wt.% Pt, 115 mA/mgPt). This study provides a promising method for the reasonable design and preparation of low cost and high performance Pt-based electrocatalysts. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Researchers implement surface-active OFGs to improve the electrocatalytic properties of graphite felt electrodes in vanadium flow batteries. Herein, we show that graphitic defects and not OFGs are responsible for lowering the activation energy barrier and thus enhance the charge transfer properties. This is proven by a thermal deoxygenation procedure, in which specific OFGs are removed before electrochemical cycling. The electronic and microstructural changes associated with deoxygenation are studied by quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy. The removal of oxygen groups at basal and edge planes improves the activity by introducing new active edge sites and carbon vacancies. OFGs hinder the charge transfer at the graphite-electrolyte interface. This is further proven by modifying the sp(2) plane of graphite felt electrodes with oxygen-containing pyrene derivatives. The electrochemical evolution of OFGs and graphitic defects are studied during polarization and long-term cycling conditions. The hypothesis of increased activity caused by OFGs was refuted and hydrogenated graphitic edge sites were identified as the true reason for this increase.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000661976300001

The relative importance of the different upsilon' contributions, both to the classical and quantum more averaged quantities has been interpreted with the help of the state-to-state opacity function. Finally, the alternating vibrational distribution and its evolution with translational energy are discussed within the context of a Franck-Condon type model.									41	0	1	0	0	0	42			0301-0104			WOS:A1995QE00500001

The structure evolution and ablation behavior of the coating under single and cyclic ablation were investigated in an oxyacetylene torch environment. Single ablation results show that the ablated coating consists of three layers (outer ZrO2 layer, transitional ZrCxOy layer and residual ZrC layer). An oxidation progress is inferred that ZrC is oxidized into ZrCxOy firstly and then into ZrO2 in the case of the continuous diffusion of oxygen. Cyclic ablation results show that the effect of crack growth inhibition and the oxygen diffusion limitation of ZrO2 and ZrCxOy layers dominate the ablation of the coating and result in two different ablation behaviors. Based on the role of the ZrO2 and ZrCxOy layers in the single and cyclic ablation, two different ablation modes of the coating are proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

Here, we report an intriguing lightening of the photoluminescence (PL) from the edge to the interior over time in the WS2 monolayers grown by physical vapor deposition method, with the whole monolayer brightened eventually. Comprehensive optical studies reveal that the PL enhancement arises from the p doping induced by oxygen adsorption. First-principles calculations unveil that the dissociation of chemisorbed oxygen molecule plays a significant role; i.e., the dissociation at one site can largely promote the dissociation at a nearby site, facilitating the photoluminescence lightening. In addition, we further manipulate such PL brightening rate by controlling the oxygen concentration and the temperature. The presented results uncover the extraordinary surface chemistry and related mechanism in WS2 monolayers, which deepens our insight into their unique PL evolution behavior.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000795031700037	35226511

The onset potential of the hybrid is 0.88 V vs. RHE and the half-wave potential is only 60 mV negative from that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The diffusion-limit current density of this catalyst reaches 5.47 mAcm (-2), which is very close to that of Pt/C. The electron-transfer number of ORR on the py-CB/Co3O4 is 3.9, indicating a desirable four-electron reduction pathway. Moreover, the hybrid catalyst exhibits a much higher durability toward the ORR than the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The py-CB/ Co3O4 composite catalyst is highly competitive compared to other carbon-based catalysts, owing to its high activity, excellent stability, and especially the use of inexpensive CB and the ease of preparation. This work may open a new avenue for the design and preparation of ORR catalysts based on cheap and commercially available CB.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2196-0216			WOS:000410500100020

Catalytic performance not only critically depends on the size of the supported Au nanoparticles (NPs) but also strongly on the chemical nature of the iron oxide. In this study, Au NPs supported on iron oxide nanorods with different surface properties through beta-FeOOH annealing, at varying temperatures, were synthesized, and applied in the CO oxidation. Detailed characterizations of the interactions between Au NPs and iron oxides were obtained by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results indicate that the surface hydroxyl group on the Au/FeOOH catalyst, before calcination (Au/FeOOH-fresh), could facilitate the oxygen adsorption and dissociation on positively charged Au, thereby contributing to the low-temperature CO oxidation reactivity. After calcination at 200 degrees C under air exposure, the chemical state of the supported Au NP on varied iron oxides partly changed from metal cation to Au-0, along with the disappearance of the surface OH species. Au/FeOOH with the highest Au-0 content exhibits the highest activity in CO oxidation, among the as-synthesized catalysts. Furthermore, good durability in CO oxidation was achieved over the Au/FeOOH catalyst for 12 h without observable deactivation. In addition, the advanced identical-location TEM method was applied to the gas phase reaction to probe the structure evolution of the Au/iron oxide series of the catalysts and support structure. A Au NP size-dependent Ostwald ripening process mediated by the transport of Au(CO)(x) mobile species under certain reaction conditions is proposed, which offers a new insight into the validity of the structure-performance relationship.

Here, we report a versatile template-directed strategy for synthesizing multimetallic ASNSs. As a proof-of-concept, ternary Pd44Pt30Ir26 ASNSs are elaborately synthesized and applied as robust bifunctional electrocatalysts toward overall water splitting. The products are mesocrystalline 2D superstructures derived from lamellar stacking of ultrathin Pd-Pt-Ir NSs. During electrocatalysis, the multilayered superstructures can locally concentrate reactants within the parallel subnanometer interlayer spacings and essentially intensify the morphological stability. Featured with electronically modulated Pt-IrOx dual active sites, the products exhibit high efficiency and durable bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for overall water splitting in 1.0 M KOH, presenting 46 and 92 mV lower overpotential than the state-of-the-art Pt/C and Ir/C for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively. Significantly, they can realize stable H-2 production at a large current of 500 mA in an anion exchange membrane electrolyzer. This work fully proves that the integration of an ordered 2D superstructure and electronic-modulated multiple reactive sites has broad prospects for advanced electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000813272400001

There are still many unqualified phenomena in the test of PMA samples on the construction site, which causes a confusion of suppler. To obtain the high quality of asphalt pavement, the effects of thermal degradation on PMA during storage and transportation become very important. This paper investigates physical properties and molecular structure of PMA samples by a series of test. The results of conventional tests indicated that time, temperature and oxygen concentration (thermal degradation test in thin air (TDTTA) and TFOT) have great effects on the deterioration of asphalt performance. For TDTTA or TFOT, the PMA exhibit performance erosion with time increasing. Moreover, the influences of temperature on physical properties of three PMA can be ranked as follows:163 degrees C> 150 degrees C> 130 degrees C. Compared with the effects of TDTTA on physical properties of three PMA, the TFOT has a more significant effect on physical properties of three PMA. The reason is that many scholars main focus on the study of conditions of high oxygen concentrated. Moreover, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) displayed that there were no chemical reaction found in three PMA. For TDTTA or TFOT, the degradation reaction of polymer in three PMA can clearly present base on analysis results of gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and FTIR. The performance erosion of PMA is more obvious in the air/oxygen compared with performance erosion of PMA in the thin air/oxygen, but the performance degradation cannot be ignored when the air/oxygen is lack during the process of practical applications.

The necessity of exploring ORR catalysts with immunity to anion adsorption is particularly significant considering that platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts are costly and highly vulnerable to impurities such as halides. Herein, we report a metal organic framework (MOF)-derived Fe-N-C catalyst that exhibits a dramatically improved half-wave potential of 240 mV compared to the state-of-the-art RhxSy/C catalyst in a rotating disk electrode in the presence of Cl-. The Fe-N-4 active sites in Fe-N-C are intrinsically immune to Clpoisoning, in contrast to Pt/C, which is severely susceptible to Cr poisoning. As a result, the activity of Fe-N-C decreases only marginally in the presence of Cr, far exceeding that of Pt/C. The viability of this catalyst as ODCs is further demonstrated in real-life hydrochloric acid electrolyzers using highly concentrated HC1 solution saturated with C1(2) gas as the electrolyte. The introduction of Fe-N-C materials as ODC catalysts here overcomes the limitations of (i) the low intrinsic ORR activity of RhxSy/C as the state-of-the-art ODC catalyst; (ii) the vulnerability to Cr poisoning of Pt/C as the state-of-the-art ORR catalyst; and (iii) the high cost of precious metals in these two materials, resulting in a cost-effective ODC catalyst with the overall performance exceeding that of all previously reported materials.									22	0	0	0	0	0	21			0743-7463			WOS:000411549700002	28445640

The PGTSR exhibited high photoactivity for pure water and artificial seawater splitting without sacrificial agents in single reactor under 4 -h simulated sunlight irradiation. The hydrogen/oxygen evolution rates (HER/OER) reached 80.1/41.2 mu mol.g(-1) and 94.0/45.1 mu mol.g(-1) in pure and artificial seawater splitting, respectively. The separated H-2 evolution from O-2 through the photocatalytic artificial seawater splitting was also carried out in a twin photoreactor, which was divided by a Neosepta membrane with IO3-/I- shuttle mediator and used commercial WO3 as O-2-photocatalyst, was achieved with HER/OER of 41.5/26.1 mu mol.g(-1) after 4 -h simulated sunlight irradiation.

Supported single-atom bifunctional catalysts are therefore of great economic interest and scientific importance. Here, on the basis of first-principles computations, we report a design of the first single-atom bifunctional eletrocatalyst, namely, isolated nickel atom supported on beta 12 boron monolayer (Ni-1/beta(12)-BM), to achieve overall water splitting. This nanosheet supported SAC exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic performance with the computed overpotential for oxygen/hydrogen evolution reaction being just 0.40/0.06 V. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulation shows that the SAC can survive up to 800 K elevated temperature, while enacting a high energy barrier of 1.68 eV to prevent isolated Ni atoms from clustering. A viable experimental route for the synthesis of Ni-1/beta(12)-BM SAC is demonstrated from computer simulation. The desired nanosheet supported single-atom bifunctional catalysts not only show great potential for achieving overall water splitting but also offer cost-effective opportunities for advancing clean energy technology.									276	12	0	0	10	0	275			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000407540300086	28745889

Traditionally, these catalytic processes have been performed by platinum-group metal catalysts, which are effective at promoting water electrolysis but expensive and rare. The search for an inexpensive and Earth-abundant catalyst has led to the development of 3d-transition-metal phosphides for the hydrogen evolution reaction. These catalysts have shown excellent activity and stability. In this review, we discuss the electronic and crystal structures of bulk and surface of selected Fe, Co, and Ni phosphides, and their relationships to the experimental catalytic activity. The various synthetic protocols towards the state-of-the-art transition metal phosphide electrocatalysts are also discussed.									57	0	0	0	1	0	57			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000434074600004	29172022

These reactions can be performed at metallic surface sites on heterogeneous electrocatalysts or through redox mediation at molecular electrocatalysts. The relative ease of synthesis and characterization for homogeneous catalysts has allowed for molecular-level control over the active site and permitted systematic tuning of activity and selectivity. Similar control is difficult to achieve with heterogeneous electrocatalysts, because they typically exhibit a distribution of active site geometries and local electronic structures, which are challenging to modify with molecular precision. However, metallic heterogeneous electrocatalysts benefit from a continuum of electronic states that distribute the redox burden of multielectron transformations, enabling more efficient catalysis. We envisioned that we could combine the attractive properties of molecular and heterogeneous catalysts by integrating tunable molecular active sites into the delocalized band states of a conductive solid.The Surendranath group has developed a class of electrocatalysts in which molecules are strongly electronically coupled to graphitic electrodes through a conductive, aromatic pyrazine linkage such that they behave like metallic surface active sites. In this Account, we discuss the dual role of these graphite-conjugated catalysts (GCCs) as a platform with which to answer molecular-level questions of metallic active sites and as a tool with which to fundamentally alter the mechanism and enhance the performance of molecular active sites. We begin by describing the electrochemical and spectroscopic studies that demonstrated that GCC sites behave like metallic active sites rather than simply as redox mediators attached to electrode surfaces. We then discuss how electrochemical studies of a series of graphite-conjugated acids enabled the construction of a molecular model for the thermochemistry of proton-coupled electron transfer reactions at GCC sites based on the pK(a) of the molecular analogue of the conjugated site and the potential of zero free charge of the electrode. In the final section, we discuss the effects of graphite conjugation on the mechanism and rate of oxygen reduction, hydrogen evolution, and carbon dioxide reduction catalysis across four different GCC platforms involving N-heterocycle, organometallic, and metalloporphyrin active sites. We discuss how molecular-level tuning at graphite-conjugated active sites directly correlates to changes in catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction. We demonstrate that graphite-conjugated porphyrins show enhanced catalytic oxygen reduction activity over amide-linked porphyrins. Lastly, we describe how catalysis at graphite-conjugated sites proceeds through mechanisms involving concerted electron transfer and substrate activation, in stark contrast to the mechanisms observed for molecular analogues. Overall, we showcase how GCCs provide a rich platform for controlling heterogeneous catalysis at the molecular level.									45	0	0	0	4	0	45			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000503910400014	31714746

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY				77	8			2049	2057		10.1111/j.1151-2916.1994.tb07096.x				AUG 1994	1994	The oxidation behavior of a 2D woven C/SiC composite partly protected with a SiC seal coating and heat-treated (stabilized) at 1600-degrees-C in inert gas has been investigated through an experimental approach based on thermogravimetric analyses and optical/electron microscopy. Results of the tests, performed under flowing oxygen, have shown that the oxidation behavior of the composite material in terms of oxidation kinetics and morphological evolutions is related to the presence of thermal microcracks in the seal coating as well as in the matrix. Three different temperature domains exist. At low temperatures (<800-degrees-C), the mechanisms of reaction between carbon and oxygen control the oxidation kinetics and are associated with a uniform degradation of the carbon reinforcement. At intermediate temperatures, (between 800-degrees and 1100-degrees-C), the oxidation kinetics are controlled by the gas-phase diffusion through a network of microcracks in the SiC coating, resulting in a nonuniform degradation of the carbon phases. At high temperatures (>1100-degrees-C), such diffusion mechanisms are limited by sealing of the microcracks by silica; therefore, the degradation of the composite remains superficial. The study of the oxidation behavior of (i) the heat-treated composite in a lower oxygen content environment (dry air) and (iii) the as-processed (unstabilized) composite in dry oxygen confirms the different mechanisms proposed to explain the oxidation behavior of the composite material.									152	26	1	0	0	0	173			0002-7820			WOS:A1994PC50900009

Electrochemical analysis such as cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectrometry, and Tafel test was utilized to determine different behavior of electrodes. According to gas chromatography results, pyrrole removal efficiency at a constant current density of 17 mA cm-2 during 6 h was in the range of 83%-100% for Sn/SnO2 and CP electrodes, respectively. The denitrification reaction using CP, Gr, and Sn/SnO2 electrodes was diffusion-controlled regarding data extracted from cyclic voltammetry at various scan rates. However, the adsorption mechanism was dominated by Pt and Pb/PbO2 electrodes. Tafel analysis demonstrated that the electrocatalytic activity of electrodes is as follows: Pt > CP > Gr > Pb/PbO2 > Sn/SnO2. Besides, the formation of polypyrrole and low oxygen evolution potential diminished Pt pyrrole removal efficiency. Carbon-based electrodes with pyrrole oxidation potential near Pt electrode and higher oxygen evolution potential can be utilized as efficient and cost-effective electrodes in the denitrification process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000663159800002

In particular, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during water splitting renders the need of a catalyst indispensable. However, the development of catalysts is often based on laboratorial trial-and-error approaches and complex synthetic routes. Herein, the facile and systematic synthesis of pentlandite-like FexNi9-xS8 (x=0-9) nanosized particles from its elements with distinct Fe: Ni ratios was achieved using a mechanochemical method. The OER performance is optimized through tailoring the surface properties via altering the catalyst composition. The catalytic activity increases with higher nickel content in the structure, accomplishing an overpotential of 354 and 420 mV for 'Ni9S8' to drive 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, with high stability. The in-situ formed nickel oxide/hydroxide species concurrent with sulphur depletion from the pentlandite structure upon OER are more active than NiS, inferring the crucial role of the pentlandite structure in activity. The herein reported simple synthetic approach could bring significant progress in the catalyst material development via rationally screening pentlandites with desired properties for modern energy systems.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2196-0216			WOS:000686160300001

Electronic properties of reactants based on Mulliken atomic charge and electrostatic potential reveal the attack sites and electron donation from char to NO during the chemisorption, which is consistent with HOMO and LUMO analysis. Two stages of NO secondary chemisorption, N2 and N2O formation are included in the evolution pathway of NO reduction, and the second NO chemisorption is determined as the rate-limiting step of NO reduction. Meanwhile, the migration of the oxygen atom is favorable for NO reduction, resulting in the preferred pathway of N2 formation than N2O in thermodynamics. According to the kinetic calculation, the reaction rate constant of NO reduction to release N2 is 1.438E thorn 01 s-1 at 900 K, and the corresponding activation energies of N2 and N2O formation are 37.97 and 78.02 kcal/mol respectively, which is in coincidence with previous experiments. Mayer bond order analysis exhibits the C-N, N-O and N-N bond evolution of two rate-limiting steps, together with the bond strength between atoms.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0360-5442	1873-6785		WOS:000792620600004

To optimize and improve the performance, the optimal operating conditions were deduced from the numerical simulation and validated using experimental data. Under the optimized conditions, the current efficiencies of alkali-sorbent regeneration and H2SO4 reached 84 and 87%, respectively, which is comparable to those obtained in the chlor-alkali industry. Therefore, this method has the potential to be scaled up. If this technology is integrated into an existing FGD facility, the money-consuming chemical process could be transferred into a renewable resource and clean energy conversion process.

To address this challenge, herein, we encapsulated CsPbBr3 nanocrystals into a stable iron-based metal-organic framework (MOF) with mesoporous cages (similar to 5.5 and 4.2 nm) via a sequential deposition route to obtain a perovskite-MOF composite material, CsPbBr3@PCN-333(Fe), in which CsPbBr3 nanocrystals were stabilized from aggregation or leaching by the confinement effect of MOF cages. The monodispersed CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (4-5 nm) within the MOF lattice were directly observed by transmission electron microscopy and corresponding mapping analysis and further confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and N-2 adsorption characterizations. Density functional theory calculations further suggested a significant interfacial charge transfer from CsPbBr3 quantum dots to PCN-333(Fe), which is ideal for photocatalysis. The CsPbBr3@PCN-333(Fe) composite exhibited excellent and stable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activities in aprotic systems. Furthermore, CsPbBr3@PCN-333(Fe) composite worked as the synergistic photocathode in the photoassisted Li-O-2 battery, where CsPbBr3 and PCN-333(Fe) acted as optical antennas and ORR/OER catalytic sites, respectively. The CsPbBr3@PCN-333(Fe) photocathode showed lower overpotential and better cycling stability compared to CsPbBr3 nanocrystals or PCN-333(Fe), highlighting the synergy between CsPbBr3 and PCN-333(Fe) in the composite.									33	1	0	0	3	0	33			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000696018700027	34459185

Herein, a dual oxygen group (C-O-C and C = O) doped carbon nitride (ACN*) was prepared by a two-step thermal treatment process. The photocatalyst showed high and stable photocatalytic activity for the degradation and mineralization of refractory organic pollutants under visible light irradiation, as demonstrated with bisphenol A, phenol, 2-chlorphenol and diphenhydramine. By electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, higher valence-electron densities were formed around the O atoms of C-O-C and C = O groups than around C and N atoms, constructing an internal electric field in ACN*, which was enhanced by light irradiation and the adsorption of pollutants by hydrogen bond and n-n bond interactions. Correspondingly, transfer processes of photogenerated carriers were proposed based on all experimental information obtained for pollutant photodegradation, including transfer of photoexcited electrons to the region around O atoms in the two types of oxygen groups, reaction with O-2 to form center dot O- 2, and donation of electrons from adsorbed pollutants to electron-poor tri-s-triazine motifs in ACN*. The synergetic oxidation by the two processes contributed to higher photodegradation of pollutants. This correlation between the transfer of photogenerated carries and pollutant degradation shed a new light on the construction of internal electric field in carbon nitride photocatalysis.									63	2	0	0	12	0	63			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000483451200069

Accordingly, we proposed an interfacial engineering approach to construct layered porous graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-stabilized Co2SnO4 inverse spinel nanohybrid materials as highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline medium. Here, a Co2SnO4/g-C3N4 nanohybrid with a layered porous g-C3N4 stabilized cubelike inverse spinel has been synthesized with an enhanced surface area via a simple one-pot hydrothermal method. Besides, detailed structural and morphological characterizations were carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. Briefly, XPS analysis has revealed the existence of a strong coupling bond at the interface between a definite proportion of g-C3N4 nanosheets and the inverse spinel, which act as an electron transport channel to explore the exceptional performances for HER and OER. Compared to the Co2SnO4 inverse spinel lattice or g-C3N4 nanosheets, the prepared Co2SnO4/g-C3N4 nanohybrid-loaded 316 SSL mesh electrode showed excellent and stable electrocatalytic performances with very low overpotentials of 41 mV for HER and 260 mV for OER to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). To understand the electrocatalytic phenomena, the faradic efficiency was calculated for the prepared bifunctional electrocatalyst as 96%, which effectively would favor water electrolysis. Accordingly, the Co2SnO4/g-C3N4 nanohybrid-loaded electrodes were constructed, and the minimum cell voltage was found to be 1.52 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is comparable to the standard RuO2 parallel to Pt/C in two-electrode systems. Thus, the developed nanohybrid-based electrocatalyst could be an alternative to noble metal-centered systems for highly efficient overall water splitting.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0743-7463			WOS:000819169800001	35708286

The synthesis procedure uses an interaction mediator (IM), which significantly increases the density of active site by mediating interaction between PEO-b-PS template and Mo source. The valence state of Mo is tuned by systematic control of the environment around Mo by controlled heat treatment under air before thermal treatment at 1100 degrees C. Theoretical calculations reveal that the hydrogen binding is strongly influenced by Mo valence. Consequently, MoxC achieves a significant increase in HER activity (exceeding that of Pt/C at high current density similar to 35 mA/cm(2) in alkaline solution). In addition, a volcano-type correlation between HER activity and Mo valence is identified with various experimental indicators. The present strategies can be applied to various carbide and Mo-based catalysts, and the established Mo valence and HER relations can guide development of highly active HER electrocatalysts.									54	3	0	0	1	0	54			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000529895500114	32186842

While extensive investigations have been devoted to monometallic TMPs, multimetallic TMPs have lately proved to show enhanced electrochemical performance compared to their monometallic counterparts, thanks to the synergistic effect between different transition metal species. This topical review summarizes recent advance in the synthesis of new multimetallic TMP nanostructures, with particular focus on their applications in supercapacitors and electrochemical water splitting. Both experimental reports and theoretical understanding of the synergy between transition metal species are comprehensively reviewed, and perspectives of future research on TMP-based materials for these specific applications are outlined.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000836440200001	35820404

Based on systematic investigations such as UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, photoluminescence spectra, transient photocurrent response, XRD, XPS, TEM, SEM, BET and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to determine the inner reaction mechanism, the dramatically enhanced properties were mainly attributed to the coordinated effects of fast electron transfer. These effects are aided by the various valence states of the vanadate ion centers. Moreover, the effective redox couple strategy of FVO/CdS significantly promotes charge transfer. In addition, these novel composite materials not only exhibit high photoelectrochemical performance, but also effectively prevent photocorrosion of CdS. This work highlights the importance of the redox couple strategy for accelerating charge separation and opens a new avenue for the development of visible light-driven photocatalysts for H-2 production.									32	2	0	0	2	0	32			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000459944900041

Here, we have successfully prepared hollow Co-Mo mixed oxide nanostructures with controlled structure and compositions, including hollow Co3O4/CoMoO4 heterostructures and ball-in-ball CoMoO4 nanospheres. Uniform CoMo-Co-Mo hybrid precursors are prepared through one-pot solvothermal hybrid spheres method and then transformed into hollow structures after thermal treatment. Importantly, this strategy can be used to prepare other ternary Mo-based oxides. In view of the unique heterostructure with hollow structure, the Co3O4/CoMoO4 heterostructures exhibit much better electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction than CoMoO4. Moreover, the as-synthesized carbon-coated Co3O4/CoMoO4 nanospheres show excellent lithium storage properties. Our result described here provides a method to fabricate other mixed metal oxides with complicated structure.									87	4	0	0	5	0	86			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000374196000057

They exhibit distinct mineral textures, metamorphic evolution, and whole-rock and mineral compositions. Most 'mantle' type peridotites originated from the subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) of the North China Craton and thus provide direct evidence of crust-mantle interactions in the continental subduction channel. In garnet peridotites, both garnet and Cr-spinel can be equilibrated at peak pressure conditions. Their stabilities are mainly controlled by the refertilized degree of whole-rock; therefore, spinel composition cannot be used to discriminate the partial melting degree of orogenic peridotites. Refractory mantle-derived dunites contain the textures of low Mg and high Ca olivine veins that crosscut orthopyroxene porphyroblasts, which is considered as evidence for silica-undersaturated melt-rock reactions. Such reactions occurring before subduction may potentially affect Re-Os isotopic compositions. Rutile, Ti-clinohumite and zircon in mantle-derived peridotites or pyroxenites provide direct mineralogical evidence for the transport of high field strength elements (HFSEs) from the subducted crust into the mantle wedge. Based on detailed in situ element and isotope analyses, we can constrain the source of metasomatic agents, the metasomatic time and the process of mass transfer. The mantle wedge above continental subduction zones has a wide range of oxygen fugacity values (FMQ=-5.50-1.75), showing a roughly negative correlation with the subducted depths. However, the calculated results of oxygen fugacity are significantly affected by mineral assemblages, P-T conditions and dehydrogenation-oxidation of nominally anhydrous mantle olivine during exhumation. Although significant progress has been made in the study of orogenic peridotites in the Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt, many critical questions remain. With new approaches and advanced technologic applications, additional knowledge of the phase relation in the peridotite-pyroxenite complex system, the mantle geodynamic process before continental subduction, the effects of crustal metasomatism on chemical composition, the oxygen fugacity, and the physical properties of the mantle wedge is anticipated.									30	16	0	0	0	0	39			1674-7313	1869-1897		WOS:000362336700001

However, defects usually exist abundantly and randomly on 2D materials, which makes it difficult to tune the properties in a controllable manner. Therefore, it is highly desirable to find out the formation mechanism and controllable fabrication method of defects on 2D materials. In this report, we systematically investigated the line defects on monolayer MoS2 formed by introducing oxygen during the CVD growth. The line defects were formed due to the overoxidation of the MoS2 flake along crystal boundaries, which bulged out of the surface and had the same surface potential as the basal plane. Therefore, the MoS2 flake with line defects maintained the optical and electrical integrity but exhibited distinct properties as compared to the pristine one. By controlling the oxygen concentration during CVD growth, the density of the line defects can be precisely controlled to implement controllable property tuning. Moreover, during the transfer process, the MoS2 flake was easily broken along the line defects, which increased the active sites to achieve enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction performance. This work is expected to inspire the development of patterned functional 2D materials by defect engineering.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000875623800001	36205718

In this work, we report a simple metal-organic-frameworks-based one-step calcination route to the rational design of a multidimensional bifunctional electrocatalyst, constituting 0D CoP nanocrystals embedded in N, P-doped binary carbon networks with 1D carbon hollow nanotube and 2D carbon porous nanosheet. The elaborate hierarchical architecture allows for high exposure of active sites and continuous electron/ion transport pathwaysf1.02. Together with the strong coupling effect between CoP and hybrid carbon matrices, the obtained electrocatalyst can efficiently catalyze both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. Specifically, low overpotentials of 103 and 260 mV are needed to deliver H-2-evolving current of 10 mA cm(-2) and O-2-evolving current of 30 mA cm(-2), respectively. Remarkably, an alkaline electrolyzer comprising this electrocatalyst drives 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.54 V, outperforming the integrated benchmarking Pt/C+IrO2 couple, along with steady durability. The current work introduces a new way of developing innovative transition metal phosphides/carbon nanostructures for electrocatalysis and other energy-related applications.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000649180400001

Hence there is much interest in the growth of thin films of BiFeO3 via chemical vapor deposition (CVD); however, the number of suitable bismuth precursors is severely limited. A series of homoleptic bismuth(III) fi-diketonate complexes were synthesized via simple room temperature ligand-exchange reactions from [Bi(N(SiMe3)(2))(3)] and free diketonate ligands, which yielded the crystal structure of [Bi(acac)(3)] as a 1-D polymer. We attempted to use these complexes for low pressure CVD (LPCVD) growth of BiFeO3 films with [Fe(acac)(3)]; however, all bismuth complexes exhibited poor volatilities and decomposition characteristics, and as a result film growth was unsuccessful. Subsequently, the volatile alkoxide [Bi((OBu)-Bu-t)(3)], with [Fe(acac)3], was used to grow dense BiFeO3 films via low pressure CVD. The BiFeO3 films possessed multiferroic properties at room temperature and exhibited activity for visible light-driven water oxidation in improved significantly when modified with a cobalt surface cocatalyst. The increase in activity, probed by time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, was attributed to improved charge carrier separation arising from the in-built internal electric field of BiFeO3 in addition to the presence of an efficient cobalt oxygen evolution catalyst.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			1528-7483	1528-7505		WOS:000379456700033

Synthesis, characterization and kinetic evaluation of manganese oxide nanoparticles for the H2O2 catalytic decomposition								International Journal of Chemical Reactor Engineering				6				12 pp.	12 pp.						2008	2008	Nanostructured manganese oxides were synthesized towards the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. The effect of the type of precipitant (Na2CO3 and NH4OH) over the particle size and crystallographic phase was determined. Also, the influence of particle size and crystal phase over the catalytic activity was established. Characterization of the obtained nanoparticles was performed through XRD analysis, BET surface area and TEM microscopy catalytic activity was followed through gasometry of the oxygen evolution [H2O2(1)rarrH2O(1)+O2 (g)] at 25degC. Na2CO3 (Mn-1) and NH4OH (Mn-2) precipitants produced nanoparticles with average sizes of 5-10 nm and 20 nm, respectively. This result was attributed to higher pH stability of precipitant Na2CO3 during the synthesis process. XRD results revealed the presence of beta-MnO2, Mn5O8 and Mn3O4 crystal phase mixture for Mn-1 and Mn5O8 for Mn-2 catalyst. Catalytic activity resulted in intrinsic rate constants (kint=min-1m-2) of 5.2 and 2.3 for Mn-1 and Mn-2, respectively. The greater catalytic activity of Mn-2 catalyst was attributed to the presence of the Mn55O8 phase.									0	0	0		0	0	0			1542-6580			INSPEC:10238727

Particular attention has been paid to:the importance of characterising the starting material, as well as intermediate productsthe effect of experimental variables on the thermal analysis resultsThe various reactions that sulphides can undergo in inert and oxidising atmospheres are presented. Under mild oxidising conditions, such as an air atmosphere and heating rates of 10-20 degrees C min(-1), the oxidation occurs as a sequence of reactions usually controlled by oxygen diffusion, although in some situations decomposition of the sulphide with evolution of sulphur can occur. Besides the formation of oxides and sulphates, and the subsequent decomposition of the latter, solid-solid reactions can occur between sulphates and unreacted sulphides. In ternary systems, such as the iron-nickel sulphides, considerable ion diffusion can take place.Under more vigorous oxidising conditions, such as an oxygen atmosphere with a heating rate in excess of 40 degrees C min(-1), some sulphides can be ignited. Under these conditions the relative ignition temperatures of sulphides can be measured, and the effects of variables such as particle size and stoichiometry on the ignition temperature examined.The oxidation of pyrite is presented as a case study of the effects of experimental variables on the results of thermal analysis. The application of the results of studies to the industrial processing of sulphides of economic importance has been discussed.

In this Article, we propose that formation of a thin amorphous Ni carbonate layer on Ni3N nanoarray supported on carbon cloth (Ni3N NA/CC) is an effective strategy to boost its OER activity in at near-neutral pH. When used as a 3D non noble-metal OER electrocatalyst, the resulting core-shell Ni3N@Ni-Ci NA/CC displays superior catalytic activity with extremely small overpotential of 400 mV for 20 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KHCO3 (bulk pH: 8.3). Moreover, it also exhibits considerable long-term electrochemical durability with its activity being preserved for at least 12 h. Conductive Ni3N nanoarray not only provides as the Ni source for in-situ electrochemical derivation of 3D Ni-Ci catalyst with high surface area, more exposed active sites and facilitated mass diffusion, but effectively prompts the electron transport from Ni-Ci shell to CC, enabling more efficient water oxidation electrocatalysis.

To this end, near-infrared (NIR) photocatalysts stand out as promising candidates (where 53% of the solar light is NIR light) to solve the present energy crisis but the lack of NIR-activated photocatalysts has remained a great challenge for decades. Herein, for the first time, we report the synthesis of high-index faceted plasmonic Au nano-branched 12 tip nanostars, which can absorb the whole spectral region of electromagnetic radiation (UV-vis-NIR), for efficient water splitting. Moreover, the plasmonic hot spots on the Au 12 tip nanostars significantly promote the photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under NIR light (915 nm) with long-term stability. Remarkably, the Au 12 tip nanostars exhibit 250-fold enhancement of activity under 915 nm laser irradiation and 6.5-fold enhancement of activity under 532 nm laser irradiation, as compared to the Au NPs. Furthermore, the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) study confirmed that the significant photoelectrochemical (PEC) enhancement in the NIR light region could be attributed to the hot-electron injection/plasmonic hot spot mechanism upon localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) excitation. Overall, we anticipate that the present work would help to develop new NIR photoelectrocatalysts for meeting future energy demands.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000830578600001	35894176

In this study, we report the synthesis of penroseite (Ni,Co)Se-2 nanocages anchored on 3D graphene aerogel using Prussian blue analogues as a precursor and further their applications in overall water splitting electrolysis. The synergy between the high activity of (Ni,Co)Se-2 and the good conductivity of graphene leads to superior performance of the hybrid toward the water splitting in basic solutions. The (Ni,Co)Se-2-GA only requires a low cell voltage of 1.60 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), making the (Ni,Co)Se-2-GA hybrid a competitive alternative to noble metal based catalysts for water splitting.									180	9	0	0	8	0	181			2155-5435			WOS:000410005700095

The oxidation kinetic parameters were obtained and a controlling mechanism was proposed. The XPS depth profile analysis was consistent with a layered structure of the oxide film. The evolution of oxygen concentration profile allowed to estimate the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in zirconium oxide. Thermal desorption behaviours of pre-oxidized ZrH2 were studied using simultaneous thermogravimetry and thermal desorption spectroscopy (TG-TDS). The phase transformation sequence during dehydrogenation process of pre-oxidized ZrH2 was established and a corresponding shrinking core model was proposed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:000429187200020

This methodology is suitable for application in small treatment and remediation facilities. Reagent concentrations of H2O2 and Fe2+ were found to influence the reaction time and temperature, as well as the degree of mineralization and biodegradability of the sample contaminants. Some H2O2/Fe2+ combinations (H2O2 greater than 10% and Fe2+ greater than 50 mM) resulted in a strong exothermic reaction, which causes peroxide degradation and violent gas liberation. Up to 75 % TOC removal efficiency was attained in water and 70% in soil when high H2O2 (20%) and low Fe2+ (1 mM) concentrations were used. Besides increasing the degree of mineralization, the Fenton's reaction enhances the biodegradability of petroleum compounds (BOD5/COD ratios) by a factor of up to 3.8 for contaminated samples of both water and soil. Our experiments showed that low reagent concentrations (1% H2O2 and 1 mM Fe2+) were sufficient to start the degradation process, which could be continued using microorganisms. This leads to a decrease in reagent costs in the treatment of petroleum-contaminated water and soil samples. The simple measurements of H2O2 concentration or CO2 evolution were effective to evaluate the Fenton's reaction efficiency. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The results of FTIR indicate that the cyclization reaction occurs in a large amount under nitrogen, but there was less of dehydrogenation. Under air, both of cyclization and dehydrogenation happen in a large amount. Oxygen has a negative effect on the cyclization of PAN homopolymer, but has a positive effect on the cyclization of P(AN/ MMA/IA). The results of WAXD indicate that the cyclization occurs in the amorphous region in the PAN homopolymer at first and extends to the crystalline region as the proceeding of cyclization. Cyclization occurs mainly in the amorphous region at 240 ℃ when t = 1 h and in the crystalline region when t≥1.5 h.			采用傅里叶变换红外光谱(FTIR)和广角X射线衍射(WAXD)研究了处理温度、处理时间、气体氛围对聚丙烯腈(PAN)均聚物及其共聚物P[丙烯腈(AN)/甲基丙烯酸甲酯(MMA)/衣康酸(IA)]热处理过程中结构演变的影响。FTIR结果表明,在氮气中,环化反应可以大量出现,但脱氢反应较少;而在空气氛围中,环化反应和脱氢反应都可以大量发生。氧气对PAN均聚物的环化反应有抑制作用,而对P(AN/MMA/IA)的环化反应有促进作用。WAXD结果表明,PAN均聚物的预氧化反应首先发生在非晶区,而后发生在晶区。在240℃时,t=1 h,环化反应主要发生在非晶区;t≥1.5h,主要发生在晶区。						0	0	0		0	0	0			1005-5770			CSCD:5641581

Therefore, accurately identifying the effects of ions from different sites on OER catalysis is essential to improve catalytic activity. Co ions at octahedral sites are usually considered as active sites, whereas those at tetrahedral sites are less active. In this study, the effects of cation vacancies at the tetrahedral sites were investigated for the OER, excluding the contributions from the active cations at the octahedral sites, using a series of Zn-substituted cobalt spinel oxides, ZnxCo1-xAl2O4 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1), where Co ions occupy only the tetrahedral sites because Al ions tend to occupy the octahedral sites. Among them, Zn0.6Co0.4Al2O4 exhibited the highest OER activity and comparable kinetics to that of Co3O4, which is attributed to the cation vacancies generated by Zn dissolution. The Al ions in the structure enhanced the stability of the cobalt spinel oxides, and the spinel structure of Zn0.6Co0.4Al2O4 was retained after 1200 OER cycles. By excluding the active sites from the octahedral sites, this study demonstrates that a certain degree of cation vacancies at the tetrahedral sites can effectively improve the activity of less active Co ions at the tetrahedral sites, thus providing an important basis for future catalyst design.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2633-5409		WOS:000848120600001

This reactor is evaluated against the drop tube reactor and the thermo-gravimetric analyser. It shows to enable high heat up rates (similar to 10(4) K/s), long timescale observation (up to several hours), operation with small fuel particles (similar to 100 mu m) and accurate control of reaction conditions. Char reaction rates are established from real-time gas product analysis by FTIR spectroscopy, through a detailed data-analysis procedure. This procedure employs a particle surface-evolution model and accounts for sampling system signal attenuation. The validity of the well-stirred conditions is established, and the method is employed for char combustion and gasification. Highly consistent results for char gasification over a wide range of conditions (T = 800-1100 degrees C, C-CO2 = 19-76%), are used to demonstrate the establishment of kinetic parameters for an n-th order approach. Activation energy and order of reaction are found and compare well with the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We report a general strategy for efficient formic-acid synthesis by a concurrent cathodic CO2 reduction and anodic partial methanol-oxidation reaction (MOR) using mesoporous SnO2 grown on carbon cloth (mSnO(2)/CC) and CuO nanosheets grown on copper foam (CuONS/CF) as cathodic and anodic catalysts, respectively. Anodic CuONS/CF enables an extremely lowered potential of 1.47 V vs. RHE (100 mA cm(-2)), featuring a significantly enhanced electro-activity in comparison to the OER. The cathodic mSnO(2)/CC shows a rather high Faraday efficiency of 81 % at 0.7 V vs. RHE for formic-acid production from CO2. The established electrolyzer equipped with CuONS/CF at the anode and mSnO(2)/CC at the cathode requires a considerably low cell voltage of 0.93 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for formic-acid production at both sides.									57	6	0	0	5	0	59			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000598652100001	33164291

Considering this situation, the concept of "carbon neutrality" has been put forward by 125 countries one after another. To achieve the goals of "carbon neutrality," two main strategies to reduce CO2 emissions and develop sustainable clean energy can be adopted. Notably, these are crucial for the synthesis of advanced single-atom catalysts (SACs) for energy-related applications. In this review, we highlight unique SACs for conversion of CO2 into high-efficiency carbon energy, for example, through photocatalytic, electrocatalytic, and thermal catalytic hydrogenation technologies, to convert CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels (CO, CH4, HCOOH, CH3OH, and multicarbon [C2+] products). In addition, we introduce advanced energy conversion technologies and devices to replace traditional polluting fossil fuels, such as photocatalytic and electrocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen energy and a high-efficiency oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for fuel cells. Impressively, several representative examples of SACs (including d-, ds-, p-, and f-blocks) for CO2 conversion, water splitting to H-2, and ORR are discussed to describe synthesis methods, characterization, and corresponding catalytic activity. Finally, this review concludes with a description of the challenges and outlooks for future applications of SACs in contributing toward carbon neutrality.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2637-9368		WOS:000824362600001

The commercialization of this technology, however, is hindered by a variety of technical hurdles, including low obtainable capacity, poor energy efficiency, and limited cycle life. Breakthrough to these barriers requires a fundamental understanding of the complex electrochemical and transport behaviors inside the batteries. Mathematical modeling and simulation are imperative in gaining important insight into the mechanisms of these complex phenomena, which is vital to achieving rational designs of better materials for high-performance batteries. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the latest advances in modeling and simulation of Li-air batteries and offer our perspectives on new directions of future development. Unlike previous reviews that centered mainly on continuum modeling of non aqueous Li-air batteries, the present paper focuses on mathematical descriptions of the detailed transport and electrochemical processes in different types of Li-air batteries. We start with a brief introduction to the working principles of Li-air batteries. Then, the governing equations for mass transport and electrochemical reactions in non-aqueous Li-air batteries are formulated, including lithium ion and oxygen transport in the porous air electrode, the formation of solid discharge products, the kinetics of electrode reactions, the evolution of electrode structure, the distribution of active sites, the effect of the side reactions during cycling, the phenomena of the volume change, and the charge process. In addition, the modeling and simulations of aqueous and hybrid Li-air batteries are reviewed, highlighting the phenomena that are different from those in the non-aqueous ones. Finally, the challenges facing the modeling and simulation of Li-air batteries are discussed and perspectives for the development of a new generation of Li-air batteries are outlined.

IrRu alloy electrocatalysts supported on TiO2-rGO (denoted as IrRu/TG) were prepared via ultrasonic spray pyrolysis, followed by the polyol method. TiO2-rGO (TG) support is used not only to disperse IrRu nanoparticles effectively but also to induce the electronic modulation of Ir by downshifting its d-band center compared to unsupported catalysts. IrRu/TG exhibits optimal OER performances and high stability when the weight ratio of TiO2:rGO is 90:10 (i.e., T90G10). The successfully synthesized IrRu/T90G10 exhibits remarkable OER activity, requiring a low overpotential of 254 mV to reach 10 mA cm-2 compare with the unsupported IrRuOx (372 mV), IrRu/rGO (325 mV), and commercial Ir black (340 mV). Moreover, TiO2-rGO (TG) support inhibits the aggregation and oxidative dissolution of IrRu species, thereby enhancing the stability in acidic media. In proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) tests using membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs), IrRu/T90G10 shows more than twice the mass activity of commercial IrO2.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000657746600001

Unfortunately, the band edge positions are unknown for nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH), one of the best water oxidation catalysts. We present here first-principles calculations of band edge positions for surfaces of pure NiOOH. Specifically, the band edge positions of NiOOH (001), (100), and (015) were calculated using density functional theory (DFT) + U, PBEO, and G(0)W(0) methods by using slab models for the surfaces with a vacuum region and periodic boundary conditions. The band edge positions were determined by calculating the band gap center using DFT + U and by accounting for the band gap using G(0)W(0). This approach was validated with other methods. Our results show that due to the polarity of NiOOH, the valence band position is especially sensitive to surface orientation: facets with O-H bonds parallel to the normal of the surface have the highest valence band edge. The following relation between valence band edges is obtained: E-VBM(001) > E-VBM(0 (1) over bar5) > E-VBM(100). As a result, the (100) surface should be the most active, while the other surfaces may be less efficient in enabling the oxygen evolution reaction. Our results suggest that chemical activity of polar materials can be controlled through facet selection.									26	1	0	0	0	0	26			1932-7447			WOS:000374811100022

In this research, layered double hydroxides (LDH) are chosen as the supporting material for platinum to improve its electrochemical activity, tolerance to carbonaceous intermediates as well as reduce the cost of electrode. Experimental results show that low amount of platinum (42 and 29 mg/g) can be intercalated into the interlayer of LDH with a thickness less than 1 nm, which can effectively enhance the electrochemical activity as well as reduced the cost. Both MgAl-LDH/Pt and NiFe-LDH/Pt have a lower onset potential toward methanol oxidation than commercial 20% Pt/C. In addition, the peak current of NiFe-LDH/Pt is 18.0 mA/cm(2), which is 1.5- and 4.7-fold higher than that of MgAl-LDH/Pt and commercial 20% Pt/C, respectively. MgAl-LDH/Pt has a higher tolerance to CO poisoning due to its preference to the generation of hydroxyl radical rather than oxygen evolution reaction, which is commonly observed on the surface of NiFe-LDH. By using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique, it can be observed that the intercalation of Pt could effectively reduce the electron transfer resistance of LDH. (C) 2020 The Authors.

However, the harsh CO2 splitting conditions, the limited oxygen release kinetics and capacity of metal oxides block further promoted the CO yield and solar-to-fuel energy efficiency. Here, we propose a different carbon cycle assisted by Ni/La2O3 via coupling methane decomposition with thermochemical CO2 splitting, replacing conventional metal oxides cycle. Superior performance was demonstrated with methane conversion reached around 94% with almost pure H-2 generation. Encouragingly, CO2 conversion of 98% and CO yield of 6.9 mmol g(-1) derived from CO2 were achieved, with peak CO evolution rate (402 mL min(-1) g(-1)) of orders of magnitude higher than that in metal oxide process and outstanding thermodynamic solar-to-fuel energy efficiency (55.5% vs. 18.5%). This was relevant to the synergistic activation of La2O3 and Ni for CO2 in carbon cycle, thus improving CO2 splitting reaction with carbon species.

Here, graphene and Fe3O4/graphene films were both prepared via a green approach of electrochemical exfoliation of graphite paper in aqueous Fe-2(SO4)(3). Iron ions in the electrolyte could facilitate graphite exfoliation and reduce hydrogen evolution in water medium as well as in-situ functionization of graphene. Small size (4-6 nm) of Fe3O4 uniformly grown onto graphene improved magnetic and electromagnetic properties as well as electrocatalytic activity of oxygen reduction reaction but decreased thermal conductivity and mechanical strength over free graphene. The films of 50 mu m thickness of Fe(3)O(4)z/graphene (21-58 wt% Fe3O4) exhibited excellent electromagnetic shielding of 41-62 dB at 1.0-18 GHz and good thermal conductivity (120 W/(m.K)), which may be related to their high electrical conductivity (500 S/cm) and ferromagnetism (241 Oe). Free-standing graphene films could reach high thermal conductivity of similar to 787 W/(m.K) and electromagnetic shielding of 39-65 dB at 1.0-18 GHz as well as 48 MPa mechanical strength.

During plasma deposition, in situ Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) measurements clearly show a correlation between the evolution of characteristic atomic emission line intensities and the thin film composition determined by simultaneous Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS) and Nuclear Reaction Analysis (NRA). As a result, the cathode surface state can be monitored by OES to ensure a good compositional transferability from the tal get to the film and reproducibility of thin film properties for given values of deposition parameters. Electrical properties and crystallization have been optimized with a 90 nm PZT thin film grown on RuO2 electrodes. These PZT films, annealed with a very modest thermal budget (550 degrees C) are fatigue-free and show very low leakage currents (J=2.10(-8) A/cm(2) at 1 V). The use of a metallic target allows us to control the oxygen incorporation in the PZT thin film and also, using O-18 as a tracer, to study the oxygen vacancy migration which plays a key role in fatigue, leakage current, and electrical degradation/breakdown in PZT thin films.
