Meanwhile, MOFs have also been regarded as promising templates for the synthesis of conductive and electrochemically active catalysts. However, in most of the studies, high-temperature annealing is needed to transform nonconductive or low-conductive MOFs to conductive materials for electrocatalyis, during which the unique structures and intrinsic active sites in MOFs can be easily destroyed. Therefore, in recent years, different strategies have been developed for improving the catalytic performances of MOF-based composites for electrochemical reactions with no need of post-treatment. This mini-review highlights the recent advances on MOF-based structures with improved conductivities and electrochemical activities for the application in electrocatalysis. Overall, the advanced MOF-based electrocatalysts include the highly conductive and electrochemically active pristine MOFs, MOFs combined with conductive substrates, and MOFs hybridized with active materials. Finally, we propose the direction for future works on MOF-based electrocatalysts.									29	1	0	0	0	0	29			2470-1343			WOS:000514827200001	32095674

The Silver nanowire@Polypyrrole (AgNWs@PPy) aerogels were synthesized by freeze-drying method, and then nano-CoNi alloy was grown on the surface of Ag- NWs@PPy aerogels framework by solvothermal method, and AgNWs@PPy@CoNi aerogels with good OER electrocatalytic performance was obtained. The results show that the catalytic performance of AgNWs@PPy@CoNi aerogels first increase and then weaken with the increase of CO_(2+) and Ni~(2+) concentrations. When the CO_(2+) and Ni~(2+) concentrations are 0.0175 mol/L, the AgNWs@PPy@CoNi aerogels exhibite high current density. At 10 mA·cm~(-2), the overpotential is 346 mV, and the Tafel slope is 86.25 mV·dec~(-1). After a 10-hour stability test under a constant voltage, the current retention rate reaches 93.9%, which has good stability. The three-dimensional independent AgNWs@PPy aerogels provide excellent electrical conductivity, and the CoNi alloy provides abundant active sites. The combined effect of them shows excellent OER catalytic performance, which is expected to replace precious metal catalysts and become a new type of OER catalytic material.			针对传统贵金属析氧反应(OER)电催化剂的电导率较低、催化活性较差、成本高等问题,开发高效耐久、低成本且具有高暴露活性表面和优良导电性的电催化剂已迫在眉睫。通过冷冻干燥法合成银纳米线@聚吡咯(AgNWs@PPy)气凝胶,然后使用溶剂热法在AgNWs@PPy气凝胶骨架表面生长纳米CoNi合金,获得了OER电催化性能良好的AgNWs@PPy@CoNi气凝胶。结果表明,随着CO_(2+)、Ni~(2+)浓度的增加,AgNWs@PPy @CoNi气凝胶的催化性能先增强后减弱,当CO_(2+)、Ni~(2+)浓度为0.0175 mol/L制备的AgNWs@PPy@CoNi气凝胶在电流密度10 mA·cm~(-2)时,过电位为346 mV,Tafel斜率为86.25 mV·dec~(-1),在恒定电压下经过10 h的稳定性测试,电流保持率达93.9%,具有良好的稳定性。三维独立型AgNWs@PPy气凝胶提供优良的导电性, CoNi合金提供丰富的活性位点,二者的共同作用表现出优异的OER催化性能,将有望替代贵金属催化剂而成为新型的OER催化材料。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-3851			CSCD:7180494

Layered-double-hydroxide (LDH) materials have attracted much attention due to the special layered structure, but their electrocatalytic activity and stability are still limited. Herein, we propose to tune Co2+ occupancy and coordination in cobalt-based LDH nanosheets via Fe3+ doping for efficient and stable electrocatalysis for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is found that Fe doping regulates the occupancy and coordination of Co2+ in CoO4 tetrahedrons and CoO6 octahedrons of Co-LDHs. Through density functional theory calculation, we also clarified that Fe3+ not only modulated the Co2+ coordination but also functioned as an added catalytic active site. LDH nanosheets with a Co/Fe ratio of 5:1 show a low OER overpotential, much better than the commercial IrO2, owing to the modulation of Fe3+ doping on the crystal and electronic structures. After appropriate incorporation of Fe3+, the almost inactive octahedral coordinated Co2+ is significantly activated with a partial deletion of tetrahedral coordinated Co2+, which greatly boosts the overall electrocatalytic activity. This study offers some new insights into tuning the crystal and electronic structures of LDHs by lattice doping to achieve high-efficiency electrocatalysis for OER.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000637850300112	33724012

However, the inefficient generation of oxygen severely restricts the catalytic efficiency for overall water splitting. Thus, it is necessary to find new photocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In the present study, the electronic structure and related properties of one-dimensional blue phosphorene nanotubes (BPNTs) are systematically investigated using first-principle calculations to explore their photocatalytic activities. Our results demonstrate that the strain energy of BPNTs with a large diameter (larger than 8 angstrom) is nearly the same as that of carbon nanotubes, indicating that these BPNTs are stable. Due to their perfect band gaps and band energies for photocatalytic activity, BPNTs have potential for application in visible light photocatalysis for overall water splitting. More significantly, p-type zigzag BPNTs with good photooxidation capabilities, low electron-hole recombination, and high hole mobility (1729.53 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) and photo-response coefficient (20a(0)(2) per photon) are promising candidates as photocatalytic materials for OER. Besides, the band gap of BPNTs can be tuned monotonically by reasonable strain. We further report advanced strategies for designing and improving potentially efficient photocatalysts for overall water splitting.									28	2	0	0	1	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451600200054

The deposition process employs bis(N,N'-di-tert-butylacetamidinato)nickel(II) and H2S as the reactants and is able to produce fairly smooth, pure, godlevskite-structured NiSx thin films following an ideal layer-by-layer ALD growth fashion for a relatively wide process temperature range from 90-200 degrees C. Excellent conformal coating is demonstrated for this ALD process, as the deposited NiSx films are able to uniformly and conformally cover deep narrow trenches with aspect ratio as high as 10:1, which highlights the general and broad applicability of this ALD process for fabricating complex 3D-structured nanodevices. Further, we demonstrate the applications of this ALD NiSx for oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis. The ALD NiSx is found to convert to nickel (oxy)hydrate after electrochemical aging, and the aged product shows a remarkable electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability, which is among the best electrocatalytic performance reported for nonprecious OER catalysts. Considering that ALD can be easily scaled up and integrated with 3D nanostructures, we believe that this ALD NiSx process will be highly promising for a variety of applications in future energy devices.									127	8	0	0	0	0	128			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000370987300020

The sintered samples exhibit a functional gradient characteristic. The phase evolution can be described as follows: Passive and active oxidation of Si to form SiO2 and SiO to reduce the partial pressure of oxygen. SiO(g) and Si react with N2 to form Si3N4 respectively. As the temperature increases and the partial pressure of oxygen decreases, Ti2O3 reacts with CO and N2 to form Ti(C,N)ss, which is accom-panied by the release of O2. Si3N4 fixes the O2 and reacts to form Si2N2O, and Si2N2O reacts with Al2O3 to form O '-Sialon, thereby realizing the transformation from Si3N4 to Sialon. CO and residual carbon from the pyrolysis of phenolic resin react with SiO(s) and Si to form SiC. The dense layer formed by SiC and SiO2 blocks the diffusion of external gas to the central parts of the samples, there is still free Si which can continue to react and transform into a non-oxide reinforcing phase. In this paper, the reaction models are presented.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000863342400004

Here, we demonstrated a low-temperature plasma strategy at atmospheric pressure for enhancing the catalytic activity of metal-organic framework derived N-doped carbon nanotubes (MOF-NCNTs) by changing the relative contents of Co-N-x sites, Co-Co bonds and pyridinic-N. The increase of pyridinic-N/pyrrolic-N ratio improves the ORR performance, while unsaturated Co-N-x sites and strong Co-Co bonds promote the OER performance. The relative contents of pyridinic-N, Co-N-x sites, and Co-Co bonds in MOF-NCNTs can be readily tailored by varying the plasma treatment time. The MOF-NCNTs treated with N-2 plasma for 4 min (MOF-NCNTs-N-2-4) exhibited improved ORR (eta(onset): 0.91 V) and OER (eta(10): 0.44 V) activities compared to MOF-NCNTs because of the higher ratio of pyridinic-N to pyrrolic-N and higher relative contents of Co-N-x sites and Co-Co bonds. The hybrid sodium-air batteries (HSABs) assembled with MOF-NCNTs-N-2-4 catalyst display a low overpotential of 0.35 V and excellent round trip efficiency of 88.9% at 0.1 mA cm(-2). Besides, they also exhibited great cycling stability with an average discharge voltage of 2.75 V and an outstanding round trip efficiency of 84% after 150 cycles.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000646729000001	33949530

In water splitting, water oxidation is a bottleneck, and thus different catalysts have been synthesized for water oxidation. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are among the highly efficient catalysts for water oxidation, and so far, MOF-based catalysts have been divided into two categories: MOF-derived catalysts and direct MOF catalysts. In particular, a nickel/cobalt MOF is reported to be one of the best direct catalysts for water oxidation. For the first-row transition MOF structures in general, a hypothesis is that the harsh conditions of OER could cause the decomposition of organic ligands and the formation of water-oxidizing oxide-based structures. By electrochemical methods, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, a nickel/cobalt MOF known to be a highly efficient catalyst for water oxidation is shown to form Ni/Co oxide, making it a candidate catalyst for oxygen evolution. MOFs are interesting precatalysts for metal oxide water-oxidizing catalysts, but control experiments are necessary for determining whether a certain MOF or other MOFs are true catalysts for OER. Thus, finding a true and direct MOF electrocatalyst for OER is a challenge.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000584351700067	33021376

Herein, porous cobalt-iron fluoride nanoflakes (CoFe-F) are prepared by hydrothermal and fluoridation treatment. A CoFe-F catalyst with a preserved nanoflake morphology and porous surface is obtained by an optimal degree of fluoridation, avoiding the aggregation of metal fluoride nanoparticles and exposing abundant active sites. Meanwhile, surface chemistry modification for the CoFe-F catalyst by forming ionic metal-F bonds can boost electrocatalytic performance, such as enhanced electrocatalytic activity, outstanding stability, and fast kinetics. CoFe-F-16 with optimal fluoridation only requires an overpotential of 252 mV with a Tafel slope of 52.1 mV dec(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2), which is smaller than the control samples with insufficient or overfluoridation, attributing to nanoflake morphology with a porous surface and the formation of ionic metal compounds by low-temperature fluoridation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000797927200033

Photo-oxidation of the thermoset was investigated by several techniques, such as IR spectroscopy, DMA, headspace-SPME and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The measurements by infrared spectroscopy combined with gas analysis allowed us to elucidate details of the reaction mechanisms that are difficult to detect by only spectroscopic measurements. This approach was used to probe mechanistic aspects of the photo-oxidation of acrylic-melamine (AM) thermoset and was completed by dynamic-mechanical measurements combined with AFM and micro-hardness measurements, which revealed the effect of photo-oxidation on the mechanical properties of the thermoset.

The results obtained by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that PbO2 crystal grains presented honeycomb structure were formed on the electrode surface by doping with Ce. The specific surface areas and catalytic active sites of the Ce-PbO2 doped electrode were increased and the catalytic activity was evidently greater than the undoped one. However, when Ce was doped into the intermediate layer (SnO2+Mn2O3), a more cracked surface structure formed, thus leading electrode deactivation by passivation of the Ti-substrate. So the anodic stability was decreased according to the accelerated life tests.									6	3	0	0	0	0	7			1002-0721			WOS:000254839500020

Herein, by taking the photoinduced activation effects of TiO2, we obtained a Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 (Ti3+-TiO2). In situ characterization revealed that the presence of Ti3+ is attributed to the reduction reaction of Ti4+ on the TiO2 surface under UV light irradiation. The research results prove that the optical properties of TiO2 are modified by the active species Ti3+; the recombination rate of the photogenerated carriers is significantly decreased, and Ti3+-TiO2 exhibits a hydrogen production rate which is 1.7 times superior than that of pristine TiO2. To further enhance the self-activation effect of TiO2, we constructed a type II heterojunction TiO2/UiO-66-NH2 structure to transfer photoexcited electrons to TiO2, which gives a higher concentration and duration of the active species Ti3+. Ti3+-TiO2/UiO-66-NH2 shows improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity with a rate 3.2 times better than that of pristine TiO2 due to the synergistic function of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+. A novel perspective was adopted in this work to observe the dynamic variation of active species and electron transfer pathways during TiO2 photocatalytic reactions. Since Ti3+ is generated on the TiO(2)in situ, this work could be extended to TiO2-based photocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000775100400001

Nitrogen-doped carbon materials are seen as promising catalysts for ORR, so it is of great significance in studying the functions of different nitrogen moieties.Experiments: The graphene hydrogel-based nitrogen-arbon materials (GH N-C) were fabricated by first obtaining a gel through hydrothermal treatment using graphene oxide (GO) as precursor, and then calcined in an ammonia atmosphere at different temperatures to form N-doped graphitized materials with divers nitrogen configuration.Findings: GH N-C materials with tunable nitrogen configuration were synthesized by a two-step method base on graphene hydrogel. Benefiting from the 3D hydrogel structure, rich defects and optimized chemical properties, GH N-C-900 prepared by NH3 pyrolysis at 900 degrees C exhibits an excellent electrocatalytic performance toward ORR, with the onset potential of 0.947 +/- 0.013 V versus RHE, half-wave potential of 0.830 +/- 0.010 V versus RHE, electron transfer number of 3.61-3.99, along as methanol tolerance and superior long-term stability.

In this work, products identification and its evolution of different gas components have been studied. In the NO/O-2/N-2 systems, nitric oxide (NO) can be removed via chemical oxidation and chemical reduction, and corresponding products are NO2 and N-2, respectively. In the O-2/N-2 systems, N2O5 producing from the interaction of NO3 with NO2 was also observed. There is an optimum SED at which the highest NOx yield and best NO conversion efficiency will be achieved. In the H2O/O-2/N-2 systems, the formation of NO2, HNO2 and HNO3 were observed in both NF and NO conversion.

The direct Z-scheme photocatalytic systems, which can realize the effective separation of photoinduced carriers and possess outstanding redox ability, have attracted a huge amount of interest. In this work, we have studied the photocatalytic performance of the bilayer MoSe2/HfS2 van der Waals (vdW) heterojunction following the direct Z-scheme mechanism by employing the hybrid density functional theory. Our calculated results show that the HfS2 and MoSe2 single layers in this heterojunction are used for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. The charge transfer between the two layers brought about an internal electric field pointing from the MoSe2 layer to the HfS2 slab, which can accelerate the separation of the photoinduced electron-hole pairs and support the Z-scheme electron migration near the interface. Excitingly, the optical absorption intensity of the MoSe2/HfS2 heterojunction is enhanced in the visible and infrared region. As a result, these results reveal that the MoSe2/HfS2 heterojunction is a promising direct Z-scheme photocatalyst for photocatalytic overall water splitting.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13				2079-4991		WOS:000506675800062	31795287

Herein, the Ru single-atom system constructed on an iron-cobalt layered double hydroxide (Ru(x)SACs@FeCo-LDH) exhibits extremely low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials of 194 and 246 mV at current densities of 10 and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively, and a high stability greater than 1000 h at 1000 mA cm(-2), all of which far surpass the values obtained for commercial RuO2. Moreover, its mass activity is similar to 2 and 6 times higher than those of Ru and FeCo-LDH, respectively. Extraordinarily, it only needs 1.52 V to achieve a 1000 mA cm(-2) current density for water splitting, and it is almost unchanged after 1000 h, as the highest performance reported so far. Experimental and theoretical calculation results show that, after an activation process, an in situ Ru-O-TM (Fe, Co, and Ni)-like nanocompound is formed on the atom-scale symmetry breaking interfaces of the FeCo-LDH surface, promoting O-O coupling at the Ru-O active sites for OER and beneficial for suppressing multiple heteroatomic interface instability for large-current-density water splitting. Our strategy opens up opportunities for boosting the single-atom stability in industrial-scale hydrogen production from water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000847701900001

Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has proven to be a promising metal-free photocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), however, bulk g-C3N4 suffers from limited HER efficiency owing to its disadvantages including fast electron-hole recombination, low conductivity and irregular microstructure. Herein, we report a supramolecular chemistry-based approach to construct g-C3N4 nano-architectures by calcining the pre-organized complexes originating from the copolymerization of two symmetrical precursors, melamine and trithiocyanuric acid. The resultant g-C3N4 micro-/nanostructures not only effectively induce enhanced visible light-harvesting property but also accelerate the electron-hole separation and charge carrier transfer, leading to highly improved HER performance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirms the chemical environment of different elements, while in-situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) characterizations reveal the types of oxygen-containing radicals and charge carrier dynamics. Compared to pristine g-C3N4, the optimal large-aspect-ratio g-C3N4 sheets derived from ethanol show the fastest HER rate of 1144 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1). The improvement of photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to synergistic effects of extended visible light absorption, boosted charge transfer and more active catalytic sites for HER in modified g-C3N4 materials.					3rd International Symposium on Energy and Environmental Photocatalytic Materials (EEPM3)3rd International Symposium on Energy and Environmental Photocatalytic Materials (EEPM3)	MAY 15-19, 2018MAY 15-19, 2018		Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Chem, Krakow, POLANDJagiellonian Univ, Fac Chem, Krakow, POLAND	41	3	0	0	5	0	41			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000471996400008

Here, we report the performance of a pure organic semiconductor film as a catalyst for hydrogen production via visible light-driven water splitting. The neat and unsubstituted polythiophene film, characterized with a well-filled grain morphology of the crystalline polymer, is prepared by a facile polymerization method. The photovoltage of 1.38 V versus RHE at pH 12 enables solar-driven one-electron-per-photon water splitting in combination with a traditional water-oxidation catalyst to produce hydrogen and oxygen separately. The high photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 1.02 mol(H-2) h(-1) g(-1) or 0.75 mA/cm(2) at 0 V versus RHE is also achieved with high durability.

In this work, we report a facile, green, low-cost and scalable method for the synthesis of a Mo2C-based HER electrocatalyst consisting of ultrafine Mo2C nanoparticles embedded within bacterial cellulosederived 3D N-doped carbon nanofiber networks (Mo2C@N-CNFs) using 3D nanostructured biomass as a precursor. The electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable HER activity (an overpotential of 167 mV achieves 10 mA cm(-2) and a high exchange current density of 4.73 x 10(-2) mA cm(-2)) and excellent stability in acidic media as well as high HER activity in neutral and basic media. Further theoretical calculations indicate a strong synergistic effect between Mo2C nanoparticles and N-CNFs in the Mo2C@ N-CNF catalyst, which leads to an impressive HER performance.									130	8	0	0	9	0	131			1884-4049	1884-4057		WOS:000383414800006

The synergistic interplay between N, S doped carbon matrix, the porous structure and the highly catalytic active cobalt nickel sulfides species contributes greatly to the excellent bifunctional catalytic activity both in the ORR and OER in 0.1M KOH solution for the Co-Ni-S@NSPC catalyst. The ORR measurement results showed that the half-wave potential (0.82 V vs. RHE), current density (5.23 mAcm(-2) at 0.2 V vs. RHE) of our sample were very close to that of Pt/C (0.82 V, 5.17 mA cm(-2)), meanwhile its stability and methanol tolerance were superior to Pt/C. The OER measurement results showed that the Co-Ni-S@ NSPC catalyst exhibited a small overpotential (0.47 V vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2), close to that of RuO2 (0.39 V). Importantly, compared to the mixture of Pt/C and RuO2 cathodes, the rechargeable Zn-air battery based on Co-Ni-S@NSPC cathode exhibits smaller discharge/charge overpotential (0.85 V), higher power density (51.6mWcm(-2)), higher voltaic efficiency (58.5%) at 10 mA cm(-2) and an improved cycling stability over 3600 min.

This is manifested in the fact that the processes observed at the nanoscopic level are noticeably multistage in time. The paper expounds an approach that allows, basing on the methods of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, to obtain kinetic equations that enable describing the evolution of slow processes occurring against the background of faster ones. Vibrational relaxation in electronic terms and stochastic deviations of the position of the electronic energy levels of the system from their stationary positions are considered the most important fast processes. As an example, it is shown how the kinetics of one- and two-electron transfer through protein chains, the oxygen-mediated transfer of a triplet excitation in the pigment-protein complex, the kinetics of temperature-independent desensitization of pain receptors, as well as conformational regulation of enzymatic reactions, can be described.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1063-777X	1090-6517		WOS:000635986500010

Ruthenium oxide is well known as an efficient catalyst for photochemical four-electron oxidation of water to O-2. Zeolites are an excellent host for creating long-lived photochemically generated charge-separated species. There is a need for mild methods of incorporation of catalysts onto zeolites for water oxidation reactions. We report here that thermal decomposition of RU3(CO)(12) on zeolite Y at 170 degrees C produces Ru metal which is readily oxidized to RuO2 by air. The morphology of RuO2 on the zeolite is strongly dependent on the temperature at which air oxidation occurs. Samples of RuO2-zeolite made by air oxidation at 200 degrees C produce fibers of RuO2 of approximate dimensions of length of 50 nm and widths of 5 nm. This material is found to be an efficient catalyst for oxidation of water to oxygen by photochemically generated Ru(bpy)(3)(3+) in solution. This study demonstrates that a specific morphology of RuO2 is optimum for an effective catalyst, thereby suggesting that particular crystal faces of RuO2 provide catalytic sites.

We successfully prepared a hierarchical parallelepiped-like morphology of iron oxide (Fe2O3) and different transition-metal-doped M-Fe2O3, namely, Mn-doped iron oxide (Mn-Fe2O3), Co-doped iron oxide (Co-Fe2O3), and Ni-doped iron oxide (Ni-Fe2O3), and subsequently characterized them by diverse physical techniques. A closer inspection of the morphology clearly authenticated that the hierarchical parallelepiped-like morphology of M-Fe2O3 was evolved due to assembly of several small nanorods. We then studied their electrocatalytic activity toward OER and compared their activity during the OER process. All of the doped M-Fe2O3 exhibited enhanced catalytic activity compared to the pristine Fe2O3, owing to the synergistic effect of the doped metal together with Fe. Among all of the as-prepared catalysts, Ni-Fe2O3 showed outstanding stability and OER activity due to the higher electronegativity of Ni compared to that of Mn or Co. Finally, we had demonstrated how the doped metal enhanced the activity of the catalysts by tuning their electronegativity.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				2574-0970		WOS:000657373800087

Pigment analysis showed that salinity decreased chlorophyll a and phycocyanin content, while low salinity increased carotenoid concentration and high salinity decreased carotenoid concentration. Salinity also inhibited CO2 assimilation rate and photosynthetic oxygen evolution in this cyanobacterium. Chlorophyll a fluorescence transient parameters (phiPo, phiEo, psiO, RC/ABS, RC/CS, PIABS, and PICS) were decreased under salt stress, while dVo/dto(Mo), Vj and phiDo were increased. The decrease of ETRmax and Yield and the change of chlorophyll a fluorescence transients showed that salt stress had an important influence on photosynthesis. These results indicated that the effects of salinity stress on photosynthesis in S. javanicum may depend on the inhibition of electron transport and the inactivation of the reaction centers, but this inhibition may occur in the electron transport pathway at the PSII donor and acceptor sites.

However, at the temperatures (400-700 degrees C) typically employed for pyrolysis, CO2 might also involve in pyrolysis and impact properties of the biochar formed, which was investigated in this study with cellulose as feedstock and N-2 or CO2 as the carrier gas. The results indicated that CO2 promoted the formation of biochar below 600 degrees C by suppressing cracking of biochar and enhancing secondary condensation of the volatiles. This reduced the size and abundance of the organics with pi-conjugated structures in the bio-oil. CO2 as an atmosphere produced the biochar with a carbon content higher than that produced in N-2 by 9.96%, and correspondingly the oxygen content was lowered by 36.68% in the biochar, as CO2 facilitated deoxygenation and dehydrogenation reactions during the pyrolysis. The presence of CO2 in the pyrolysis also made the biochar more aromatic and thermally more stable, which enhanced both energy yield and energy density of the process. As the heating temperature increases, CO2 as an atmosphere will significantly affect the evolution of the oxygen-containing function of the biochar surface.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000790502700004

However, its practical application is limited by the inert nature of the basal planes. In this study, we developed a highly active and robust MoS2 catalyst with uniform triangular nanoholes on its basal plane via nanoscale patterning. The process successfully created edge defects with a Mo-terminated zigzag configuration. Notably, owing to the exposure of Mo-terminated zigzag edges at numerous nanopores, the overpotential of the nanoporous MoS2-x was significantly lower than that of the pristine MoS2. In addition, the stable catalytic performance of the nanoporous MoS2-x was verified under continuous measurement for 16 h. This study provides new insights into the nanoscale patterning and edge engineering of two-dimensional MoS2 to design highly efficient and low-cost HER electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000813504600001

However, the actual activities of P-rich TMPs do not behave as expected, and the underlying essence especially at the atomic level is also ambiguous. Our structural analysis reveals the inferior activity could stem from the reduced overlap of atomic wave functions between metal and P with the increase in P contents, which consequently results in too strong P-H interaction. To this end, we used N-induced lattice contraction to generally boost the HER catalysis of P-rich TMPs including CoP2, FeP2, NiP2, and MoP2. Refined structural characterization and theoretical analysis indicate the N-P strong interaction could increase the atomic wave function overlap and eventually modulate the H adsorption strength. The concept of lattice engineering offers a new vision for tuning the catalytic activities of P-rich TMPs and beyond.									142	10	0	0	12	0	143			2375-2548			WOS:000507552400008	31922001

In this paper,fiber samples are prepared by resin embedding and polishing technique for optical analysis. The evolution process of the radial heterogeneity of two kinds of oxidative polyacrylonitrile fibers were compared and analyzed by optical microscope. The evolution model was proposed for the radial heterogeneity of oxidative polyacrylonitrile fibers. The results proved that typical radial heterogeneity is present in TG300 oxidative polyacrylonitrile fibers. However,no obvious radial heterogeneity is found in TG800 oxidative polyacrylonitrile fibers. When the oxidation reaction proceed,the diameter and carbon content of fiber decrease and the oxygen content increase gradually. Therefore,the optical microscope can be applied in the evaluation of homogeneous oxidation of polyacrylonitrile fiber. A new detection method is provided for the manufacture of homogeneous oxidative polyacrylonitrile fibers.			为检测整束氧化聚丙烯腈纤维径向异质结构发育情况,迫切需要开发一种评价聚丙烯腈纤维是否均质氧化的检测方法。本文通过树脂包埋和研磨抛光制备用于光学分析的纤维试样,应用光学显微方法对比分析了两种类型氧化聚丙烯腈纤维径向异质结构演变过程,提出了氧化聚丙烯腈纤维径向异质结构演变模型。结果表明,TG300氧化聚丙烯腈纤维呈典型的径向异质结构,TG800氧化聚丙烯腈纤维径向异质结构不明显。随着氧化反应进行,纤维直径和碳含量逐渐降低,而氧含量逐渐上升。这说明光学显微分析可以用于氧化聚丙烯腈纤维是否均质氧化评价,可为得到均质氧化聚丙烯腈纤维提供分析检测手段。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1007-2330			CSCD:6869962

However, as the properties become more dissimilar, achieving synergistic effects effectively becomes more difficult due to phase separation. Here we describe a comprehensive study on how subnanoscale alloying is always effective for inter-elemental synergy. Thirty-six combinations of both bimetallic subnanoparticles (SNPs) and nanoparticles (NPs) were studied systematically using atomic-resolution imaging and catalyst benchmarking based on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Results revealed that SNPs always produce greater synergistic effects than NPs, the greatest synergistic effect was found for the combination of Pt and Zr. The atomic-scale miscibility and the associated modulation of electronic states at the subnanoscale were much different from those at the nanoscale, which was observed by annular-dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000842959600001	35912811

An electrocatalytically active cathode coating with essentially hydridic features has been employed to enhance Faradaic yields in xylitol production at low current densities by heterogeneous reaction of hydrogenation with H-adatoms, and the entire mechanism has been proved by experimental evidence. An anionic selective anodic coating for titanium substrate was also used to suppress oxygen evolution and optimize the xylonic acid production by direct oxidation with anodically generated bromine, and to carry out the electrode process at almost equilibrium potential. The kinetic effect of specifically adsorbable anions for decreasing cathodic current yields in xylitol production and the resulting necessity for membrane separation of catholyte from anolyte, with proper optimization of the supporting neutral salt composition, has also been emphasized.									19	0	0	0	3	0	20			0021-891X			WOS:A1991FE34900007

One of the most promising approaches to sunlight-driven water splitting is to construct a dual-illuminated photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell by integrating a photoanode with a photocathode in a tandem configuration. To this end, the important work is to individually develop highly efficient, durable, inexpensive, and readily scalable photoanodes and photocathodes for each half reaction of water splitting, either O-2 or H-2 evolution reaction (OER or HER). A promising approach emerging in recent years towards OER photoanodes and HER photocathodes is the immobilization of molecular catalysts (MC) onto the surface of visible-light-absorbing semiconductor (VLASC) electrodes. Very recently, some encouraging results have been achieved in the construction of MC-modified VLASC photoanodes and photocathodes. This review is focused on the recent advances in hybrid photoelectrodes for OER and HER, which were built by the integration of MCs with VLASC materials. After a brief introduction of three major units, viz. VLASC materials, MCs, and anchor groups, used to date for fabricating hybrid photoelectrodes for OER and HER, the construction strategy and the performance of the VLASC/MC photoanodes and photocathodes are described in two respective chapters. Finally, challenges and developments in future studies of VLASC/MC hybrid photoelectrodes are discussed.									51	0	0	0	5	0	51			2398-4902			WOS:000422789600001

The as-prepared Cu/Bi2WO6-1 was dominated by CuO and Cu and Cu/Bi2WO6-2 was dominated by metallic Cu, confirmed by XPS and TEM analyses. These etching pretreatments also induced the formation of defect sites such as oxygen vacancies and W5+. The presence of oxygen vacancies could significantly increase the photogenerated electrons capture abilities. Metallic Cu nanocrystals on the surface of Bi2WO6 photoanodes are beneficial for the photoresponse range as well as the separation and consumption of photogenerated carriers due to the surface plasmon resonance effect of Cu. Photoelectrochemical studies demonstrated that Cu/Bi2WO6-x exhibited a markedly improved PEC performance in water splitting reaction as compared to that of Bi2WO6 which mainly because of the light harvesting efficiency (eta(abs)) and the interfacial charge transfer efficiency. Importantly, Cu/Bi2WO6-2 exhibited the best PEC activity with a high current density and good stability under neutral conditions, which may be ascribed to the defective Bi2WO6 structure in combination with surface ligand engineering and the synergistic effect of oxygen vacancies and metallic Cu. In addition, the function mechanism of CuO, metallic Cu and oxygen vacancies were discussed in details.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000451004100018

Monitoring probable changes of catalytic materials under working conditions and uncovering the information of the real active phase are crucial to constructing catalyst systems. Recent advances have witnessed an extensive phenomenon of in situ self-reconstruction inducing electroactive amorphous species (ISIA), which bridges the pristine state with evolved amorphous state of an electrode. However, the difficult-to-detect dynamic process and elusive amorphous structure block progress on its exploration. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries and proceedings regarding this phenomenon in various catalytic processes in terms of generally accepted mechanisms, influential factors, functional roles, characterization techniques, and deliberate utilizations. We conclude the review with our personal insights and provide challenges and perspectives on investigating and utilizing this phenomenon to achieve facile electrocatalysis processes and desirable functional materials.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2590-2393	2590-2385		WOS:000702820600011

The near-band-edge (NBE) emission observed in the electrolyte at around the flat-band potential (E-FB), -0.47 V-RHE, was stronger than that observed in air because of the disappearance of band bending that existed for the GaN surface in air. A broad PL related to the surface states was observed between the NBE emission and yellow luminescence (YL) and decreased rapidly with an increase of potential above a significant onset of anodic photocurrent. This quenching reflects a deactivation of surface states through the suppressed diffusion of electrons to the surface because of the significant charge separation by band bending. The relative intensity of the YL increased above the significant onset of anodic photocurrent, indicating that the deep levels were partially filled with holes, and photoexcited holes were utilized for oxygen evolution reaction from water.									4	0	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000655640900032

In this work, silicon nanowire arrays (SiNWs) photocathodes decorated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for PEC water splitting were successfully prepared by a flexible and scalable electrochemical reduction method. The SiNWs photocathode with the optimized rGO decoration (SiNWs/rGO20) shows an enhanced activity with a much higher photocurrent density and significantly positive shift of onset potential compared to the bare SiNWs arrays for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The enhanced PEC activity is ascribed to the high electrical conductivity of rGO and improved separation of the photogenerated charge carriers. This work not only demonstrates a facile, rapid and tunable electrochemical reduction method to produce rGO, but also exhibits an efficient protocol to enhance the PEC water splitting of silicon-based materials.									30	2	0	0	0	0	31			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000382745900013	27461187

The chemical compositions and the micrographic surface features of these coatings are reported. The utility of these coatings as cathodes in laboratory scale alkaline water electrolytic cells is assessed with polarization techniques. It is shown that the trend in their electrocatalytic activities follows this order: Ni-Mo-Fe > Ni-Mo-Cu > Ni-Mo-Zn > Ni-Mo-W approximately Ni-Mo-Co > Ni-Mo-Cr. The electrocatalytic activities of these coatings are very significant when compared with the data of performance realized on conventional mild steel cathodes used currently in industry.

The way in which a mild laser treatment influences the photo-electrochemical performances of the thus obtained WO3/TiO2 systems was also investigated. At laser-treated electrodes (L-WO3/TiO2), the melting-solidification process induced by the treatment led to a smaller size of the deposited WO3 particles and to their better dispersion on the surface. The treatment also enhanced the surface oxygen deficiency and ensured better relative absorptivity of the oxygenated species on the surface. These features, together with the intrinsic narrower bandgap of the WO3/TiO2 composites, the higher donor density and the lower flat band potential of L-WO3/TiO2 enabled faster kinetic of the oxygen photoanodic evolution. Importantly, the same process exhibited a cathodic shift of its onset potential. The laser treatment also strongly enhanced the photoelectrocatalytic performances for UV-assisted methanol anodic oxidation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000830057700004

Herein, a novel the nickel (Ni) doping layered double hydroxide (LDH), named Ni/CuMgFe LDH, was synthesized by the impregnation method. The doping of Ni causes the lattice expansion (a and b axes stretches to 5.26 angstrom and 5.78 angstrom from 3.12 angstrom) and oxygen vacancies (Ovs) of LDH (30.72%). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results indicates the electrons transfer ability of Ni/CuMgFe LDH have been enhanced by Ovs. The superior catalytic activity of Ni/CuMgFe LDH on benzotriazole (BTA) degradation was proved (88.9% after 6 cycling experiments) under ambient temperature and pressure. In the catalytic process of Ni/CuMgFe LDH, the oxidative and reductive species were present. A two-pathway degradation mechanism was proposed according to the LC-MS results and Hirshfeld charges of BTA. The nucleophilic reaction was present in anaerobic condition attacked by center dot O-2(-) and.H and electrophilic reaction was present in aerobic condition attacked by center dot OH. This study provides a method of developing more multi-substance adsorption sites and higher electrons transfer ability via atom doping, which further allows researchers to gain new catalyst into the pollution control in complex wastewater treatment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000812981200006

The effects of the C/WO3 molar ratio, reaction temperature and reaction time on the phase transition and morphology evolution of the products are investigated. During the carbothermic reduction process, all the oxygen in yellow tungsten trioxide (WO3) is removed by carbon to generate a mixture of W, W2C and WC at 1100 degrees C; and then the as-prepared powder is mixed with an appropriate content of carbon black and carbonized at 1200 degrees C. The carbon content in the finally obtained WC powders is almost equal to the theoretical value. Furthermore, it is found that a high C/WO3 molar ratio at the first stage is beneficial for decreasing the particle size of the WC powders. When the C/WO3 molar ratio is 3.5, the single phase WC with a particle size of about 200 nm can be obtained. Therefore, this carbothermic reduction -carburization process may provide a simple, low-cost, and high efficiency route to prepare the WC powders in a large-scale. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The earth-abundant and affordable transition metals have been regarded as ideal alternatives to precious platinum. Herein, we report the designed synthesis of component-modified cobalt telluride nanoparticles encapsulated in the nitrogen-doped carbon frameworks with the feature of high surface area and great electron conductivity. Compared with CoTe2/C and CoTe/C, the Co1.11Te2/C presents the highest catalytic activity for HER in 1M KOH due to its structural and component advantages. After a continuous reaction for 20 h or cycling for 1000 cycles, Co1.11Te2/C shows only a little performance loss. This work provides an effective approach to synthesize low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts for HER via rational structural and component design.									46	2	0	0	1	0	46			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000457952600058

Its removal from the circulation chain between the natural environment and animals is still a serious problem. Fe(III) ions can be used to break this chain. Fe(III) ions appear in water in spite of irradiation of Fe(III)-Cit complex and oxidation by oxygen present in water. Fe(III)-Cit was a reservoir of Fe(III) ions from which they were continuously released. Therefore, in this paper we studied an interaction between tetracycline (TC) and Fe(III) ions under fluorescent light at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C in the water environment. This interaction leads to TC + Fe(III) coordinating complex formation. Changes caused by this process were monitored within 1860 min by measuring absorption and fluorescence spectra. The absorption spectra showed a charge-transfer stacking band(s) of oxidized and non-oxidized form of TC above 400 nm; in turn the fluorescence spectra revealed decay of initial bands and formation of the new ones. The initial, main fluorescence band at 16,660 cm(-1) associated with the intramolecular proton transfer has gradually disappeared after Fe(III) ions binding to oxygen atoms in the BCD system rings of a TC molecule. Gaussian decomposition of all fluorescence spectra allowed extracting new bands, their evolution in time and calculating the rate of the first reaction step. Temperature rise of 10 degrees C caused more than a ten-fold increase in the first-order reaction rate. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The evolution of the products with reaction time shows that there is an initial induction period and during this time very little epoxide is fomed and the products of allylic oxidation are dominant. Subsequently the epoxide becomes the major product prior to the diol being formed from hydrolysis due to the presence of by-product water formed from the selective oxidation reaction. It is considered that the allylic oxidation products are in part converted in situ into aldehydes which form peracids during the induction period; the peracid leads to epoxide formation as the major product as the conversion is increased. The effect of addition of a number of aldehydes is investigated, all leading to enhanced epoxide formation when added in small amounts. Molar enhancements of epoxide yield can approach twice the amount of aldehyde initially added. This behaviour is in contrast to earlier studies which utilise aldehydes in greater than stoichiometric amounts as sacrificial reactants. The importance of in situ aldehyde formation is also demonstrated by the addition of benzyl alcohol which under the reaction conditions rapidly gives benzaldehyde and enhanced epoxide formation. Possible mechanistic interpretations of the observations are discussed.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000348937900074

EFFECT OF EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS ON PROCESS PERFORMANCE AND SYNGAS QUALITY								PAPERS OF THE 23RD EUROPEAN BIOMASS CONFERENCE: SETTING THE COURSE FOR A BIOBASED ECONOMY								88	97						2015	2015	This paper studied the gasification of two solid recovered fuels (SRF) in a laboratory scale fluidized bed reactor. The gasification performance and syngas quality were assessed under the influence of several parameters: gasification temperature (from 700 to 850 degrees C), equivalence ratio (ER, 0.22-0.35), SRF feedstock (RT or FL), bed material (sand or dolomite) and gasification agent (air or oxygen/steam). Special attention was devoted to the evolution of tar and microcontaminants concentration (H2S, HCN, HCl and NH3) in the syngas. The results indicated that increasing gasification temperature and ER led to higher gas yields and H-2/CO ratios whereas tar content decreased. In general, the predominant levels of HCl and HCN in the producer gas tended to diminish at these conditions meanwhile H2S slightly increased and NH3 was scarcely detected.

Herein, to improve performance with a synergistic effect, the ternary Ni3Mo3N-MoO2-NiO nanoparticles catalyst (NMN-MO-NO) and its derivatives are fabricated by pyrolyzing the Ni-Mo urea precursor at 800 degrees C in Ar. The nest-like NMN-MO-NO is composed of particles with a diameter of about 40 nm, including an abundant contact area. As-prepared samples are conducted in the OER measurements, in which NMN-MO-NO exhibited the best performance. The catalyst exhibits favorable activity with a low overpotential of 363 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 139 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the sample also shows excellent stability that the current density retains without obvious attenuation. The superior performance of the catalyst is attributed to the synergistic effect and loose structure. Overall, our work offers a neoteric avenue to synthesize the transition metal nitrides and tune the performance of the catalyst of OER on the basis of the non-noble metal.									2	0	0	0	0	0	1			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000799358500023

Ta3N5 was produced on a Ta foil substrate using PCVD with a Ta precursor, followed by NH3 nitridation at high temperatures. Various characterization techniques were used to assess the properties of the resulting films, including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy with elemental mapping, cross-sectional high resolution transmission electron spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. This PCVD technique formed an amorphous phase that was converted into a multilayer structure having the composition TaOx/Ta3N5/Ta3N5 + Ta2N/Ta during nitridation. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) trials assessing the progress of the oxygen evolution reaction showed a high photocurrent density of 8.1 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE under simulated solar radiation. This represents one of the highest values ever reported for Ta3N5 without further modification or the addition of a surface layer. The incident photon-to-current efficiency of this specimen reached a maximum of 67% at 500 nm and the device was stable for up to 60 min. The superior PEC performance obtained in this work is attributed to the formation of a highly crystalline, compact and uniform Ta3N5 + Ta2N layer.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2398-4902			WOS:000534220100016

Here, we use hydrothermal synthesis in modified solvents with triethanolamine to directly synthesize bulk NiFe LDHs with carbonate, chloride, and sulfate interlayer anions without inert atmosphere protection. Structural characterizations by X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm the anion composition. Electrochemical characterization shows that LDHs with these three anions display similar OER catalytic performance after surface area normalization, consistent with observed anion exchange to carbonate in alkaline electrolyte under ambient conditions. However, dodecyl sulfate-intercalated NiFe LDHs prepared by anion exchange show enhanced electrocatalytic performance unexplained by surface area and resist carbonate exchange during electrochemical cycling. The synthetic methods developed for carbonate, chloride, and sulfate LDHs also allow direct fabrication of three- dimensional high surface area electrodes, but the anion composition of these electrodes does not affect the OER performance after surface area normalization. These results provide new insights on how the interlayer anions in LDH materials influence OER catalytic activity and open a new approach for tuning these catalytic materials.									87	3	0	0	8	0	87			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000438653300017

Cobalt phosphosulfide (CoPS) is regarded as a promising electrocatalyst for the HER in acid solution. Nonetheless, there are no studies of its HER and OER activity in basic solution. Herein, we engineer a novel and highly efficient water splitting electrocatalyst of ultrafine CoPS nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated in N, P, and S tri-doped porous carbon (CoPS@NPS-C) through metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and commercial carbon black (XC-72) as precursors. The abundant and evenly distributed metals of MOFs form ultrafine CoPS NPs, and the rich N organic ligands of MOFs and XC-72 are shaped into the NPS-C to protect CoPS NPs leading to long-term stability in water-splitting applications. Meanwhile, the strong interaction between CoPS and NPS-C in this special structure not only ensures the high activity of the HER in acid solution and the OER in alkaline solution, but also maintains good HER performance in alkaline solution. The results display that the novel structure electrocatalyst of CoPS@NPS-C has great potential in water-splitting applications.									53	0	0	0	2	0	53			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000437106300032

A Ru oxidation catalyst, 2,2(+), is used in the homogeneous phase in the anodic compartment to oxidize a water-soluble alkene, 4-styrene sulfonic acid (4-HSS), to the corresponding epoxide that in acidic solution is hydrolyzed to the diol (4-(1,2-dihydroxyethyl)-benzenesulfonic acid). Concomitantly, protons are generated that diffuse through a proton exchange membrane to a Pt cathode where they are transformed into hydrogen. Illumination under 1.5 AMG (100 mW cm(-2)) together with an external bias of 0.3 V vs. NHE after 24 h leads to the generation of 1.28 Coulombs together with the formation of 6.1 mu mol of H-2 at the cathodic compartment that corresponds to a faradaic efficiency of 92%. In addition 0.7 mM of the 4-HSS substrate has been oxidized at the anodic compartment with a conversion yield of 7%. The rate of hydrogen evolution is limited by the oxidation of the organic substrate, and the TOF for both reactions is measured to be 0.8 ks(-1).									18	2	0	0	3	0	19			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000366831800024

Besides the bandgap and edges, the behavior of photogenerated charge carriers and trap states can also greatly affect the photocatalytic process but it has been less considered during the material design. A previous study (G. Liu, J. Pan, L. Yin et al., Adv. Funct. Mater., 2012, 22, 3233-3238) showed that the interstitial boron on anatase {001} facets can change the photocatalytic preference from reductive H-2 evolution to oxidative O-2 evolution in the water splitting reaction, interpreted as the change in the band edges. In this work, we employed transient infrared absorption-excitation energy scanning spectroscopy and femtosecond time-resolved mid-infrared spectroscopy to investigate this phenomenon in view of the effect caused by the boron dopant on the photogenerated carrier kinetics and the energy level distribution of the trap states. We found that the surface boron doping eliminates significantly the trap states above the valence band, which improves its photocatalytic oxygen generation. On the other hand, surface boron doping also introduces a substantial amount of electron recombination centers (i.e., B sigma+ in the shell layer). Furthermore, surface boron doping also leads to an inefficient electron transfer from TiO2 to the co-catalyst Pt. Both of these effects give rise to its inferior photocatalytic capability in H-2 evolution.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000461722500021	30724275

Br3??? ions in the electrolyte increase monotonically after ???30% charging, which indicates that a part of Br3??? formed via the oxidation of Br??? during charging does not oxidize Li2O2 as RM but gets accumulated in the cell. The accumulated Br3??? is estimated at ???20% of the total amount of charging. Consistent with this result, the O2 evolution efficiency gradually decreases from the initial 100% as the charging progresses, and CO2 is emitted at the end of the charging. The integrated amount of O2 evolution during charging accounts for ???83% of the theoretical two-electron reaction. All these results clearly show that the Br???/Br3???

Herein, an alternative approach for solar energy conversion is developed by coupling Hy generation with the selective oxidation of alcohol. In a closed redox system containing molecular ruthenium catalyst (RuCat) and Pt modified g-C3N4 (Pt-g-C3N4) composite, hydrogen production is concomitant with the oxidation of benzyl alcohols to aldehydes with over 99% selectivity in the presence of visible light and pure water. By contrary, the system lacking molecular catalyst only exhibits low to moderate selectivities towards aldehydes. The remarkably improved selectivity is attributed to the formation of highly active Ru(IV) = O intermediate through efficient hole transfer from g-C3N4 to RuCat.									50	5	0	0	2	0	50			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000424719300026

In the present study, the substrate scope of the recently discovered thermally stable BVMO, TmCHMO from Thermocrispum municipale, was studied. This revealed that the wild-type (WT) enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of a variety of structurally different ketones with notable activity and enantioselectivity, including the desymmetrization of 4-methylcyclohexanone (99% ee, S). In order to induce the reversal of enantioselectivity of this reaction as well as the transformations of other substrates, directed evolution based on iterative saturation mutagenesis (ISM) was applied, leading to (R)-selectivity (94% ee) without affecting the thermostability of the biocatalyst.									19	0	0	0	6	0	19			1477-0520	1477-0539		WOS:000416538100011	29130465

Here, we successfully fabricated W-doped alpha-Ni(OH)(2) honeycomb-like microstructures deposited on nickel foam (NF) using an easy and fast one-step electrodeposition approach. Some parameters affecting the morphology and OER activity of the target product were systematically investigated, including the initial nickel source, the deposition time, and the deposition current density. It was found that W-doped alpha-Ni(OH)(2) honeycomb-like microstructures deposited from the NiSO4 solution at -100 mA cm(-2) for 15 min manifested the strongest electrocatalytic OER capability. In 1.0 M KOH, only 170/209 mV of overpotential was required for the as-obtained W-Ni(OH)(2)/NF electrode to launch a current density of 10/100 mA cm(-2), respectively, outperforming most previously reported electrocatalysts. Also, the as-prepared catalyst showed outstanding long-term stability without attenuation over 400 h at a large current density of 250 mA cm(-2). Distinctly, the present electrochemical deposition technology paves a facile and fast pathway for preparing nonprecious metal OER electrocatalysts with high electroactivity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000834104400001

In vivo, the process is catalysed within a photoenzyme called photosystem II (PSII) by a m-oxido sCaMn(4) cluster, the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). The OEC is known to be virtually inactive if Ca2+ is removed from its structure. Activity can be restored not only by the addition of Ca2+ but also Sr2+ ions. We have recently introduced layered calcium manganese oxides of the birnessite mineral family as functional synthetic model compounds for the OEC. Here, we present the syntheses of layered manganese oxides where we varied the interlayer cations, preparing a series of K-, Ca-, Sr- and Mg-containing birnessites. Structural motifs within these materials were determined using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) showing that all materials have similar atomic structures despite their different elemental compositions. Water-oxidation experiments were carried out to elucidate structure-reactivity relations. These experiments demonstrated that the oxides-like the OEC-require the presence of calcium in their structures to reach maximum catalytic activity. As another similarity to the OEC, Sr2+ is the "second best choice" for the secondary cation. The results thus support mechanistic proposals which involve an important catalytic role for Ca2+ in biological water-oxidation. Additionally, they offer valuable hints for the development of synthetic, manganese-based water-oxidation catalysts for artificial photosynthesis.									228	7	0	0	40	0	231			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000304919200023

Nano-micro letters				14	1			214	214		10.1007/s40820-022-00966-7				2022 Nov 05	2022	Ammonia has been recognized as the future renewable energy fuel because of its wide-ranging applications in H2 storage and transportation sector. In order to avoid the environmentally hazardous Haber-Bosch process, recently, the third-generation ambient ammonia synthesis has drawn phenomenal attention and thus tremendous efforts are devoted to developing efficient electrocatalysts that would circumvent the bottlenecks of the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) like competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, poor selectivity of N2 on catalyst surface. Herein, we report the synthesis of an oxygen-functionalized boron carbonitride matrix via a two-step pyrolysis technique. The conductive BNCO(1000) architecture, the compatibility of B-2pz orbital with the N-2pz orbital and the charging effect over B due to the C and O edge-atoms in a pentagon altogether facilitate N2 adsorption on the B edge-active sites. The optimum electrolyte acidity with 0.1M HCl and the lowered anion crowding effect aid the protonation steps of NRR via an associative alternating pathway, which gives a sufficiently high yield of ammonia (211.5mugh-1 mgcat-1) on the optimized BNCO(1000) catalyst with a Faradaic efficiency of 34.7% at -0.1V vs RHE. This work thus offers a cost-effective electrode material and provides a contemporary idea about reinforcing the charging effect over the secured active sites for NRR by selectively choosing the electrolyte anions and functionalizing the active edges of the BNCO(1000) catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2150-5551		MEDLINE:36334149	36334149

Electrocatalyst supports based on tantalum-doped tin oxide (Ta/SnO2) were prepared by electrospinning. The dopant amount was varied between 0 (undoped SnO2) and 7.5 at. %, and the resulting materials were characterized for their morphology, composition, structure, porosity, and electrical properties. Platinum nanoparticles prepared by a microwave-assisted polyol method were deposited with different loadings on 1 at. % Ta-doped SnO2 (1Ta/SnO2), selected for its highest electrical conductivity of 0.09 S cm(-1). Their electrocatalytic properties toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were compared with those of the same particles deposited on carbon black and those of a commercial carbon-supported Pt catalyst. Pt/1Ta/SnO2 showed higher ORR activity and stability at high potential than Pt/C. In particular, the electrocatalyst with the lowest Pt loading (7 wt %) presented high mass activity and stability which, from XPS analysis, is suggested to result from very strong metal-support interaction. These results indicate that amongst tin oxides doped with pentavalent metals such as niobium (Nb/SnO2), antimony (Sb/SnO2), and tantalum, Ta/SnO2 has the advantage of both higher conductivity than Nb/SnO2 and greater stability in the fuel cell voltage range than Sb/SnO2.									15	2	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200009

Due to the well-arranged mesopores, the high surface area, the interconnected conductive networks as well as the finely dispersed Fe-N active species, the as-prepared 3D Fe-N-C catalyst exhibits significantly enhanced ORR activity compared to commercial Pt/C. More,precisely, the 3D Fe-N-C yields a more-positive half-wave potential of -0.08 V (vs. SCE) and remarkably stable limiting current of similar to 6.2 mA cm(-2). The 3D Fe-N-C shows also an excellent tolerance to methanol as well as remarkably long-term stability with more than 82.4% retention of its initial activity after 55.5 h operation. Based on the as-prepared 3D Fe-N-C as the air cathode catalyst, a stable microbial fuel cell (MFC) device is fabricated and tested, performing a maximum power density of 3118.9 mW m(-2) at a high current density of 9980.8 mA m(-2). More importantly, it is found that the Fe-N-C MAFC device could steadily operate for more than 250 h in a feed period, which is substantially longer than the Pt/C-MFC device. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

After post-treatment with H-2/N-2 mixture gases, this catalyst displays excellent ORR catalytic activity and durability for the synergetic influences of electronic and geometry effects on catalysts during the alloying. Specifically, the as-prepared PtNi/C (350 degrees C-6 h) sample delivers preponderant ORR activity with only 53.5% Pt usage than the commercial Pt/C. The specific activity and mass activity are corresponding 7.49 times and 3.5 times to the commercial Pt/C. This catalyst exhibits excellent ORR catalytic activity after 10 000 potential cycles in acid, which benefits from the well alloyed core-shell structure of PtNi/C. H-2-induced thermal treatment has significant effects on the development of high performance low-platinum PtNi/C alloy catalyst, and plays the significant role in the formation of well-alloyed core-shell structures. The lowered d-band center is believed to facilitate ORR catalysis through weakening the adsorption of intermediate oxygen species on the alloyed Pt surface. Therefore, PtNi/C(350 degrees C-6 h) alloyed catalyst possesses outstanding ORR catalytic activity with much lower Pt loading.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000517171800001

The electric percolation as a function of the film thickness was studied during deposition and annealing using a two-electrode in-situ resistance measurement technique. Electrical percolation was achieved in as-deposited films greater than 5.4 +/- 0.4 nm; however, thermal treatment (550 A degrees C in air) resulted in film dewetting for Ag films as thick as 500 nm and formation of electronically isolated Ag nanoparticles, as was confirmed by SEM and XPS. In thermally treated samples, stable electronic conductivity associated with a continuous percolated network was only observed in samples greater than 600 nm in thickness. The effect of polarization on the electrochemical reactions at the three-phase (electrode-gas-electrolyte) and two-phase (electrode-electrolyte) boundaries of the electrode was investigated by solid electrolyte cyclic voltammetry (SECV) at 350 A degrees C and P (O2) = 6 kPa. With the application of positive potential, silver oxide (Ag2O) was found to form along the three-phase boundary and then extends within the bulk of the electrode with increasing anodic potentials. By changing the hold time at positive potential, passivating oxide layers are formed which results in a shift in favor of the oxygen evolution reaction at the working electrode. This oxide forms according to a logarithmic rate expression with thick oxides being associated with decrease in current efficiency for subsequent oxide formation.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000339800600022

Reversible growth of UO2 nanoparticles in aqueous solutions through 7 MeV electron beam irradiation								JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS				438	1-3			26	31		10.1016/j.jnucmat.2013.02.005				JUL 2013	2013	Uranium dioxide (UO2) nanoparticles of rod-shaped structures with diameter 80 nm and length 500 nm, have been grown in aqueous solutions of uranyl nitrate with electron beam irradiation using a 7 MeV linear electron accelerator. These nanoparticles were found to be stable under de-aerated condition; however they decomposed upon exposure to air or oxygen. The bimolecular rate constant for decomposition of these nanoparticles has been estimated to be 4.3 x 10(-1) M-1 s(-1), in the aerated and oxygen saturated solutions, assuming these to be of pseudo-first order processes. The nitrogen-purged decomposed solution again produced the black coloured UO2 sol upon such irradiation and these reversible phenomena could be repeated for several cycles. There was also decomposition of the UO2 nanoparticles along with evolution of hydrogen upon addition of acid in the de-aerated condition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				5	11			4901	4925		10.1039/c5cy01251a				2015	2015	Recent developments in the oxidation of water to dioxygen using metal complexes as catalysts or precatalysts are presented, as well as the conversion of homogeneous catalysts into nanoparticles or heterogeneous catalysts during the oxidation of water. Homogeneous catalysts are advantageous in the careful design and elucidation of the mechanisms for catalytic water oxidation. In distinction, the use of heterogeneous catalysts in water oxidation is advantageous for applications as a result of their robust catalytic activity. Although detailed studies on homogeneous and heterogeneous water oxidation reactions are performed rather often, understanding the link between homogeneous catalysts and heterogeneous ones is becoming an additional requirement in order to produce economically attractive water oxidation catalysts (WOCs). This minireview focuses on the aspects that determine whether particular catalysts for the oxidation of water are homogeneous or heterogeneous.									49	1	0	0	3	0	49			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000363230200003

In this paper, a quadruple metal-based layered structure, composed of aluminium (Al), gallium (Ga), magnesium (Mg), and nickel (Ni), is reported which allows the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into CO with a high selectivity close to 100% in the presence of water. The shifted oxidation states on the Ni and Mg ions than bivalent states lead to an increment in electronegativity for their neighboring oxygen (O) while the Ga and Al ions maintain their trivalent states, thereby enabling the O to adsorb a high amount of CO2. Furthermore, the quadruple metal-based layered structure without any use of scavengers is proven to give an approximately two-fold increase in photocatalytic activity compared to those with bi or triple metal-based structures.									12	1	0	0	2	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000400983400009

In this chapter, we focus on understanding how the nature and extent of cation substitution in the layers reflect the position of that cation in the Periodic Table. Our analyses indicate that the electron configurations and coordination properties of the cations in the layers result in periodic variations in the fundamental properties of the resulting LDHs, such as their local coordination geometry, stability, electronegativity, and band structure. These periodic variations directly influence the efficacy of a given LDH in applications such as solid base catalysis and photocatalysis.									7	3	0	0	1	0	7			0081-5993	1616-8550	978-3-030-40010-1; 978-3-030-40009-5	WOS:000554828800005

The cation exchange reaction of nanocrystals (NCs) has been reported as the way to provide metastable crystal structures and complicated functional nanostructures that are not accessible by conventional synthetic methods. Herein we demonstrate the cation exchange-derived formation of metastable spinel Ni3Se4 NCs (sp-Ni3Se4) and phase segregated berzelianite Cu2-xSe (ber-Cu2-xSe)/sp-Ni3Se4 heterostructured NCs as active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. A rare sp-Ni3Se4 phase was formed by cation exchange of ber-Cu2-xSe NCs with Ni2+ ions, because both phases have the face-centered cubic (fcc) Se anion sublattice. Tuning the Ni : Cu molar ratio leads to the formation of Janus-type ber-Cu2-xSe/sp-Ni3Se4 heterostructured NCs. The NCs of sp-Ni3Se4 and ber-Cu2-xSe/sp-Ni3Se4 heterostructures exhibited high catalytic activities in the OER with small overpotentials of 250 and 230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH, respectively. They were electrochemically oxidized during the OER to give hydroxides as the real active species. We anticipate that the cation exchange reaction could have enormous potential for the creation of novel heterostructured NCs showing superior catalytic performance.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000514452400006	34084382

First order kinetics are used to describe consumption rates of hydroquinone, benzoic acid and hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives by galvanostatic electrolysis with simultaneous oxygen evolution at a Pt electrode. Linear correlations were established from the effect of electrolyses current density on k(app). The meaning of the intercept and slope is analyzed. A good agreement is found between intercept values and the apparent rate constants from potentiostatic electrolysis without O-2 evolution. Simultaneously, the slopes magnitude corroborate the relative reactivity order of species that was established considering the occurrence of positive charge densities on carbon atoms of the aromatic ring. Therefore, the present analysis provides kinetic information concerning both, the direct electron-transfer and the reaction with HO radical. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, solar-water-splitting electrodes assembled using them as precursors always produce very low photocurrents. This could be due to the lack of an effective fabrication and/or modification protocol applicable to assemble these micrometer-sized semiconductor particles into suitable electrode configurations. A fast and simple fabrication scheme of drop-casting followed by the necking treatment is developed to enable the micrometer-sized precursor particles derived photoelectrodes to deliver appreciable photocurrent densities (>1 mA cm(-2)). By applying this fabrication scheme, photoelectrodes of solid-state reaction derived Mo doped BiVO4 (approximate to 4 mu m, modified with oxygen evolution catalysts) and commercial WO3 (size ranging from 100 nm to >10 mu m) have yielded photocurrent densities higher than 1 mA cm(-2), while the photoelectrode composed of commercial CdSe (approximate to 10 mu m) is able to produce a photocurrent density higher than 5 mA cm(-2) (in a Na2S aqueous solution). This strategy provides a new possible way, in addition to the predominant route of nanostructuring, to construct efficient solar-water-splitting electrodes.									12	2	0	0	1	0	13			2365-709X			WOS:000398997600003

Here we characterise ceria in its fresh and post-reaction states by adsorption of CO2, NH3 and CO. Micro-calorimetry, FTIR and TPD experiments are complemented by DFT calculations, which assess adsorption energies and vibrational frequencies. The calculations were performed on the lowest energy surface, CeO2(111), with perfect termination and with various degrees of hydroxylation and/or chlorination. Both experiments and calculations suggest that the basic character of the ceria surface has been eliminated upon reaction in HCl oxidation, indicating that most of the basic lattice O sites are exchanged by chlorine and that the OH groups formed are rather acidic. The density and the strength of surface acidic functions increased significantly upon reaction. An in situ FTIR reaction cell has been designed and constructed to study the evolution of OH group density of the ceria surface during HCl oxidation. The effect of experimental variables, such as pO(2), pHCl and temperature, has been investigated. We found that the OH group density positively correlated with the reactivity in the pO(2) and temperature series, whereas negative correlation was observed when pHCl was varied. Implications of the above observations to the reaction mechanism are discussed.									39	2	0	0	2	0	40			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000314846600009	23361164

To improve the NIB capacity and retainability, extensive efforts have been put into the developments of NIB electrode materials. The redox activities of the transition metal (TM)-based NIB electrodes are critical in defining the capacity and stability. Here, we provide a comprehensive review on recent studies of the redox mechanisms of NIB cathodes through synchrotron-based soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) and mapping of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (mRIXS). These soft X-ray techniques are direct and effective tools to fingerprint the TM-3dand O-pstates with both bulk and surface sensitivities. Particularly, 3dTML-edge sXAS has been used to quantify the cationic redox contributions to the electrochemical property; however, it suffers from lineshape distortion for the bulk sensitive signals in some scenarios. With the new dimension of information along the emitted photon energy, mRIXS can address the distortion issue of in TM-LsXAS; moreover, it also breaks through the limitation of conventional sXAS on detecting unconventional TM and O states, e.g., Mn(I) in NIB anode and oxidized oxygen in NIB cathodes. The mRIXS fingerprint of the oxidized oxygen state enables the detection of the reversibility of the oxygen redox reaction through the evolution of feature intensity upon electrochemical cycling and thus clarifies various misunderstandings in our conventional wisdom. We conclude that, with mRIXS established as a powerful tool, its potential and power will continue to be explored for characterizing novel chemical states in NIB electrodes.									11	2	0	0	0	0	10			2296-2646			WOS:000575965700001	33102438

Our objective is to develop a robust solution target method, which can be applicable to a wide array of radiometals and would be simply and easily adopted by existing cyclotron facilities for the routine production of radiometals.Method: We have developed a simplified, solution target approach for production of Zr-89 using a niobium target by 14 MeV energy proton bombardment of aqueous solutions of yttrium salts via the Y-89(p,n)Zr-89 nuclear reaction. The production conditions were optimized, following a detailed mechanistic study of the gas evolution.Results: Although the solution target approach avoided the expense and complication of solid target processing, rapid radiolytic formation of gases in the target represents a major impediment in the success of solution target. To address this challenge we performed a systematic mechanistic study of gas evolution. Gas evolution was found to be predominantly due to decomposition of water to molecular hydrogen and oxygen. The rate of gas evolutions varied >40-fold depending on solution composition even under the same irradiation condition. With chloride salts, the rate of gas evolution increased in the order rank Na < Ca < Y. However, the trend was reversed with the corresponding nitrate salts, and further addition of nitric acid to the irradiating solution minimized gas evolution. At optimized condition, Zr-89 was produced in moderate yield (4.36 +/- 0.48 MBq/mu A.h) and high effective specific activity (464 +/- 215 MBq/mu g) using the solution target approach (2.75 M yttrium nitrate, 1.5 N HNO3, 2 h irradiation at 20 mu A).Conclusion: The novel findings on substrate dependent, radiation-induced water decomposition provide fundamental data for the development and optimization of conditions for solution targets. The developed methodology of irradiation of nitrate salts in dilute nitric acid solutions can be translated to the production of a wide array of radiometals like Cu-64, Ga-68 and Y-88, and is well suited for short-lived isotopes.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), not their high-temperature pyrolysis derived materials, have attracted great attention as electrocatalysts in recent years, because of their large specific surface area, rich pore structure, and uniformly dispersed active sites. Although there are already some review articles focusing on MOFs as electrocatalysts, most of them are mainly based on the applications of MOFs to illustrate their capability and superiority in electrocatalysis.

J	Shao, Xue; Yang, Yuting; Liu, Yi; Yan, Puxuan; Zhou, Shuqing; Isimjan, Tayirjan Taylor; Yang, Xiulin								Oxygen vacancy-rich N-doped carbon encapsulated BiOCl-CNTs heterostructures as robust electrocatalyst synergistically promote oxygen reduction and Zn-air batteries								JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE				607				826	835		10.1016/j.jcis.2021.08.210		SEP 2021		FEB 2022	2022	The development of non-precious metal catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) is vital for promising clean energy technologies such as fuel cells, and zinc-air batteries. Herein, we present a stepwise synthesis of N-doped and carbon encapsulated BiOCl-CNTs heterostructures. Electrocatalytic ORR studies show that the optimized catalyst has a high half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.85 V (vs. RHE), large limiting current density (-5.34 mA cm(-2)@0.6 V) in alkaline medium, and nearly perfect 4e(-) reduction characteristics, even surpassing commercial Pt/C. Meanwhile, the catalyst has exceptional durability (above 97.5 % after 40000 s) and strong resistance towards methanol poisoning. The good ORR activity also results in high-performance zinc-air batteries with a specific capacity (724 mAh g(-1)@10 mA cm(-2)), a high open-circuit potential of 1.51 V and a peak power density of 170.7 mW cm(-2), as well as an ultra-long charge-discharge cycle stability (155 h), comparable with the Pt/C catalyst. The catalytic mechanism reveals that the excellent electrocatalytic performance originates from the synergistic effect of N doping, oxygen vacancies, and BiOCl sites. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared photocatalyst was evaluated by using it for assessing the degradation of different organic pollutants under visible-light irradiation. The composite 3%-AgVO3/MoS2 catalyst demonstrated a significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to the pure compounds (AgVO3 and MoS2). The reason behind the excellent photocatalytic performance was the modification of MoS2 by AgVO3 to facilitate O-2 adsorption/activation. In addition, the composite catalyst facilitates the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction whereby H2O2 is generated on the surface of MoS2 to produce additional reactive oxygen species (ROSs). ESR coupled with the POPHA fluorescence detection method and a free radical capture experiment were used to elucidate the mechanism of formation of the ROSs, including center dot OH, center dot O-2(-) and H2O2. Furthermore, the generation of additional ROSs could accelerate electron consumption, leaving behind more holes for the oxidation of organic pollutants. A possible photocatalytic mechanism of the composite is also discussed. (C) 2018, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Ultra low Pt-loading electrode prepared by displacement of electrodeposited Cu particles on a porous carbon electrode								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				35	15	SI		8071	8079		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.077				AUG 2010	2010	Ultra low Pt-loading and high Pt utilization electrodes were prepared by displacement of electrodeposited Cu on a porous carbon electrode. Copper particles were electrodeposited on a porous carbon electrode (PCE) by four-step deposition (FSD) at first. The size and dispersion of deposited Cu particles were markedly improved with application of the FSD. The Cu deposits were then displaced by platinum as dipping a Cu/PCE in a platinum salt solution. Sequentially, Pt particles supported on the PCE were obtained. The Pt/PCE electrode prepared via the FSD of Cu overcomes the problem of the hydrogen evolution reaction accompanied with direct platinum electrochemical deposition, and has a high Pt dispersion. The single cell consisting of the electrodes Pt/PCE via the FSD of Cu outputs a power of 0.45 W cm(-2) with ultra low Pt loadings of 0.196 mg cm(-2) MEA (0.098 mg cm(-2) per each side of the MEA) at no backpressure of reactant gases.

Thus it has attracted considerable research efforts for the development of inexpensive and efficient electrocatalysts. Recent research progress has demonstrated that the Earth-abundant metal-based phosphides are attractive materials for efficient electrocatalysis because of attractive features such as tunable structure and high activity. In this Minireview, we summarize the latest research progress of metal phosphide-based materials as efficient electrocatalysts. The synthesis approaches of metal phosphides and the factors that influence structural reconstruction in certain reactions are reviewed and discussed. Specifically, advanced in-situ X-ray characterization techniques for metal phosphide research in the field of electrocatalysis are also highlighted. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives for these materials are presented.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000533660800001

The crystal structure of the hollandite across the entire compositional range remained in the I4/m space group. Structural evolution was resolved by neutron diffraction, total scattering data, and density functional theory calculations. A trend of decreasing thermodynamic stability with smaller tunnel cations was attributed to increased structural distortion observed in the system. In addition, the tunnel cations' local environment was studied in the eightfold coordinated oxygen cavities. Local binding features of the tunnel cations reveals that the hollandite structure can strongly stabilize tunnel cations, even at elevated temperatures up to 500 K.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000393844100034

Here, we fabricate a phosphate and phosphide composite-based catalyst using the highly integrated precursor 1,1'-bis (diphenylphosphino) ferrocene (DPPF) as integral P, Fe, and C sources. The catalyst was prepared via the vapor deposition process of DPPF on the precursor of 900 degrees C pretreated ZIF-L/NF. Under the induction of P in DPPF, Ni on NF migrates through porous NC to form Ni2P, while DPPF transforms into FePO4/PdC. Therefore, the catalyst has the structure of the FePO4/P-doped C two-dimensional nanofilm-encapsulated Ni2P@NC matrix on NF substrates (named FPPC/Ni2P@NC/NF). Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the FePO4/PdC, Ni2P, and NC matrix, the FPPC/Ni2P@NC/NF catalyst needs only 1.317 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in urea oxidation. Moreover, it also exhibits good OER activity, which requires an overpotential of 292 mV to reach 100 mA cm(-2). This work provides a novel and environmentally friendly strategy for the simultaneous construction of metal phosphate and phosphide catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000818710200001

Formation of core/shell structures, in which the core is the inorganic particle and the shell is the surface-deposited MOF, is one of the rational methodologies to create such hybrid materials. Here, we present the facile creation of metal oxide-core/MOF-shell structures by applying a solution-based step-by-step modification of the core surface using a framework compound. The modification procedure includes alternate immersion of LiCoO2 (LCO) - a catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction - into oxalic acid and ferrous solutions, resulting in the formation of iron(II) oxalate (Fe(ox), ox = oxalate anion) - one of the simplest MOFs with short unit frameworks - nanolayers on the LCO surface (Fe(ox) NL@LCO). The amount of deposited Fe(ox) does not increase monotonically with the number of the modification cycles, but tends to saturate rapidly, implying that the Fe(ox) framework grows laterally on the LCO surface. An increase of the electrical resistivity of the LCO particles that influences adversely catalytic activity is suppressed when a high coverage of the LCO surface by the Fe(ox) framework is achieved at subsequent modification cycles.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1466-8033			WOS:000406696300016

Herein, SrTiO3 nanocrystals with controllably exposed {001} and {110} facets are prepared as a proof-of-concept candidate to study the effect of exposed facets on the activation of molecular oxygen into O-2(center dot-) species, finally acting on the photocatalytic oxidation of gaseous HCHO. The photocatalytic test demonstrates that {110} facet exposed SrTiO3 nanoparticles present a HCHO photocatalytic degradation rate about 6.8 times faster than that of the {001} facet exposed one. The experiments and theoretical calculations together confirm that as compared to the {001} facet exposed sample, the {110} facet exposed sample is favorable for activating molecular oxygen to produce O-2(center dot-) species under the irradiation of light, owing to the relatively higher conduction band position and lower surface adsorption energy for O-2 molecules as well as advantageous charge accumulation on adsorbed O-2 molecules. Finally, the new production of O-2(center dot-) species and the higher charge separation contribute to the superior HCHO photocatalytic oxidation activity of {110} facet exposed SrTiO3. This interesting finding is probably useful for the design of highly efficient single crystal photocatalysts for photocatalytic oxidation reactions.									38	2	0	0	6	0	38			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000415990800047

This property has been exploited in Nature for an enormous variety of physiological functions, and representatives of this ancient enzyme family have been identified in all kingdoms of life. The catalytic versatility of P450s makes them well suited for repurposing for the synthesis of fine chemicals such as drugs. Although these enzymes have not evolved in Nature to perform the reactions required for modern chemical industries, many P450s show relaxed substrate specificity and exhibit some degree of activity towards non-natural substrates of relevance to applications such as drug development. Directed evolution and other protein engineering methods can be used to improve upon this low level of activity and convert these promiscuous generalist enzymes into specialists capable of mediating reactions of interest with exquisite regio- and stereo-selectivity. Although there are some notable successes in exploiting P450s from natural sources in metabolic engineering, and P450s have been proven repeatedly to be excellent material for engineering, there are few examples to date of practical application of engineered P450s. The purpose of the present review is to illustrate the progress that has been made in altering properties of P450s such as substrate range, cofactor preference and stability, and outline some of the remaining challenges that must be overcome for industrial application of these powerful biocatalysts.									51	0	0	0	30	0	51			0264-6021	1470-8728		WOS:000351687500001	25793416

This behavioural measure of risk-taking reflects the risk of being captured by real predators, and it correlates with a range of life history traits, as expected if flight distance optimizes risk of predation. Given that FID provides information on risk of predation, we should expect that physiological and morphological mechanisms that facilitate flight and escape predict interspecific variation in flight distance. Haematocrit is a measure of packed red blood cell volume and as such indicates the oxygen transport ability and hence the flight muscle contracting reaction of an individual. Therefore, we predicted that species with short flight distances, that allow close proximity between a potential prey individual and a predator, would have high haematocrit. Furthermore, we predicted that species with large wing areas and hence relatively low costs of flight and species with large aspect ratios and hence high manoeuvrability would have evolved long flight speed. Consistent with these predictions, we found in a sample of 63 species of birds that species with long flight distances for their body size had low levels of haematocrit and large wing areas and aspect ratios. These findings provide evidence consistent with the evolution of risk-taking behaviour being underpinned by physiological and morphological mechanisms that facilitate escape from predators and add to our understanding of predatorprey coevolution.									21	1	0	0	21	1	22			1010-061X	1420-9101		WOS:000318291900019	23617805

The finite volume discretisation and the bi-conjugate gradient stabilised method are used to solve the system of governing equations. The chemical kinetics model is based on a first order pyrolysis reaction, followed by oxidation of the porous fuel and the carbonaceous residual. This second reaction of oxidation might promote the transition from smouldering to flaming, and thus, fire initiation. The gas and solid temperature, the oxygen and the char mass fraction temporal evolutions are computed, based on the adopted chemical kinetics model, and the assumed heat and mass transfer coefficients. The smoulder propagation velocity is then determined. The developed code featured a CPU time, of the simulated phenomena, of the order of 47 hours on a typical Pentium 4 configuration, which represents a significant improvement compared to many previously applied algorithms. The developed code is able to simulate any smouldering and/or reacting front propagation through a fixed bed.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1468-4349	1741-5233		WOS:000247901100005

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have sparked tremendous interest for their maximum atom-utilization efficiency and fascinating properties. Therefore, the development of effective synthetic methodology toward SACs becomes highly imperative yet still remains greatly challenging. Herein, a reliable SiO2-templated strategy is elaborately designed to synthesize atomically dispersed Fe atoms anchored on N-doped carbon nanospheres (denoted as Fe-N-C HNSs) using the cheap and sustainable biomaterial of histidine (His) as the N and C precursor. By virtue of the numerous atomically dispersed Fe-N-4 moieties and unique spherical hollow architecture, the as-fabricated Fe-N-C HNSs exhibit excellent ORR performance in alkaline medium with outstanding activity, high long-term stability, and superior tolerance to methanol crossover, exceeding the commercial Pt/C catalyst and most previously reported non-precious-metal catalysts. This present synthetic strategy will provide new inspiration to the fabrication of various high-efficiency single-atom catalysts for diverse applications.									361	26	0	0	26	0	364			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000459798700012	30589127

Factors such as templates, precursors, and carbonization-activation methods, directly determine their performance. However, rational design and preparation of porous carbon materials with controlled 2D morphology and heteroatom dopants remains a challenge. Therefore, an ionic polyimide with both sp(2)- and sp(3)-hybridized nitrogen atoms was prepared as a precursor for fabricating N-doped hexagonal porous carbon nanosheets through a hard-template approach. Because of the large surface area and efficient charge-mass transport, the resulting activated 2D porous carbon nanosheets (2DPCs-a) displayed promising electrocatalytic properties for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline and acidic media, such as ultralow half-wave potential (0.83 vs. 0.84 V of Pt/C) and superior limiting current density (5.42 vs. 5.14 mA cm(-2) of Pt/C). As air cathodes in Zn-air batteries, the as-developed 2DPCs-a exhibited long stability and high capacity (up to 614 mA h g(-1)), which are both higher than those of commercial Pt/C. This work provides a convenient method for controllable and scalable 2DPCs fabrication as well as new opportunities to develop high-efficiency electrocatalysts for ORR and Zn-air batteries.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000509596600001	31788872	
J	Bao, Han; Dilbeck, Preston L.; Burnap, Robert L.								Proton transport facilitating water-oxidation: the role of second sphere ligands surrounding the catalytic metal cluster								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				116	2-3	SI		215	229		10.1007/s11120-013-9907-1				OCT 2013	2013	The ability of PSII to extract electrons from water, with molecular oxygen as a by-product, is a remarkable biochemical and evolutionary innovation. From an evolutionary perspective, the invention of PSII approximately 2.7 Ga led to the accelerated accumulation of biomass in the biosphere and the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere, a combination that allowed for the evolution of a much more complex and extensive biosphere than would otherwise have been possible. From the biochemical and enzymatic perspective, PSII is remarkable because of the thermodynamic and kinetic obstacles that needed to have been overcome to oxidize water as the ultimate photosynthetic electron donor. This article focuses on how proton release is an integral part of how these kinetic and thermodynamic obstacles have been overcome: the sequential removal of protons from the active site of H2O-oxidation facilitates the multistep oxidation of the substrate water at the Mn4CaO (x) , the catalytic heart of the H2O-oxidation reaction. As noted previously, the facilitated deprotonation of the Mn4CaO (x) cluster exerts a redox-leveling function preventing the accumulation of excess positive charge on the cluster, which might otherwise hinder the already energetically difficult oxidation of water. Using recent results, including the characteristics of site-directed mutants, the role of the second sphere of amino acid ligands and the associated network of water molecules surrounding the Mn4CaO (x) is discussed in relation to proton transport in other systems. In addition to the redox-leveling function, a trapping function is assigned to the proton release step occurring immediately prior to the dioxygen chemistry. This trapping appears to involve a yet-to-be clarified gating mechanism that facilitates to coordinated release of a proton from the neighborhood of the active site thereby insuring that the backward charge-recombination reaction does not out-compete the forward reaction of dioxygen chemistry during this final step of H2O-oxidation.									27	0	0	0	16	0	26			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000325848800007	23975203

Here we report an unexpected finding that manganese oxide, a kind of common non-noble catalysts easily soluble in acidic solutions, can be applied as a highly efficient and extremely durable anodic electrocatalyst for hydrogen production from an acidic aqueous solution of alcohols. Particularly in a glycerol solution, a potential of as low as 1.36 V (vs. RHE) is needed at 10 mA cm(-2), which is 270 mV lower than that of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), to oxidize glycerol into value-added chemicals such as formic acid, without oxygen production. To our surprise, the manganese oxide exhibits extremely high stability for electrocatalytic hydrogen production in coupling with glycerol oxidation for longer than 865 hours compared to shorter than 10 h for OER. Moreover, the effect of the addition of glycerol on the electrochemical durability has been probed via in situ Raman spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work demonstrates that acid-unstable metal oxide electrocatalysts can be used robustly in acidic media under the presence of certain substances for electrochemical purposes, such as hydrogen production.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000686016700001	34322983

The unusual redox reactions in PSII often lead to damage, degradation, and reassembly of this molecular machine. To identify novel assembly factors, high sensitivity proteomic analysis of PSII purified from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was performed. This analysis identified six PSII-associated proteins that are encoded by an operon containing nine genes, slr0144 to slr0152. This operon encodes proteins that are not essential components of the PSII holocomplex but accumulate to high levels in pre-complexes lacking any of the lumenal proteins PsbP, PsbQ, or PsbV. The operon contains genes with putative binding domains for chlorophylls and bilins, suggesting these proteins may function as a reservoir for cofactors needed during the PSII lifecycle. Genetic deletion of this operon shows that removal of these protein products does not alter photoautotrophic growth or PSII fluorescence properties. However, the deletion does result in decreased PSII-mediated oxygen evolution and an altered distribution of the S states of the catalytic manganese cluster. These data demonstrate that the proteins encoded by the genes in this operon are necessary for optimal function of PSII and function as accessory proteins during assembly of the PSII complex. Thus, we have named the products of the slr0144-slr0152 operon Pap (Photosystem II assembly proteins).									35	2	0	0	34	0	35			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000259719200054	18693241

A new hybrid, which was fabricated by incorporating molybdenum carbide (MoxC) nanoparticles into a nitrogen-implanted three-dimensional carbon matrix (MoCN-3D), was developed as a highly active and durable nonprecious metal electrocatalyst for HER. The porous architecture of MoCN-3D can provide continuous mass transportation with a minimal diffusion resistance and thus produce effective electrocatalytic kinetics in both acidic and alkaline media. Experimental observations in combination with density functional theory calculations reveal that the effective coupling between molybdenum carbide nanoparticles and the carbon matrix, as well as N hybrid coordination, can modify the electronic Fermi level of the final hybrid, which synergistically reduces the proton adsorption and the reduction barrier during electrocatalytic HER.									94	8	0	0	0	0	94			1884-4049	1884-4057		WOS:000383414800011

The critical dose for amorphization at 170 and 300 K is similar to0.14 dpa, and a higher dose of similar to 0.22 dpa is observed for irradiation at 700 K, which agrees with previous in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data for polycrystatline Sm2Ti2O7. Annealing in an 180 environment reveals a damage recovery stage at similar to 850 K that coincides with a significant increase in O-18 exchange due to oxygen vacancy mobility. This thermal recovery stage is also consistent with the critical temperature for amorphization measured by in-situ TEM in polycrystalline samples.

Sequent loading with trace amounts of metal-free porphyrin and Co2+ in RGO can dramatically enhance both the half wave potential and the peak current density. Intriguingly, the RGO/P/2Co single cluster exhibits the best ORR. catalytic performance with the half-wave potential of 0.834 V, extremely approaching that of commercial Pt/C (0.836 V). This half-wave potential surpasses most of the reported half-wave potentials of RGO supported non-noble metal ORR catalysts through low temperature synthesis. Furthermore, the as-prepared RGO/P/2Co delivers a peak current density of 1.3 times higher than that of Pt/C at the same loading, together with a high mass activity of 2.76 A mg(co)(-1). During the durability test, a cathodic current loss less than 10% is recorded after 8000 continuous potential cycles. Insights into this successful example will be conducive to the development of elegant routes for constructing metal nitrogen (MN)-based ORR catalysts with high efficiency, outstanding stability, and excellent selectivity.									35	5	0	0	1	0	36			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000405764700042	28609106

In recent years, low-cost and high-efficiency electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have attracted a lot of attention. Herein, we report that in situgenerated Co@nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Co@NCNTs) derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) were fabricated by a facile method and corresponding HER activities were investigated in detail. Among these hybrids, the Co@NCNTs-800 hybrid shows outstanding electrocatalytic activity and stability, which is one of the best Co-based electrocatalysts for the HER under both alkaline and acidic conditions reported to date, benefiting from the synergistic effect from Co nanoparticles, N dopants, and CNTs. Most importantly, this work paves a new way for designing novel, efficient, and inexpensive HER electrocatalysts derived from MOFs as promising alternatives to Pt or Pt-based materials.									25	2	0	0	0	0	26			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000411768600053

An efficient electrocatalyst was fabricated via the electroless plating of well-dispersed Co-Ni-P alloy particles on three-dimensional graphene using nickel foam as the template (Co-Ni-P/rGO/NF). Co-Ni-P/rGO/NF exhibited excellent HER activity with a low overpotential of 65 mV and a small Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This catalyst also showed prominent electrochemical durability (over more than 10 h) in an alkaline electrolyte. Therefore, this study provides a facile design for non-noble-metal electrocatalysts, which can be used in future applications to replace Pt-based electrocatalysts.

C	Fray, Derek						Kongoli, F; Reddy, RG		Electrochemical production of materials using molten salts								SOHN INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ADVANCED PROCESSING OF METALS AND MATERIALS, VOL 3: THERMO AND PHYSICOCHEMICAL PRINCIPLES: SPECIAL MATERIALS AND AQUEOUS AND ELECTROCHEMICAL PROCESSING								587	595						2006	2006	Molten salts have been used for the extraction of metals since the 19(th) century but, recently, many interesting processes have been investigated using mixtures of molten salts and different cathodic materials. In several existing processes, the cation is simply discharged from melt but, in some cases, complications arise when the electrode potentials of the cations are relatively close. For example, the co-deposition of sodium with aluminium in the Hall-Heroult process is discussed in terms of electrode potentials of the components in the molten electrolyte. Similar considerations will also be given to the anodic reactions with respect to chlorine, oxygen, carbon dioxide or monoxide evolution from chloride-oxide melts. In some cases, the cathodic product interacts with the cathode to produce new and exciting products such as nanotubes from carbon or titanates and reduced titanium oxides from titanium dioxide. Depending on the electrode potentials, it is also possible to completely change the cathodic reaction from discharge of the cation in the salt to ionisation of the anions in the cathode. Examples are given of the reduction of metal oxides to produce metals, high technology alloys and nanomaterials and the cathodic refining of liquid metals.

The decomposition process, which was carried out under an ambient atmosphere at room temperature and tracked by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, appears to proceed by way of a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) process. The amorphous nature of the films is based on the lack of any observable Bragg reflections by powder X-ray diffraction techniques; the elemental composition was corroborated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The films are found to be excellent electrocatalysts for mediating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media, as evidenced by the onset of catalysis at 130 mV and a Tafel slope of 34 mV dec(-1). These parameters enable current densities of 1 and 10 mA cm(-2) to be reached at 190 and 220 mV, respectively. Exposing the films to higher temperatures (500 degrees C) renders a film of crystalline iridium oxide, c-IrOx, which displays a Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1), thus requiring an additional SO mV to reach a current density of 1 mA cm(-2). The film of a-IrOx reported here is among the best OER electrocatalysts reported to date.									161	4	0	0	13	0	162			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000332059400022		
J	Kang, Zhen; Qin, Ke-Zhang; Mao, Ya-Jing; Tang, Dong-Mei; Yao, Zhuo-Sen				Qin, Kezhang/K-4695-2017				The formation of a magmatic Cu- Ni sulfide deposit in mafic intrusions at the Kalatongke, NW China: Insights from amphibole mineralogy and composition								LITHOS				352						105317	10.1016/j.lithos.2019.105317				JAN 2020	2020	The early Permian Kalatongke Cu-Ni sulfide deposit in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) is the most important Cu-Ni deposit in northern Xinjiang, NW China. It is hosted mainly by mafic intrusions, which is in contrast to deposits in the Eastern Tianshan area of eastern Xinjiang that are hosted mainly by ultramafic intrusions. The controls on sulfide mineralization in the Kalatongke mafic intrusions are poorly constrained relative to the ultramafic intrusions. Here we use amphibole compositions to trace the nature, oxygen fugacity, and water content of the Kalatongke magmas. The results, together with data for other Ni-Cu mineralized magmas in Eastern Tianshan, are used to clarify the formation mechanism of sulfide mineralization in mafic intrusions. Amphiboles in the Kalatongke intrusions are divided into three types based on petrographic features: poikilitic amphiboles in olivine norite and norite (Type 1), which formed by reactions between olivine and pyroxene and interstitial residual melt; zoned amphiboles in norite (Type 2), generated by contamination processes; and needle-shaped amphiboles in diorite (Type 3), which indicate rapid cooling during the early stage of magma evolution. Modeled results show that the melts in equilibrium with amphiboles and clinopyroxenes exhibit enrichment in Th, U, and light rare earth elements (LREE) over heavy REE (HREE). Combined with amphibole and clinopyroxene chemistry, this indicates that the parental magma of the Kalatongke intrusions was strongly contaminated by continental crust during ascent. The oxygen fugacity of the magma during fractionation was evaluated using amphibole chemistry and olivine-sulfide equilibration. The oxygen fugacity of the magmas varied during their evolution, with the Kalatongke deposit magma showing relatively little variation compared with the deposits related to ultramafic intrusions in Eastern Tianshan. The oxygen fugacity of ore-forming magma thus varied significantly during the early stages of magma emplacement. Moreover, the calculated water content of melts in equilibrium with Kalatongke amphibole and clinopyroxenes averages 4.37 wt% in. These lines of evidence indicate that a highly hydrous and relatively oxidized magma favors the formation of sulfide deposits in mafic intrusions. It is inferred that sulfide saturation was delayed to the onset of mafic magma crystallization, rather than trapped in the early crystallized olivine cumulate within the staging magma chamber.

The morphology and composition are highly dependent on the available parameters inferring of exact hydrolysis of tetrabutyl titanate and sintering temperature. The obtained hierarchical microstructure is composed of numerous dodecahedron-like hollow boxes decorated with in-situ growth of size-tunable and twisting nanotubes on surfaces. The effective elemental separation of Ti and Co on the upper and lower ends of nanotubes can be realized by regulating the ionic migration and crystalline phase formation process at a high temperature. The as-prepared C-N/Co/Ti composites exhibit the enhanced electrocatalytic activities to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via a favorable four-electron pathway and the desired reaction kinetics with the low Tafel slope (67.8 mV dec(-1)), as well as the excellent methanol tolerance in comparison with the Pt/C electrocatalysts. The superior ORR electrocatalytic performance would be mainly contributed to the combination of the designed multi-phase composition, the enhanced surface adsorption/desorption, the modified surface/interface electron transfer mechanism, and the constructed Co/Ti double-active sites on different locations of microstructure. The present work presents a new insight for the synthesis of C-N-based inorganic composite with outstanding electrocatalytic behavior for ORR process.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000523185200058

However, high-performance TiO2-based electrocatalysts for HER are quite limited, and the catalytic active centers still remain elusive. Herein, a simple strategy is demonstrated for the synthesis of TiO2-carbon composite (TiO2/C) with high HER performance and stability. The remarkable HER performance of TiO2/C can be ascribed to the doping of carbon atoms, which leads to stronger hybridization of Ti 3d and O 2p orbitals, thus substantially improving the electrocatalytic efficiency. This study elucidates that the hydrogen evolution activity of oxide electrocatalysts can be largely improved by regulating their electronic structures by doping carbon atoms and also provides an effective strategy for designing heterostructured electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and stability at high current density for HER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2637-9368		WOS:000745083400001

The char employed in the study was subjected to a series of kinetics-limited oxidation tests in a pressurized thermogravimetric analyzer (PTGA). Temperature-programmed desorption and BET-CO2 gas adsorption tests were also performed in order to characterize surface oxide complexes and specific surface areas. In agreement with other studies, the experiments indicated that the surface-oxide populations may be characterized in terms of a distribution of desorption activation energies and that migration of the surface oxide complexes is significant. A heterogeneous reaction mechanism was developed to account for the observed rates of O-2 adsorption, CO and CO2 desorption, and surface-oxide accumulation and was used in a numerical algorithm that modeled the PTGA reaction environment. Surface species were characterized by activation-energy-based distributions; allowance was made for the impact of surface area evolution on surface species concentrations. Analysis of calculated results indicate that a quasi-steady surface area assumption tends to underpredict surface species concentrations, especially at late conversions, but can overpredict these concentrations at early conversions. Calculated results also indicate that using less than five sites to approximate activation energy distributions yields results that are inconsistent with oxidation behaviors that are based on the full distributions.

However, the complex kinetics and high reaction barriers greatly hinder the development of the photocatalytic N-2 reduction reaction. Herein, a BiOBr/MXene-Ti3C2 composite catalyst is prepared by the simple electrostatic adsorption and self-assembly method. The as-prepared 10 wt % BiOBr/Ti3C2 exhibits the best performance for N-2 fixation to NH3 by photocatalysis. The evolution rate of NH3 is up to 234.6 mu mol center dot g(-1)center dot h(-1), which is approximately 48.8 times and 52.4 times higher than those of pure BiOBr and Ti3C2, respectively. It is found that the designed double vacancies of oxygen and titanium for BiOBr/ Ti3C2 composites, with the availability of localized electrons, have the ability to adsorb and activate N-2, which can be efficiently reduced to NH3 by the interfacial electrons transferred from the excited BiOBr/Ti3C2 composite. In addition, the results of in situ Fourier transform infrared show the generation of NxHy species by the continuous protonation processes. Moreover, titanium vacancy (V-Ti) induces a strong absorption energy for nitrogen atoms on the surface of BiOBr/Ti3C2 according to the density functional theory calculations. In particular, the P-electron feedback caused by V-Ti could effectively promote the weakening of the N.N triple bond and elongate the N-2 bond length by similar to 31.6%. This work might provide new insights into the synergistic effect of double defects and inspiration for the rational design of catalysts by defect engineering in the field of catalytic synthesis of ammonia.									17	1	0	0	1	0	17			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000697282300027	34467762

Their structural properties have been examined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), oxidation power and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. To study the effects of solid state properties of the spinel-type compounds on their electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (orr) in aqueous KCI-KOH solutions, the cathodic polarization characteristics were investigated on composite electrodes of copper and manganese spinel-type oxides nanoparticles embedded in an electrically conductive polymer. These electrodes consisted of multilayered composite electrodes on conductive glass (CG), having the structure CG/PPY/PPy (Ox)/PPy, where PPy is the polypyrrole and Ox is a mixed valence oxide with the general composition CuxMn3-xO4 (1.0 <= x <= 1.4). The data have shown that the substitution of Mn by Cu increases the catalytic activity, the maximum being that exhibited by Cu1.4Mn1.6O4.Correlations between solid state chemistry and electrocatalytical reactivities towards the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media were also investigated on the composite powder electrodes of CuxMn3-xO4 (1.0 <= x <= 1.4). The results have indicated that the copper content promotes not only the Mn4+/Mn(3+)formation but also the increase of the Mn4+/Mn3+ The change of the Mn4+/Mn3+ ratio as a function of x has been correlated to the electrocatalytical parameters of the orr. The enhanced activity that is observed is related to the higher occurrence of the Mn4+/Mn3+ solid state redox couple in octahedral sites. (C) 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

The temporal dependence of the photodissociation coefficients has been calculated in detail, paying special attention to twilight conditions. Photochemical processes for the different compounds are considered using the latest reaction rate coefficients. Vertical transport effects are also included, considering molecular diffusion and a semiempirical eddy diffusion coefficient profile. The variability of the different compounds throughout a complete day is obtained and compared with other theoretical models and experimental measurements. Special emphasis is paid to the study of the rapid changes occurring during morning and evening twilight times in the concentration of various minor compounds. The results obtained have been applied to the study of the diurnal evolution of the O2(1-DELTA-g) and OH emissions derived from appropriate photochemical schemes. A reasonable agreement is achieved between different measurements and our predictions and this may be taken to validate the model.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			0032-0633			WOS:A1991FT14500001		
J	Shen, Bo; Wen, Xianghua; Korshin, Gregory V.								Electrochemical oxidation of ciprofloxacin in two different processes: the electron transfer process on the anode surface and the indirect oxidation process in bulk solutions								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS				20	6			943	955		10.1039/c8em00122g				JUN 1 2018	2018	Herein, the rotating disk electrode technique was used for the first time to investigate the effects of mass-transfer limitations and pH on the electrochemical oxidation of CPX, to determine the kinetics of CPX oxidation and to explore intrinsic mechanisms during the electron transfer process. Firstly, cyclic voltammetry revealed that an obvious irreversible CPX oxidation peak was observed within the potential window from 0.70 to 1.30 V at all pHs. Based on the Levich equation, the electrochemical oxidation of CPX in the electron transfer process was found to be controlled by both diffusion and kinetic processes when pH = 2, 5, 7 and 9; the diffusion coefficient of CPX at pH = 2 was calculated to be 1.5 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1). Kinetic analysis indicated that the reaction on the electrode surface was adsorption-controlled compared to a diffusion process; the surface concentration of electroactive species was estimated to be 1.15 x 10(-9) mol cm(-2), the standard rate constant of the surface reaction was calculated to be 1.37 s(-1), and CPX oxidation was validated to be a two-electron transfer process. Finally, a possible CPX oxidation pathway during the electron transfer process was proposed. The electrochemical degradation of CPX on a Ti-based anode was also conducted subsequently to investigate the electrochemical oxidation of CPX in the indirect oxidation process in bulk solutions. The effects of pH and current density were determined and compared to related literature results. The oxidation of CPX at different pHs is believed to be the result of a counterbalance between favorable and unfavorable factors, namely electromigration and side reactions of oxygen evolution, respectively. The effects of current density indicated a diffusion- and reaction-controlled process at low currents followed by a reaction-controlled process at high currents. The results presented in this study provide better understanding of the electrochemical oxidation of CPX and would enable the development of new treatment methods based on electrochemistry.									15	0	0	0	6	0	15			2050-7887	2050-7895		WOS:000436029900006	29756621	
J	Luo, Yongjun; Gao, Wenxiang; Liu, Fuyu; Gao, Yuqi								Mitochondrial nt3010G-nt3970C haplotype is implicated in high-altitude adaptation of Tibetans								MITOCHONDRIAL DNA				22	5-6			181	190		10.3109/19401736.2011.632771				OCT 2011	2011	Tibetans are well adapted to living and thriving in high-altitude environments. Mitochondria are central links to oxygen consumption, and variations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) could play a role in high-altitude adaptation. Alleles at several polymorphic sites in mtDNA define common haplotypes, or haplogroups, including some that have been implicated in the risk of developing certain diseases. However, few reports have determined whether relationships exist between haplogroups and high-altitude adaptation in the Tibetan population. The D4 haplogroup is a major haplogroup of the Han Chinese. In the present study, genotypes of 12 polymorphisms were determined in members of a Tibetan population (n = 72), low altitude-Han (la-Han, n = 144), and high altitude-Han (ha-Han, n = 227) populations using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and polymerase chain reaction-ligase detection reaction assays. The mitochondrial haplogroup D4 was negatively associated with high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans (P = 0.001 vs. la-Han, OR = 0.166, 95% CI = 0.048-0.567; P = 0.009 vs. ha-Han OR = 0.232, 95% CI = 0.069-0.778). The frequency of the nt3010G-nt3970C haplotype was significantly higher in Tibetans than in la-Han (P = 0.000) and ha-Han (P 0.001) subjects. Findings in the present study suggest that unique mitochondrial variations determine a genetic background that is associated with high-altitude adaptation in the Tibetan population.									15	5	0	0	11	0	20			1940-1736	1940-1744		WOS:000298002600010	22117106

Most of the time, the lifetime of intermediates is too short to allow their isolation and subsequent identification by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The developments of ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with the advances in the acquisition rates of mass spectrometry could facilitate the research on antioxidant mechanisms. This work is based on the reaction involved in the Oxygen Radical Antioxidant Capacity (ORAC) and Total Radical trapping Antioxidant Parameter (TRAP) assays. Hence, the reaction between 2,2'-azobis (2-amidinepropane)dihydrochloride (AAPH) radicals and an antioxidant was carried out in the thermostatized autosampler of a chromatographic device. Then, the reaction media were injected every six minutes, and the compounds were separated by UHPLC and detected by mass spectrometry in scan mode. Nine consecutive injections were registered in a unique file, then the evolution of the reaction for one hour in a single run was monitored. In this way, the reaction mechanisms of Trolox and eugenol with AAPH were studied, leading to the detection of nine and thirteen different compounds, respectively. An exhaustive analysis of the spectra obtained in product ion scan mode led to the identification of the compounds. Most of them were species previously found in the literature, but others have never been reported, so tentative structures were suggested. All this allowed the proposal of several steps within the antioxidant mechanisms of Trolox and eugenol, showing the great performance of UHPLC-MS/MS to complement the use of NMR in antioxidant mechanistic studies.									11	0	1	0	5	0	12			0003-2654			WOS:000297998000026	22081796

However, limited attention is paid on delicately optimizing the free energy barrier of Fe-N-4 active sites through heteroatom doping in the carbon skeleton. Herein, Fe single atoms (SAs) on heteroatoms N- and P-codoped porous honeycomb-like carbon (Fe-N-4/NP-PHC) have been rationally designed. The as-developed Fe-N-4/NP-PHC catalyst with abundant accessible active sites showed an impressive onset potential (E-onset = 1.0 V) and half-wave potential (E-1/2 = 0.89 V) under low electrocatalyst loading capacity, which is more positive than those of Pt/C and most SAECs. Encouragingly, the experimental results and DFT calculations systematically demonstrated that the optimized adsorption energy of the Fe-N-4 sites in the P-doped carbon matrix facilitated the release of OH* and thus boosted the ORR performance. The metal-air battery containing Fe-N-4/NP-PHC exhibited high peak power density and long-term working feasibility with a low voltage gap at large current densities. This study demonstrates that P doping in carbon matrix is an effective strategy to promote catalytic properties and presents a novel avenue for developing high-performance electrocatalysts for various electrochemical reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000842224700001

By a facile controllable process through self-assembly and chemical etching of reducedgraphene oxide, synergetic enhancement of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance from intrinsic activity to apparent activity was realized. The as-obtained materials exhibit 3D interconnected hierarchical porosity for efficient mass transport, a high surface defect content with increased numbers of active sites and a robust conductive network, leading to a comprehensive multiscale electron transfer capability that ultimately enhances the ORR catalytic activity. Incredibly, the alkaline ORR performance of as-obtained catalyst exhibits a 4-electron pathway reaction with an onset potential (E-onset) of 0.89 V, half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.84 V, and a lower Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1), showing activity comparable to that of Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, the as assembled primary Zn-air batteries (ZABs) demonstrate a higher power density (182.6 mW cm(2)) and a higher specific capacity (809.1 mA h g(-1)) than the Pt/C-based counterpart. The outstanding electrochemical performance and facile fabrication techniques make this material a promising alternative to commercial Pt/C for renewable energy devices. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

PCC 6803 in which the glutamic acid at position 354 of the 43 kDa chlorophyll protein (CP43) was replaced with glutamine. To determine the effect of this mutation on the reaction processes of the Mn cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex, we mainly analyzed the spectroscopic properties, including Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, of photosystem II core complexes. Mutant cells exhibited a lower oxygen-evolving activity than wild-type cells, and an altered pattern of flash-dependent delayed luminescence. This phenotype differed somewhat from an earlier report of the same mutant [Strickler, M. A., et al. (2008) Philos. Trans. R. Soc. London, Ser. B 363, 1179-1187]. FTIR difference spectroscopy revealed that CP43-Glu354 functions as a ligand to the Mn cluster, most likely with bridging bidentate coordination to two Mn ions in the S-1 state and chelating bidentate coordination to a single Mn ion in the S-2 state. A single water molecule was bound to the same Mn atom to which CP43-Glu354 was ligated, and this Mn atom was oxidized in the S-1-to-S-2 transition. This is the first report on a binding site of a water molecule relevant to a specific amino acid ligand. We found that the Mn ion or ligand that is oxidized in the S-2-to-S-3 transition was not directly coupled to CP43-Glu354. While the definitive assignment or ligation to the Mn atoms is still under debate, our identification of a novel water binding site will lead to new insights into the oxygen evolution mechanism.									41	0	0	0	28	0	41			0006-2960			WOS:000267609100007	19466796

In this present study, a simplified mathematical model of the electrochemical processes, occurring during ECT, is presented. The model is based on electrode kinetics and transport equations of ionic species in dilute solutions. The analysis focuses on tissue surrounding a spherical platinum anode, which is treated as an aqueous solution of sodium chloride containing a bicarbonate buffer system. The considered electrochemical reactions are chlorine and oxygen evolution, while the considered homogeneous chemical reactions are the water protolysis and buffer reactions. The validity of the model is investigated by comparing simulated pH profiles with pH profiles and lesion sizes, reported from in vivo experiments. This paper indicates that by putting a proper set of input parameters into quite a simple mathematical model, it is possible to predict the size of a lesion produced through ECT. The model gives a very good qualitative and a fairly good quantitative description of the pH profile, obtained in tissue surrounding the anode after ECT treatment. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

Herein, one nickel nitride-based heterostructure composed of 1D Ni0.2Mo0.8N nanorods and 0D Ni3N nanoparticles (denoted as NiMoN/NiN) is reported to exhibit significantly promoted hydrogen evolution reaction performance in both alkaline and neutral media. In particular, the optimal overpotential of the NiMoN/NiN sample at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH is 49 mV. The successful fabrication of 1D/0D heterostructures is mainly ascribed to morphology-inherited nitridation of 1D oxide precursor (denoted as NiMoO-NRs) in situ grown on Ni foam surface, and attributed to strong Lewis acid-base interaction that renders the Ni2+ ions emitted from the oxide precursor to well coordinate with NH3 for the formation of Ni3N nanoparticles during the nitridation process. It is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that the special 1D/0D heterostructure provides tandem active phases Ni0.2Mo0.8N and Ni3N for synergistic promotion in lowering the activation energy of H2O dissociation and optimizing the adsorption energy of H, respectively. This work may open a new avenue for developing highly active tandem electrocatalysts for promising renewable energy conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000798091400001	35595714

In this study, 17 geothermal water samples were collected from southwest China, and XRD, SEM, hydrogen and oxygen isotopes, correlation analysis, mineral saturation index method, and reverse geochemical simulation were combined to uncover the types and evolution mechanism of geothermal water.The results show that the main chemical types of geothermal water in the area are SO4.HCO3-Ca.Mg type water, followed by Cl-Na Cl.SO4-Na.Ca type water, and the origin of geothermal water is atmospheric precipitation recharge, with its elevation of 564.87-1447.44 m. The main mineral composition of thermal reservoir is dolomite, followed by calcite, gypsum, halite and a small amount of clay minerals and quartz. During the process of hot water runoff, there is a strong water rock interaction with the surrounding rocks of the thermal reservoir. Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42-, HCO3- are mainly derived from the dissolution of carbonate minerals and gypsum salts. Especially, Mg2+ mainly comes from the dissolution of dolomite, HCO3- is from the dissolution of dolomite and calcite, Ca2+ is controlled by the dissolution of dolomite, calcite and gypsum, and SO42- mainly comes from the dissolution of gypsum. In addition, the abnormally high Na+, Cl-, and TDS in some geothermal waters in the area is mainly controlled by the cation exchange reaction of clay minerals or clay-like minerals in the salt-forming basins and thermal reservoirs of Sichuan, northwest of the study area. PHREEQC inverse modeling verifies that dolomite, gypsum, and halite-NaCl dissolution and partial weak cation exchange reactions were the main hydrogeochemical reactions. The research results provide a reference for the study of the hydrogeochemical evolution mechanism of geothermal water in carbonate rock areas, contributing to the rational development, utilization and protection of geothermal water resources in the study region.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1866-7538			INSPEC:21582044

Hence, the development of a synthesis approach by which the chemical composition and phase of colloidal HEA nanoparticles can be controlled could lead to a new pool of nanoalloys with unparalleled functionalities. Herein, this study reports the single-step synthesis of colloidal CoCrFeMnNi HEA nanoparticles with targeted equimolar stoichiometry and diameters less than 5 nm by liquid-phase, ultrashort-pulsed laser ablation of the consolidated and heat-treated micropowders of the five constituent metals. Further, the scalability of the process with an unprecedented productivity of 3 grams of colloidal HEA nanoparticles per hour is demonstrated. Electrochemical analysis reveals a unique redox behavior of the particles' surfaces in an alkaline environment and a potential for future application as a heterogeneous catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction.									71	3	0	0	1	0	72				2046-2069		WOS:000472775900049	35515245

This work proposed a bimetallic Fe3O4/CuO catalyst prepared in situ from the Cu-Fe Prussian blue analogues precursor, promoting Fe3O4-modified CuO as a highly efficient and stable bimetallic WOC. The Fe3O4/CuO exhibits superior and robust catalytic activity for the oxidation of water. Compared with the reported results, it has a higher O-2 evolution rate of about 4406 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1) and a maximum value for the yield of O-2 as 83.2%, mainly because of the synergetic effect between Fe3O4 and CuO in the complicated water oxidation reaction (WOR) process. We hope this work will be useful for other researchers to design new transition metal bimetallic catalysts for WOR.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0888-5885			WOS:000460199800022

It is found that the embedding CCB into the PbO2 coating inhibited the growth and aggregation of the PbO2 crystal grains, caused the formation of porous structure and the preferred growth of the (101) and (301) planes of the PbO2 crystal, and enhanced the oxygen evolution overpotential and carrier density of PbO2. The degradation experiment of anthraquinone dye (reactive brilliant blue KN-R) showed that the CCB-modified Ti/F-PbO2 electrodes had higher photoelectrocatalytic activity than that of the bare Ti/F-PbO2 electrode. In addition, the accelerated life measurement demonstrated that the lifetime of the CCB-embedded Ti/F-PbO2 electrode was much longer than that of the bare Ti/F-PbO2 electrode. The improvement of decolorization efficiency and stability of the CCB-modified Ti/F-PbO2 can be attributed to the large active areas, the presence of photoelectric synergism, the inhibition of oxygen precipitation, high current efficiency for formation of hydroxyl radicals, and the weakening of internal stress in PbO2 coatings.									21	0	0	0	6	0	21			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000427805100017

However, their intrinsic activity is limited by the inadequate hydrogen adsorption energy. Herein, we reported a novel self-supported heterostructure catalyst in the form of Ni2P-NiSe2, which is obtained by phosphorization of NiSe2 nanosheet arrays grown on the carbon cloth. The heterostructure catalyst exhibits excellent HER performance in 1 M KOH, only requiring an overpotential of 66 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 72.6 mV dec(-1) and showing excellent long-term durability. The experimental and theoretical calculation results demonstrate the strongly electronic interaction between Ni2P and NiSe2, resulting in the optimized Gibbs free energy of hydrogen and water adsorption. This work concerning the regulation of electronic structure through interface engineering may offer a deep insight to explore superior catalysts.									149	11	0	0	15	0	151			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000501613700010

In this work, a PTB7:PC61BM BHJ-based photocathode is fabricated for photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous solution. With CuOx and TiOx thin films as interfacial modification layers, the photocathode with full structure (fluorine-doped tin oxide/CuOx/PTB7:PC61BM/TiOx/Pt) generates a maximum photocurrent density up to -7.27 mA cm(-2) and an onset potential as positive as 0.63 V. The half-cell solar-to-hydrogen efficiency is up to 1.5%, outperforming all of the previous BHJ-based photocathodes for HER CuOx is identified to play a role of facilitating charge separation, whereas TiOx improves the charge injection as well as blocks the back migration of holes during the PEC process. The factors including permeation of water and oxygen molecules, incident light spectrum, and current flowing that affect the PEC stability are investigated and discussed.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000462950400010

Both materials were found to transform from the spinel into the rocksalt phase while being imaged by high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) at room temperature. To mitigate the degradation, we found HR-STEM characterization at cryogenic temperature delays the critical electron dose for structural modification. We determined the native phase of materials to be spinel while the other phases observed by HR-STEM were induced by the electron-beam. From a careful analysis of the experimental data and a detailed understanding of the different degradation processes induced by an energetic electron beam, we conclude that radiolysis is the mechanism responsible for the degradation in LiNi(0.5)Mn(1.5)O(4)and ZnCo(1.8)Ni(0.2)O(4)nanoparticles.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3				2515-7639		WOS:000559775100001

The surface morphology and electrochemical performance of the as-prepared electrodes were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), etc. The characterization results indicated that Ti4O7 composite modification improved the surface morphology and crystal plane orientation of the PbO2 coating electrodes and reduced the interplanar spacing of PbO2. Phenol was chosen as the model pollutant to evaluate electrochemical activity of the electrode. The Ti4O7 with 1.0 g L-1 below 500 mesh modification electrodes presented the highest removal efficiency (97.8%) on degradation of phenol, which could be attributed to its high oxygen evolution potential (OEP) and more electrode active sites.

Their properties were compared with anodic Ta oxide film grown to the same formation voltage in 0.1 M NaOH. Anodizing process carried out in sodium citrate led to the growth of the anodic oxide with the best blocking properties whilst, when Ta is anodized in sodium adipate, a significant part of the circulated charge is wasted in side reactions, such as oxygen evolution. Photoelectrochemical measurements showed the presence of optical transitions at energy lower than the band gap for the anodic films grown in citrate and tartrate electrolytes, attributed to localized electronic states located close to the valence band mobility edge of the films generated by anions incorporation into the oxide. Differential capacitance measurements proved an increase by 17% in capacitance value for the oxide grown in citrate-containing solution with respect to that grown in NaOH electrolyte. A sketch of the energetic of the metal/oxide interface is provided.Graphical abstract									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000539813300001

The flash energy and the time interval between the flashes were varied between the experiments, and photoinactivation was measured with oxygen evolution and the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence (F-v/F-m). The photoinhibitory efficiency of saturating xenon flashes was found to be directly proportional to flash energy and independent of the time interval between the flashes. These findings indicate that a low-light-specific mechanism, based on charge recombination between PSII electron acceptors and the oxygen-evolving complex, is not the main cause of photoinactivation caused by short flashes in vivo. Furthermore, the relationship between the rate constant of photoinactivation and photon flux density was similar for flashes and continuous light when F-v/F-m was used to quantify photoinactivation, suggesting that continuous-light photoinactivation has a mechanism in which the quantum yield does not depend on the mode of delivery of light. A similar quantum yield of photoinhibition for flashes and continuous light is compatible with the manganese-based photoinhibition mechanism and with mechanisms in which singlet oxygen, produced via a direct photosensitization reaction, is the agent of damage. However, the classical acceptor-side and donor-side mechanisms do not predict a similar quantum yield for flashes and continuous light.									17	1	0	0	14	0	18			0022-0957	1460-2431		WOS:000283130300010	20643811

While the low utilization of sulfur and sluggish reaction kinetics would lead to degradation of electrochemical performance and thus hinder the practical application of Li-S batteries. Herein, a double-shelled TiO2-graphene heterostructure (H-TiO2/rGO) with abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) and highly exposed active plane as advanced host material in Li-S batteries is designed. This rational structure not only provides sufficient active sites and lower bandgap for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), but also builds smooth adsorption-diffusion-conversion of LiPSs on catalyst, which greatly reduces interfacial energy barrier and promotes the utilization of sulfur through suppressing the devastating shuttling effect. Combining the synergetic merits of strong anchoring ability and catalyzing the of LiPSs, the electrode (S-TiO2/rGO-1) exhibits superior rate performance and long lifespan (1000 cycles at 1C, 0.023% capacity loss per cycle) with high columbic efficiency. This work paves an alternative way to establish smooth adsorption-diffusion-conversion of polysulfides on catalyst in Li-S batteries and provides a new sight to understand catalyst design in energy storage devices.

The reaction is dominated by two broad resonances, at E-p = 338 and 1028 keV, and a direct capture contribution to the ground state of O-16. Interference effects between these contributions both in the low-energy region (E-p < 338 keV) and between the two resonances (338 < E-p < 1028 keV) can dramatically affect the extrapolation to energies of astrophysical interest. To facilitate a reliable extrapolation, the N-15(p,gamma)O-16 reaction has been remeasured covering the energy range from E-p = 1800 keV down to 130 keV. The results have been analyzed in the framework of a multilevel R-matrix theory and an S(0) value of 39.6 keV b has been found.									39	1	0	0	0	0	40			0556-2813	1089-490X		WOS:000284144600004

The total carbon of cermets debinded in H-2 is lower than that debinded in vacuum by 0.4%-0.5%. The contents of carbon and oxygen are decreased sharply when being sintered at 1 100-1 300 degrees C. The decomposition reaction of nitrogen is conducted sharply at 1 300 degrees C. However, the decomposition of nitrogen is inhibited while the liquid phase appears, and then begins again above 1 500 degrees C. The solution reaction of TaC and Mo2C into ring phase starts at 1 200 degrees C, and WC into ring phase at 1 300 degrees C is finished. Therefore, the heating rate during sintering of cermets between 900 degrees C and 1 350 degrees C is important.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			1003-6326	2210-3384		WOS:000272501300032

The resulting Co-Mo-O/Ni3S2/NF exhibits an excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in KOH solution, which yields a 50 mA cm(-2) of OER current density at an overpotential of 0.29 V, outperforming the state-of-the-art noble RuO2 (eta 50 = 0.42 V), Co-Mo-O/NF (eta 50 = 0.33 V) and Ni3S2/NF (eta 50 = 0.31 V). And it demonstrates a high specific capacity of 340 mAh g(-1) at 2 mA cm(-2) with good capability (82.1% of the retention at 32 mA cm(-2)) in basic solution when used as supercapacitor electrode, which is superior to those of Co-Mo-O/NF (183 mAh g(-1)) and Ni3S2/NF (70 mAh g(-1)). The outstanding electrochemical performance of Co-Mo-O/Ni3S2/NF is associated with the synergistic effect of the individual components as well as the nanosheets directly grown on Ni conducting support with more active sites exposed. Furthermore, Co-Mo-O/Ni3S2/NF displays good durability in 12 h-electrolysis experiment for OER and 10000 charge-discharge cycles. It is expected to benefit from Ni3S2 entrapped by the protective layer of 3D porous Co-Mo-O nanosheet arrays, which not only can provide channel for electrolyte ion to pass through, but also improve the stability of Ni3S2. In addition, the fabricated Co-Mo-O/Ni3S2/NF//Activated carbon (AC) asymmetrical supercapacitor shows an ultra-high energy density of 57.9 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 1.1 kW kg(-1).

Here, we present a combination of experiment and theory to reveal the dynamics of hydrogen abstraction by OH radical at primary and secondary sites in n-butane at a collision energy of 8 kcal/mol. Crossed molecular beam slice imaging experiments unequivocally probe the secondary abstraction channel showing backward angular distributions with mild energy release to product translation, which are accurately captured by trajectory calculations using a specific-reaction-parameter Hamiltonian. Experiments containing both reaction channels indicate a less marked backward character in the angular distribution, whose origin is shown by trajectory calculations to appear as an evolution toward more sideways scattering from the secondary to primary channel. While the two channels have markedly different angular distributions, their energy release is largely comparable, showing ample energy release into the water product. The synergistic combination of crossed-beam imaging and trajectories opens the door to detailed reaction-dynamics studies of chemical reactions with ever-increasing complexity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000547551400002	32640816

This subject, thus, stimulates studies on the improvement of new electrocatalysts. Specifically, through improving the population of active sites and/or the activity of individual sites, the performance of the catalysts can be significantly improved. However, clarifying the contribution of these two factors is still ambiguous and must be done with great care. To allow researchers in related fields to present their findings objectively, having a clear insight into the electrocatalytic activity is indispensable. In this study, a series of cobalt-based pre-electrocatalysts are taken as an example to examine their corresponding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) behaviors. Wherein, the three important metrics - electrochemical active surface area (ECSA)/roughness factor (RF), Tafel slope, and turnover frequency (TOF) - are used to profile the population of active sites of electrocatalysts and the activity of related individual sites. The results indicate the correction of OER behavior by ECSA/RF manifests the more accurate identification of OER activity. Meanwhile, the timing to obtain RF/ECSA significantly influence such an evaluation. Altogether, a fair benchmarking is proposed for the comparison between the activities of electrocatalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000517420200001

Characterization of the copper oxide species in both fully oxidized and partially reduced states reveals that they are significantly affected by interactions with the underlying support. On the basis of catalytic activity results and in combination with analysis of the evolution of particular Cu+ carbonyls, comparing the CO oxidation reaction in the presence and absence of NO, it is proposed that the two basic factors affecting the catalytic performance of this type of system are the facility for achieving a partially reduced state for the copper oxide phase at the interfacial zone and the redox properties of the CuOx/CeZrO4 interface.

The emergence of 2D nanoscale materials with remarkable electronic and optical properties has received much attention in this field. Owing to the recent developments in high-end computation and advanced electronic structure theories, first principles studies offer powerful tools to screen photocatalytic systems reliably and efficiently. This review is organized to highlight the essential properties of 2D photocatalysts and the recent advances in the theoretical engineering of 2D materials for the improvement in photocatalytic overall water-splitting. The advancement in the strategies including (i) single-atom catalysts, (ii) defect engineering, (iii) strain engineering, (iv) Janus structures, (v) type-II heterostructures (vi) Z-scheme heterostructures (vii) multilayer configurations (viii) edge-modification in nanoribbons and (ix) the effect of pH in overall water-splitting are summarized to improve the existing problems for a photocatalytic catalytic reaction such as overcoming large overpotential to trigger the water-splitting reactions without using cocatalysts.

The main challenge for these compounds is to reduce the relatively high value of the activation energies vacancies diffusion, which is influenced by several factors. In this work the thermal evolution of CaO-HfO2 materials have been investigated. (CaO) y-Hf(1-y)O(2-y) (y = 0.06, 0.14 y 0.2) coatings and powders were synthesized by chemical solution deposition (CSD). Films were deposited onto alumina substrates by Dip Coating technique, the burning of organic waste was carried out at 500 degrees C under normal atmosphere and then the films were thermally treated at intervals of temperature rising to a maximum temperature of 1250 degrees C. By means Glazing Incidence X-ray Diffraction (phi-2 theta configuration) the phases were studied in the annealed films. On the other hand, the thermal evolution and crystallization process of powders were analyzed in-situ by HT-XRD. The phenomena crystallization occurred in films and powders were analyzed. The activation energies of diffusion of oxygen vacancies of HfO2-14 mole% CaO and HfO2-20 mole% CaO films were measured from the thermal evolution of the relaxation constant measured by Perturbed Angular Correlation Technique.					19th Latin American Symposium on Solid State Physics (SLAFES)19th Latin American Symposium on Solid State Physics (SLAFES)	OCT 05-10, 2008OCT 05-10, 2008	Consejo Nacl Investigaciones Cientificas Tecnicas (CONICET); Agencia Nacl Promocion Cientifica Tecnologica (ANPCyT); Tecnologia Innovacion, Secretaria Estado Ciencia; Univ Nacl Litoral, Centro Latinoamericano Fisica; Inst Phys (IOP) Publishing; European Phys Journal (EPJ); EDP Sci; Soc Italiana Fisica; SpringerConsejo Nacl Investigaciones Cientificas Tecnicas (CONICET); Agencia Nacl Promocion Cientifica Tecnologica (ANPCyT); Tecnologia Innovacion, Secretaria Estado Ciencia; Univ Nacl Litoral, Centro Latinoamericano Fisica; Inst Phys (IOP) Publishing; European Phys Journal (EPJ); EDP Sci; Soc Italiana Fisica; Springer	Puerto Iguazu, ARGENTINAPuerto Iguazu, ARGENTINA	4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1742-6588	1742-6596	*****************	WOS:000298811200052

The resulting CoC2O4 center dot 2H(2)O microrods (MRs) and micropolyhedrons (MPs) can be easily controlled by rationally tuning the composition of solvents. It is experimentally demonstrated that CoC2O4 center dot 2H(2)O microstructures as nonprecious metal based electrocatalysts exhibit remarkable activity for catalyzing OER in alkaline medium. Such performance is found to be closely dependent on the morphology of CoC2O4 center dot 2H(2)O microstructures. The MRs with higher aspect ratio and more active Co sites manifest a small OER onset potential, large anodic current and long-term durability, which are superior to the MPs, derived Co3O4 MRs, and previously reported cobalt oxalate electrocatalysts, and even compare favorably with most previously reported Co-based OER electrocatalysts.									60	0	0	0	4	0	60			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000353927500046

The electrocatalyst shows overpotentials of 123 mV, 250 mV and 300 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1.0 M KOH and 1.0 M PBS, respectively, to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, NiSe@NC also exhibits a small Tafel slope and superior long-term stability over a wide pH range. The excellent electrocatalytic performance should be ascribed to the unique coral-like structure with a large BET specific surface area (125.4 m(2) g(-1)) and mesoporous features, as well as synergistic effects between NiSe nanocrystals and highly conductive N-doped porous carbon.									65	2	0	0	2	0	66			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000453248100055	30325393

The degradation of highly delithiated LiCoO2 is mainly induced by oxygen vacancy migration and weakening of oxygen-related interactions, which result in pitting corrosion and fault formation on the surface. In this research, a coupling agent, namely, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), was grafted onto the surface of LiCoO2 to form a cross-linking structure. Through the aza-Michael addition reaction, an oligomer formed from barbituric acid and bisphenol a diglycidyl ether diacrylate were reacted with the cross-linking APTES to form an artificial cathode electrolyte interphase (ACEI). The highly delithiated LiCoO2 containing the ACEI had considerably less degradation on the surface of the bulk material caused by oxygen release. The formation of the O1 phase was prevented in high delithiation and high-temperature operations. This research revealed that the ACEI reinforced the Co-O bond, which is crucial in preventing gas evolution and O1 phase formation. In addition, the ACEI prevents direct contact between the electrolyte and highly active surface of LiCoO2, thereby preventing the formation of a thick and high impedance traditional cathode electrolyte interphase. According to the present results, highly delithiated LiCoO2 containing the ACEI exhibited outstanding cycle retention and capacity at 55 degrees C as well as low heat capacity release in the fully delithiated state. The ACEI considerably protected and maintained the electrochemical performance of highly delithiated LiCoO2, which is suitable for high-energy-density applications, such as electric vehicles and power tools.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000706187100048	34549937

In this work, a pore-scale model is developed based on lattice Boltzmann (LB) method for the simulation of multicomponent multiphase reactive transport in an operating PEMFC, with the aim to capture the water vapor generation, condensation, and subsequent transport in the entire porous cathode, including the catalyst layer, gas diffusion layer, and gas channel. The current LB model considers the effect of liquid/vapor condensation on the dynamic evolution of liquid water. The transportation of oxygen and dynamic water evolution is coupled by the electrochemical reactions occurring at the active site of the catalyst layer. Effects of the microstructure and wettability of gas diffusion layer, vapor generation rate, temperature distribution, and existence of the rib on the dynamic evolution of liquid water are elaborated. The insights provided in this work would facilitate the understanding of liquid water evolution in the PEMFC and reduce its water flooding issues.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1040-7782	1521-0634		WOS:000589107500001

Photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) technology driven by solar energy is one of the most green and efficient ways to realize the oxidation of biomass-derived alcohol/aldehydes. Compared with the traditional PEC water splitting process to produce both O-2 and H-2, the use of PEC oxidation of bio. mass-derived alcohol/aldehydes instead of anodic oxygen evolution process can not only increase the value of anodic products, but also improve the conversion efficiency of solar energy to hydrogen, which is of great significance for H-2 production and high value chemical synthesis. In this review, we introduce the reaction mechanism of PEC H-2 produc. tion coupled with biomass-derived alcohol/aldehyde oxidation, and summarize the recent progress in PEC oxidation of biomass-derived alcohol/aldehydes. Moreover, the opportunities and challenges in this field are also prospected.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0251-0790			WOS:000765114700021

A theoretical study on tetragonal BaTiO3 modified by surface co-doping for photocatalytic overall water splitting								International Journal of Hydrogen Energy				47	44			19073	19085		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.04.098				2022	2022	Density functional theory calculations are applied to study the influence of co-doping on the stability, electronic structure, and photocatalytic activity of tetragonal BaTiO3 (001) surface. The results show that the formations of all the metal-nonmetal co-doped BaTiO3 (metal = V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W and nonmetal = N, C) are energetically favorable. Most of co-doped surfaces have remarkable narrower bandgaps than the pristine surface, which favors the movement of absorption edge to the visible light region. Co-doped systems have better affinity toward H2O than the pure surface. For most of the studied systems, the active sites of HER and OER are the O site and the Ti site adjacent to the metal dopant, respectively. Surface co-doping results in remarkable decreases in | DeltaGH | of HER and the OER overpotential of BaTiO3 (001) surface. This work proposes the potential application of BaTiO3 modified by surface co-doping as efficient photocatalysts for overall water splitting.

So far, no effective technique for preparing ultrathin 2D Pd-based metal nanostructures with more than three compositions has been published. Herein, a new visible-light-induced template technique for producing PdAuBiTe alloyed 2D ultrathin nanosheets is developed. The mass activity of the PdAuBiTe nanosheets against the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is 2.48 A mg(Pd)(-1), which is 27.5/17.7 times that of industrial Pd/C/Pt/C, respectively. After 10 000 potential cyclings, there is no decrease in ORR activity. The PdAuBiTe nanosheets exhibit high methanol tolerance and in situ anti-CO poisoning properties. The PdAuBiTe nanosheets, as cathode electrocatalysts in direct methanol fuel cells, can thus give significant improvement in terms of power density and durability. In O-2/air, the power density can be increased to 235.7/173.5 mW cm(-2), higher than that reported in previous work, and which is 2.32/3.59 times higher than Pt/C.									23	0	0	0	1	0	22			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000691404900001	34468056

However, the poor conductivity and OER kinetics hinder its catalytic performance. Herein, we have developed a facile dynamic anion regulation strategy to enhance OER activity of FeOOH. Of the seven common anions (VO33-, MoO42-, WO42-, S2-, H2PO4- , H2PO2- and F-), S2- was found to have the best regulatory effect. The obtained 0.01 S-FeOOH+1000/IF exhibits industrial-level OER current output of 1000 mA cm-2 with low overpotential of 358 mV. Importantly, this catalyst can operate stably at 1000 mA cm-2 for at least 1000 h. Theoretical calculation reveals that the doping of sulfur can drastically lower the energy barrier of ratedetermining step during OER. Meanwhile, 0.01 S-FeOOH+1000/IF in alkaline anion exchange membrane (AEM) cells demonstrates a stable cell voltage of 2.12 V to reach 1000 mA cm-2 over 24 h.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000817810700002

In this context, the most fascinating and challenging approach is the rational design of a nanocomposite encompassing multiple components with unique functionalities. Herein, we describe the fabrication of a strongly catalytic and superb durable phosphorus incorporated cobalt molybdenum sulfide electrocatalyst grown on carbon cloth (P-CoMoS/CC). The hybrid material exhibited excellent activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions over a wide range of pH (1-14) with extremely high stability (similar to 90% retention of the initial current density) after 24 h of electrolysis. Importantly, when P-CoMoS/CC was used as both cathode and anode for overall water splitting, a very low cell voltage of 1.54 V is required to attain the 10 mA cm(-2) current density, and the hybrid material exhibited a long-term stability (89.8% activity retention after 100 h). The outstanding overall water-splitting performance compared to an electrolyzer consisting of the noble-metal-based catalysts Pt/C and RuO2 makes P-CoMoS one of the most efficient earth-abundant water-splitting catalysts. Phosphorus incorporation was proved to be a vital aspect for the improved charge-transfer properties and catalytic durability of the P-CoMoS/CC catalyst.									88	4	0	0	4	0	88			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000414506600026	29019248

They strongly influence the surface electronic structures of the materials and could serve as a good platform to gain insight into the surface reactions. Here we synthesized high-quality bulk single crystals of Co3Sn2S2 that naturally hosts the band structure of a topological semimetal. This guarantees the existence of robust TSS from the Co atoms. Co3Sn2S2 crystals expose their Kagome lattice that constructed by Co atoms and have high electrical conductivity. They serves as catalytic centers for oxygen evolution process (OER), making bonding and electron transfer more efficient due to the partially filled orbital.

Here, we apply theoretical calculations to experimental studies to uncover the influence of structure engineering (quantizing and support coupling) on the HER catalytic activity and develop an optimized C3N4 hybrid catalyst. Impressively, the desired atom-thick C3N4 quantum dots on graphene (CNQDs@G) has been successfully obtained and achieves HER performance with low overpotential (110 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2), large exchange current density (3.67 mu A cm(-2)), and long-term durability, better than those of many metallic catalysts. In combination with the experimental results, DFT calculations also disclose that the HER catalytic activity of CNQD5@G originates from bisynergetic effects: one between G and CNQDs and another between the edge and the molecular sieve structure.									101	8	0	0	3	1	102			2155-5435			WOS:000431727300028

J	Cai, Chao; Rao, Yan; Zhou, Jiangfeng; Zhang, Lichang; Chen, Wei; Wan, Zhaohui; Tan, Jinting; Pan, Mu								Carbon corrosion: A novel termination mechanism of the water electrolysis plateau during voltage reversal								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				473						228542	10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228542				OCT 15 2020	2020	Although the mechanism of the voltage reversal process due to overall hydrogen deficiency is clear, the termination mechanism of the water electrolysis plateau (WEP) is still very controversial. In this work, for the first time, the termination mechanism of the WEP is analyzed by synchronously detecting the internal resistance (IR) change in the process of the voltage reversal. The results show that in the WEP, the IR of the cell increases slowly, but increases sharply once the plateau is finished. The IR-corrected voltages have directly indicated that the termination of the WEP is mainly due to a significant increase in cell IR resulting from carbon corrosion, rather than commonly believed OER (oxygen evolution reaction) catalyst deactivation and lack of water inside the cell. Remarkably, the IR at the end of the WEP is about 180 m Omega cm(2), which is independent of anode gas relative humidity, IrO2 loading, and carbon support type. Besides, the performance of the cell damaged by voltage reversal is partly recoverable, which may be due to the rehydration of the proton exchange membrane and the reestablishment of the charge and gas transport channel during the reactivation process.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000564501000003

Here ZIF-8 functions as a host, Fe-salen as the active catalyst, and SiW(12)( )helps in the charge transport by lowering the overall electrical resistance of the resulting composite system. High turnover frequency (similar to S s(-1)) and high Faradaic efficiency (similar to 94%) make the concerned composite an efficient catalyst toward water oxidation. This is the first report of one of the simplest known metal complexes, Fe-salen, to perfrom electrocatalytic OER as a heterogeneous catalyst in the neutral pH. This work also highlights the benefits of coencapsulation of the Keggin polyoxometalate (POM) along with the active catalyst Fe-salen species. Encapsulation of SiW(12)( )results in (i) faster formation of FSWZ-8 composite, (ii) higher loading of Fe-salen, and, most importantly, (iii) lowering of required overpotential for electrochemical OER by more than 150 mV. The Keggin POMs, located as discrete molecular oxides inside the cavity of ZIF-8 as well as on the surface of ZIF-8, facilitate electrical charge conduction in the ZIF-8 matrix and lower the overall charge-transfer resistance.									25	1	0	0	2	0	25			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000506719300050	31815439

The corrosion mechanism of the steel in each solution was discussed. The results showed that the free corrosion potential and limited diffusion current density of the steel increased obviously due to the addition of H2O2 in seawater, meanwhile the hydrogen-evolution potential also shifted negatively. The phase constituents of the rust layer in two solutions were almost the same, and the oxygen reduction process of the steel in two solutions was controlled by the two-electronic reaction. In conclusion, the addition of H2O2 could efficiently accelerate the corrosion rate of the steel in natural seawater, but could not change its corrosion mechanism.									8	3	0	0	0	0	9			1005-4537			INSPEC:14170572

A fundamental understanding of composition-structure-activity relationships for mixed-metal Ni-Co and Ni-Co-Fe (oxy)hydroxides is important to guide the design of advanced OER catalysts. Here we use cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, inductively-coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy, and in situ electrical conductivity measurements to characterize the properties and activity of various compositions of Ni-Co-Fe (oxy)hydroxides prepared by cathodic co-electrodeposition. Consistent with previous studies, we find Fe is essential for the mixed-metal (oxy)hydroxides to achieve high OER activity. In the rigorous absence of Fe (achieved by using specially cleaned electrolytes), the most-active Ni-Co (oxy)hydroxide composition has an OER turn-over frequency only twice that of pure Co (oxy)hydroxide, suggesting minimal synergism between the two metals. The addition of Co to Ni-Fe (oxy)hydroxides shifts the onset of electrical conductivity to lower potentials, but has little effect on the intrinsic OER activity, with the most-active Ni-Co-Fe (oxy)hydroxide having an OER turn-over frequency only similar to 1.5 times that of the Ni-Fe (oxy)hydroxides. The magnitudes of the electrical conductivities are similar for all the compositions measured. Density-functional-theory-calculated projected density of states show a significant contribution of all chemical elements at the valence band edge of the mixed-metal oxyhydroxide electronic structure, demonstrating significant electronic hybridization between the elements. The calculations suggest the involvement of all the elements in modulating the electronic structure at putative Fe-based active sites that are probably located at edges or defects in the two-dimensional oxyhydroxide sheets.									91	5	0	0	6	0	91			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000485041800028		
J	Ward, L. M.; Johnston, D. T.; Shih, P. M.								Phanerozoic radiation of ammonia oxidizing bacteria								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				11	1					2070	10.1038/s41598-021-81718-2				JAN 22 2021	2021	The modern nitrogen cycle consists of a web of microbially mediated redox transformations. Among the most crucial reactions in this cycle is the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite, an obligately aerobic process performed by a limited number of lineages of bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA). As this process has an absolute requirement for O-2, the timing of its evolution-especially as it relates to the Great Oxygenation Event similar to 2.3 billion years ago-remains contested and is pivotal to our understanding of nutrient cycles. To estimate the antiquity of bacterial ammonia oxidation, we performed phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses of AOB. Surprisingly, bacterial ammonia oxidation appears quite young, with crown group clades having originated during Neoproterozoic time (or later) with major radiations occurring during Paleozoic time. These results place the evolution of AOB broadly coincident with the pervasive oxygenation of the deep ocean. The late evolution AOB challenges earlier interpretations of the ancient nitrogen isotope record, predicts a more substantial role for AOA during Precambrian time, and may have implications for understanding of the size and structure of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle through geologic time.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			2045-2322			WOS:000613017500008	33483596

Equilibrium pH-dependent distribution of soluble species in the baths was calculated. Deposition of metals was studied by cyclic voltammetry and Hull cell tests. Deposits were obtained in potentiostatic (-1.6 to -1.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and galvanostatic (4-8 A/dm(2)) conditions. It was found that the buffering action of gluconate ions improved the quality of the deposits, and compact Ni-Mn with a grid of fine crack layers was produced. The additive inhibited the formation of nonmetallic inclusions represented by decreased oxygen content in the deposits. Layers produced at constant potentials contained 67-79 % Ni, 1-8 % Mn, and 15-30 % O. Under galvanostatic conditions, the average compositions were in the range of 18-80 % Ni, 2-48 % Mn, and 17-42 % O. Despite of the bath composition, the main cathodic reaction was hydrogen evolution resulting in very low amounts of the cathodic deposits.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000345080000012

PCC 6803								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				54	1			55	62		10.1023/A:1005895924892				OCT 1997	1997	The repair of ultraviolet-B radiation induced damage to the structure and function of Photosystem II was studied in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. UV-B irradiation of intact Synechocystis cells results in the loss of steady-state oxygen evolution, an effect accompanied by a parallel loss of both D1 and D2 protein subunits of the Photosystem II reaction centre. Transfer of the W-irradiated cells to normal growth conditions under visible light results in partial recovery of the inhibited oxygen evolving activity and restoration of the lost D1 and D2 proteins. The extent of recovery decreases with increasing degree of damage: after 50% inhibition, the original activity is completely restored within 2 hours. In contrast, after 90-95% inhibition less than half of the original activity is regained during a 4 hour recovery period. The translation inhibitor lincomycin completely blocks the recovery process if added after the UV-B treatment, and accelerates the kinetics of activity loss if added before the onset of W-B irradiation. Substantial retardation of recovery and acceleration of activity loss is also observed if the very low intensity short wavelength contribution (lambda<290 nm) is not filtered out from the W-B light source. It is concluded that in intact cells W-B induced damage of the Photosystem II complex can be repaired. This process is the first example of simultaneous D1 and D2 protein repair in Photosystem II, and considered to function as an important defence mechanism against detrimental UV-B effects in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. De novo synthesis of the D1 and D2 reaction centre subunits is a key step of the repair process, which itself can also be inhibited by ultraviolet light, especially by the short wavelength W-C components, or by high doses of UV-B.									99	6	0	0	89	3	109			0166-8595			WOS:A1997YL66400006

Herein, we report the results of one-dimensional (1D) nanorods (NRs) containing an ultralow amount of noble metal (iridium, Ir) and 10 wt % fluorine (F) doped (Mn0.8Ir0.2)O-2:10F as an efficient anode electrocatalyst, synthesized via a simple hydrothermal and wet chemical approach for the acidic OER. The as-synthesized (Mn0.8Ir0.2)O-2:10F NRs demonstrate promising electrocatalytic performance for the OER with significantly lower overpotential (eta) and higher current density than state of the art IrO2 and many other electrocatalysts containing noble metal/reduced noble metal. Owing to the presence of 1D channels of the nanorod architecture and the unique electronic structure obtained upon formation of an F-containing solid solution, the (Mn0.8Ir0.2)O-2:10F NRs exhibit low charge transfer resistance (similar to 2.5 Omega cm(2)), low Tafel slope (similar to 38 mV dec(-1)), low water contact angle (similar to 18 degrees), high electrochemical active surface area (ECSA approximate to 704.76 m(2) g(-1)), high roughness factor (similar to 2114), and notable OER performance with similar to 6-, similar to 2.1-, and similar to 2.2-fold higher electrocatalytic activity in comparison to IrO2, (Mn0.8Ir0.2)O-2 NRs and a 2D thin film of (Mn0.8Ir0.2)O-2:10F, respectively. The significantly higher ECSA and BET specific activity (0.11 mA cm(BET)(-2)), mass activity (40 Ag-1), and TOF (0.01 s(-1)) at an overpotential (eta) of 220 mV suggest the intrinsically higher catalytic activity of (Mn0.8Ir0.2)O-2:10F NRs in comparison to other as-synthesized electrocatalysts. In addition, (Mn0.8Ir0.2)O-2:10F NRs function as robust electrocatalysts by delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at eta approximate to 200 mV and displaying long-term durability, devoid of any degradation of the catalytic activity, suggesting the structural robustness for displaying prolonged OER activity. Herein, on the basis of the synergistic effects of tailoring of 2D material length scales into a 1D nanorod framework and the corresponding formation of an F-substituted unique solid solution structure (as validated by density functional theory), (Mn0.8Ir0.2)O-2:10F NRs offer promise for an efficient OER in PEMWE.									52	1	0	0	1	0	53			2155-5435			WOS:000460600600048

We developed a high-performance bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst based on Pd nanoparticles supported on cobalt hydroxide nanoplatelets (Pd/Co(OH)(2)) as an air cathode for metal-air batteries. The Pd/Co(OH)(2)shows remarkably higher electrocatalytic activity in comparison with commercial catalysts (Pt/C, IrO2), including an ORR half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.87 Vvs.RHE and an OER overpotential of 0.39 V at 10 mA cm(-2)in aqueous alkaline medium. The Zn-air battery constructed with Pd/Co(OH)(2)presents stable charge/discharge voltage (Delta EOER-ORR= 0.69 V), along with durable cycling stability for over 30 h. Also, this cathode exhibits a maximum discharge capacity of 17 698 mA h g(-1), and stable battery operation over 50 cycles at a fixed capacity of 1000 mA h g(-1), as an efficient air electrode for Li-O(2)batteries, indicating that Pd/Co(OH)(2)can be a potential candidate for both aqueous and non-aqueous metal-air batteries.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000566813600019	32840553

Ternary alloy nanoparticles (Co0.6Mn0.4 Pt), with a mean crystallite diameter under 10 nm, were electrodeposited onto a graphitic support material using a two-step pulsed deposition technique. Initially, a surface functionalisation of the carbon nanofibers is performed with the aid of oxygen plasma. Subsequently, a short galvanostatic pulse electrodeposition technique is applied. It has been demonstrated that, if pulsing current is employed, compositionally controlled PtCoMn catalysts can be achieved. Variations of metal concentration ratios in the electrolyte and main deposition parameters, such as current density and pulse shape, led to electrodes with relevant catalytic activity towards HER. The samples were further characterised using several physicochemical methods to reveal their morphology, structure, chemical and electrochemical properties. X-ray diffraction confirms the PtCoMn alloy formation on the graphitic support and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy highlights the presence of the three metallic components from the alloy structure. The preliminary tests regarding the electrocatalytic activity of the developed electrodes display promising results compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts. The PtCoMn/CNF electrode exhibits a decrease in hydrogen evolution overpotential of about 250 mV at 40 mA cm(-2) in acidic solution (0.5 M H2SO4) when compared to similar platinum based electrodes (Pt/CNF) and a Tafel slope of around 120 mV dec(-1) indicating that HER takes place under the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism.

The present work introduces an innovative and high-yield microrecycling strategy to simultaneous synthesis of TM alloy (i.e., Ni-based superalloy) and RE oxide (REO) nanostructures from obsolete Ni-MH batteries mixed with zinc-rich electric arc furnace dust (EAFD). This strategy involves integration of high-temperature thermal isolation followed by thermal nanowiring techniques. The impure thermally-isolated REOs were purified and transformed into one dimensional (1D) nanorods of hybrid REOs. Besides, during high-temperature thermal isolation, defect-rich ZnO with tailored structures of nanorods and nanoribbons were fabricated using controllable vapour deposition. The electrochemical performance of ZnO nanoribbons for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) revealed a considerable overpotential reduction of 131 mV (18%) compared to pure commercial nano-ZnO. This approach is transformational in providing a scalable and cost-effective pathway to facilitate recycling of the challenging, yet critical, waste materials into functional nanostructures for energy and environmental applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000657740000002	33740716

The utilization of various 3d transition metal-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs), especially NiFe- LDH, has gained vast attention for OER under alkaline conditions. However, the lack of a proper electronic structure of the NiFe- LDH and low stability under high-pH conditions limit its largescale application. To overcome these difficulties, in this study, we constructed an Sn-doped NiFe-LDH material using a simple wetchemical method. The doping of Sn will synergistically increase the active surface sites of NiFe-LDH. The highly active NiFe-LDH Sn0.015(M) shows excellent OER activity by requiring an overpotential of 250 mV to drive 10 mA/cm2 current density, whereas the bare NiFe-LDH required an overpotential of 295 mV at the same current density. Also, NiFe-LDH Sn0.015(M) shows excellent long-term stability for 50 h in 1 M KOH and also exhibits a higher TOF value of 0.495 s-1, which is almost five times higher than that of bare NiFe-LDH. This study highlights Sn doping as an effective strategy for the development of low-cost, effective, stable, self-supported electrocatalysts with a high current density for improved OER and other catalytic applications in the near future.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000870259400001	36221930

The as-prepared catalyst having a unique one-dimensional (1D) PDC nanowire structure with the presence of metallic silicide tips of 1D-PDC plays a crucial role in facilitating oxygen reduction/evolution reaction kinetics. The Zn-air battery was designed using Ni/PDC, Co/PDC and Fe/PDC as air electrode catalysts. In electrochemical half-cell tests, it was observed that the catalysts have a good bifunctional electrocatalytic activity. The efficiency of the catalysts to function as a cathode catalyst in real-time primary and mechanically rechargeable Zn-air battery configurations was determined. The primary battery testing results revealed that Ni/PDC and Co/PDC exhibited a stable discharge voltage plateau up to 29 h. The Fe/PDC sample, on the other hand, performed up to 23 h with an operating potential of 1.20 V at the discharge current density of 5 mA cm(-2) after which the battery ceased to perform. The Ni/PDC, Co/PDC, and Fe/PDC cathode catalysts performed galvanostatic 1200 charge-discharge cycles in a mechanically rechargeable secondary Zn-air battery configuration. The results demonstrate that the Ni/PDC, Co/PDC, and Fe/PDC materials serve as excellent and durable bifunctional cathode electrocatalysts for Zn-air batteries.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000729573000001	35494147

Edge-halogenated graphene nanosheets as an efficient metal-free electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction								International Journal of Hydrogen Energy				47	35			15731	15741		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.03.136				2022	2022	Application of carbonic materials as catalysts has recently been considered due to some advantages like tunable molecular structures, easy synthesis methods, abundance, and high tolerance in acidic and alkaline media. Here, a new metal-free electrocatalyst of halogenated reduced graphene oxide was prepared using cyclic voltammetry X (F, Br, and I)-RGO electrodeposition method. The prepared electrocatalysts were studied as a novel metal-free electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and the presence of several halogen and oxygen functional groups on the surface of nanosheets was verified by the furrier transform infra-red, FT-IR, spectroscopy, and the presence of doped halogens on the RGO surface was confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray, EDX, spectroscopy. The structural features and surface morphology of electrocatalysts were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. The electrochemical treatment of the X (F, Br, I)-RGO electrode was studied by some techniques like electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, EIS, chronoamperometry, CA, and linear sweep voltammetry, LSV. The X (F, Br, I)-RGO catalyst showed a lower onset potential (-0.81 V. vs. SHE), higher exchange current density (3.1 times times10-1 mA cm-2), and lower charge transfer resistance (1.09 Omega cm2) related to the RGO catalyst due to the high active sites by heteroatoms and graphene nanosheets.

J	McMahon, Abbey J.; Jarrold, Caroline Chick								Using anion photoelectron spectroscopy of cluster models to gain insights into mechanisms of catalyst-mediated H-2 production from water								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				22	48						10.1039/d0cp05055e				DEC 28 2020	2020	Metal oxide cluster models of catalyst materials offer a powerful platform for probing the molecular-scale features and interactions that govern catalysis. This perspective gives an overview of studies implementing the combination of anion photoelectron (PE) spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations toward exploring cluster models of metal oxides and metal-oxide supported Pt that catalytically drive the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or the water-gas shift reaction. The utility in the combination of these experimental and computational techniques lies in our ability to unambiguously determine electronic and molecular structures, which can then connect to results of reactivity studies. In particular, we focus on the activity of oxygen vacancies modeled by suboxide clusters, the critical mechanistic step of forming proximal metal hydride and hydroxide groups as a prerequisite for H-2 production, and the structural features that lead to trapped dihydroxide groups. The pronounced asymmetric oxidation found in heterometallic group 6 oxides and near-neighbor group 5/group 6 results in higher activity toward water, while group 7/group 6 oxides form very specific stoichiometries that suggest facile regeneration. Studies on the trans-periodic combination of cerium oxide and platinum as a model for ceria supported Pt atoms and nanoparticles reveal striking negative charge accumulation by Pt, which, combined with the ionic conductivity of ceria, suggests a mechanism for the exceptionally high activity of this system towards the water-gas shift reaction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000603167900001	33201956

In order to untangle the relationship between these effects and electrocatalytic activity, the perryite phase with a versatile chemical composition, (NixFe1-x)(8)(TyP1-y)(3) (T = Si and Ge; 1 >= x, y >= 0), was selected as a platform to demonstrate the influence of geometry (e.g., atomic size and bond length) and electronic (e.g., bond strength and bonding scheme) factors toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It was realized that the large Ge atom in the perryite phase can expand the unit cell parameters and interatomic distances (i.e., weaken bond strengths), which facilitates the phase transformation into active metal oxyhydroxide during OER. The quaternary perryite phase, Ni7FeGeP2, displays excellent OER activity and achieves current densities of 20 and 100 mA/cm(2) at overpotentials of 239 and 273 mV, respectively. The oxidation state of Ni and Fe in the perryite phase before/after OER was analyzed and discussed. The result suggests that incorporating the Fe element in the system may increase the rate constant of OER (K-OER) and therefore keeps the Ni element in a low valance state (i.e., Ni2+). This work indicates that the manipulation of geometry and electronic factors can promote phase transformation as well as OER activity, which exemplifies a strategy to design a promising "precatalyst" for OER.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000695585400105	34435489

The ring-like morphology is rare among bismuth oxyhalides, and the reaction pathways are superior to traditional chemical transformations. In detail, Bi3O4Br nanorings are prepared in three stages: (1) the formation of precursors, (2) selective etching and (3) Ostwald ripening. During these steps, the extra usage of templates is avoided and a series of useful intermediates are obtained. Besides, this method can be extended to fabricate other bismuth oxyhalide nanorings. Under visible-light irradiation, all of our samples are photo-activated. The Bi3O4Br nanorings exhibit an efficient oxygen-evolution rate (72.54 mmol h(-1)) and pollutant degradation rate (4.71 x 10(-2) g min(-1) m(-2)), which can be attributed to their unique ring structures and band potentials. Thus, the surfactant-mediated chemical conversion strategy not only paves a new way to enhance the photocatalytic activity of bismuth oxyhalides, but also provides an important large-scale route for designing other nanomaterials with ring-like structures.									42	2	0	0	2	0	42			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000406672400027

Although, nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (NCNT) arrays have been developed over recent decades through various advanced technologies are now capable of catalyzing ORR efficiently, their underdeveloped bifunctional property, hydrophobic surface, and detrimental preparation strategy are found to limit practical large-scale commercialization for effective rechargeable ZABs. Here, we have demonstrated fabrication of a three-dimensional (3D) nickel foam supported NCNT arrays with CoNi nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated within the apical domain (denoted as CoNi@NCNT/NF) that exhibits excellent bifunctional catalytic performance toward both ORR (onset potential of 0.97 V vs. RHE) and OER (overpotential of 1.54 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm-2). We further examined the practicability of this CoNi@NCNT/NF material being used as an air electrode for rechargeable ZAB coin cell and pouch cell systems. The ZAB coin cell showed a peak power density of 108 mW cm-2 with an energy density of 845 Wh kgZn-1 and robust rechargeability over 28h under ambient conditions, which exceeds the performance of PGM catalysts and leading non-PGM electrocatalysts. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the ORR and OER catalytic performance of the CoNi@NCNT/NF electrode are mainly derived from the d-orbitals from the CoNi NPs encapsulated within the apical dominant end of the NCNTs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						INSPEC:17724980

Herein, a coupling modification strategy of tantalum (Ta) doping and Ni2P nanocrystals modification is developed to realize the simultaneous optimization of photocurrent density and onset potential of alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode. The resulting Ni2P/Ta:alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode exhibits a photocurrent density of 2.98 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is 2.76-fold higher than that of pristine alpha-Fe2O3. Characterization results show that Ta-doping improves the conductivity and carrier density, while Ni2P nanocrystals optimizes the hole injection efficiency and water oxidation kinetics of photoanode. Notably, Ni2P nanocrystals form a core-shell structure (Ni2P@NiOOH) in situ during the PEC reaction. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the adsorption sites for Ni2P@NiOOH cocatalyst are mainly Ni atoms at the interface between NiOOH and Ni2P, with adjacent Ni or P atoms from Ni2P core also participating in the reaction, and that the synergistic catalysis of Ni2P and NiOOH lowers the energy barrier for the key *OOH intermediates formation. Finite element simulations of the current density distribution show that Ni2P core with high conductivity exhibit a significant current-collector effect, accelerating carrier migration in Ni2P@NiOOH. This work contributes to the understanding of the catalysis of Ni2P-derived composite oxygen evolution reaction catalysts and provides a reference for the rational design of photoanode for efficient PEC water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000822986300003

Symposium (Materials Research Society Symposium Proceedings Vol.658)								GG9.7.1	6						2001	2001	Chemical deintercalation in Fe-substituted lithium nickelate and its effects on the thermal stability and electrochemical behaviour are studied. A sample with Fe:Ni ratio of 1:9 was used as the starting material. Chemical deintercalation of the ceramic product was achieved by acid treatment with 0.6 M aqueous hydrochloric acid solutions at room temperature. The atomic Fe:Ni ratio remained unaffected while the Li:(Fe+Ni) ratio decreased significantly down to ca. 0.5 after acid treatment. Infrared spectroscopy was used to discard a proton exchange side reaction. The initial open circuit voltage (OCV) of non-aqueous electrolyte lithium cells using the chemically deintercalated solids was ca. 3.7 V, while 3.0 V were obtained with the pristine oxide. Heat treating the deintercalated solids lead to oxygen evolution at 230degC with the formation of spinel rock-salt structure solids at 600degC. The improved thermal stability as compared with iron-free lithium nickelate is an interesting factor for battery safety.					Solid-State Chemistry of Inorganic Materials III.

Observation of solar neutrinos directly addresses the theory of stellar structure and evolution, which is the basis of the standard solar models (SSMs). The Sun as a well-defined neutrino source also provides extremely important opportunities to investigate nontrivial neutrino properties such as neutrino oscillations and MikheyevSmirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect, because of the wide range of matter density and the great distance from the Sun to the Earth. The ultra-pure Borexino detector at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso is designed to perform low-energy solar neutrino spectroscopy. Recently, the Borexino experiment has obtained the first direct evidence of the rare proton-electron-proton (pep) fusion reaction in the Sun by the detection of the neutrinos emitted in the process. Borexino has also placed the strongest limit on the flux of the neutrinos emitted in the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle. In these proceedings I will summarise the novel techniques adopted in Borexino to reduce the cosmogenic and external background contributions and I will describe the physics results obtained.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0390-5551			INSPEC:13925565

However, developing heteroatom-doped graphene with competitive HER activity remains a great challenge. Here, we reported an effective strategy to employ plasma etching method to create more topological defects on S-doped graphene, and obtained plasma-etched, S-doped graphene exhibited a significantly enhanced HER activity with an overpotential of 178 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). It was proved that the synergetic coupling between S-doping and plasma-induced topological defects contributed to the excellent HER performance. We further showed that the combination of high S-doping level with thiophene-S-rich species and appropriate amount of topological defects could maximize the HER activity. The successful combination of plasma-assisted defect engineering and heteroatom-doping in this work may open up a new pathway for developing highly efficient graphene-based metal-free catalysts toward HER.

The fundamental result is that corrosion is very effectively controlled within a relatively narrow range of neutral to near-neutral pH values with increased corrosion rates outside that range in either direction: The negative (active) open circuit potential at pH values lower and higher than neutral (6 pH 8) was due to dissolution of the passive film by a hydrogen reduction reaction and oxidation of hydroxyl ions by oxygen evolution in the presence of chloride ions. It was also found that the corrosion potential was relatively positive (noble) when the concentration of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions was balanced (pH = 7), which depicted excellent corrosion protection of SS.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			0094-1492			WOS:000343021900009

At z = 0, Eris represents a close analog to the Milky Way, making it the ideal laboratory to understand the chemical evolution of our Galaxy. Eris formally traces the production of oxygen and iron due to supernovae (SNe) Ia and SNe II. We include in post-processing the production of r-process elements from compact binary mergers. Unlike previous studies, we find that the nucleosynthetic products from compact binary mergers can be incorporated into stars of very low metallicity and at early times, even with a minimum delay time of 100 Myr. This conclusion is relatively insensitive to modest variations in the merger rate, minimum delay time, and the delay time distribution. By implementing a first-order prescription for metal mixing, we can further improve the agreement between our model and the data for the chemical evolution of both [alpha/Fe] and [Eu/Fe]. We argue that compact binary mergers could be the dominant source of r-process nucleosynthesis in the Galaxy.									132	0	0	0	3	0	132			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000358967000001

Herein, a highly efficient ORR catalyst (Co-NPG) is explored by assembling Co-2(OH)PO4 on conductive nitrogen, phosphate co-doped graphene (NPG) via an in-situ hydrothermal process. The graphene oxide matrix ammoniated by ethylenediamine not only constructs stable building blocks for hosting active sites, but also induces strong interaction between assembled cobalt-based nanoparticles. Morphology characterizations demonstrate the formation of the bulk-like structure with rough surface for the hybrid. Electrochemical measurements confirm this designed catalyst displays more efficient ORR performance than the un-ammoniated graphene oxide based one, and even comparable to that of 20 wt% Pt/C under the identical experimental conditions. The high ORR activity of the hybrid originates from the joint effects of the four aspects: first, the ammoniated graphene oxide tends to induce stronger NPs interaction than graphene oxide due to polarization, causing higher electronic conductivity and resulting in orientated growth; second, the N and P co-doping effects modulate the electronic structure of graphene, exposing more defects; third, the hybrid employs a high specific BET surface area and mesoporous characteristics, which afford quick mass transport during the ORR process; last, the synergistic coupling between the formed Co-2(OH)PO4 and NPG plays a critical role.

Here, the recent advances in surface engineering methods, including the modification of the nanomaterial surface morphology, crystal facet, defect and doping concentrations, as well as the deposition of a functional overlayer of sensitizers, plasmonic metallic structures, and protective and catalytic materials are highlighted.

Here we develop a novel and scalable strategy, containing a "copolymer-co-morphology" conception, to shape-controlled synthesis of various types of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). Three series of PBAs MyFe1-y[Co(CN)(6)](0.67)center dot nH(2)O (MyFe1-y-Co, M = Co, Mn and Zn) with well-controlled morphology have been successfully prepared through this strategy. Using MnyFe1-y-Co PBAs as the model, by increasing the relative content of Mn, flexible modulation of the morphology could be easily realized. In addition, a series of porous MnxFe1.8-xCo1.2O4 nano-dices with well-inherited morphologies and defined cation distribution could be obtained through a simple thermal treatment of the PBAs. All these results demonstrate the good universality of this novel strategy. When evaluated as an electrocatalyst, the octahedral-site Mn-III/Mn-IV content in MnxFe1.8-xCo1.2O4, mainly determined by sensitive Fe-57 Mossbauer in combination with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic techniques, was discovered to be directly correlated with the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) activity.									46	4	0	0	3	0	47			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000368860900068	26752350

In this paper, the deposition mechanism is thoroughly investigated aiming at the clarification of the deposition dynamics and the chemical nature of the deposit. We focused on initial stages of the potentiostatic deposition on ITO, which yields a nanostructured film. In the potential range investigated the process is mass transport controlled and strongly overlaps with oxygen evolution reaction. The nucleation regime, which is finely tunable, correlates with the surface extension of the film. Supporting electrolytes are found to suppress the deposition, likely by modifying the nickel speciation in the aqueous electrolyte. Further, through XPS investigation we shed light on the mixed gamma-beta NiOOH nature of the deposited film and its electrochemistry. This work provides precious understanding for future exploitations of anodic electrodeposited NiO, especially in applications where a strict control on surface morphology and thickness at the nanoscale level is mandatory.

Herein, two types of three-dimensional (3D) graphene materials synthesized by one-step of simultaneous doping (Co,N/3DG-1) and two-step of sequential doping (Co,N/3DG-2) respectively, are evaluated and correlated their electrocatalytic activity for HER with experimental parameters. The results indicate that Co,N/3DG-2 exhibits significantly better electrocatalytic activity than Co,N/3DG-1. The structure analysis reveals that Co,N/3DG-2 has more moderate Co-N coordinated number than Co,N/3DG-1. Density functional theory calculations unravels that the equilibrium C and N around Co atom is more favorable to the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen. The results shed new light on the rational design of dual hetero-atom co-doped carbon materials, which may be applicable to other energy conversion and storage systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The electrochemical behavior of low-alloy chrome-molybdenum-vanadium steel (12Cr1MoV) in a 5 mol.L-1 sodium hydroxide solution is presented and compared with steel of ordinary quality (Steel 3) and nickel that are used in electrolyzers for producing hydrogen. Weight loss tests show that the chrome-molybdenum-vanadium steel is more corrosion-resistant in the tested environment than Steel 3. Overvoltage of oxygen evolution reaction on 12Cr1MoV steel under galvanostatic conditions of 200 m.Arcmr-2 is 40 mV lower than on Steel 3 and 150 mV lower than on nickel. Chrome-molybdenum-vanadium steel is perspective to replace Steel 3 in alkaline water electrolysis both as electrode material and as substrate for different catalytic coatings. Multilayer coating [(Ni-Cu)/(Mi-Mi(OH)2)]n is proposed for use in alkaline electrolysis of water and in fuel cells in systems with renewable energy sources. Proposed electrodes are suitable for use in electrolyzes powered by renewable energy sources as they show lower corrosion rate during pauses and load changes.					2021 IEEE 2nd KhPI Week on Advanced Technology (KhPIWeek)2021 IEEE 2nd KhPI Week on Advanced Technology (KhPIWeek)	13-17 Sept. 202113-17 Sept. 2021		Kharkiv, UkraineKharkiv, Ukraine	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-6654-1205-6	INSPEC:21460324

Owing to abundant under coordinated sulfur atoms serving as catalytically active centers, intensive spectra studies have revealed that the HER property of amorphous molybdenum sulfide (a-MoSx) is superior to crystal molybdenum sulfide (c-MoS2). In this work, nitrogen-doped active carbon (NAC) is obtained through plasma treatment and amorphous MoSx/NAC hybrid catalyst films are electrodeposited on carbon fiber papers (CFP) which are employed as porous three-dimensional electrodes with low resistivity. The incorporation of NAC increases the electrochemically active surface area, enhances the electron transport, and facilitates the reaction kinetics. Moreover, the functionality durability benefits from synergistic effect between a-MoSx and NAC. Thus, the obtained hybrid catalyst delivers the excellent HER activity, requiring only 203 mV overpotential to achieve a geometrical current density of 100 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of similar to 43.9 mV per decade.

The solid-state structure of complex 1 has also been determined by single crystal X-ray crystallography. Single crystal X-ray analysis revealed a monomeric centrosymmetric structure for complex 1 in which two dithiocarbamate ligands are bonded to the Ni(II) metal ion in a S boolean AND S chelating mode resulting in a square planar geometry around the nickel center. These complexes are immobilized on activated carbon cloth (CC) and their electrocatalytic performances for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have been investigated in aqueous alkaline solution. All the complexes act as precatalysts for the OER and undergo electrochemical anodic activation to form Ni(O)OH active catalysts. Spectroscopic and electrochemical characterization revealed the existence of the interface of molecular complex/Ni(O)OH, which acts as the real catalyst for the OER.

The effect of adding Ti, V, Cu, Zn, and/or Mo into a baseline quinary-metal HEG, consisting of Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni, on the electrocatalytic performance is investigated. The quinary-metal HEG shows an overpotential of 307 mV at 50 mA cm-2 (eta50). We demonstrate that the catalytic activity can only be enhanced via doping with desired metals. The additions of Ti, V, and Zn lead to enhanced electrocatalytic performances, exhibiting eta50 of 254, 283, and 289 mV, respectively. The co-doping of Ti and Zn into the quinary-metal HEG results in a synergistic effect, giving robust catalytic activity with an ultra-low overpotential of 251 mV at 50 mA cm-2 and a low Tafel slope of 42.3 mV dec-1, and durable stability in 1 M KOH electrolyte for 60 h at different current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm-2. Also, phase transformation of the metal glycerate into metal (oxy)hydroxide during OER is investigated using various in situ and ex-situ analyses. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation validates the synergistic effect of addition of Ti and Zn in HEG system.

In this work, we report a ternary material system based on reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) and copper-tetracyanoquinodimethane (Cu-TCNQ) decorated on anodically aligned TiO2 nanotubes (TONTs), which simultaneously improve the charge separation and water oxidation kinetics. r-GO and Cu-TCNQ were sequentially decorated on the surface of TONTs by a facile electrophoretic deposition method and marked in brief as TONTs/r-GO/Cu-TCNQ The fabricated TONT/r-GO/Cu-TCNQ photoanode film was systematically characterized by various techniques, namely, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission-scanning electron microscopy, field emission-transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Photoelectrochemical water oxidation was evaluated in 1 M NaOH as an electrolyte, and the TONT/r-GO/Cu-TCNQ photoanode film exhibited a considerably improved J(SC) (photocurrent density) value of 0.72 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V versus V RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) compared to the J(SC) value (0.30 mA/cm(2)) of bare TONTs. The obtained experimental results demonstrated that r-GO with a high work function and higher electron mobility accepts photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of TONTs and leads to suppressed charge recombination and favorable charge separation/transfer events, whereas Cu-TCNQacts as an oxygen evolution reaction co-catalyst, which accepts photogenerated holes from the valence band of TONTs, accelerating the surface water oxidation reaction. Additionally, photoluminescence spectroscopy, incident photon-to-current efficiency, Mott-Schottky plot, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirmed that the r-GO and Cu-TCNQ complexes boost the charge separation/transfer events.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2574-0970		WOS:000752919200040

The optimum sample, Fe(ox)(H2O)(2)/NF-(-1.4)-15, was obtained at an electrodeposition potential of -1.4 V vs Ag/AgCl for 15 min, which can deliver OER current densities of 40 and 100 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 270 and 340 mV, respectively. The sample also exhibits good long-term OER activity during 80 h electrolysis at 20 mA cm(-2), which is superior to those of previously reported metal-organic framework (MOF) catalysts. Furthermore, the formation mechanism of the Fe(ox)(H2O)(2) nanorods is primarily investigated and the effect of the species of metal ions in MOF on the morphology and OER behavior is also explored. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the rate-limiting steps on Fe(ox)(H2O)(2) and Ni(ox)(H2O)(2) are the formation of Fe*-OOH and Ni*-OH intermediates with maximum Delta G values of 1.628 and 1.710 eV, respectively, which is attributed to the different electronic configurations of Ni and Fe, thus giving rise to different d-band centers and different affinities for adsorbates.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000637850300099	33749257

The black substance was investigated by means of X-ray diffraction and found to be trivalent cobalt oxy-hydroxide (alpha-CoOOH). The deposition of cobalt oxy-hydroxide and possible ways to prevent this deposition were studied. Experiments showed that the deposited cobalt oxy-hydroxide could be dissolved cathodically. The amount of charge for cathodic dissolution was used to estimate the deposited amount of cobalt oxy-hydroxide. The partial current density for the cobalt oxy-hydroxide formation increased with increasing anodic potential, indicating an electrochemical deposition reaction [Co2+(aq) + 2H(2)O -> 3H(+)(aq) + CoOOH + e -]. In agreement with thermodynamics, the deposition of cobalt oxy-hydroxide decreased with decreasing pH. The deposition was no longer observed at low pH (pH = 1.0), in good agreement with the thermodynamic calculations. The results showed that the cathodic pulses on the anode during electrowinning can be used to prevent accumulation of cobalt oxy-hydroxide on the anode. It was also found that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen peroxide suppressed the deposition of cobalt oxy-hydroxide. (C) 2010 The Electrochemical Society.

The beta-phase of molybdenum carbide (i.e., beta-Mo2C) has been reported to be one of the most active noble metal-free electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in electrolyzers, whereas the other phases, MoC and MoC1-x, have been widely regarded as weak electrocatalysts for HER. Herein, we report the synthesis of nanoporous substoichiometric alpha-MoC1-x and eta-MoC nanosheets, named np-MoC NSs, that show comparable electrocatalytic activity toward HER as beta-Mo2C does. The materials are synthesized using two-dimensional (2D) conjugated carbonitride and ammonium molybdate as precursors. Their structures contain N dopant atoms and nanopores. The pores create highly accessible catalytic sites and good mass and charge transport, and thereby excellent reaction kinetics for HER, in the materials. Theoretical calculations show that the N dopant atoms modulate the electronic properties of the catalytically active sites in the materials, leading to lower free energy of adsorption and desorption for the hydrogen species involved in the reaction and better catalytic activity for HER. This work demonstrates that, by simple structural design and electronic modulation, various phases of molybdenum carbides and related materials that have been traditionally considered inactive catalysts for HER can be made robust electrocatalysts for the reaction.									37	1	0	0	2	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000477988200031

Modeling of steady-state and impedance behavior								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				149	12			E497	E505		10.1149/1.1518484				DEC 2002	2002	The steady-state and impedance response of a solid metal point electrode in contact with a solid, oxygen-ion conducting electrolyte in CO-CO2 atmospheres was derived for three reaction mechanisms, involving gaseous species or species adsorbed on the surface of the electrode and/or the electrolyte. The overall electrochemical reaction was assumed to proceed in elementary steps, such as adsorption, diffusion of adsorbed species, and charge transfer. Eliciting the reaction mechanism from the steady-state response may require an extensive analysis in terms of temperature, gas-phase composition, and overpotential dependence. The impedance response, on the other hand, can in favorable cases be more distinctively dependent on the number of adsorbed species involved in the reaction and on the role of diffusion. Thus, if only one adsorbed intermediate species is involved, the impedance spectrum will always appear in the first quadrant of the impedance plane plot irrespective of experimental conditions. If two adsorbed intermediates are involved, however, this may lead to appearance of fourth-quadrant data.

J	Zhang, Weiying; Zou, Yanli; Mei, Xiang; Li, Yuexiang; Peng, Shaoqin; Xu, Junying				LI, Yue/GRS-8071-2022				Facile synthesis of Co-2(OH)(3)Cl/cobalt carbide/reduced graphene oxide composites for enhanced dye-sensitized photocatalytic H-2 evolution								SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS				4	12			6181	6187		10.1039/d0se01347a				DEC 1 2020	2020	Photocatalytic H-2 evolution from water splitting using catalysts has proven to be a promising strategy. In photocatalytic H-2 evolution, a hydrogen evolution cocatalyst is necessary. The cocatalyst should be inexpensive and efficient. In this work, a hollow Co-2(OH)(3)Cl/cobalt carbide/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composite was fabricated as a cocatalyst via the one-step thermal treatment at low temperature (300 degrees C and 350 degrees C) of CoCl2/graphene oxide (GO). Cobalt carbide was formed based on the strong interaction between GO and Co2+. GO not only provides the carbon source for cobalt carbide, but also acts as a soft template of a hollow structure and promotes the distribution of active species. The obtained sample exhibits a much higher dye-sensitized photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity than the catalysts prepared at high temperature (500 degrees C and 600 degrees C), which mainly consist of CoO/Co/cobalt carbide/RGO. This enhanced activity is ascribed to the formation of highly dispersed cobalt carbide and Co-2(OH)(3)Cl, the effective electron transfer between them, and the ability of Co-2(OH)(3)Cl to efficiently convey electrons from excited dye molecules. The highest apparent quantum yield of dye-sensitized photocatalytic H-2 evolution obtained using our catalyst was 28.3% at 420 nm. The possible mechanism is also discussed.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2398-4902			WOS:000593581500024

The lattice constants of Sr3-xCaxSn2O7 decrease, and the rotation of oxygen octahedron around c axis increases with the increasing of Ca doping. The phase transition temperature of Sr3-xCaxSn2O7 increases 183.3 K with the increase of Ca doping concentration from x = 0 to x = 0.3. The space group of Sr3Sn2O7 changed from A2(1)am to I4/mmm at 407.9 K.

Herein, an advanced aprotic Li-O-2 battery is designed using Co9S8@carbon porous nanocages as a bifunctional catalyst derived from a metal-organic framework. It achieves superior electrocatalytic activity, resulting in a high-energy efficiency of 72.7% and a long cycle life of up to 110 cycles at 100 mA g(-1) current density. Combined experimental studies and density functional theory calculations reveal that the promising electrochemical performance observed here could be attributed to the high catalytic activity of Co9S8. In addition, the open-framework porous structure of these carbon porous nanocages provides a facile mass transport pathway and fast charge transfer kinetics for the oxygen reduction/evolution reactions.									52	3	0	0	6	0	52			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000434624800051

The plasma is generated at a pressure of 440 Pa by a microwave cavity working at the excitation frequency of 433 MHz. The main nitrogen and nitrogen oxide species are experimentally studied, mainly in the late afterglow of both a N-2-O-2 discharge and a nitrogen discharge with a downstream O-2 admixture. The molecules NO(B-2 Pi) and NO2(A(2)B(2)) relative densities were monitored by optical emission spectroscopy and the atoms N(S-4) by means of mass spectrometry. A temporal 0D model is built and coupled to a steady state model on NO(B-2 Pi) and NO2(A(2)B(2)) states, for comparison with the experimental results, in order to describe the kinetics of the studied afterglows. This calculation is supported by the simulation of gas flow in the reactor using COMSOL Multiphysics (R). We present results concerning the temporal density evolutions of N(S-4), O-2(X-3 Sigma(-)(g)), O(P-3), NO(X-2 Pi), NO2(X(2)A(1)), O-3(X(1)A(1)) and steady density evolutions of NO(B-2 Pi) and NO2(A(2)B(2)) species as functions of the amount and location of an oxygen injection. The principal mechanisms in the described system are identified allowing the proposal of a simplified kinetic scheme showing a strong coupling among N(S-4), O(P-3) and the main channels of the formation and destruction of NO, NO2 and O-3 molecules.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000356626500013

Meanwhile, by changing the curing time and the contents of Zn and Co precursors, a series of Zn0.76Co0.24S/Co3S4/NF catalysts with different proportions of bi-active components (Zn0.76Co0.24S and Co3S4) were obtained. In particular, the Zn0.76Co0.24S/Co3S4/NF-4 h (1:2) catalyst has a typical heterostructure and 3D nanosheet network structure. The nanosheets are composed of nanoparticles with an average size of 3.1 nm. More importantly, the Zn0.76Co0.24S/Co3S4/NF-4 h (1:2) catalyst shows a very low overpotential of 120 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Even, at the large current density of 200 mA cm(-2), the Zn0.76Co0.24S/Co3S4/NF-4 h (1:2) catalyst only has the overpotential of 280 mV. Moreover, the overpotential of Zn0.76Co0.24S/Co3S4/NF-4 h (1:2) catalyst is almost unchanged after 500 cycles at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The excellent HER activity and stability of the catalyst can be attributed to the heterostructure, which can further increase the number of active sites. This work provides a new direction for the preparation of highly efficient and stable heteromorphic non-noble metal catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000584672700001

NUCLEOSYNTHETIC CONSTRAINTS ON THE MASS OF THE HEAVIEST SUPERNOVAE								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				769	2					99	10.1088/0004-637X/769/2/99				JUN 1 2013	2013	We explore the sensitivity of nucleosynthesis in massive stars to the truncation of supernova explosions above a certain mass. It is assumed that stars of all masses contribute to nucleosynthesis by their pre-explosive winds, but above a certain limiting main sequence mass, M-BH, the presupernova star becomes a black hole and ejects nothing more. The solar abundances from oxygen to atomic mass 90 are fit quite well assuming no cutoff at all, i.e., by assuming all stars up to 120 M-circle dot make successful supernovae. Little degradation in the fit occurs if M-BH is reduced to 25 M-circle dot. If this limit is reduced further however, the nucleosynthesis of the s-process declines precipitously and the production of species made in the winds, e. g., carbon, becomes unacceptably large compared with elements made in the explosion, e. g., silicon and oxygen. By varying uncertain physics, especially the mass loss rate for massive stars and the rate for the Ne-22(alpha, n)Mg-25 reaction rate, acceptable nucleosynthesis might still be achieved with a cutoff as low as 18 M-circle dot. This would require, however, a supernova frequency three times greater than the fiducial value obtained when all stars explode in order to produce the required O-16. The effects of varying M-BH on the nucleosynthesis of Fe-60 and Al-26, the production of helium as measured by Delta Y/Delta Z, and the average masses of compact remnants are also examined.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000319999100015		
J	Murakami, Kenji; Watanabe, Ryo; Matsuhashi, Emiri; Nakamura, Ayano; Takehara, Kenta; Higuchi, Takahide; Matsumura, Masaru								Influence of Particle Size of Carbon Materials and Oxygen Concentration on the Combustion Rates								TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN				107	6			422	430		10.2355/tetsutohagane.TETSU-2020-081				JUN 2021	2021	To reduce the amount of CO2 evolution in iron ore sintering process, it is considered to replace a part of coke and anthracite, which are agglomeration agent, with biomass char. However, it is unclear how the particle size of biomass char and the oxygen concentration affect the combustion rate. The purpose of this study is to measure the combustion rate when PKS (Perm Kernel Shell) char and coke breeze with various particle sizes of 0.15-0.25, 0.6-1, 1-3 mm were combusted at a temperature of 400-800 degrees C under 1-5 vol% of oxygen. The combustion rate in the chemical reaction rate-determining step (low temperature region) was analyzed by the Arrhenius equation. It was found that the apparent activation energy was 110-120 kJ/mol for PKS char and 140-150 kJ/mol for coke breeze independent of oxygen concentration and particle size. On the other hand, the frequency factor decreased with increasing particle size. As a result, the combustion rate decreased slightly with increasing particle size. The combustion rate in the diffu- an equation considering the gas diffusion sion-controlled step (high temperature region) was analyzed by and the pore structure of carbonaceous ma terial. The proposed equation fitted the measured combustion rate well for particle size of 1-3 mm. However, when the particle size was small, the correction factor must be introduced to the equation of combustion rate. Because the combustion rate of PKS char is high even at low oxygen concentration, it is preferable to place the PKS char in the lower layer of the sintering bed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-1575	1883-2954		WOS:000664241400006

Herein, we prepared metal-free N,P-codoped hydrophilic carbon nanosheets (NPC-Li) as effective bifunctional electrocatalysts using LiCl as the medium, in which phytic acid was used as the source of phosphorous and carbon, and ammonia atmosphere as the source of nitrogen. Furthermore, micrometer-sized agglomerations of carbon materials were significantly restrained using LiCl. NPC-Li exhibits superior bifunctional catalytic activity for both ORR and OER. In addition, the NPC-Li-based primary zinc-air battery shows a high energy density of 908 Wh kg(Zn)(-1), and the rechargeable battery shows excellent charge-discharge cycle efficiency.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			2052-1553			WOS:000461666900006

The optimized CoP3/CoSnO2 porous nanaocubes showed excellent electrocatalytic activity for OER/ORR.

However, water oxidation occurs readily in plants, catalyzed by the Mn4O4Ca manganese cluster. In addition to this, manganese minerals are ubiquitous in nature displaying layered and tunnel structures. In this study, mixed valent porous amorphous manganese oxides (AMO), along with cryptomelane type tunnel manganese oxides (OMS-2) and layered birnessite (OL-1) have been used as water oxidation catalysts. Significantly higher turnovers were obtained with AMO (290 mmol O-2/mol Mn) compared to tunnel structure OMS-2 (110 mmol O-2/mol Mn) and layered structure OL-1 (27 mmol O-2/mol Mn) in water oxidation tests with Ce4+. Oxygen evolution was also confirmed under photochemical conditions using Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) as a photosensitizer and persulfate as a sacrificial agent. The differences in catalytic activity among these catalysts have been probed using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, average oxidation state, and compositional analyses. Comparison of AMO against prominent manganese catalysts described in literature shows AMO provided the highest turnover numbers. AMO catalyst was also reusable after regeneration. O-18 labeling studies proved that water was the source of dioxygen and IR proved the structural stability of AMO after reaction. AMO is related to hexagonal birnessites such as layered biogenic manganese oxides or H+-birnessite that have cation vacancies in the MnO2 sheets rather than completely filled Mn3+/Mn4+ sheets, and this is influential in catalytic activity.									247	6	0	0	37	1	250			1932-7447			WOS:000301509600063

As reference of L. monocytogenes behaviour, the evolution of Listeria innocua growth was monitored at different positions within a kappa-carrageenan synthetic meat and visualised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Microbial growth was also determined in a liquid medium, prepared with the same nutrients as the solid phase, and the effect of oxygen concentration, a fundamental parameter in meat preservation, was studied. To simulate microbial behaviour in the solid, results of kinetics in broth were incorporated to a diffusion-reaction model that considers growth kinetics as a function of the local oxygen concentration. Data from the model have been then discussed, taking into account experimental data and SEM observations. This model, useful for food safety purposes, has been shown to provide a reasonably good simulation of experimental data in the structured synthetic meat.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0950-5423	1365-2621		WOS:000264185700010

This study investigated the conversion of flexible plastic packaging waste with 11.8 and 27.5 wt.% polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (denoted as PET-12 and PET-28, respectively) into oil and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The mixtures were initially pyrolyzed and the produced volatiles were processed over 9.0 wt.% Fe2O3 supported on ZSM-5 (400 degrees C) to remove oxygenated hydrocarbons (catalytic cracking of terephthalic and benzoic acids) that deteriorate oil quality. The contents of oxygenated hydrocarbons were decreased in oil from 4.6 and 9.4 wt.% per mass of PET-12 and PET-28, respectively, to undetectable levels. After catalytic cracking, the oil samples had similar contents of gasoline, diesel and heavy oil/wax fractions. The non-condensable gas was converted into MWCNTs over 0.9 wt.% Ni supported on CaCO3 (700 degrees C). The type of plastic packaging influenced the yields (2.4 and 1.5 wt.% per mass of PET-12 and PET-28, respectively) and the properties of MWCNTs due to the differences in gas composition. Regarding the electrocatalytic application, both MWCNTs from PET-12 and PET-28 outperformed commercial MWCNTs and Pt-based electrodes during oxygen evolution reaction, suggesting that MWCNTs from flexible plastic packaging can potentially replace conventional electrode materials.									64	1	0	0	23	0	65			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000514758500033	31951979

Herein, a noble-metal-free ternary composite of TiO2-Cu@C was prepared by electrostatic self-assembly loaded copper nanoparticles and amorphous carbon dots (CDs) on porous TiO2 microrods. The good conductivity of the CDs was beneficial to promoting the charge transfer and separation, generating an enhanced solar-to-hydrogen performance on TiO2-Cu@C. The optimized TiO2-Cu@C reveals a stable and notable hydrogen evolution rate of 3911 mu mol g(-1)h(-1), which is 1.6 times that of TiO2-Cu and many times higher than that of TiO2. Instead of providing active sites for hydrogen production, the CDs act as an electronic mediator and provide another electron pathway to further enhance the activity of TiO2-Cu, where the photogenerated electrons on (TiO2) could pass through the CDs to the copper cocatalyst and reduce water to hydrogen.									33	3	0	0	5	0	33			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000483341000103

Herein, ultra-small Ni-doped CuCo2S4 nanoparticles (NCCS NPs) are easily achieved in a single step by a facile hydrothermal method. The investigations, using powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and TEM, reveal that the as-prepared NCCS products are composed of a large number of uniform nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 20 to 50 nm. Triethanolamine is of vital importance for the formation of the NCCS NPs during the sulfidation process. As a promising electrocatalyst for HER, the NCCS NPs not only display a lower overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) current density than that of bare CuCo2S4 nanoparticles (CCS NPs), but also show better long-term durability than CCS NPs during the galvanostatic electrolysis. Furthermore, Ni doping for NCCS NPs are proved to play a particular important role in the HER process. This finding provides a strategy in compositional tuning of mixed polymetallic sulfides catalysts for electrochemical hydrogen evolution.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0232-1300	1521-4079		WOS:000458902100004		
J	Kumar, Anurag; Phadke, Sohan; Bhan, Aditya								Acetic acid hydrodeoxygenation on molybdenum carbide catalysts								CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				8	11			2938	2953		10.1039/c8cy00358k				JUN 7 2018	2018	As-synthesized molybdenum carbide shows >98% selectivity (deoxygenated products) and stable chemical conversion for >30 h time-on-stream after an initial deactivation period of approximate to 9 h for vapor phase hydrodeoxygenation of acetic acid at a low temperature (403 K) and atmospheric pressure. Space-time variation studies show acetaldehyde as a primary unstable product, ethanol as a secondary unstable product, and ethyl acetate and ethylene as secondary stable products suggesting a sequential reaction pathway for acetic acid deoxygenation on Mo2C. The concurrent half and zero-order dependence of acetic acid HDO rates on H-2 and acetic acid pressure, respectively, suggests that catalytic sites for H-2 activation are distinct from those required for the activation of acetic acid consistent with prior reports for deoxygenation of aromatic ethers and alcohols. Catalyst surface evolution by oxygen (O:Mo-bulk approximate to 0.3) and carbon (C:Mo-bulk approximate to 0.1) deposition from the reactant oxygenate was noted using temperature programmed surface reaction (TPSR) with hydrogen post reaction. Higher O*/Mo deposition with acetic acid in reference to H2O, CO2, and aromatic ethers at similar oxygenate pressures suggests that the identity of the oxygenate determines its proficiency for heteroatom deposition on fresh carbidic materials. Catalytic site densities were estimated via in situ titration using 2,2-dimethylpropanoic acid (DMPA) as a reagent to calculate a turnover frequency (TOF) of (9 +/- 1) x 10(-4) mol s(-1) mol(DMPA)(-1). The X-ray diffraction patterns and X-ray photoelectron spectra of passivated Mo2C catalyst samples before and after acetic acid reaction indicate the presence of a carbide/oxycarbide phase, even though the bulk structure of orthorhombic -Mo2C is retained.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000434386000021

Herein, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of noble metals is used to respond to a broad solar spectrum, and to design polydopamine-passivated particulate photocatalysts for widely used visible-infrared water splitting. This plasmon-passivated effect promotes the charge transfer for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions to enter the Marcus inverted region for overcoming the kinetics barrier. Remarkably, this effect can also, facilitate thermodynamic upconversion processes for making efficient use of long-wavelength photons. Thus, its dequantization property should be insensitive to the energy-band structure and the energy loss would be mainly due to thermalization related to the incident power. When incident power is increased to 14 suns intensity, the efficiency in 500-750 nm region is up to 1.53%, which is a significant breakthrough for a particulate photocatalyst. Evidently, this plasmon-passivated strategy can solve the thermodynamic and kinetic challenges of photocatalysis and greatly promote visible-infrared solar water splitting applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000746660700001

Herein, an efficient 1D bifunctional electrocatalyst was constructed via a multistep strategy, which consisted of core-shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 derived CoP/N-doped porous carbon nanotube anchored with vertically aligned MoS2 nanosheets (NCT@CoP@MoS2). Benefiting from the synergies between the unique 1D porous hollow hetemstmcture and the components, the tubular NCT@CoP@MoS2 composites showed superior electrocatalytic activity in 1 M KOH with an overpotential of similar to 234 and 195 mV to achieve 10 mA.cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively. More importantly, the NCT@CoP@MoS2//NCT@CoP@MoS2 couple delivered high overall water splitting performance with an ultralow cell voltage of 1.57 and 1.85 V to achieve 10 and 200 mA.cm(-2) , only 70 and 40 mV higher than that of Pt/C//RuO2, respectively. Specifically, the as-prepared electrode exhibited ultra-stability for overall water splitting, and the current density only decreases by 4% at 1.6 V after 40 h of cycling.									20	0	0	0	0	0	19			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000663665500004

Despite the fact that various non-noble metal-based materials as electrocatalysts toward the HER are gaining considerable attention, noble metal-based nanomaterials (NMNs) for catalyzing the HER still have advantageous features, i.e., wide pH applicability, high intrinsic activity, and good stability. Considering a high chemical similarity to HER-benchmark Pt metals, various non-Pt NMNs with high atom utilization, super efficiency, and durability for HER catalysis are engineered through various structural/electronic tailoring strategies, which has become a significant trend in this research field. Herein, a panoramic review about recent representative efforts and progress in the design of non-Pt NMNs is presented. It first introduces the HER fundamentals and then generally describes the structural and electronic characteristics of non-Pt noble metals matching the HER. Followed on, different tuning strategies for fabricating effective non-Pt NMN catalysts, including composition optimizing by constructing alloys or novel compounds, morphological tuning via decreasing the particle size or designing unique nanostructures, and hybrid engineering as well as crystalline structure/facet controlling, are systemically summarized, with a special focus on the underlying structure-activity relationship for different catalysts. The features of pH universality and bifunctionality for these non-Pt NMN catalysts are also highlighted. At the end, existing challenges and future perspectives awaiting this emerging research field are discussed.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1931-9401			WOS:000578452900001

This work reported the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical (PEG) properties of synthesized photoanodes depending on solvothermal treatment time (i.e., 12, 16, and 20 h) maintained during synthesis. The treatment time influenced the morphology of Zr-doped alpha-Fe2O3 nanostructures, which directly exert an effect on the electrochemical and PEG performance of the synthesized photoanodes. The high conductivity and lowest Tafel slope value (83 mV/decade) were attained from electrochemical studies for the nanoflake morphology. The highest photocurrent of about 0.52 mA/cm(2) at 1.5 V Vs RHE was obtained for Zr-doped alpha-Fe2O3 nanoflakes and 16.17% intrinsic photon conversion efficiency was achieved for the same sample with high photostability for 2 h under continuous irradiation of light. We reported the treatment time-dependent morphology effect on both electrochemical and PEG water oxidation of Zr-doped hematite nanoflakes in this work.									29	0	1	0	0	0	30			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000455471100083

The pulsed MnO2 electrodeposition also led to the formation of Ti(III); however, the highest values of specific capacitance (similar to 200 F g(-1) at 5 A g(-1) ) were only attained when a CT (-1.6 V vs . Ag/AgCl/KCl 3 mol L-1 during 5 s using 0.5 mol L-1 of Na2SO4 as electrolyte) was applied regardless of the used substrate. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy combined with the analysis of the time evolution of the electrochemical impedance (EI) showed that the hydroxylated surface, produced after CT by the reaction between adsorbed H2O and the unstable surface oxygen vacancies in the TiO2, led to a decrease of the charge transfer resistance and an increase of the TiO2-NT@MnO2 film conductivity, indirectly measured through the evolution of the ohmic drop during galvanostatic experiments. The Ti/TiO2-NT substrates and the thermally grown TiO2 oxide also exhibited similar EI performances before and after the CT, independently of the thermal treatment method. However, the total impedance of these samples was higher than that found for the composite electrode. This is an indication of the beneficial effect of the pulsed electrodeposition procedure in improving the conductivity of the TiO2-NT substrate used successfully as template to produce nanosized MnO2 without binders.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The MOF prepared when added chloride ion with the overpotential at 100 mA.cm(-2) as 247 mV. Meanwhile, the stability test at 100 mA cm(-2) for 12 h had no obvious change which exhibited high electrochemical stability. The analysis demonstrated that the superior performance of the MOF prepared when added chloride ion was attributed to the low charge transfer resistance, increased active area, exposure more active sites.

The specific relationship between the position and type of substituent and the electrochemical oxidation activity on the BDD electrode was systematically studied by employing Chemical Oxygen Demand and concentration variation. Electrochemical mineralization of hydroquinone was conducted on electrodes with different oxygen evolution potentials. It was found that there exists an important relationship between the electrochemical activity and the ability to generate hydroxyl radicals. A high activity was achieved on the BDD electrode owing to its higher electro-generation ability for hydroxyl radicals. The mineralization of substituted phenols is indirectly conducted by the hydroxyl radicals and the divorce of the substituent group is the rate determining step for the mineralization process. Meanwhile, the electrochemical mineralization rate towards substituted phenol contaminants is limited by the electronic effects of the substituents. The mineralization rate increases with increasing electron donating ability of the substituent. A linear relationship is found to exist between the reaction rate and the Hammett constant during degradation of substituted phenols.									2	1	0	0	0	0	3			1000-6818			WOS:000409322900021

This novel MnO2/P:Fe2O3 photoanode exhibited a remarkably enhanced PEC water oxidation activity, and its photocurrent density is approximately 5-fold higher than that of pristine Fe2O3. The significant improvement of PEC performance is mainly attributed to the synergistic effects of P-doping and MnO2 cocatalysts. More specifically, the Mott-Schottky and Nyquist plots clearly reveal that P-doping could not only effectively increase the density of charge carriers but also enhance the electron and hole transfer mobilities of Fe2O3 photoanodes. Furthermore, the MnO2 cocatalyst modification can significantly facilitate charge separation and hole transport to the photoanode/electrolyte interface for water oxidation. Therefore, these demonstrations may provide an alternate strategy for designing and fabricating highly efficient Fe2O3-based PEC systems for solar energy conversion.									60	4	0	0	5	0	62			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431003600033

In this study, a novel multi-tubular fixed bed tri-reformer assisted with hydrogen and oxygen perm-selective membranes is proposed for synthesis gas production for methanol synthesis reactor. This reactor can be used instead of conventional steam methane reformer (SMR) and conventional auto-thermal reformer (ATR). A distributed mathematical model is developed for tri-reformer membrane reactor which consists of three sides for synthesis gas production. Air is fed co-currently into the oxygen perm-selective membrane in the inner tube and oxygen permeates into the reaction side for oxidative reforming of methane. Selective permeation of hydrogen via the Pd-based membrane is achieved by co-current flow of sweeping gas through the permeation side. The results of tri-reformer are compared with the corresponding predicted results by HYSIS simulation software under the same feed condition. The superiorities of this novel configuration to optimized tri-reformer without any membrane (Arab Aboosadi, Z., Jahanmiri, A.H., Rahimpour, M.R., 2011.

However, the actual activity of P-rich TMPs is not as good as expected because of the undesirable electronic structure. Transition metal doping has been shown to be effective in improving the HER activity of TMPs in both acid and alkaline media, but the underlying mechanism is ambiguous, especially for P-rich TMPs. Herein, cobalt-doped and phosphorus-rich tungsten phosphide nanowire arrays (Co/WP2 NWs/CC) are synthesized and the electrochemical properties and mechanism are determined by both experiments and theoretical calculation. The results reveal that Co dopants serve as inert catalytic sites and do not participate in HER process, but the Co/WP2 NWs/CC exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic activity as a result of the lower water dissociation barrier and hydrogen adsorption/desorption free energy on W or P sites and improved conductivity by strong electron-donating effects of Co dopants, thereby boosting the catalytic activity and kinetics.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2196-0216			WOS:000664219100015

NANOSCALE				10	33			15624	15631		10.1039/c8nr04505d				SEP 7 2018	2018	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a metal-free two-dimensional photocatalyst, has drawn increasing attention due to its application in photocatalytic water splitting. However, its quantum efficiency is limited by the poor performance of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, it is important to clarify the behavior of photogenerated holes in the OER. In this work, we investigate the energy level alignment using the GW method and the exciton properties using the Bethe-Salpeter equation within the ab initio many-body Green's function theory at the g-C3N4/water interface. We found that the g-C3N4 substrate can elevate energy levels of OH- and H2O molecules at the interface by up to 0.6 eV. This effect can make the electronic levels of OH- surpass the valence band maximum (VBM) of g-C3N4. However, orbital energies of H2O molecules remain far below the VBM of g-C3N4. This indicates that a photogenerated hole after exciting g-C3N4 can relax to OH- instead of neutral H2O. Moreover, OH- could be directly oxidized through electron transfer from OH- to g-C3N4 by light near the optical absorption edge of g-C3N4, which is beneficial for efficient carrier separation at the interface.									30	4	0	0	2	0	32			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000443623800023	30090897

Among various cathode materials for AZIBs, manganese oxides have risen to prominence due to their high energy density and low cost. However, sluggish reaction kinetics and poor cycling stability dictate against their practical application. Herein, we demonstrate the combined use of defect engineering and interfacial optimization that can simultaneously promote rate capability and cycling stability of MnO2 cathodes. beta-MnO2 with abundant oxygen vacancies (V-O) and graphene oxide (GO) wrapping is synthesized, in which V-O in the bulk accelerate the charge/discharge kinetics while GO on the surfaces inhibits the Mn dissolution. This electrode shows a sustained reversible capacity of similar to 129.6 mAh g(-1) even after 2000 cycles at a current rate of 4C, outperforming the state-of-the-art MnO2-based cathodes. The superior performance can be rationalized by the direct interaction between surface V-O and the GO coating layer, as well as the regulation of structural evolution of beta-MnO2 during cycling. The combinatorial design scheme in this work offers a practical pathway for obtaining high-rate and long-life cathodes for AZIBs.									22	1	0	0	2	0	22			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000686672100001	34387758

Three main types of nanometer/atomic scale features were identified by STM: (i) small bumps, attributed to surface atomic vacancies; (ii) smooth bumps, attributed to interstitial Ar or C atoms; and (iii) depressions not previously reported for graphite, and tentatively attributed to interstitial oxygen species. The evolution of the STM features suggests that the surface modification of HOPG by an air DBD plasma is dominated by physical processes (ion bombardment). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Toxicities have been attributed to scavenging of nitric oxide (NO). However, while NO scavenging may explain many in vitro effects, and some effects in animal models and clinical trials with HBOCs, key inconsistencies in the theory require alternative explanations. This review considers the hypothesis that cell-free Hb oversupplies oxygen to tissues, leading to oxygen-related toxicity, possibly through formation of reactive oxygen species and local destruction of NO. Evidence for this hypothesis comes from various sources, establishing that tissue oxygen levels are maintained over very narrow (and low) levels, even at high oxygen consumption. Tissue is normally protected from excessive oxygen by its extremely low solubility in plasma, but introduction of cell-free Hb, even at low concentration, greatly augments oxygen supply, engaging protective mechanisms that include vasoconstriction and ischemia. The requirement to limit oxygen supply by cell-free Hb suggests novel ways to modify it to overcome vasoconstriction, independent of the intrinsic reaction of Hb with NO. This control is essential to the design of a safe and effective cell-free HBOC.									46	0	2	0	24	0	50			0041-1132	1537-2995		WOS:000314783700027	22804568	
J	Ke, Xiwei; Li, Yiran; Jiang, Ling; Zhang, Man; Lyu, Junfu; Huang, Zhong					Huang, Zhong/0000-0002-3996-1728			Experimental and modeling investigation on char combustion and char-nitrogen evolution characteristics under different conditions								JOURNAL OF THE ENERGY INSTITUTE				102				256	267		10.1016/j.joei.2022.04.001				JUN 2022	2022	The proper description of char combustion and char-nitrogen (char-N) evolution characteristics are imperative to analyze the operating performance of decoupling combustion systems. The char-O-2 combustion and char-CO2 gasification reactivity of three typical coal chars, including lignite, bituminous, and anthracite, was tested in a lab-scale fixed-bed reactor in the temperature range of 1023 K-1223 K. The relevant chemical kinetic parameters were determined by applying a one-dimensional packed-bed reactor model embedded with a lumped particle model. Meanwhile, a 1-dimensional spherical particle model is necessary for describing the char-N conversion behaviors. Experimental results show that the conversion rate of char-N in the entire bed to NO (XNO, bed) gradually decreases with increasing temperature, and the decrease of coal rank leads to a decline in the NOx emission. Further simulation results indicate that for a single char particle in the initial combustion stage, if the char particle size increases (0-1000 mu m), the external gas mass transfer coefficient decreases (0-5 ms(-1)), or the oxygen content decreases (0-20%), the char-N conversion to NO (XNO, p) will gradually decrease. However, due to the complicated effects of temperature on multiple factors, involving reactivity, CO/CO2 ratio in products, and dual nature of CO influence on char-NO reaction, the relationship between char-N conversion and temperature for a single particle is not fixed. When the oxygen concentration is low, the XNO, p increases as temperature rising; while, an opposite trend may be formed under high oxygen conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1743-9671	1746-0220		WOS:000797733100004		
J	Chai, Shouning; Zhao, Guohua; Wang, Yujing; Zhang, Ya-nan; Wang, Yanbin; Jin, Yefei; Huang, Xiaofeng				Chai, Shouning/P-8232-2017				Fabrication and enhanced electrocatalytic activity of 3D highly ordered macroporous PbO2 electrode for recalcitrant pollutant incineration								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				147				275	286		10.1016/j.apcatb.2013.08.046				APR 5 2014	2014	By virtue of the self-assembled colloidal crystal template with face-centered cubic structure, a novel three-dimensional highly ordered macroporous PbO2 (3DOM-PbO2) electrode was fabricated by electrochemical deposition method. In the 3DOM-PbO2 film, every spherical cavity was interconnected to three adjacent spherical cavities on the upper and lower layer, respectively, and the pore size was about 500 nm. Compared to the traditional flat microcrystalline PbO2 (Flat-PbO2), the nanocrystalline 3DOM-PbO2 with beta-PbO2 crystal phase possessed larger specific surface area (46 m(2) g(-1)), higher oxygen evolution potential (1.92 V), smaller electron transfer resistance (35.5 Omega), and more abundant crystal defect sites, resulting in better electrocatalytic performance. The electrochemical mineralization of refractory metalaxyl with 3DOM-PbO2 anode demonstrated that, the electrocatalytic reaction followed pseudo-first-order kinetics and the value of apparent rate constant (k(app)) is 0.017 min(-1), about 2.4 times that with Flat-PbO2, and total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removals are all approximately 95% after 300 min. The mineralization current efficiency with the 3DOM-PbO2 was much higher than that with the Flat-PbO2, and corresponding electrical energy consumption was lower. Moreover, the intermediates were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometer (GC-MS), and possible electrocatalytic oxidation mechanism of metalaxyl on the 3DOM-PbO2 electrode was also discussed in detail.

For our developed electrode, large stable current density of 100 and 200 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of only 283 and 300 mV in oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte was obtained, which is dramatically lower than many previous reported overpotentials. It also exhibits low Tafel slope at current range from 10 to 25 mA cm(-2) (56.47 mV dec(-1)). Further analysis demonstrates the key role of higher carriers of the rambutan-like NiFe-LDH nanocluster arrays electrode in boosting the water-splitting performance of the resulting system. Benefiting from the fine geometry shape of the self-supported nanocluster nanoarrays electrode, the transfer process of the reactants and oxygen/hydrogen bubbles is accelerated. In addition, a 19-time enhancement of carrier concentration for our developed rambutan-like NiFe-LDH nanoclusters (2.9 x 10(29) m(-3)) is obtained. Notably, the resultant rambutan-like NiFe-LDH nanocluster arrays electrode exhibits enhanced stability (in high and low current density) for the full water splitting in 1 M KOH, remaining nearly 100% of the original current density after continued testing for 20 h. This finding may provide new insight on rational structural design LDH nanostructures with high performance for electrocatalysis. Graphic abstract A highly hydrophilic NiFe-LDH nanocluster arrays electrode is developed for efficient full water splitting. Large and stable current density of 200 mA cm(-2) is obtained at overpotential of 300 mV.

The combination of electrochemical, microscopic, and spectroscopic techniques leads to a comprehensive interpretation of the dissolution mechanism. The polishing quality increases with increasing nitrate concentration and current density, respectively. The oxygen evolution amounts up to 45% of the consumed anodic charge and the apparent valence of the chromium dissolution decreases with increasing applied potential down to z=3.5. The authors explain this phenomenon by a passive dissolution of chromium via Cr3+ followed by a chemical oxidation of Cr3+ to dichromate under nitrate reduction to nitrogen.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000456744900002

The results showed that seed germination rate, chlorophyll content, and photochemical activity of photosystems, and the activities of antioxidative enzymes in hexaploid wheat and octoploid Triticale were significantly higher than in diploid and tetraploid wheat. Compared to other two wheat species and octoploid Triticale, hexaploid wheat presented lower levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, we found that the levels of photosystem II reaction center protein D1, light-harvesting complex II b4 (CP29), and D subunit of photosystem I (PsaD) in diploid wheat were significantly lower compared with hexaploid wheat and octoploid Triticale. Taken together, we concluded that hexaploid wheat and octoploid Triticale have higher photosynthetic capacities and better antioxidant systems. These findings indicate that different ploidy levels of chromosome probably play an important regulatory role in photosystems and antioxidative systems of plants.									21	0	0	0	16	0	21				1422-0067		WOS:000448951000161	30279334

This work follows on this seemingly untrodden path whereby, via utilization of first-principles DFT calculations and the accepted HER activity description (vertical bar Delta G(H*)vertical bar), the polar (002) surface of commercially abundant ZnO shows a clear preference toward HER activity compared to other facets. Further, a robust and systematic screening of viable surface modulators was performed, through which it was determined that surface oxygen vacancies atop (002) ZnO yield a phenomenal reduction in vertical bar Delta G(H*)vertical bar (namely, 36 meV) toward the ideal zero value. This shows promise for industrial realization as an alternative to Pt and transition-metal chalcogenides. The viability of production was ensured through the rational faceted growth of (002) ZnO followed by a physicochemical reduction technique. This resulted in a novel "black" ZnO material with universal pH stability. Electrochemical measurements showed that to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), black ZnO requires an overpotential of 220 mV, compared to 440 mV of its pristine counterpart in acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) electrolyte. It is this work's foresight that appropriate and facile structural modifications may be applied to the myriad of available transition-metal oxides as a way to ameliorate the pressure on environmentally poignant hydrogen generation methods for an array of industrial uses.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2574-0962			WOS:000595488500034

From our transmission electron microscopy observations, the outermost surfaces of the as-prepared Co-CoxC composites were primarily covered with Co2C crystallites. Our best performing electrocatalyst exhibited superior HER activity with an overpotential of 78 mV to reach a current density of -10 mA.cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 87.8 mV.dec(-1), and 1 h of electrode durability. We show that this excellent HER performance is primarily due to the superior intrinsic activity of Co2C, as well as the high electrical conductivity resulting from the inclusion of cobalt metal and the presence of graphitic carbon shells in and on the composite, respectively. Using both computational and experimental approaches, we determine that the carbon-rich cobalt carbide (Co2C) phase is more favorable for the HER than the carbon-poor phase (Co3C).									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			2574-0962			WOS:000529190300088		
J	Yang, Yujia; Xu, Lejin; Wang, Jianlong								An enhancement of singlet oxygen generation from dissolved oxygen activated by three-dimensional graphene wrapped nZVI-doped amorphous Al species for chloramphenicol removal in the Fenton-like system								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				425						131497	10.1016/j.cej.2021.131497		AUG 2021		DEC 1 2021	2021	Three-dimensional graphene wrapped nZVI-doped amorphous Al species (3D-GN@Fe/a-Al) was fabricated as a novel Fenton-like catalyst for efficient removal of chloramphenicol (CAP) within a wide pH range. The mechanism of singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) generation from dissolved oxygen (DO) activated by 3D-GN@Fe/a-Al was discovered. 3D-GN@Fe/a-Al was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy combined with an energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS), Brunner-Emmet-Teller (BET) measurement, X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and Raman spectroscopy to investigate the morphological and physicochemical properties. The catalytic performance of 3D-GN@Fe/a-Al for DO activation was estimated by the factor experiments of CAP degradation, including CAP concentration, catalyst dose, reaction temperature and pH value. Based on the evolution of the ultraviolet spectrum during the reaction and the results of high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) detection, the degradation pathway of CAP in the 3D-GN@Fe/a-Al-DO system was proposed. More importantly, the generation of singlet oxygen from DO activation mediated by the Al3+-promoted single electron delivery was further explored by the experiments of scavengers, electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis and electrochemical tests. The mechanism of O-1(2) generation provides a new strategy for improving the degradation of organic pollutants in water by Fenton-like systems.									7	1	0	0	3	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000707126000206

Deletion of the gene from a high light-sensitive strain lacking four hli genes (4Xhli) restored viability to the parental strain under high light conditions. The quintuple mutant pfsR(-)/4Xhli retained photosystem-II and oxygen evolution capacity at levels similar to the wild-type levels under high light conditions. The transcripts of the two bfr genes ( encoding bacterioferritin) were found to be constitutively up-regulated, whereas the transcripts of ho1 gene ( encoding a heme oxygenase) were greatly down-regulated in high light upon deletion of pfsR. Under intermediate high intensity light, the pfsR deletion strains accumulated carotenoids and chlorophyll a to a significantly higher level than their corresponding parental strains. An exacerbated, transient increase in oxygen evolution during the early hours of high light acclimation and a somewhat increased steady-state level of photosystem-II-mediated oxygen evolution observed in the 4Xhli strain were brought back to the wild-type levels upon deletion of pfsR from the strain. The pfsR deletion mutants were found to be less sensitive to iron limitation under low light conditions and to suffer less lipid peroxidation following exposure to high light. Therefore, inactivation of PfsR resulted in tighter control of iron availability, which in turn reduced oxidative stress during photosynthesis in high light. These studies have revealed a critical role of PfsR in regulation of iron homeostasis and stress response.									20	1	0	0	16	0	20				1083-351X		WOS:000241075900062	16914546	
J	Longo, Roberto C.; Ranjan, Alok; Ventzek, Peter L. G.								Density Functional Theory Study of Oxygen Adsorption on Polymer Surfaces for Atomic-Layer Etching: Implications for Semiconductor Device Fabrication								ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS				3	6			5189	5202		10.1021/acsanm.0c00618				JUN 26 2020	2020	Atomic-layer etching (ALE) is a technique that removes thin layers of material using sequential self-limiting reactions and is considered to be one of the most promising techniques for achieving the low-process variability necessary in the imminent atomic-scale era of semiconductor device fabrication. Here, a theoretical investigation of the ALE of organic polymer surfaces using oxygen pulses has been performed, by means of density functional theory calculations. Experimental evidence shows that ion bombardment of polymer surfaces results in carbon-abundant layers, which are formed as a competition between two opposite effects, the breaking of C-H and C-C bonds, which leads to either structural evolution or sputtering of the polymer surface. Cognizant of that, we develop appropriate polymer surface models, first, to investigate whether the adsorption of oxygen on organic surfaces can be rendered self-limiting, as required in ALE and, second, to establish the conditions for obtaining controlled, self-limiting etching of surface carbon atoms. Our results show that, indeed, for large oxygen flux densities, atomically controlled etching can be obtained in the form of desorption of different carbonate species. We quantify the etching process through both the oxygen flux density and the initial kinetic energy of the impacting oxygen atoms. On the basis of a saturated carbon surface model, the theoretical maximum etch rate was estimated to be 0.51 +/- 0.05 angstrom/cycle (4.94 +/- 0.1 ng/cm(2).cycle), which matches the range of maximum experimental values.									15	1	0	0	0	0	16			2574-0970			WOS:000545689000029

Room temperature crystal structure, electrical conductivity and oxygen exchange capacity, as well as electrochemical performance of LSNCux are comprehensively investigated. Among the series of samples, LSNCu0.25 half-cell exhibits the lowest polarization resistance value of 0.179 omega cm2 at 800 degrees C, which decreases by approximately 86.07% compared with that of LSN. In addition, the fuel electrode-supported single cell with LSNCu0.25 air electrode presents a high current density of 1.2 A cm-2 at 1.5 V under 30% CO-70% CO2 condition at 800 degrees C, which is 207% of LSN (0.58 A cm-2) under the same condition. Results show that the impressive catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is ascribed to the improved electronic conductivity and oxygen exchange capacity. With Cu substitution for Ni-site, the contraction of Ni-O bond in NiO6 octahedron and increased concentration of charge carries owing to the oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+ are beneficial to the electron conduction. The formation of more interstitial oxygen as ionic compensation also favors the oxygen ion diffu-sion/exchange and greatly accelerates the charge transfer process. Furthermore, no degradation is observed for the single cell durability test at 750 degrees C for 50 h, which demonstrates the highly stable performance of LSNCu0.25 air electrode for electrolysis of CO2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000864517900002

Interaction of oxygen and water vapor with rhenium								Physics, Chemistry and Mechanics of Surfaces				2	6			1810	28						1985	1985	The methods of thermal desorption mass spectrometry with the use of isotopes and field emission microscopy have been employed to study the adsorption of oxygen and water vapor on rhenium single crystal tips and polycrystalline wire over the temperature range 78-1600K. At T<300K oxygen is adsorbed in the molecular and dissociative forms. It is shown that the low-temperature adsorption of O2 on oxidized rhenium is attended by the appearance of an additional form of molecular oxygen that is stable at room temperature. The adsorption of H2O in the molecular form at 78K reduces the work function by 1.0 eV. The dissociation of H2Oad with the evolution of H2 and the formation of a stable oxygen coverage begins at T>200K. The corrosive oxidation of rhenium in O2 or H2O occurs at T>900K.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0734-1520			INSPEC:2469617

The increase in the number of active sites by tuning the morphology and structure and the enhancement of the reactivity of active sites by the incorporation of other components are the two main strategies for the enhancement of their catalytic performance. In this study, by combining these two strategies, a unique three-dimensional nanoporous Fe-Co oxyhydroxide layer coated on the carbon cloth (3D-FeCoOH/CC) was successfully synthesized by in situ electro-oxidation methods, and directly used as a working electrode. The electrode, 3D-FeCoOOH/CC, was obtained by the Fe doping process in (NH4)(2)Fe(SO4)(2), followed by continuous in situ electro-oxidization in alkaline medium of "micro go chess piece" arrays on the carbon cloth (MCPAs/CC). Micro characterizations illustrated that the go pieces of MCPAs/CC were completely converted into a thin conformal coating on the carbon cloth fibers. The electrochemical test results showed that the as-synthesized 3D-FeCoOOH/CC exhibited enhanced activity for OER with a low overpotential of 259 mV, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a small Tafel slope of 34.9 mV dec-1, as well as superior stability in 1.0 mol KOH solution. The extensive analysis revealed that the improved electrochemical surface area, conductivity, Fe-Co bimetallic composition, and the unique 3D porous structure together contributed to the enhanced OER activity of 3D-FeCoOOH/CC. Furthermore, the synthetic strategy applied in this study could be extended to fabricate a series of Co-based electrode materials with the dopant of other transition elements.

In this work, for the first time we report oxygen self-doping of solvothermally synthesized g-C3N4 nanospheres with tunable electronic band structure via ambient air exposure for unprecedentedly enhanced photocatalytic performance. Various measurements, such as XPS, Mott-Schottky plots, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that such oxygen doping can tune the intrinsic electronic state and band structure of g-C(3)N(4)via the formation of C-O-C bond. Our results show that the oxygen doping content can be controlled by the copolymerization of the precursors. As a consequence, the oxygen doped g-C3N4 shows excellent photocatalytic performance, with an RhB photodegradation rate of 0.249 min(-1) and a hydrogen evolution rate of 3174 mol h(-1) g(-1), >35 times and approximate to 4 times higher than that of conventional thermally made pure g-C3N4 (0.007 min(-1) and 846 mol h(-1) g(-1), respectively) under visible light.

Degradation reactions were carried out in batch, at 25 degreesC, in the absence of oxygen, by contacting electrolytic iron powder (size range: 20-50 mum) with a triallate aqueous solution (2.5 mg l(-1)). Herbicide decay, corresponding evolutions of TOC, TOX and chloride ion release were regularly monitored throughout the reactions. Furthermore, the main degradation by-products were identified by HPLC/MS. The results showed that, after 5 days, herbicide degradation extent was about 97% and that the reaction proceeded through the formation of a dechlorinated alkyne by-product (S-2-propinyl di-isopropyl thiocarbamate) resulting from the complete dechlorination of triallate. The subsequent reduction of such an alkyne intermediate gave S-allyl di-isopropyl thiocarbamate as main end by-product. The identified by-products suggested that dechlorination took place mainly via reductive P-elimination. However, as traces of dichloroallyl di-isopropyl thiocarbamate were also detected, a role, although minor, was assigned even to hydrogenolysis in the overall dechlorination process.

The anionic surfactant dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium salt (AOT) can act as the soft template to build the novel Cu2O-based microstructure. The ascorbic acid serves as reductant and etching agent in the Cu2O growing process. The facet etching of Cu2O and reduction of GO can take place simultaneously in the reaction system. The concave cubes Cu2O with average edge length of similar to 1.55 mu m were well-dispersed on the surface of RGO. The Cu2O-RGO (2wt%) heterojunction exhibited superior photocatalytic performance and recyclability with the highest amount of H-2 yields of 64.3 mu mol/g, which was fivefold more than the pure Cu2O (12.8 mu mol/g). The enhanced photocatalytic performances were attributed to the oxygen vacancies in Cu2O and a flexible conducting channel supported by RGO. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of Cu2O and graphene caused broader absorption in visible light region and lower recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. It is believed that the Cu2O-RGO heterojunction could provide an alternative method to design excellent photocatalysts for energy application.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000467435300096		
J	Marta, M.								Experimental study of the N-14(p, gamma)O-15 reaction at high and low energies								PROGRESS IN PARTICLE AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS				66	2			303	308		10.1016/j.ppnp.2011.01.025				APR 2011	2011	The N-14(p, gamma)O-15 reaction controls the rate of the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle of stellar hydrogen burning. The reaction proceeds by capture to the ground state and several excited states in O-15. Several studies of this reaction have recently been performed in the low energy range 150 < E-p < 500 keV and only one set of data from an experiment performed in 1987 extends up to 3 MeV. In order to obtain a reliable extrapolation of the excitation curve to astrophysical energy, R-matrix fits need data covering the widest possible range of energy. In a first phase, the experimental investigation has been performed at the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA) 400 kV accelerator in an energy range that sensitively tests such fits, placed deep underground in the Gran Sasso facility in Italy, using a composite germanium detector. In a second phase, the reaction has been studied at the high-current FZDTandetron in Dresden (Germany), in the energy region from 0.6 to 2.5 MeV. The astrophysical motivation, setup, and data analysis are presented. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0146-6410	1873-2224		WOS:000289600900022

J	Ge, Lihong; Lai, Wei; Deng, Yilin; Bao, Jian; Ouyang, Bo; Li, Huaming								Spontaneous Dissolution of Oxometalates Boosting the Surface Reconstruction of CoMOx (M = Mo, V) to Achieve Efficient Overall Water Splitting in Alkaline Media								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				61	5			2619	2627		10.1021/acs.inorgchem.1c03677				FEB 7 2022	2022	Bimetallic materials have been regarded as promising catalysts for efficient alkaline water splitting. However, the spontaneous reconstruction of the surface structures of the catalysts before catalysis has long been overlooked. Here, we present that in situ dissolution of MoO42- in CoMoO4 boosts spontaneous surface reconstruction in an alkaline medium. Our results reveal that CoMoO4 microrod arrays function as precatalysts that undergo spontaneous surface reconstruction under alkaline conditions, forming a layer of Co3O4/CoMoO4 and CoOOH/CoMoO4 heterostructures. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) combined with in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that in such activated CoMoO4 (A-CoMoO4), the partial electron transfer from Co to Mo sites helps induce a higher valence state of Co centers and the heterostructure of Co3O4/CoMoO4 may promote the generation of CoOOH, which is very likely the precursor to the active Co4+ species for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis. During the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Co3O4 generated after surface reconstruction can promote the dissociation of water, which is considered the rate-determining step of the alkaline HER. Hence, A-CoMoO4 exhibits superior bifunctional electrocatalytic activities that the overpotentials at a working current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER are only 13 and 264 mV, respectively. Inspired by the remarkable bifunctionality, the electrolytic cell employing A-CoMoO4 as both anode and cathode shows an appealing potential of 1.51 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting. Similarly, CoVOx also shows the spontaneous surface reconstruction behavior in the alkaline medium, which we propose can be extended to a series of oxometalate catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000766209800025	35067052

Since iridium is both expensive and scarce, the future practical application of this process makes it essential to reduce IrO2 loading on the anodes of PEM water electrolysers. In the present study an approach to utilising a suitable electrocatalyst support was followed. Of the materials selected from a literature review, TaC has proved to be stable under the conditions of the accelerated stability test proposed in this study. The test involved dispersing each potential support material in a mixture of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMSA) and hydrogen peroxide at 130 degrees C. The liquid phase was subsequently analysed using ICP-MS with respect to the occurrence of ions potentially originating from the support material tested. The TaC support selected was additionally characterised by thermogravimmetric and differential thermal analysis to prove its thermal stability. A modified version of the Adams fusion method was used to deposit IrO2 on the support surface. A series of electrocatalysts was prepared with a composition of (IrO2)(x)(TaC)(1-x), where x represents the mass fraction of IrO2 and was equal to 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 and 1. The thin-film method was used for electrochemical characterisation of the electrocatalysts prepared. SEM-EDX analysis, X-ray diffraction, N-2 adsorption (BET) and powder conductivity measurements were used as complementary techniques to complete characterisation of the electrocatalysts prepared. The electrocatalysts with x >= 0.5 showed stable specific activity. This result is consistent with the conductivity measurements. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

However, their practical application is hindered by low energy efficiency, sluggish kinetics, and a reliance on catalysts for the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER). In a superoxide battery, oxygen is also used as the cathodic active medium but is reduced only to superoxide (O-2(center dot-)), the anion formed by adding an electron to a diatomic oxygen molecule. Therefore, O-2/O-2(center dot-) is a unique single-electron ORR/OER process. Since the introduction of K-O-2 batteries by our group in 2013, superoxide batteries based on potassium superoxide (KO2) have attracted increasing interest as promising energy storage devices due to their significantly lower overpotentials and costs. We have selected potassium for building the superoxide battery because it is the lightest alkali metal cation to form the thermodynamically stable superoxide (KO2) product. This allows the battery to operate through the proposed facile one-electron redox process of O-2/KO2. This strategy provides an elegant solution to the long-lasting kinetic challenge of ORR/OER in metal-oxygen batteries without using any electrocatalysts. Over the past five years, we have been focused on understanding the electrolyte chemistry, especially at the electrode/electrolyte interphase, and the electrolyte's stability in the presence of potassium metal and superoxide. In this Account, we examine our advances and understanding of the chemistry in superoxide batteries, with an emphasis on our systematic investigation of K-O-2 batteries. We first introduce the K metal anode electrochemistry and its corrosion induced by electrolyte decomposition and oxygen crossover. Tuning the electrolyte composition to form a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is demonstrated to alleviate electrolyte decomposition and O-2 cross-talk. We also analyze the nucleation and growth of KO2 in the oxygen electrode, as well its long-term stability. The electrochemical growth of KO2 on the cathode is correlated with the rate performance and capacity. Increasing the surface area and reducing the O-2 diffusion pathway are identified as critical strategies to improve the rate performance and capacity. Li-O-2 and Na-O-2 batteries are further compared with the KO2 chemistry regarding their pros and cons. Because only KO2 is thermodynamically stable at room temperature, K-O-2 batteries offer reversible cathode reactions over the long-term while the counterparts undergo disproportionation. The parasitic reactions due to the reactivity of superoxide are discussed. With the trace side products quantified, the overall superoxide electrochemistry is highly reversible with an extended shelf life. Lastly, potential anode substitutes for K-O-2 batteries are reviewed, including the K3Sb alloy and liquid Na-K alloy. We conclude with perspectives on the future development of the K metal anode interface, as well as the electrolyte and cathode materials to enable improved reversibility and maximized power capability. We hope this Account promotes further endeavors into the development of the K-O-2 chemistry and related material technologies for superoxide battery research.									69	6	1	0	1	0	71			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000445441200045	30178665

Moreover, the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution from pure water was investigated under UV light irradiation. The peanut-shaped nanoparticles exhibited a much higher photocatalytic activity compared to SrSnO3 powder synthesized by a solid-state reaction.

However, a more industrially viable alternative to the argon plasma desulfurization process is needed. In this work, we introduce a scalable route towards generating S-vacancies on the MoS2 basal plane using electrochemical desulfurization. Even though sulfur atoms on the basal plane are known to be stable and inert, we find that they can be electrochemically reduced under accessible applied potentials. This can be done on various 2H-MoS2 nanostructures. By changing the applied desulfurization potential, the extent of desulfurization and the resulting activity can be varied. The resulting active sites are stable under extended desulfurization durations and show consistent HER activity.									434	16	0	0	28	0	434			2041-1723			WOS:000399985300001	28429782

Within this two-dimensional plane, we quantitatively detail the range of core masses at various stages of evolution, mass locations of the main nuclear burning shells, electron fraction profiles, mass fraction profiles, burning lifetimes, stellar lifetimes, and compactness parameter at core collapse for models with and without mass-loss. Up to carbon burning, we generally find that mass resolution has a larger impact on the variations than the number of isotopes, while the number of isotopes plays a more significant role in determining the span of the variations for neon, oxygen, and silicon burning. Choice of mass resolution dominates the variations in the structure of the intermediate convection zone and secondary convection zone during core and shell hydrogen burning, respectively, where we find that a minimum mass resolution of approximate to 0.01 M-circle dot is necessary to achieve convergence in the helium core mass at the approximate to 5% level. On the other hand, at the onset of core collapse, we find approximate to 30% variations in the central electron fraction and mass locations of the main nuclear burning shells, a minimum of approximate to 127 isotopes is needed to attain convergence of these values at the approximate to 10% level.									68	0	0	0	0	0	68			0067-0049	1538-4365		WOS:000390795900002		
J	Bader, KP; Schuler, J								Inhibition of the photosynthetic electron transport by pyrethroid insecticides in cell cultures and thylakoid suspensions from higher plants								ZEITSCHRIFT FUR NATURFORSCHUNG C-A JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES				51	9-10			721	728						SEP-OCT 1996	1996	Synthetic pyrethroid insecticides with different molecular structures have been investigated with respect to their effect on photosynthetic electron transport reactions in chloroplast suspensions and cell cultures from higher plants. The fluorescence induction curves of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves and tomato cells were substantially affected by permethrin and cypermethrin resulting in a strong increase of the maximum fluorescence. Application of different concentrations (0.3-1.2 mM) of the respective chemical abolishes virtually any kinetics of the normal Kautsky effect. Oxygen evolution from cell cultures from tomato (Lycopersicon peruvianum) was completely inhibited by cypermethrin. Analysis of partial reactions of the photosynthetic electron transport showed that both a methylviologen-mediated Mehler reaction and a ferricyanide-driven Hill reaction were quantitatively inhibited by e.g. fenvalerate. On the other hand, neither a silicomolybdate-driven Hill reaction nor a methylviologen-driven Mehler reaction using dichlorophenol indophenol/ascorbate as electron donors could be inhibited by the pyrethroid. The analyses suggest that pyrethroid insecticides interfere with the photosynthetic electron transport al the same site as urea-type herbicides do. Depending on the molecular structure and on the halogen compound in the molecule, however, different pyrethroids are more or less phytotoxic to the investigated photosynthetic membranes - cypermethrin with two Cl-substituents requires much higher concentrations to be applied for significant inhibition of the electron transport reactions than the Br-derivative deltamethrin does. Moreover, qualitative differences have to be taken into account. In the case of fenvalerate the effect seems to exist in a type of all-or-nothing reaction when the reaction centres are inhibited by the pyrethroid. None of the S-states nor the transition probabilities are specifically influenced by increasing concentrations of fenvalerate. In the case of deltamethrin, however, it was found that the overreduced state S--1 is significantly increased at the expense of both S-1 and S-0. Moreover, the miss parameter alpha is increased in the case of deltamethrin addition. The results and the significance of different substituents for the investigated pyrethroids are discussed.									4	0	0	0	5	0	6			0939-5075			WOS:A1996VP57200017

Herein, a new way is reported to tune the performance of perovskitetype materials as oxygen reduction electrodes by embedding anions (F-) in oxygen sites. The obtained perovskite oxyfluorides SrFeO(3-sigma-delta)dF(sigma) and SrFe0.9Ti0.1O3-sigma-delta F sigma (sigma = 0.05 and 0.10) show improved electrocatalytic activity compared to their parent oxides, achieving area specific resistance values of 0.875, 0.393, and 0.491 Omega cm(2) for SrFeO3-delta, SrFeO2.95-delta F0.05, and SrFeO2.90-delta F0.10, respectively, at 600 degrees C in air. Such improved performance is a result of the improved bulk diffusion and surface exchange properties due to anion doping. Moreover, favorable stability in performance is also demonstrated for the F- anion-doped perovskites as oxygen reduction electrodes at 650 degrees C for a test period of approximate to 200 h.

The waste had low organic content, and ignition loss was about 9%. It is considered that the sufficient input of rain water and aerobe activity promoted the reaction of organic matter with dissolved oxygen in the rain water, yielding water-soluble fatty acids that were readily consumed by anaerobes. The fatty acids were transported to deeper anaerobic region by entrainment infiltrating rain water. Accumulation of fatty acids is related to the evolution of high concentration of hydrogen sulfide. Lactic acid and pyruvic acid were not found in regions of high concentration of hydrogen sulfide, but existed in regions of low concentration of hydrogen sulfide. Evolution of high concentration of hydrogen sulfide requires a continuous supply of sulfate ion at this site. Sulfate ion mainly comes from gypsum plaster boards. Sulfide content at ground surface, which was the upper part of the region of high concentration of hydrogen sulfide, was 0.2 mg/g (dry earth), indicating that hydrogen sulfide did not ascend from the deeper anaerobic region to the surface.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0369-4577			WOS:000173235000007

This study analyses thirteen homogeneous Ru-based catalysts-some, the most active catalysts studied: the Ru(tpy-R)(QC) and Ru(tpy-R)(4-pic)(2) complexes, where tpy is 2,2';6',2"terpyridine, QC is 8-quinolinecarboxylate and 4-pic is 4-picoline. Typical relationships studied among heterogenous catalysts cannot be applied to homogeneous catalysts. The selected group of structurally similar catalysts with impressive catalytic activity deserves closer computational and statistical analysis of multiple reaction step energetics correlating with measured catalytic activity. We report general methods of LFESR analysis yield insufficiently robust relationships between descriptor variables. However, volcano-plot-based analysis grounded in Sabatier's principle reveals ideal relative energies of the Ru-IV = O and Ru-IV-OH intermediates and optimal changes in free energies of water nucleophilic attack on Ru-V = O. A narrow range of Ru-IV-OH to Ru-V = O redox potentials corresponding with the highest catalytic activities suggests facile access to the catalytically competent high-valent Ru-V = O state, often inaccessible from Ru-IV = O. Our work incorporates experimental oxygen evolution rates into approaches of LFESR and Sabatier-principle-based analysis, identifying a narrow yet fertile energetic landscape to bountiful oxygen evolution activity, leading to future rational design.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000846175000001

Enhanced electronic conduction, extended light absorption, enhanced HER reaction kinetics and benign photothermal performance were verified by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental studies. Vis-NIR light-enhanced electrocatalytic HER was accomplished with a small overpotential of 52 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)) and a low Tafel slope of 37 mV dec(-1) and performed much more efficiently than that in darkness, comparable to the noble-metal catalysts (Pt, Pt/C). Moreover, the resultant WO3-OVs possess good photothermal conversion efficiency. The promising potential of the WO3-OVs for anticancer photothermal therapy has been demonstrated with a high photothermal conversion efficiency (similar to 41.6%) upon single wavelength near-infrared irradiation and an efficient tumor inhibition rate (similar to 96.8%). This design of photoelectronic/thermal materials paves an exciting new avenue for the conversion of well-developed metal oxides to be high-performance and multifunctional materials for energy and oncology applications.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000512634500026	31556902

In this work, we present a controllable structural transformation engineering strategy to construct 3D hierarchical CoP porous microscale prism-like superstructure (assembled with nanoflakes) arrays grown on surface-phosphatized Ni foam (CoP/SPNF). Specifically, Zn/Co-based composite arrays with a nanowires@prism hierarchical structure were prepared on Ni foam first. Then, porous Co-based compound arrays with a nanoflakes@prism hierarchical structure were obtained through removing the Zn-based compound by alkaline etching. Finally, CoP arrays were produced through phosphatization of the prepared Co-based array precursor, using NaH2PO2 center dot H2O as the P source. The fabricated CoP/SPNF electrocatalyst exhibits impressive bifunctional performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, overpotential of 45 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER, overpotential of 215 mV at 80 mA cm(-2)) and consequently enables efficient electrolytic water splitting with a low cell voltage of 1.547 V at 30 mA cm(-2) and a prominent durability. Versatile CoP with its porous superstructure arrays on surface-phosphatized Ni foam can increase the exposure of electrochemically active sites and render easy contact with the electrolyte, thus facilitating fast electron transport and effective electrolyte diffusion during the electrocatalytic process, as well as promoting the release of product gas bubbles from the electrode. This work provides an effective strategy for the design and preparation of non-noble-metal bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting electrolysis.									26	1	0	0	1	0	26			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000541873600069	32463675

The intricate phase transitions upon electrochemical cycling constrain the high-rate performances of the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode. The formation of the rocksalt-like phase causes the diffusion of Li ions asymmetric in the lithiation and delithiation reactions. The evolution of multiple cubic phases results in poor diffusivity of Li ions in the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4. High-resolution XRD scans on the chemically delithiated samples reveal that the intricate phase transitions are effectively suppressed in Cr-doped LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4. The suppression of phase transitions not only enhances the Li ions' diffusivity inside the lattice, but also stabilizes the charge transfer interfaces by reducing lattice mismatch and alleviating structural stress during the lithiation and delithiation. Consequently, the improvement on structure evolution endows the LiNi(0.5)Mn(1.5)O(4 )with enhanced diffusion coefficient of Li ions, larger accessible capacity, and improved Coulombic efficiency.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000449888600010

Herein, a carambola-like CoWO4 microsphere with preferred crystal planes and oxygen vacancies is synthesized by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal process together with post annealing treatment. The in-depth observation on microstructure and electrochemical tests suggest that it is the new preferred crystal planes and oxygen vacancies in CoWO4 that improves conductivity and reaction activity to lead to a much higher capacity. Further density functional theory (DFT) analysis reveals that tuning the preferred crystal plane and introduction of oxygen vacancy into CoWO4 not only effectively enhance electronic conductivity, but also promote OH- adsorption/desorption, and reduce electronic transmission barrier. As a result, the as-obtained carambola-like CoWO4 microsphere with preferred crystal planes and oxygen vacancies delivers high specific capacity (493.7 C g(-1)/137.1 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)) with superior rate capability (148.6 C g(-1)/41.3 mA h g(-1) at 15 A g(-1)). Moreover, the cycling-induced morphology evolution lead to unconventional capacity increasing during cycling. The as-fabricated A-CoWO4//6 M KOH//activated carbon (AC) BSH device exhibits a maximum energy density of 27.5 Wh kg(-1) at 1031.4 W kg(-1) and 95.7% capacity retention after 12000 cycles.

However, the oxygen challenge hypothesis often ignores the effect of known phenotypic plastic responses. These can occur on either a within- or multigenerational scale, where multiple reactions act in concert to increase oxygen supply in response to increased temperature in a wide range of traits (molecular, egg content, behavioural, cell structure, morphological). Here, we combine a novel modelling approach with empirical measurements that enable quantification of how both the oxygen supply (maximum oxygen diffusion rate) and demand (metabolic rate) are affected by temperature while allowing for phenotypic plasticity. We exposed the aquatic ectotherm Daphnia magna to a range of temperatures (17-28 degrees C) over several asexual generations and confirm that phenotypic plasticity contributes to an increased ability to obtain oxygen on the whole-organism level at high temperatures. This response is strongest within the highest temperature range (22-28 degrees C), where the change in oxygen challenge is expected to be most pronounced. However, the observed thermal plasticity in oxygen supply failed to compensate for the increased demand. Thus, we provide empirical evidence that the oxygen challenge in aquatic ectotherms increases with increasing temperature, even in the presence of phenotypic plasticity in oxygen supply.

Herein, Co3O4@Ni3Se4 core-shell nanorod arrays on nickel foam (Co3O4@Ni3Se4/NF) are successfully synthesized as long-term and efficient bi-functional catalysts for water splitting in 1.0 M KOH. The satisfactory Co3O4@Ni3Se4/NF catalyst exhibits excellent activity with low overpotentials of 260 mV and 180 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively. In addition, its overpotential is only higher than the initial overpotential within 10 mV when the Co3O4@Ni3Se4/NF has been used after 30 hours at OER and HER. Significantly, the cell based on bi-functional Co3O4@Ni3Se4/NF||Co3O4@Ni3Se4/NF couple shows a low potential of 1.735 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte and remains a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for 30 hours without serious attenuation, indicating that the as-prepared catalyst has huge potential in practical water splitting.									9	2	0	0	0	0	9			2199-692X			WOS:000470028700016

The Si1+, Si2+ and Si3+ species rapidly increased in the low O2 dose and then gradually decreased. However, the Si4+ species continuously increased with increasing the O2 exposure. Furthermore, the Si4+ species increased with increasing the incident O2 energy, thus the formation of SiO2 layers with the thickness up to ~0.6 nm was precisely controlled by the O2 incident energy.

Scientists have suggested that ultraviolet degradation of folate in vivo played a role in the evolution of mankind. In order to better understand the photodegradation of folate, we have provided a spectroscopic study of the ultraviolet photodegradation of aqueous folic acid under aerobic conditions. We found strong indications that the folic acid molecule is cleaved into p-aminobenzoyl-L-glutamic acid and 6-formyl pterin when exposed to ultraviolet radiation. When the irradiation continues, 6-formyl pterin is degraded to pterin-6-carboxylic acid. The photodegradation of folic acid is divided into three phases. In the first phase, the formation of photoproducts follows a zero order rate law. In the second phase the presence of photoproducts sensitizes the degradation of folic acid and the degradation process is accelerated. In the third phase the degradation of 6-formyl pterin to pterin-6-carboxylic acid is the dominating process. This reaction follows a first order rate law. We show that both 6-formyl pterin and pterin-6-carboxylic acid sensitize the photodegradation of folic acid. However, experiments performed in heavy water indicate that generation of singlet oxygen is probably not the explanation for the photosensitizing of folic acid. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The application of the obtained holey TiO1_xNx nanosheets as immobilization substrates allowed to maximize mass electrocatalytic activity of hybridized Pt nanoclusters via enhanced interfacial interaction at defective sites. The strong electronic coupling between positively-charged Pt nanoclusters and holey TiO1_xNx nanosheets with interfacial oxygen linkers enabled to achieve a superior electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction with an unusually high gravimetric efficiency (20.8 AmgPt_ 1), i.e., one of the most efficient values for Pt nanostructures. Density functional theory calculations and in-situ Raman analysis emphasize the significant contributions of interfacial oxygen linker in holey TiO1_xNx substrates and positive charge of Pt nanocluster to optimizing the electrocatalytic activity. The present study underscores that employing composition-controlled holey TiO1_xNx nanosheets as immobilization substrates provides a novel efficient methodology to explore high-performance electrocatalysts via the improvement of charge/mass transport and electrocatalytic kinetics, and the optimization of d-band center upon hybridization.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000779661700002

Valence band engineering is possible by forming ternary oxides using the combination of a metal cation with an s(2)d(10) electronic configuration and a transition metal oxide with a d(0) configuration. Many (Sn2+, Bi3+, Pb2+)-based ternary metal oxide photocatalysts have been reported for hydrogen and/or oxygen evolution under visible irradiation. Sn2+-based materials have attracted particular attention because tin is inexpensive, abundant and more environmentally friendly than lead or bismuth. In this review, we provide a fruitful library for Sn2+-based photocatalysts that have been reported to evolve hydrogen using sacrificial reagents, including SnNb2O6, Sn2Nb2O7, SnTaxNb2-xO6, SnTa2O6, Sn2Ta2O7, SnWO4 (alpha and beta phases), SnSb2O6 center dot nH(2)O, and Sn2TiO4.

One of these tyrosine radicals, D., is stable and has an unknown function. The other redox-active tyrosine, Z, acts to transfer oxidizing equivalents from the primary chlorophyll donor of photosystem II to the manganese cluster, where water oxidation occurs. In an attempt to obtain more information about Z and its interaction with its environment, we have begun a study using Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) vibrational spectroscopy. To facilitate these studies, we have developed a procedure to isolate spinach photosystem II complexes with an antenna size of approximately 100-110 chlorophylls per reaction center. These complexes show an approximately 2-fold increase in the specific activity of oxygen evolution over the activity of the starting material, photosystem II membranes. Although fully solubilized in detergent, these complexes retain the 24- and 18-kDa extrinsic proteins and exhibit no calcium chloride requirement for optimal oxygen evolution. In manganese-depleted photosystem II samples, Z. can be accumulated in the light. In the dark, the tyrosine radical is reduced and reprotonated to form the neutral tyrosine. Since this process is reversible and light-dependent, we have used light-minus-dark difference FT-IR spectroscopy to observe the vibrational difference spectrum that is associated with the oxidation of this residue. As a control, EPR spectra were measured under identical conditions to assess the amount of Z. that accumulated in the light. We also hope to use difference FT-IR to identify the amino acid with which Z may form a hydrogen bond. As a first step, we have obtained the difference FT-IR spectrum associated with protonation of the imidazole ring of histidine in vitro. This spectrum allows us to assess the contribution that such a protonation would have on the in vivo difference spectrum.									77	2	0	0	46	0	78			0006-2960			WOS:A1992JT51800043	1327128

Electrochemical studies of optimized NiCo2O4 and CoNi2S4 revealed the respective specific capacitance of 767.067 F/g and 648.11 F/g at scan rate of 10 mVs(-1) in 1 M KOH electrolyte solution. Furthermore, the current density of 331 and 159 mAg(-1) was achieved for the best performed NiCo2O4 and CoNi2S4 electrodes with improved electrical conductivity. The stability over 12 h of highly performed NiCo2O4 nanospheres has been reported. This work suggested a viable and optimized approach to synthesize Ni and Co based oxide and sulfide nanospheres for efficient electrochemical water oxidation.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			2365-6549			WOS:000490895800035		
J	Leplan, H; Robic, JY; Pauleau, Y								Kinetics of residual stress evolution in evaporated silicon dioxide films exposed to room air								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				79	9			6926	6931		10.1063/1.361517				MAY 1 1996	1996	Deposition of silicon dioxide thin films on silicon, germanium, and glass substrates has been accomplished by electron gun evaporation under various experimental conditions. The level of compressive residual stresses in evaporated SiO2 films determined just after deposition of films on Si or Ge substrates and the mass density of silica were found to be dependent on the substrate temperature and-oxygen partial pressure in the evaporation chamber. Moreover, the intensity of compressive residual stresses decreased linearly as the logarithm of the exposure time of films to room air (aging time) was increased. After a compressive-tensile stress transition observed at a given aging time for films with relatively low densities, the intensity of tensile stresses continued to increase progressively with increasing aging time. The relative variation of residual stresses in SiO2 films was dependent on the mass density of the deposited material. Since the intensity of the absorption band of Si-OH radicals in the infrared spectra of SiO2 films exposed to room air increased with increasing aging time, the evolution of residual stresses was attributed to the effect of the hydration of silica by water vapor contained in room air. A reaction mechanism involving the physical adsorption of water vapor molecules on the SiO2 surface and reaction between adspecies and Si-O-Si species is proposed and discussed to interpret the logarithmic kinetics of residual stress evolution in evaporated SiO2 films exposed to room air.

Herein, different graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-based van der Waals (vdW) type II homojunctions have been fabricated and g-C3N4/K-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets have an outstanding PC-HER rate of 1,243 mu mol-h(-1).g(-1) under visible light, higher than that of bulk g-C3N4, doped g-C3N4 nanosheets, and mixed nanosheets. The enhanced PC-HER performance can be ascribed to the cooperative effects of the shortened bandgap, enlarged specific surface area, matched type II energy band structure, "face to face" vdW charge interaction, and peculiarly partite positions of the conduction and valence bands in different layers. Besides, the type II junctions were found superior to binary type II junction. This study highlights the synergistic effect of different strategies in improving the PC-HER capacities of g-C3N4, especially the application of particular vdW junctions, and provides new insights to the structures and mechanism.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000681564700008

The range in stellar mass over which this occurs is very narrow and the interior evolutionary characteristics vary rapidly over this range. Consequently, while those stars with larger masses (similar to 11 M-circle dot) are likely to undergo electron-capture accretion induced collapse, those models with smaller masses (8.5 less than or similar to M/M-circle dot less than or similar to 10.5) will presumably form massive (M greater than or similar to 1.1 M-circle dot) white dwarfs. The final outcome depends sensitively on the adopted mass-loss rates, the chemical composition of the massive envelopes, and on the adopted prescription for convective mixing.					281st Symposium of the International-Astronomical-Union281st Symposium of the International-Astronomical-Union	JUL 04-08, 2011JUL 04-08, 2011	INAF; City Padova; Univ Padova, Dept Astronomy; INAF Padova Observ; ANEMOSINAF; City Padova; Univ Padova, Dept Astronomy; INAF Padova Observ; ANEMOS	Padova, ITALYPadova, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1743-9213	1743-9221	978-1-107-01981-2	WOS:000316706100014		
J	Wang, Qiang; Wang, Yan					Wang, Yan/0000-0003-1060-2956			Overcoming the Limiting Step of Fe2O3 Reduction via in Situ Sulfide Modification								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				8	16			10334	10342		10.1021/acsami.6b01737				APR 27 2016	2016	Iron-based alkaline batteries are extremely attractive due to iron's environmental friendliness, and low cost. The parasitic reaction of H-2 evolution and the poor electrical conductivity of the discharge products are among the major barriers for the commercialization of these batteries. In this paper, we first show that O2- diffusion inside the solid Fe2O3 particles is the rate-limiting step in the reduction reaction. In situ sulfide modified Fe2O3, which has a core-shell structure verified by SEM, XRD and XPS analysis, has excellent electrical and ionic conductivity. The functional mechanism of sulfide in the reaction was identified as in the potential region around -1.071 V (vs Hg/HgO), the outside layer of Fe2O3 was reduced to amorphous FeS, which has good electrical conductivity and enlarges the electrochemical reaction interface. O2- diffusion inside the Fe2O3 particle is still the rate-limiting step. In the potential region around -1.15 V (vs He HgO), amorphous FeS ages to FeS (pyrrhotite), FeS2 (marcasite), and FeS0.9 (mackinawite), which have high electrical conductivity. FeS0.9 can also introduce vacancies into Fe2O3 particles, which can greatly enhance O2- diffusion and the ionic conductivity, and the surface reaction is the rate-limiting step. In summary, after in situ sulfide modification, the ohmic overpotential and ion diffusion overpotential for Fe2O3 reduction were significantly reduced. The reduction reaction rate increases 26 times and the discharge capacity of Fe2O3 electrode increases 78 times after sulfide modification.									24	0	0	0	2	0	24			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000375245100031	27023474

The optimized TiO2 (B)/RP and TiO2 (A)/RP heterostructure exhibits significantly enhanced photocatalytic performances, with HER rate reaching 11.4 and 5.3 mu mol h(-1), respectively. The optical absorption of TiO2 is significantly extended to the visible light region after decoration of RP. And more oxygen vacancies (V-o) were introduced by phosphorus doping in the TiO2 (B)/RP than TiO2 (A)/RP. The theoretical calculations illustrate the formation of V o can decrease the ratio of effective masses of electron to hole, which gives rise to promoted photoinduced charge separation and transfer. These results suggest that the boosted photocatalytic HER performance should be mainly attributed to the synergetic enhancement in light harvesting and charge separation enabled by RP deposition and P5+ doping.									115	5	0	0	14	0	115			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000474501500023

Research employing transition metal-based catalysts has progressed exponentially in recent years, resulting in catalysts with excellent activity and stability. Compared to other neighbour d-metals (Ni, Fe, Co, Cu) which receive proper preference, research on Zn, Mn, and Cr containing electrocatalysts for water electrolysis is limited. Chromium in general has received limited consideration but has begun to attract the attention of researchers in the past few years. This review provides a brief discussion and evaluation of different catalysts (oxides, hydroxides, nitrides, phosphides, sulphides, carbides, etc.) incorporating different phases of the Cr component, together with a perspective on the catalytic significance of using Cr as a co-catalyst for hydrogen evolution in alkaline media. With advancements in catalysis research, electroactivity and stability showcased by Cr-based catalysts, some even competitive against precious metal catalysts, can be lucrative solutions for H-2 generation.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000604176400002

For this study, a system with a high-speed video camera was developed, achieving in-situ observation of bubble generation on an electrode surface, monitoring an area of 1.02 mm(2) at 6000 frames per second. The relation between polarization curve (current density up to 3.0 A cm(-2)) and oxygen bubble generation behavior on nickel electrodes having cylindrical wires and rectangular wires of different sizes (100-300 mu m) was clarified. The generated bubbles slide upward, contacting the electrode surface and detaching at the top edge. Observations indicate that small electrodes have short bubble residence time and thin bubble covering layer on the electrode. As a result, the small electrode diameter contributes to smaller overpotential at high current density. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The bonding of PFPE chains, added in 1:1 and 2:1 weight ratios, on CNTs influences the dispersion of nanotubes in the UHMWPE matrix due to the non-polar nature of the polymer, facilitating the formation of nanofillers-rich conductive pathways and improving composites' electrical conductivity (two to five orders of magnitude more) in comparison to UHMWPE-based nanocomposites obtained with pristine CNTs. Electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM) was used to evaluate the morphological changes during cyclic voltammetry (CV). The decrease of the overpotential for hydrogen oxidation peaks in samples containing PFPE-functionalized CNTs and hydrogen production (approximately -1.0 V vs. SHE) suggests that these samples could find application in fuel cell technology as well as in hydrogen storage devices. Carbon black-containing composites were prepared for comparative study with CNTs containing nanocomposites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1996-1944		WOS:000866979600001	36234224

Herein, ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets with Al doping (Al-ZIS) were fabricated via a one-step solvothermal method with magnetic stirring and could realize stoichiometric H-2 and O-2 evolution in pure water. The introduction of Al atoms not only adjusted the electronic configuration and improved the carrier density of atomic layers but also accelerated the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers due to the formation of a domain electrostatic potential difference. Moreover, the positive charge enriched Al atoms are favorable for the adsorption of H2O molecules, which greatly boost the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process on the Al-ZIS nanosheets. As a result, the photocatalysts achieved average H-2 and O-2 evolution rates of 77.2 and 35.3 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), respectively, under visible-light irradiation and an apparent quantum yield (AQE) of 1.61% at 420 nm. This study provides new insights for introducing a heteroatom strategy to prepare other high-performance single-component photocatalysts for overall water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2052-1537		WOS:000806463200001

Here, via a "high-valence metal single-atom confinement" strategy, we effectively modify the valence band structure of the semiconductor photocatalyst toward a spontaneous photocatalytic water splitting in pure water. This asprepared Pt-II-C3N4 could achieve an efficient photocatalytic water splitting activity with the H-2 production rate up to similar to 140 mol g(-1) h(-1), about 10 times that of Pt nanoparticle-C3N4 (15 mu mol g(-1)h(-1)). Moreover, the unique Pt-II-C3N4 suspension in pure water exhibits an impressive quantum efficiency of 1.5% at 420 nm under visible light irradiation. Electronic structure characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the hybridization of Pt-II Sd and N 2p obviously downward shifts the valence band maximum level of Pt-II-C3N4 by 0.26 V relative to g-C3N4, which could significantly promote the reaction thermodynamics of oxygen evolution toward the high photocatalytic water splitting activity.									37	4	0	0	2	0	36			1932-7447			WOS:000445711100003

The gel-like films prepared from alcoholic solutions of the precursor salts (IrCl3.3H(2)O and TaCl5) onto titanium metal support were heated in an atmosphere containing 20% O-2 and 80% Ar up to 600degreesC. The liberation of the chlorinated species followed by the mass spectrometric ion intensity curves showed that the two oxide phases do not develop independently.The cracking of retained solvent, the combustion of organic surface species formed (and elemental carbon trapped in the film) was also followed by the MS curves. The formation of carbonyl- and carboxylate-type surface species connected to the noble metal were identified by Fourier transform infrared emission spectroscopy (IRES). These secondary processes-catalyzed by the noble metal-play an important role in the development of surface morphology of the films when used as anode materials in oxygen evolution reactions.

Here we report the development of inorganic CsPbBr3-based photoanodes for direct photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution from aqueous electrolytes. We use a commercial thermal graphite sheet and a mesoporous carbon scaffold to encapsulate CsPbBr3 as an inexpensive and efficient protection strategy. We achieve a record stability of 30 h in aqueous electrolyte under constant simulated solar illumination, with currents above 2 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE. We further demonstrate the versatility of our approach by grafting a molecular Ir-based water oxidation catalyst on the electrolyte-facing surface of the sealing graphite sheet, which cathodically shifts the onset potential of the composite photoanode due to accelerated charge transfer. These results suggest an efficient route to develop stable halide perovskite based electrodes for photoelectrochemical solar fuel generation.									80	4	1	0	3	0	81			2041-1723			WOS:000467370800002	31068590

Herein, using first principles simulations, we first proposed a novel and effective strategy for significantly enhancing the activity of the inert MoS2 surface using a graphene oxide (GO) support (MoS2/GOs). The chemical bonding of the functional groups (CH3 and NH2) on the MoS2-GO hybrid is stronger than that in freestanding MoS2 or MoS2-graphene. Upon increasing the oxygen group concentration or introducing N heteroatoms into the GO support, the stability of the chemically functionalized MoS2 is improved. Furthermore, use of GOs to support pristine and defective MoS2 with a S vacancy (S-MoS2) can greatly promote the HER activity of the basal plane. The catalytic activity of S-MoS2 is further enhanced by doping N into GOs; this results in a hydrogen adsorption free energy of almost zero (DGH = similar to -0.014 eV). The coupling interaction with the GO substrate reduces the p-type Schottky barrier heights (SBH) of S-MoS2 and modifies its electronic properties, which facilitate charge transfer between them. Our calculated results are consistent with the experimental observations. Thus, the present results open new avenues for the chemical functionalization of MoS2-based nanosheets and HER catalysts.									20	1	0	0	0	0	21			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000423019600054	29292808

Here, we develop a two-step approach to fabricate Cu-N-C single-atom catalysts with a uniform and well-defined Cu2+-N-4 structure that exhibits comparable activity and superior durability in comparison to Pt/C. By combining operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy with theoretical calculations, we unambiguously identify the dynamic evolution of Cu-N-4 to Cu-N-3 and further to HO-Cu-N-2 under ORR working conditions, which concurrently occurs with reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ and is driven by the applied potential. The increase in the Cu+/Cu2+ ratio with the reduced potential indicates that the low-coordinated Cu+-N-3 is the real active site, which is further supported by DFT calculations showing the lower free energy in each elemental step of the ORR on Cu+-N-3 than on Cu2+-N-4. These findings provide a new understanding of the dynamic electrochemistry on M-N-C catalysts and may guide the design of more efficient low-cost catalysts.									50	1	0	0	2	0	49			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000697286000018	34464109

The evolution of chemical state, surface crystallographic structure, surface topography, and the nature of desorption products were studied using electron diffraction, spectroscopy, and scanning probe microscopy. Exposure to atmosphere leads to decomposition of the surface in vacuum at similar to 300 degrees C, despite good crystalline order before annealing. At the same time, films annealed to 700 degrees C in an oxygen/ozone mixture (10 mTorr) followed by vacuum annealing show no evidence of decomposition below 600 degrees C. These results reveal that the surface stability of epitaxial SrRuO3 is strongly affected by the presence of surface contaminants after exposure to air. Vibrational spectroscopy identifies these contaminants as adsorbed hydrocarbons. Results are compared with thermodynamic calculations, and implications for oxide electronic device technology are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Here, carbon nanofiber-supported Co9S8 nanocrystals fully (F-Co9S8@MoS2/CNFs) and semi-wrapped (S-Co9S8@MoS2/CNFs) with interfaces were successfully synthesized. Interface engineering in Co9S8@MoS2 core shell structures leads to the formation of abundant Co-S-Mo nanointerfaces with remarkable charge transfer. Benefiting from the novel semi core-shell structure, S-Co9S8@MoS2/CNFs with exposed Co-S-Mo nanointerfaces display superior HER activity, requiring overpotentials of only 77 mV and 122 mV to achieve current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. Beyond that, S-Co9S8@MoS2/CNFs can afford a high current density of similar to 100 mA cm(-2) for at least 10 h with negligible degradation. The results indicate that the construction of the core-shell structure facilitates charge redistribution between Co9S8 and MoS2, inducing electron transfer from Co to Mo through Co-S-Mo nanointerfaces. This work indicates the vital effect of nanointerfaces for electrocatalytic HER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000658828800001

Herein, a simple and extensible method using ball milling and space-confinement pyrolysis is reported to prepare a series of transition metals and N-C catalysts (M-NLPC), which possess three-dimensional porous carbon substrates and dense active sites for efficient ORR. M-NLPC catalysts (especially Fe-NLPC) exhibit outstanding ORR activity with a half-wave potential (E-1/2, 0.88 V) in an alkaline medium, high stability, and strong methanol resistance. The M-N-4 sites are proven to be the active centers in M-NLPC by theoretical calculation, and methanol molecules are more likely to desorb than react on the Fe-N-4 sites, which is the origin of the inactivity for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Furthermore, Fe-NLPC was applied to membraneless alkaline direct methanol FC (DMFC) in practice, exhibiting outstanding performance. Meanwhile, the Fe-NLPC-based ZAB also shows excellent electrochemical performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0743-7463			WOS:000795901900018	35414176

A sublethal level of ROS sustains cell proliferation, differentiation and promotes tumor metastasis, while a drastic ROS burst directly induces apoptosis. Herein, surface-oxidized arsenene nanosheets (As/AsxOy NSs) with type II heterojunction are fabricated with efficient .O-2(-) and O-1(2) production and glutathione consumption through prolonging the lifetime of photo-excited electron-hole pairs. Moreover, the portion of AsxOy with oxygen vacancies not only catalyzes a Fenton-like reaction, generating .OH and O-2 from H2O2, but also inactivates main anti-oxidants to cut off the "retreat routes" of ROS. After polydopamine (PDA) and cancer cell membrane (M) coating, the engineered As/AsxOy@PDA@M NSs serve as an intelligent theranostic platform with active tumor targeting and long-term blood circulation. Given its narrow-band-gap-enabled in vivo fluorescence imaging properties, As/AsxOy@PDA@M NSs could be applied as an imaging-guided non-invasive and real-time nanomedicine for cancer therapy. Multifunctional materials with a number of effects are important for dealing with the complex environment in cancer therapy. Here, the authors report on surface-oxidized arsenene nanosheets coated with polydopamine and cancer cell membrane as a multi theranostic tumour targeting cancer therapy.									67	3	0	0	28	0	68			2041-1723			WOS:000684548700011	34362904

Characterization of the catalysts by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy confirms the formation of a single-phase 3DOM NiFe2O4 structure. Linear scanning voltammetry measurements reveal that Ketjen black (KB) carbon-supported 3DOM NiFe2O4 exhibits a decreased overpotential for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than commonly used KB. A reduction in both the ORR and OER overpotentials increases with the mean pore size of 3DOM NiFe2O4 materials. Importantly, Li-O-2 batteries with 3DOM NiFe2O4 materials as the cathode catalysts exhibit a significant enhancement in the discharge capacity, rate capability, and cyclability, and these performances increases with the mean pore size of 3DOM NiFe2O4 materials. For a Li-O-2 battery equipped with a 3DOM NiFe2O4 catalyst with a maximum mean pore size of 25.1 nm, a long cycling life of up to 100 cycles under the limiting capacity of 1000 mAh gC-1 is achieved, strongly indicating that the mesoporous size of the bifunctional catalysts plays a crucial role in enhancing the performance of Li-O-2 batteries. The combined use of 3DOM NiFe2O4 with a maximal pore size of 25.1 nm and a poly(vinylidene difluoride hexafluoropropylene) separator with a tuned pore structure further improves the Li-O-2 battery performance, highlighting the importance of the pore structure in the development of bifunctional catalysts and separators.									55	3	0	0	2	0	56			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000346326600047	25405827

Here, a hybrid of Fe doped CoSe2 incorporated in nitrogen doped carbon (Fe-CoSe2@NC) was synthesized by selenization of Fe3+-etched metal organic frameworks (ZIF-67). As a result of the electronic structure engineering and morphology design, the Fe-CoSe2@NC hybrid showed an enhanced HER performance with a low overpotential of -143 mV for 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of similar to 40 mV dec(-1). It also exhibited good stability and a high Faradiac efficiency. The enhanced HER activity might be owing to the increased active surface area due to Fe3+ ions etching. Moreover, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the improved HER activity of Fe-CoSe2 could be attributed to the favorable adsorption-desorption behavior and accelerated HER kinetics, which was induced by the doping of iron atoms into CoSe2. This work comes up with a valuable strategy in designing and improving advanced electrocatalysts.									48	0	0	0	2	0	48			2168-0485			WOS:000444924500066		
J	Hutchison, RS; Betts, SD; Yocum, CF; Barry, BA								Conformational changes in the extrinsic manganese stabilizing protein can occur upon binding to the photosystem II reaction center: An isotope editing and FT-IR study								BIOCHEMISTRY				37	16			5643	5653		10.1021/bi9724467				APR 21 1998	1998	Photosystem LI catalyzes the light-driven oxidation of water and reduction of plastoquinone in oxygenic photosynthesis. The manganese stabilizing protein (MSP) of photosystem II is an extrinsic subunit that plays an important role in catalytic activity. This subunit can be extracted and re-bound to the photosystem LT reaction center. Extraction is associated with decreased stability of manganese binding by the enzyme and by loss in high rates of oxygen evolution activity; reconstitution reverses these phenomena. Since little is known about the assembly of complex membrane proteins, we have employed isotope editing and vibrational spectroscopy to obtain information about any changes in secondary structure that occur in MSP upon functional reconstitution to photosystem II. The spectroscopic data obtained are consistent with substantial changes in conformation when MSP binds to photosystem II; approximately 30-40% of the peptide backbone undergoes a change in secondary structure. These conclusions were reached by comparing different aliquots, before and after binding, of the same (13)[C]MSP sample. Analysis of amide I band line shapes through Fourier deconvolution and nonlinear regression suggests that binding of MSP to photosystem II is associated with a decrease in random structure and an increase in beta-sheet content. We conclude that binding of MSP to the reaction center can induce folding of MSP. Our results also indicate that, in solution, MSP can sample a variety of conformational states, which differ in hydrogen bonding of the peptide backbone.									67	1	0	0	52	0	68			0006-2960			WOS:000073515500037	9548950

In this paper, characteristics of carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of carbonates in the mudstone from the borehole ZK309, ZK301, ZK311 and ZK004 were studied to discuss the geological evolution and sedimentary environment of the Nong Bok Formation in Laos. It is concluded that the carbonates are primarily authigenic according to analysis of mineral composition and carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of the mudstones. The result shows that the stable carbon isotope composition (delta~(13)C) slightly higher than -5.69 and the stable oxygen isotope composition (delta~(18)O) varying between -2.71 and -10.8, and the average value of delta~(13)C and delta~(18)O of the carbonates are -5.1 and -4.6 respectively in the mudstone. The multiple correlation coefficients R between delta~(13)C and delta~(18)O values for samples from the borehole ZK309 and ZK301 are lower than 0.7. Based on the carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions and correlations of delta~(13)C and delta~(18)O value, we conclude that the Nong Bok Formation is terrestrial facies. The average value of delta~(13)C are slightly higher than the threshold value of terrestrial carbonates (-5.69), it may due to the mudstones were reformed by brine after deposited. The brine might be generated from dissolution of the underlying salt rocks by meteoric water. This could decipher the abnormal sequence of salt rock deposition (sylvite overlies carnallite). Therefore the meteoric water played an important role in the changes of oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions of the carbonates in mudstones in the study area.			碳、氧同位素作为反映古沉积环境、成矿物源和水-岩反应等良好的稳定同位素指标,被广泛应用。通过对老挝龙湖钾盐矿区ZK309、ZK301、ZK311和ZK004四个钻孔农波组盐岩上覆泥岩碳、氧同位素组成的分析,讨论了盐岩上覆泥岩沉积的碳、氧同位素组成变化特征及其指示的沉积环境。经分析,所测碳、氧同位素基本代表了碳酸盐碳、氧同位素组成,初步推测这些碳酸盐均为当地自生,受后期改变很少,delta~(13)C和delta~(18)O平均值分别为-5.1和-4.6,其中delta~(13)C值略高于一般陆相碳酸盐碳同位素最大值-5.69, delta~(18)O值介于-2.71~-10.8之间, ZK309和ZK301钻孔碳、氧同位素相关系数均小于0.7,初步指示盐岩沉积之后沉积环境为陆相。delta~(13)C值略高于-5.69,推测是后期盐岩层被淋滤,泥岩层受淋滤后的残余卤水影响的结果,这也解释了蒸发岩沉积层序异常(钾石盐覆盖于光卤石之上)的沉积特征。因此,在本研究中,大气水在泥岩碳、氧同位素的变化中扮演了重要角色。						0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1001-1552			CSCD:5433472

Measurement periods as little as 4 h could easily discriminate between CO2 emission rates when tests were conducted to investigate the effect of using different reaction atmospheres or of including UV absorber in the PET samples. Samples containing UV absorbers either homogeneously distributed through the film or in thin surface layers (similar to 0.7 mu m thick) were also tested. Relatively small reductions in CO2 emission rates were observed with samples containing UV absorbers but the rates were not very sensitive to the distribution and concentration of the absorbers. A thin surface layer containing only 2% stabiliser (equivalent to 0.23% stabiliser when averaged over the whole film thickness) provided oxidation reduction similar to that observed when 1% stabiliser was distributed evenly throughout the sample. Tests were conducted in wet oxygen, dry oxygen and dry nitrogen. For as-received bi-axially drawn PET film containing no absorber, the CO2 emission rate under UV illumination in wet oxygen was much higher than in dry oxygen or dry nitrogen. For as-received PET the difference between the rates observed in dry oxygen and dry nitrogen was small. For PET films that had been pre-exposed to UV (for 9 days) prior to insertion into the in situ CO2 measurement cell the rate of CO2 generation in oxygen was significantly larger than that in nitrogen. In both nitrogen and oxygen the presence of UV absorbers significantly decreased the rate of CO2 generation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A crucial step in conducting e-refinery processes is the development of appropriate reactions and optimal electrocatalysts for efficient cleavage and formation of chemical bonds. However, compared to well-studied primary reactions (e.g., O-2 reduction, water splitting), the mechanistic aspects and materials design for emerging complex reactions are yet to be settled. To address this challenge, herein, we first present fundamentals of heterogeneous electrocatalysis and some primary reactions, and then implement these to establish the framework of e-refinery by coupling in situ generated intermediates (integrated reactions) or products (tandem reactions). We also present a set of materials design principles and strategies to efficiently manipulate the reaction intermediates and pathways.									114	5	0	0	6	0	114			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000627042200001	33606339

The oxygen vacancy (V (o)) on metal oxides is expected to be a key factor affecting the efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 reduction on metal-oxide-based catalysts. Yet, to date, the question of how an V (o) influences photocatalytic CO2 reduction is still unanswered. Herein, we report that, on V (o)-rich gallium oxide coated with Pt nanoparticles (V (o)-rich Pt/Ga2O3), CO2 is photocatalytically reduced to CO, with a highly enhanced CO evolution rate (21.0 mu mol center dot h(-1)) compared to those on V (o)-poor Pt/Ga2O3 (3.9 mu mol center dot h(-1)) and Pt/TiO2(P25) (6.7 mu mol center dot h(-1)). We demonstrate that the V (o) leads to improved CO2 adsorption and separation of the photoinduced charges on Pt/Ga2O3, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity of Pt/Ga2O3. Rational fabrication of an V (o) is thereby an attractive strategy for developing efficient catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.									110	12	0	0	8	0	112			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000376652300014

Control experiments demonstrate that the porous TiO2 precursor, imidazole, and hydrochloric acid are all necessary for the formation of Vo.-TiO2. Although the synthesis of Vo.-TiO2 originates from such a multicomponent system, this synthetic approach is facile, controllable, and reproducible. X-ray diffraction, XPS, and EPR spectroscopy reveal that the Vo.-TiO2 material with a high crystallinity embodies a mass of paramagnetic oxygen vacancies, and is free of other dopant species such as nitrogen and carbon. UV/Vis diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical measurement demonstrate that Vo.-TiO2 is a stable visible-light-responsive material with photogenerated charge separation efficiency higher than N-TiO2 and P25 under visible-light irradiation. The Vo.-TiO2 material exhibits not only satisfactory thermal- and photostability, but also superior photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution (115molh1g1) from water with methanol as sacrificial reagent under visible light (>400nm) irradiation. Furthermore, the effects of reaction temperature, ratio of starting materials (imidazole:TiO2 precursor) and calcination time on the photocatalytic activity and the microstructure of Vo.-TiO2 were elucidated.									123	6	0	0	10	0	124			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000314926300035	23307339

Following our previous mechanistic studies on the OER on RuO2(110) (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 18214), this work aims to provide further insight into the key parameters relevant to the activity of OER catalysts by investigating a group of rutile-type binary metal oxides, including RuNiO2, RuCoO2, RuRhO2, RuIrO2 and OsIrO2. Two key aspects are focused on, namely the surface O coverage at the relevant potential conditions and the kinetics of H2O activation on the O-covered surfaces. The O coverage for all the oxides investigated here is found to be 1 ML at the concerned potential (1.23 V) with all the exposed metal cations being covered by terminal O atoms. The calculated free energy barrier for the H2O dissociation on the O covered surfaces varies significantly on different surfaces. The highest OER activity occurs at RuCoO2 and RuNiO2 oxides with a predicted activity about 500 times higher than pure RuO2. On these oxides, the surface bridging O near the terminal O atom has a high activity for accepting the H during H2O splitting. It is concluded that while the differential adsorption energy of the terminal O atom influences the OER activity to the largest extent, the OER activity can still be tuned by modifying the electronic structure of surface bridging O.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000311735700013	22941355

Presently, several different proposals exist for how they catalyze O-2 formation from water. Knowledge about this process at molecular detail will be required for their further improvement. Here we present time-resolved O-18-labelling isotope-ratio membrane-inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) experiments to study the mechanism of water oxidation in Co/methylenediphosphonate (Co/M2P) oxide nanoparticles using [Ru(bpy)(3)](3+) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) as chemical oxidant. We show that O-16-Co/M2P-oxide nanoparticles produce O-16(2) during their first turnover after simultaneous addition of (H2O)-O-18 and [Ru(bpy)(3)](3+), while sequential addition with a delay of 3 s yields oxygen reflecting bulk water O-18-enrichment. This result is interpreted to show that the O-O bond formation in Co/M2P-oxide nanoparticles occurs via intramolecular oxygen coupling between two terminal Co-OHn ligands that are readily exchangeable with bulk water in the resting state of the catalyst. Importantly, our data allow the determination of the number of catalytic sites within this amorphous nanoparticular material, to calculate the TOF per catalytic site and to derive the number of holes needed for the production of the first O-2 molecule per catalytic site. We propose that the mechanism of O-O bond formation during bulk catalysis in amorphous Co-oxides may differ from that taking place at the surface of crystalline materials.									39	0	0	0	15	0	39			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000358730600027

In this work, a series of La,Al-codoped SrTiO3 catalysts are synthesized by a flux treatment method after grounding. An appropriate doping amount of La3+ and Al3+ ions into perovskite will lead to fewer defects, responsible for enhancing photocatalytic performance. Al3+ ion doping will introduce the oxygen vacancies into the perovskite, resulting in a decreasing number of Ti3+ ions. During the defect engineering, more Sr2+ will precipitate onto the perovskite surface caused by the introduction of Al3+. Hence, surface engineering is applied through appropriate La3+ ion doping contributing to the lattice distortion, allowing surficial Sr2+ to re-enter the perovskite lattice, leading to the promoted conversion of Ti3+ to Ti4+. Simultaneously, the La3+ ion doping is also beneficial to the decrease in oxygen vacancies. As a result, the essential relationship between the La3+ doping amount and photocatalytic performance in overall water splitting is revealed. The optimized 0.6% La and 1% Al codoped SrTiO3 sample loading Rh (0.1 wt %)/Cr2O3 (0.05 wt %)/CoOOH (0.05 wt %) gives the highest activity and good stability, with gas evolution rates of 1.79 mmol.h(-1) (H-2) and 0.91 mmol.h(-1) (O-2). In comparison, the apparent quantum efficiency is 78.43% under 365 nm irradiation.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000697346200010

Study of the Characteristics of Elementary Processes in a Chain Hydrogen Burning Reaction in Oxygen								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL PHYSICS				125	6			1026	1033		10.1134/S1063776117120019				DEC 2017	2017	The characteristics of possible chain explosive hydrogen burning reactions in an oxidizing medium are calculated on the potential energy surface. Specifically, reactions H-2 + O-2 -> H2O + O, H-2 + O-2 -> HO2 + H, and H-2 + O-2 -> OH + OH are considered. Special attention is devoted to the production of a pair of fast highly reactive OH radicals. Because of the high activation threshold, this reaction is often excluded from the known kinetic scheme of hydrogen burning. However, a spread in estimates of kinetic characteristics and a disagreement between theoretical predictions with experimental results suggest that the kinetic scheme should be refined.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1063-7761	1090-6509		WOS:000426401800005

Herein, we report a "self-catalysis" method for the synthesis of ferrous metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) FM-N-C (FM = Fe, Co, and Ni) with similar to 2 wt% metal loadings on a carbon black support. The combination of experimental and theoretical evidence reveals a self-catalytic process from FM atoms to FM-N(4)species, which involves (1) the adsorption of FM ions on the surface-oxidized carbon nanoparticlesviaoxygen coordination bonds (FM-O); (2) the catalytic decomposition of ammonia to nitrogen radicals on the FM atoms; (3) the replacement of coordinating oxygen with nitrogen. The precoordination of FM with oxygen is the key to the synthesis and reduces the energy barrier of ammonia decomposition and nitrogen bonding to the FM atoms. Thus, the formation of the FM-N(4)species at a mild temperature of 600 degrees C is enabled. The as-synthesized FM-N-C SACs exhibit high catalytic activities towards O(2)and/or CO(2)reduction reactions. In contrast to the metal-organic framework-based SACs in which the MOF support significantly changes in size and weight, the self-catalysis technique is "minimally invasive" to the carbon support, thus benefiting the structural design of SACs by taking advantage of the abundant morphologies of the carbon nanomaterials.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000546391600024

Loading Effect at Air Plasma Etching of Fabric of Polyethylene Terephthalate Fibers								SURFACE ENGINEERING AND APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY				44	2			127	132		10.3103/S1068375508020099				APR 2008	2008	The results of studying the loading effect at low temperature air plasma action on the surface of fabric of polyethylene terephthalate filament yarns are presented. Gravimetric and mass-spectrum techniques were used in this work. Gas evolution changes plasma properties and, as a consequence, the target process kinetics. Due to the mutual influence of heterogeneous and volumetric processes not only flows of active oxygen particles on the material surface reduce but also the correlations of these flows change. The NO molecule concentration is closely connected with the atom oxygen balance. Even when the fraction of the reactor surface occupied by the fabric is relatively low, the NO molecules' concentration drops appreciably. For a wide interval of discharge parameters, the specific rates of etching, the oxygen absorption from the gas phase, the gaseous product formation, and the NO molecule concentration decrease extensively when the reactor load ratio is increased from 6% to 50%. The interconnected influence of the parameters and the loading is shown in the behavior of the reaction product formation. In the case of the load ratio rising, the correlation of the degradation channels changes to a channel with a yield of CO and H-2 stronger at higher initial gas pressure.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1068-3755	1934-8002		WOS:000262784200009

It is shown that dissolved metal ions from the cathode reacted with the introduced organic additives, reduced the cathode stability, and blocked metal oxidation reactions. This was due to a Kolbe-like decomposition reaction that occurred because of the presence of potassium citrate, which formed because of the reaction of KOH and citric acid. Furthermore, intermediate products of this decomposition reaction appeared to block the cathode's surface, hindering oxygen (O-2) evolution and reducing the overall cell performance. The decomposition of potassium citrate starts above 1.7 V Zn. Additionally, it is shown that tribase citric acid behaves similarly to a dibase carbonic acid. Both decrease the onset potential for the O-2 reduction reaction from 0.9 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for pure 6 M KOH to 0.6 V vs RHE for KOH with these organic acids.

Accordingly, engineering the photocatalyst with surface oxygen vacancies will enhance the semiconductor nanostructure's photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, a CeO2-x nanostructure is designed under the influence of low-frequency ultrasonic waves to create surface oxygen vacancies. This approach enhances the photocatalytic efficiency compared to many heterostructures while keeping the intrinsic crystal structure intact. Ultrasonic waves induce the acoustic cavitation effect leading to the dissemination of active elements on the surface, which results in vacancy formation in conjunction with larger surface area and smaller particle size. The structural analysis of CeO2-x revealed higher crystallinity, as well as morphological optimization and the presence of oxygen vacancies is verified through Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature-programmed reduction, photoluminescence, and electron spin resonance analyses. Oxygen vacancies accelerate the redox cycle between Ce4+ and Ce3+ by prolonging photogenerated charge recombination. The ultrasound-treated pristine CeO2 sample achieved excellent hydrogen production showing a quantum efficiency of 1.125% and efficient organic degradation. Our promising findings demonstrated that ultrasonic treatment causes the formation of surface oxygen vacancies and improves photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and pollution degradation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000743637300001

The effects of WO3 particles on surface morphology, structure and electrochemical characters of PbO2 electrodes were investigated. Different from PbO2 electrodes, the PbO2/WO3 composite electrodes owned higher oxygen evolution overpotential, longer service life and higher hydroxyl radicals generation performance. The effect of key operating parameters, for instance, current density, initial metribuzin concentration, initial pH values, and supporting electrolyte concentration, upon electrochemical removal process of metribuzin were studied. The current density and initial metribuzin concentration exerted prominent effects on electrochemical degradation of metribuzin. Kinetic analysis indicated that the electrochemical decomposition of metribuzin was a pseudo-first-order reaction. The byproducts during metribuzin degradation process were identified, several aromatic products and inorganic ions were generated along with the reaction time. Finally, the electrochemical pathways of metribuzin degradation at the PbO2/WO3 composite electrode were proposed based on the identified reaction byproducts, which were separated into three parallel sub pathways according to the different degradation reactions by hydroxyl radicals, and quantities of hydroxylation, oxidation, demethylation, deamination, and addition reactions' products were generated. All the byproducts were finally decomposed into inorganic H2O, CO2, NO3-, and NH4+. (C) 2019 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Herein, nanostructured metal boride MB (M = Co, Fe) electrocatalysts, which have been synthesized by a Sn/SnCl2 redox assisted solid-state method, were integrated with WO3 thin films to build heterojunction photoanodes. As-obtained MB modified WO3 photoanodes exhibit enhanced charge carrier transport, amended separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, prolonged hole lifetime and increased charge carrier density. Surface modification of CoB and FeB significantly enhances the photocurrent density of WO3 photoanodes from 0.53 to 0.83 and 0.85 mA cm(-2), respectively, in transient chronoamperometry (CA) at 1.23 V vs. RHE (V-RHE) under interrupted illumination in 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte (pH 7), corresponding to an increase of 1.6 relative to pristine WO3. In contrast, the pristine MB thin film electrodes do not produce noticeable photocurrent during water oxidation. The metal boride catalysts transform in situ to a core-shell structure with a metal boride core and a metal oxide (MO, M = Co, Fe) surface layer. When coupled to WO3 thin films, the CoB@CoOx nanostructures exhibit a higher catalytic enhancement than corresponding pure cobalt borate (Co-B-i) and cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)(x)) electrocatalysts. Our results emphasize the role of the semiconductor-electrocatalyst interface for photoelectrodes and their high dependency on materials combination.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000516533300022	31965133

The alloying in Ag and Cu nanoparticles was found to affect the adsorption of the oxygen molecule and synergistically increases the relative activity towards ORR and OER in 1 M KOH medium. The catalyst sample AgCu-21, synthesized by the SWCS showed highest activity and stability due to high concentration of Ag-Cu alloy on surface as verified by XPS, TEM and phase mapping of elements on the surface. The ORR catalyzed by AgCu-21 proceed through an overall four-electron pathway with a kinetic current density of 12.4 mA cm(-2) at -0.2 V potential. The XPS analysis of the samples indicates that the ORR and OER activity correlate well with the shifting in binding energy of Ag on Cu surface with higher degree of alloying resulting in better electrocatalytic performance.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000471731600010

Nevertheless, the importance of this material in the catalysis of many reactions claims for new research around this element and its compounds. In the present work CALPHAD methodology is implemented to study the phase composition of the, unreported, Pt-Ru-Ni system and its evolution with temperature and oxygen partial pressure. Ternary system Pt-Ru-Ni has been calculated from thermodynamic assessments of Pt-Ni, Pt-Ru and Ni-Ru binary systems using a symmetric extrapolation. Gibbs energies of the liquid, FCC and HCP phases have been described by a sub-regular solution model. The behaviour of modelled ternary solutions at different oxygen partial pressures has been also simulated by thermodynamic calculations, describing the gas as an ideal phase. In this work, the thermodynamic calculation is directly applied to the synthesis of Pt-Ru-Ni based materials by means of the combustion method. Comparison of the experimental results with the calculated data evidences the useful of the thermodynamic description of the system in the design and development of Pt-Ru-Ni materials.

Here, we investigate benthic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) dynamics in relation to physicochemical surface sediment properties and bottom water mixing in the shallow, eutrophic Peel-Harvey Estuary. Our results show the strong dependence of sedimentary P release on Fe and S redox cycling. The estuary contains surface sediments that are strongly reducing and act as net P source, despite physical sediment mixing under an oxygenated water column. This decoupling between water column oxygenation and benthic P dynamics is of great importance to understand the evolution of nutrient dynamics in marine systems in response to increasing nutrient loadings. In addition, the findings show that the relationship between P burial efficiency and bottom water oxygenation depends on local conditions; sediment properties rather than oxygen availability may control benthic P recycling. Overall, our results illustrate the complex response of an estuary to environmental change because of interacting physical and biogeochemical processes.									37	1	0	0	28	0	38			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000317173100016	23477454

The dinuclear Ruthenium complex [Ru-2(mu-Cl)(bpy)(2)(btpyaq)](BF4)(3) ([3](BF4)(3), bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) was used as a catalyst for water oxidation to oxygen with (NH4)(2)[Ce(NO3)(6)] as the oxidant (turnover numbers = 248). The initial reaction rate of oxygen evolution was directly proportional to the concentration of the catalyst and independent of the oxidant concentration. The cyclic voltammogram of [3](BF4)(3) in water at pH 1.3 showed an irreversible catalytic current above +1.6 V (vs. SCE), with two quasi-reversible waves and one irreversible wave at E-1/2 = +0.62, +0.82 V, and E-pa = +1.13 V, respectively. UV-vis and Raman spectra of [3](BF4)(3) with controlled-potential electrolysis at +1.40 V revealed that [Ru(IV)=O O=Ru(IV)](4+) is stable under electrolysis conditions.

An expanded argon/oxygen plasma beam is produced with a collimated, frozen structure, which interacts uniformly and in a controlled manner, over a large area of the remotely placed, tungsten target, to produce superfine particles in bulk amounts and without mixed with large aggregates. The target surface gets oxidized to form volatile tungsten-oxide, from which nanoparticles are nucleated by gas phase condensation process. Optical emission spectroscopic studies reveal that a massive argon plasma ion density leads to the production of reactive atomic oxygen radicals that were responsible for the rapid oxidation kinetics. Non-stoichiometric tungsten-oxide in pale blue colour and nanometer sizes were deposited on the water-cooled walls of the vacuum chamber. This sample was annealed to produce nanocrystalline, tungsten-oxide in yellow colour, which was characterized with narrow size distribution and fine material crystallinity. Functional properties of the synthesized nanomaterials were also measured, their photocatalytic characteristics for the degradation of the dye Rhodamine-B and antibacterial properties against E. coli bacteria. The annealed powder sample could remove the dye almost completely in about three hours. The same nanopowders demonstrated promising antibacterial properties, which may therefore lead to multi-functionality during the treatment of wastewater. Their hydrogen evolution reaction activity is also investigated that demonstrates moderate performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000730235600001

The texture of BiOI is controlled by adjusting the pH values of reaction mixture and the corresponding formation mechanism is also explored based on the self-assembly behavior of ionic liquid. It is found that the sample BiOI-7 possesses the ultrathin nanosheets (2 4 nm) and abundant surface oxygen defects which are beneficial for accelerating carrier transfer and facilitating photocatalytic degradation. The photocatalytic activity of as-prepared BiOI is studied by using Rhodamine B (RhB), methyl orange (MO) and Bisphenol A (BPA) as target pollutants, respectively. Besides, water splitting reactions were also used to further check the photocatalytic activity. BiOI samples exhibit the enhanced photocatalytic activity than bulk BiOI and g-C3N4 obtained by calcination of melamine. Especially, 92% of bisphenol A (BPA) can be degraded under light irradiation within 1 hr by using only 5 mg of BiOI-7 nanosheets, which is superior than most counterparts reported so far. This rapidly synthetic route can be applied in fabrication of other novel materials with diverse morphology and porous structure.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0268-2605	1099-0739		WOS:000535960000001

The understanding of the multiple physicochemical and thermal processes at the combustion front is fundamental to reduce the potential risks, such as high burning temperature and low oxygen utilization. In the present study, a pore-scale modelling of the combustion front was employed based on the Lattice Boltzmann method to couple the fluid flow, heat and mass transfer and chemical reactions with the geometrical evolution. A thermal counter-slip algorithm was developed to solve the coupled interface conditions between conjugated heat transfer and heterogeneous reactions. The accuracy of the coupled lattice Boltzmann numerical models was validated by the finite element method. Pore-scale simulation was then performed to model the thermal and reacting flows through a two-dimensional model porous medium. The numerical simulation distinguished four characteristic regimes corresponding to different control mechanisms for the reacting flow. The study showed that the diffusion-limited mechanism is most desirable for the stable combustion in terms of the ideal burning temperature and full oxygen utilization. The control regime diagram was mapped on the Peclet-Damkohler plane for the specified computational domain. The effects of the Peclet and Damkohler numbers on the burning temperature, combustion front propagation velocity and oxygen utilization were then analyzed to obtain some insights about the control of the combustion front in the ISC process.									22	1	0	0	0	0	23			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000437093000078

For the first time, an integrated OER electrode based on one-step direct growth of metallic iron-nickel sulfide nanosheets on FeNi alloy foils (denoted as Fe. Ni3S2/FeNi) is reported, and the origin of the enhanced OER activity is uncovered in combination with theoretical and experimental studies. The obtained Fe. Ni3S2/FeNi electrode exhibits highly catalytic activity and long-term stability toward OER in strong alkaline solution, with a low overpotential of 282 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1). The excellent activity and satisfactory stability suggest that the as-made electrode provides an attractive alternative to noble metal-based catalysts. Combined with density functional theory calculations, exceptional OER performance of Fe. Ni3S2/FeNi results from a combination of efficient electron transfer properties, more active sites, the suitable O-2 evolution kinetics and energetics benefited from Fe doping. This work not only simply constructs an excellent electrode for water oxidation, but also provides a deep understanding of the underlying nature of the enhanced OER performance, which may serve as a guide to develop highly effective and integrated OER electrodes for water splitting.									155	10	0	0	3	0	157			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000400659000011	28296136

The endeavor to emulate the natural photosystem II for efficient water oxidation has been extended across the spectrum of organic and inorganic combinations. However, the achievement has so far been restricted to homogeneous catalysts rather than their pristine heterogeneous forms. The poor structural understanding and control over the mechanistic pathway often impede the overall development. Herein, we have synthesized a highly crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) for chemical and photochemical water oxidation. The interpenetrated structure assures the catalyst stability, as the catalyst's performance remains unaltered after several cycles. This COF exhibits the highest ever accomplished catalytic activity for such an organometallic crystalline solid-state material where the rate of oxygen evolution is as high as & SIM;26,000 mu mol L-1 s-1 (second-order rate constant k & AP; 1650 mu mol L s-1 g-2). The catalyst also proves its exceptional activity (k & AP; 1600 mu mol L s-1 g-2) during light-driven water oxidation under very dilute conditions. The cooperative interaction between metal centers in the crystalline network offers 20-30-fold superior activity during chemical as well as photocatalytic water oxidation as compared to its amorphous polymeric counterpart.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000864472400001	36168797

In the present study, we describe the design and synthesis of a nickel (Ni)-coordinated poly(thiourea-formaldehyde) polymer, then a nanocarbon (Vulcan, porous nanocarbon CNovel (TM), 2-different multi-walled carbon nanotubes, or single-walled carbon nanotubes) as the conducting support was combined to prepare seven different molecular catalysts. The chemical structure of the Ni-coordinated polymer was characterized by elemental analysis, C-13 NMR, FT-IR and XPS. Furthermore, EXAFS studies and theoretical calculations revealed that this polymer consists of two Ni-O (2.17 angstrom) and two Ni-S (2.17 angstrom) coordination bonds. This Ni-coordination polymer was stable in an oxidative and reductive environment in an alkaline medium over a long term due to its strong Ni-coordination. The catalysts were found to act as an efficient catalyst for an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Especially, among the catalysts, the CNovel (TM)-based catalyst showed the highest oxygen electrode performance for the ORR: E-1/2: 0.81 V vs. RHE, and OER: 1.57 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2). The catalyst acted as an efficient and durable cathode for a rechargeable Zn-air battery (charge-discharge overpotential gap of 0.45 V). Such outstanding air-cathode performance is explained by the cooperative mechanism between water on the axial site of the Ni in the polymer and superoxide ion on the porous carbon. The present study is of importance for the development of advanced energy materials in batteries and molecular catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2633-5409		WOS:000827760700001

The fullerenol was prepared by the reaction of C-60 in deoxygenated tetrahydrofuran with an aqueous NaOH solution using sodium zincate as an electrophilic reagent. The obtained fullerenol is not simply polyhydroxylated C-60 but is a structurally and electronically complex C-60 anion with a molecular formula of Na+ (2)[C-60 (OH)(12)(O)(2)](2-). This negatively charged fullerenol is in the form of a spherical cluster of 50 nm in diameter, and it can migrate in the same solution to an anode surface and be oxidized into the less soluble fullerenol C60O(OH)(12), when 10 V is applied to the electroplating bath. A uniform film, with a particle of 50-250 nm in diameter and a thickness of a few 10-100s of nanometers, is obtained by drying the fullerenol covered anode. This is the first time that studies of water-soluble fullerenols acting as anions for electrodeposited film preparation have been reported. The deposition mechanism has been further demonstrated by electrochemical measurements and dissolved oxygen concentration testing to be an oxidation process consisting of two anodic oxygen evolution processes.									24	4	0	0	1	0	28			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000283453700014	20843013

Herein, we have successfully synthesized MoS2/CoS2 hetero-nanostructures with an abundant 1T-MoS2 phase on a cobalt metal-organic framework (MOF), which show superior HER activity and stability with quite low overpotentials of 37 and 51 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and small Tafel slopes of 46 and 45 mV dec(-1) in alkaline and acidic media, respectively, outperforming most of the recently reported Mo-based catalysts. Only 261 mV overpotential and 1.53 V are required to drive oxygen evolution and overall water splitting in alkaline media. It is suggested that the interface-assisted phase transition is activated by electron and Co injections. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance originates from the porous structure, metallic conductivity and refined phase modulation synergistic with interfacial chemistry. Theoretical calculations show that the interfacial Co sites are activated for optimal hydrogen adsorption and water dissociation. Our work provides new ideas for the development of MOF-derived electrocatalysts for applications in energy-related fields.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000826619100001		
J	Mei Mingxiang; Meng Qingfen							梅冥相; 孟庆芬	Timing of the rise of atmospheric oxygen content level: A geobiological process that is closely and genetically related to the geodynamics			大气圈氧气含量水平上升的时间进程:一个与地球动力学过程紧密相关的地球生物学过程				古地理学报	Journal of Palaeogeography				18	1			1	20	1671-1505(2016)18:1<1:DQQYQH>2.0.TX;2-4					2016	2016	Earth's atmosphere is overwhelmingly dominated by two types of gas: N_2 and O_2. The nitrogen(N_2)is primordial,and its presence and abundance are not driven by biological processes. In contrast,the oxygen(O_2)is continuously produced biologically via the oxidation of water driven by energy from the Sun. How did O_2,a gas critical to the evolution of animal life,become the second most abundant gas on Earth?The problem is not as simple as it might first appear. In order to understand this problem,we must know not only how and when O_2 was first generated,but also how it came to persist in high concentrations in the atmosphere. Two facts are known with certainty,that are,Earth's earliest atmosphere was essentially devoid of oxygen;and today's 21% of atmosphere is composed of oxygen. It should be emphasized that most geological indicators of ancient atmospheric oxygen levels imply only presence or absence and that most of the events that took place between those following two time points are highly uncertain. A battery of geological indicators suggests the timing of the rise of atmosphere oxygen occurred at following time points:(1)A shift from an anoxic to an oxic atmosphere some time between 2.5 and 2.0 billion years ago,which is known as the Great Oxidation Event(GOE);(2)A second'Great Oxidation Event' during the Precambrian-Cambrian transition between about 0.85 and 0.54 billion years ago(GOE-Ⅱ),which is herewith referred to as the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event(NOE). Both the GOE and the NOE lead to a prevailing view of atmospheric oxygen evolution over time that is marked by a three durations for the atmospheric oxygen level. Following important cognitions are gained with the further research. If the overall increase in atmospheric O_2,from negligible in the early Archaean to 21% today,was due to the increasing oxygen production as erosion and sedimentation became increasingly important relative to volcanic activity,so, the series of step increases in O_2, associated with periods of anomalously high sedimentation following supercontinent amalgamation,superimposed on this overall trend, which demonstrates that the rise of atmospheric oxygen is resulted from the sophisticated geobiological process that is closely genetically related to geodynamics. The stepwise rise for the atmospheric oxygen is further grouped into 7 events that can be correlated with the period after the supercontinent amalgamation in the history of the Earth,which provides a more clear view;importantly,enhanced sedimentation during these periods promoted the burial of a high fraction of organic carbon and pyrite,thus preventing their reaction with free oxygen,and leading to sustained increases in atmospheric oxygen. Both novel viewpoints and important cognitions provide many important thinking approaches and researching clues for the further understanding of the geobiological process for the rise of atmospheric oxygen. Therefore,tracing these research advances on the study of rise of atmospheric oxygen is helpful to drive new research that will unveil new truths about the evolutionary history of the atmosphere of our planet.			两种气体,氮气和氧气,以压倒优势的状态主导着地球的大气圈。氮气是原生的,而且其存在和丰度不是生物过程所驱动的;相反,氧气是生物通过水的氧化作用而连续产生的,这个氧化作用得到了太阳光的能量驱动。氧气,一种对动物生命进化最为关键的气体,是如何变成大气圈中丰度第2的气体?问题并非以前所设想的那么简单;为了了解大气圈氧化的时间进程,我们不但要知道氧气是什么时候而且是如何第1次出现的,而且还要知道氧气是如何在大气圈中保持一个高浓度的。可以肯定的2个事实是:地球最早期的大气圈是缺乏氧气的,而今天的大气圈则为21%的氧气所组成。需要特别强调的是,大多数古代大气圈氧气水平的地质标志,只是意味着存在与缺乏,而且发生在以下2个时间点的大多数事件是高度不肯定的;但是,一系列地质证据已经表明,大气圈氧气含量水平上升的时间进程发生在2个时间点上:(1)一个从缺氧的到含氧的大气圈的转变,大致发生在2.0~2.5Ga期间,这个转变就是著名的巨型氧化作用事件(GOE);(2)发生在前寒武纪-寒武纪过渡时期的大约540~850Ma的第2次巨型氧化作用事件(GOE-Ⅱ),被进一步命名为新元古代氧化作用事件(NOE)。GOE与NOE,就得出了地球大气圈氧气含量水平上升三段式的盛行图像。随着研究的深入,得到了以下重要认识:如果说大气圈氧气含量的总体增加,从太古宙微不足道的水平增加到今天21%,是由于氧气生产作用增强的结果而代表了一个复杂的地球生物学过程的话,那么,这个过程则发生在随着侵蚀作用与沉积作用相对于火山活动而变得更加重要的状况下,更进一步讲,叠加在这个总体趋势下的则是一系列的阶梯式的氧气含量水平上升,这与超大陆聚合作用之后异常高的沉积作用周期是相联系的,从而进一步说明了大气圈氧气含量水平上升是与地球动力学过程紧密相关的地球生物学过程的作用结果。大气圈氧气含量水平一系列的阶梯式的上升,被总结为7个事件而与超大陆汇聚事件得到了良好的对比,从而提供了一个更加清晰的图像;也就是说,在超大陆汇聚作用之后,得到增强的沉积作用促进了大部分有机碳和黄铁矿的埋藏,因而阻碍了它们与自由氧的反应,结果就是大气圈氧气含量水平的实质性上升。新颖的观点和重要的认识,为深入理解地球大气圈氧气含量水平上升这一个重要的地球生物学过程,提供了重要的思考途径和研究线索;追索这些研究进展,将有助于揭开地球大气圈演变历史的神秘面纱并寻找出更多的科学研究生长点。						0	9	0	0	0	0	9			1671-1505			CSCD:5624675

Herein, boron atoms were incorporated into nitrogen-doped carbon as electrocatalyst through a one-step plasma synthesis route. The obtained B,N-codoped catalyst presented superior electrocatalytic performance, with an onset potential of 1.46 V vs RHE and corresponding overpotentials of 270 mV and 509 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), which were significantly lower than that of N-doped carbon (1.56 V vs RHE, 331 mV and 554 mV), and even outperformed the commercial 5 wt% Ru/C (1.48 V vs RHE, 275 mV and 547 mV). Moreover, it exhibited higher stability than Ru/C in 9-h durability test and remained relatively high OER catalytic activities. Density functional theory has verified the OH molecule was firstly adsorbed on the top side of B atom in the B,N-codoped carbon. The OH* chemisorption energy on B,N-codoped carbon was less than that on N-doped carbon catalyst system by 0.281 eV, which translated into a higher kinetic OER activity of B,N-codoped carbon. Combined with the electrochemical performance, boron as OER active sites in B,N-codoped carbon should be considered as a valid strategy to boost the performance of heteroatom-doped carbon OER electrocatalysts.									14	1	0	0	1	0	15			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000576953600006

In this paper, we have fabricated the CeO2 buffer layer on YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) (00l) single crystal substrates by the chemical solution deposition (CSD) method in different annealing atmospheres. The results show that both the thermal decomposition behavior of the precursor solution and the annealing atmosphere have an important effect on the epitaxial growth process of the CeO2 buffer layer. The large oxygen partial pressure in annealing atmosphere is to the disadvantage of the epitaxial growth of CeO2 (00l) crystal face with high energy. Moreover, the epitaxial growth of the CeO2 (00l) crystal plane goes against a decrease in the surface roughness of the CeO2 film. Therefore, it can be considered that the orientation growth of the CeO2 buffer layer and its surface morphology evolution may be related to the thermal decomposition behavior of precursor solution and the change of oxygen vacancies concentration.									2	0	1	0	0	0	3			1557-1939	1557-1947		WOS:000329655900004		
J	Riley, Jarrett; Siriwardane, Ranjani; Tian, Hanjing; Benincosa, William; Poston, James								Kinetic analysis of the interactions between calcium ferrite and coal char for chemical looping gasification applications: Identifying reduction routes and modes of oxygen transfer								APPLIED ENERGY				201				94	110		10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.05.101				SEP 1 2017	2017	Chemical Looping Gasification (CLG) is an emerging technology that shows promise for efficient coal gasification by eliminating the need for energy intensive gas separations to achieve a non-nitrogen diluted syngas stream. Oxygen from oxygen carriers, such as CaFe2O4, are used for coal gasification in place of conventionally produced gaseous oxygen from cryogenic separation of air. These oxygen carriers are unique for their ability to selectively oxidize coal to form syngas and show limited reactivity with syngas components (H-2, CO). This study was carried out to determine the kinetic model representation and parameters associated with the selective oxidation of coal derived char (Wyodak and Illinois #6) with a metal ferrite (CaFe2O4) of which are needed for advancement of the process concept. Using thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled with mass spectrometry, the selective oxygen release from metal ferrite in the presence of char by proximal contact was examined. The application of model fitting approaches was used to describe controlling resistances during oxygen release. A combination of the modified shrinking core model (SCM) with planar oxygen ion diffusion control and reaction order based models were applied for kinetic parameter determination. CaFe2O4 particle size plays a major role in the prevailing mode of oxygen release. Particle sizes on the range of 40-50 mu m tend to favor first order kinetically controlled regimes independent of geometric and diffusion controls. The probability for oxygen ion diffusion controlling regimes increased when the particle size range of the oxygen carrier was increased up to 350 mu m. Char type also impacted the prevalence of the controlling regime. Higher ranked chars react in a slower manner, limiting the gradient for oxygen ion release from the oxygen carrier. Activation energies determined for this process range from 120 to 200 kJ/mol and oxygen ion diffusion coefficients are on the order of 10 (8) cm(2)/s. It is suggested that oxygen ion movement is regulated by lattice diffusion out of partially reduced phases (Ca2Fe2O5) and through reduced outer layers composed of CaO and Fe. The controlled movement of oxygen ions influences the rate of carbon oxidation in the char and therefore the selectivity towards partial oxidation products, which are desirable in CLG applications.

Once formed, these aromatic structures begin to assemble into nanoparticles and, regardless of the clustering process, the molecular properties of the aromatic precursors play an important role. Leveraging existing experimental data collected from a coflow Jet A-1 surrogate diffusion flame, in this paper we report on a detailed study of the spatial evolution of molecular structures of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) and their corresponding formation pathways. To this end, we employed the SNapS2 kinetic Monte Carlo software to simulate the chemical evolution of PACs along multiple streamlines. The results show that growth only occurs along streamlines that traverse regions of high acetylene concentrations in the center of the flame. The PACs predicted in various conditions show diverse chemical properties, including aliphatic chains, five-membered, and heteroaromatic rings. PACs in streamlines close to the flame wings begin growing immediately due to the high temperature and large amounts of radical species, while PACs originating along inner streamlines do not appreciably grow until they pass through an area characterized by high radical concentrations. Using graph theory and network analysis, we investigated the complex reaction network generated by SNapS2 and determined that the growth pathways of many PACs center around a few stable structures that also promote oxygen addition reactions due to their morphology and long lifetimes. These pathways play a more significant role along streamlines near the centerline, compared to the flame wings, which show more variety due to the highly reactive environment encountered during early growth. The results of this study provide insights on the reaction pathways that determine the properties of PACs at different flame locations as well as information on the chemical characteristics of the formed PACs, with emphasis on oxygenated structures.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000621595300028	33587735

J	Jacob, T.								The mechanism of forming H2O from H-2 and O-2 over a Pt catalyst via direct oxygen reduction								FUEL CELLS				6	3-4			159	181		10.1002/fuce.200500201				JUL 2006	2006	Density functional theory (DFT) was used with the B3LYP gradient-corrected exchange-correlation functional to study the mechanism for the reaction of H-2 + (1)/(2) O-2 -> H2O over a Pt catalyst via direct oxygen reduction.Within these studies we first examined the binding characteristics and energetics for each likely intermediate chemisorbed on the Pt(111) surface, modeled by a 35 atom cluster: O, H, O-2, H-2, OH, OOH, H2O.Then, the pathways for the dissociation processes of the various intermediates on the Pt-35 cluster were calculated. For convenience in comparing different reaction steps, these energetics were used to calculate heats of formation (Delta H-f), which were combined with the dissociation barriers. Two main reaction pathways were found for the formation of H2O from H-2 and O-2:center dot (OO-Dissociation: Here O-2 adsorbs on the surface, dissociates, and finally reacts with H sequentially to firstly form OH and then water. The rate-determining step (RDS) for this mechanism is the O-ad + H-ad -> OHad with a barrier of 31.66 kcal mol(-1) and not the dissociation of O-2(ad) (barrier of 15.02 kcal mol(-1)).center dot OOH-Formation: Here O-2 reacts firstly with H-ad to form OOHad, which then dissociates to form OHad and O-ad (the RDS, with a barrier of 17.13 kcal mol(-1)), which finally reacts with another H-ad to form water.Thus, under gas-phase conditions, the OOH-Formation mechanism is found to be the most favorable.									104	1	0	0	5	0	104			1615-6846			WOS:000239970400002

Distinguishing electrode surface-bound heterogeneous catalysts (such as iridium oxide) from homogeneous molecular catalysts is often difficult. Using an electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance (EQCN), we report a method for probing electrodeposition of metal oxide materials from molecular precursors. Using the previously reported [Cp*Ir(H(2)O)(3)](2+) complex, we monitor deposition of a heterogeneous water oxidation catatyst by measuring the electrode mass in real time with piezoelectric gravimetry. Conversely, we do not observe deposition for homogeneous catalysts, such as the water-soluble complex Cp*Ir-(pyr-CMe(2)O)X reported in this work. Rotating ring-disk electrode electrochemistry and Clark-type electrode studies show that this complex is a catalyst for water oxidation with oxygen produced as the product. For the heterogeneous, surface-attached material generated from [Cp*Ir(H(2)O)(3)](2+), we can estimate the percentage of electroactive metal centers in the surface layer. We monitor electrode composition dynamically during catalytic turnover, providing new information on catalytic performance. Together, these data suggest that EQCN can directly probe the homogeneity of molecular water-oxidation catalysts over short times.									254	3	1	0	38	0	256			0002-7863			WOS:000293149800032	21671679

An important and urgent task is thus to develop CO2 electrolyzers that can demonstrate the feasibility of the large-scale conversion of CO2, in particular analogs of water electrolyzers using polymer electrolyte based gas-diffusion electrodes. Here we report a high-performance CO2 electrolyzer making use of alkaline polymer electrolytes (APEs). A highly conductive and stable APE, quaternary ammonia poly(N-methyl-piperidine-co-p-terphenyl) (QAPPT), was applied both as the membrane separator and the ionomer impregnating the gas-diffusion electrodes. Dry CO2 was fed into the Au cathode, with a faradaic efficiency of CO production (COFE) over 85%, and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurred at the IrO2 anode fed with pure water. The cell was operated at temperatures up to 80 degrees C, and the current density reached 0.5 A cm(-2) at 3 V at 60 degrees C. The stability of this electrolyzer was tested under 0.1 A cm(-2), and the cell voltage remained stable at 2.25 V over 100 h, with the COFE staying at 90-95%.									113	11	0	0	3	0	115			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000479082800007

FMOs typically catalyze the incorporation of an oxygen atom from molecular oxygen into small molecules. To date, the majority of functional characterization studies have been performed on mammalian, fungal and bacterial FMOs, showing that they play fundamental roles in drug and xenobiotic metabolism. By contrast, our understanding of FMOs across the plant kingdom is very limited, despite plants possessing far greater FMO diversity compared to both bacteria and other multicellular organisms. Here, we review the progress of plant FMO research, with a focus on FMO diversity and functionality. Significantly, of the FMOs characterized to date, they all perform oxygenation reactions that are crucial steps within hormone metabolism, pathogen resistance, signaling and chemical defense. This demonstrates the fundamental role FMOs have within plant metabolism, and presents significant opportunities for future research pursuits and downstream applications.									14	0	0	0	10	0	14				2073-4344		WOS:000523500100040

Among other, ionic liquids (ILs) are currently being actively used as a source of nitrogen and carbon for obtaining Co-N-C electrocatalysts via pyrolysis. At the same time, known ILs-derived Co-N-C catalysts are characterized by either not high enough ORR activity or methods of their production are complex and multi-stage. Here, for the first time the possibility of increasing the efficiency of Co-N-C ORR electrocatalysts due to the use in precursor composition of deep eutectic solvents (DES) based on 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Bmim]Cl) or tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim]BF4) and hydrated Co(NO3)(2) or CoCl2 instead of mixture of IL and salt of Co (II) was shown. The advantages of using DES as precursors are the high content of cobalt and nitrogen in them, as well as the ability to provide uniform distribution of Co and N atoms in the electrocatalyst given the structure of DES. It was found that DES nature afects composition catalysts and the type of domanant active sites, which leads to diferences in their catalytic performance towards ORR. It was shown, that obtained Co-N-C electrocatalysts in their ORR-activity in the alkaline electrolyte (onset potential of 0.96-0.99 V vs. RHE, half-wave potential of 0.85-0.89 V, and a Tafel slope of 37-50 mV/dec) are almost not inferior to Pt/C catalyst, and are also characterized by high long-term electrochemical stability. The reduction of oxygen on the DES-derived Co-N-C catalysts is mainly occurs under 4-electron mechanism.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000831566600004

Herein, we prepared a 3D hierarchical ZrO2@NiCo2O4/GNS (ZNCO) framework as cathode catalysts in Li-O-2 batteries that have been developed to synthesize with Zr/Ni to Co molar ratio of 0.1:1:2 by a facile hydro thermal method. The coating of foreign Zr4+ ions into the nickel cobaltite matrix, have superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctional activity, and allowed the formation of 3D dimensional networks for oxygen diffusion, electrolyte impregnation, and has very ORR/OER low overpotential due to Zr insertion. Moreover, the ZrO2 coated shell increases the electronic conductivity, porosity, specific surface area, and protects the core and interstitial decoration against lithium peroxide passivation (Li2O2). The electrochemical performance of the 3D hierarchical ZrO2@NiCo2O4/GNS nanocomposite delivers a higher discharge capacity of 9034 mAh g(-1) at 50 mA g(-1) and a superior cycling performance up to 100 cycles with a limited capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1). An ORR/OER mechanism was suggested to illustrate the interesting growth of spherical-like particle and film-like Li2O2 deposits at the different cycles for the ZrO2@NiCo2O4/GNS cathodes. Such MOF-derived; hierarchical porous nanocomposites can lead to high-performance efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts and enables the formation and decomposition of discharge products (Li2O2) during the discharge-charge process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000778650600003

In this review, the various synthesis methods and development of different doping types of MXenes were introduced. The application and mechanism of MXenes in electrocatalytic hydrogen production, oxygen production, oxygen reduction, CO2 reduction and nitrogen reduction processes were mainly discussed.

Herein, we report a highly efficient zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-derived Fe-N-C electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in both alkaline and acidic solutions, which involves the formation of a core-shell-structured Fe(OH)(3)@ZIF-8. The encapsulated Fe(OH)(3) in ZIF-8 gradually evolves into iron oxide with the increasing temperature during the carbonization, which plays several roles including creating Fe-N-x active sites, retaining morphology as a rigid template as well as tuning the carbon microstructure. The best-performing C-Fe(OH)(3)@ZIF-1000 catalyst features a hollow polyhedron (interior cavity: ca. 48 nm) with a thin carbon shell (ca. 5 nm), exhibiting a high Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area of 1021 m(2) g(-1). In alkaline solution, the ORR activity of C-Fe(OH)(3)@ZIF-1000 surpasses the benchmark Pt/C catalyst, with the onset potential (E-onset) of 0.99 V (vs RHE) and the half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.88 V (vs RHE). In acidic solution, the difference in E-1/2 between C-Fe(OH)(3)@ZIF-1000 and Pt/C is 60 mV (0.80 vs 0.86 V), ranking it among the best Fe-N-C electrocatalysts in acidic media. The H2O2 proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) with C-Fe(OH)(3)@ ZIF-1000 as the cathode catalyst delivers a maximum power density of 411 mW cm(2) at 0.35 V.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			2574-0962			WOS:000469885300027

It had a dramatic impact on the primary electron transport chain where it serves as terminal electron acceptor, but oxygen is also used by many enzymes as electron acceptor for a variety of reactions. The organismal oxygen phenotype, aerobic vs. anaerobic, should be manifested in its O-2-utilizing enzymes. Traditionally, enzymes involved in primary oxygen metabolism such as cytochrome c, and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-neutralizing enzymes (e.g. catalase), were used as identifiers of oxygen phenotype. However, these enzymes are often found in strict anaerobes. We aimed to identify the O-2-utilizing enzymes that may distinguish between aerobes and anaerobes. To this end, we annotated the O-2-utilizing enzymes across the prokaryotic tree of life. We recovered over 700 enzymes and mapped their presence/absence in 272 representative genomes. As seen before, enzymes mediating primary oxygen metabolism, and ROS neutralizing enzymes, could be found in both aerobes and anaerobes. However, there exists a subset of enzymes, primarily oxidases that catabolyze various substrates, including amino acids and xenobiotics, that are preferentially enriched in aerobes. Overall it appears that the total number of oxygen-utilizing enzymes, and the presence of enzymes involved in 'peripheral', secondary oxygen metabolism, can reliably distinguish aerobes from anaerobes based solely on genome sequences. These criteria can also indicate the oxygen phenotype in metagenomic samples.									9	0	0	0	7	0	9			0891-5849	1873-4596		WOS:000485873700008	30935870

Modelling of Physico-chemical Phenomena between Gas inside a Bubble and Liquid Metal during Injection of Oxidant Gas								International Journal of Chemical Reactor Engineering				8				19 pp.	19 pp.						Feb. 2010	2010	Gas liquid reactors are extensively used in many metallurgical processes involving the refining of liquid metals. In these processes, reactions leading to the oxidation of various solutes in liquid metal often compete with each other, which ultimately determine the liquid metal composition. In the present paper, a model has been proposed to simulate the evolution of solute contents in a metallic melt considering mass transfer of solutes in the melt in the vicinity of the bubble, equilibrium at the gas-metal interface and gas composition evolution in the bubble during its ascent through the melt. The composition of solutes at the metal-gas interface in principle can be altered by changing the injected gas composition. The model was applied to the case of oxygen injection through a lance into liquid steel-containing C and Cr, aiming sufficient decarburization without much oxidation of Cr to the slag. The Cr loss to the slag by oxidation is generally much more than that expected based on equilibrium thermodynamics applied to the bulk metal and gas. The actual Cr loss, as shown by the present model, is determined by the composition of solutes at the metal-gas interface rather than in the bulk. The effect of change of the partial pressure of oxygen in the bubble by replacing oxygen by carbon dioxide in the injected gas and the corresponding evolution of C and Cr contents in the melt was simulated. Some preliminary experiments were conducted to validate the model predictions. The frame work of the model is generic and can be extended to many gas-liquid metal reactors in liquid metal processing.									0	0	0		0	0	0			1542-6580			INSPEC:11762391

The potential-dependent molecular behaviors were investigated by using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Q-mass) where the molecules are collected through a gas-sampling tip located in near the electrode surface. For the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the polycrystalline Pt electrode, the potential-dependent Q-mass ion signal intensities of O-2 (m/z = 32) that are ascribable to the dissolved oxygen molecules increased linearly with the disk electrode rotation rates without substantial interference from the collection tip, clearly showing that the dissolved O-2 for ORR can be monitored by the RDE-OLEMS. For electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (ECR) on the polycrystalline Au electrode, the potential-dependent Q-mass ion signal intensities of CO (m/z = 28) generated by the ECR increased with increasing disk rotation rates from 0 (without disk rotation) to 300 rpm in the potential region from -0.4 to -1.4 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode. The results demonstrate that the RDE-OLEMS enables us to evaluate the potential-dependent behaviors of reactant and product molecules present near the electrode surface under the mass transport-controlled condition.

J	Zhang Tai-Heng; Wang Xu-Cheng; Zhang Yuan-Tao								Numerical study on simplified reaction set of ground state species in CO2 discharges under Martian atmospheric conditions								ACTA PHYSICA SINICA				70	21					215201	10.7498/aps.70.20210664				NOV 5 2021	2021	The exploration of Mars has attracted increasing interest in these years. The experiments and simulations show that strong electric field triggered by the dust storms in the Martian atmosphere may cause CO2 discharge. Studies on this phenomenon will not only help deepen our comprehension on the evolution of Martian surface, but also provide a possibility to realize the in-situ oxygen generation on Mars based on plasma chemistry. In this paper, a zero-dimensional global model is used to simplify the complicated description of CO2 chemical kinetics, therefore a reduced chemistry can be obtained for detailed numerical simulation in the near future. At the beginning of simplification, the graph theoretical analysis is used to pre-treat the original model by exploring the relationship between reacting species. Through the study of connectivity and the topological network, species such as O-2, e, and CO prove to be important in the information transmission of the network. While gaining a clearer understanding of the chemistry model, dependence analysis will be used to investigate numerical simulation results. In this way a directed relation diagram can be obtained, where the influence between different species is quantitively explained in terms of numerical solutions. Users could keep different types of species correspondingly according to their own needs, and in this paper, some species with low activeness such as CO2, O-5(+), O-4(-) and species with uncertainties such as C2O2+, CO4+ are removed from the original model. As for the reduction of specific reactions among species, the reaction proportion analysis based on the calculation of reaction rates is used to obtain the contribution of each reaction to the entire process of CO2 discharge, through which the important reactions can be selected. Finally, a simplified chemistry model of CO2 discharge based on Martian atmospheric conditions, including 16 species and 67 reactions, is established. The numerical simulations show that the trends of species densities based on the simplified chemistry model are highly consistent with those based on the original one, and considerations about the CO2 conversion and the energy efficiency are also in line with expectations, which can help deepen the understanding of the essential process of CO2 discharge under Martian atmospheric conditions. In addition, the quantitative results of the relationship between reactive species will lay a theoretical foundation for the accurate analysis of various products in Martian dust storm discharges and the realization of Mars in-situ oxygen generation technology based on plasma chemistry.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-3290			WOS:000716870500019

The UV disinfection in wastewater treatment plants is one of the essential processes before PPCPs enter the water environment, so it is crucial to elucidate the photolytic behavior and mechanism of PPCPs under UV radiation. In this work, carbamazepine (CBZ) and caffeine (CAF) were selected as typical pollutants to investigate the effect of water matrixes, humic acid, inorganic ions, and pH on the UV radiation performance. Hydroxyl radical (OH) and singlet oxygen (1O2) were identified by quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra as playing a dominant role in the degradation process. UPLC-TOF/MS was conducted to identify 13 and 14 possible intermediates of CBZ and CAF, respectively. Moreover, combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Frontier Molecular Orbital and Fukui index), hydroxylation, oxidation, and ring cleavage were proposed as the main degradation pathways of the contaminants, which occurred first at the C(7C), N(17N) and O(18O) sites of CBZ and at the C(9C) site of CAF. The bio-acute toxicity experiment and the Ecological Structure-Activity Relationships (ECOSAR) program were performed to analyze and predict the toxicity of the intermediates of CBZ and CAF under UV radiation, respectively. The results showed that the acute toxicity of both solutions increased after UV radiation and followed with the combined toxicity.

As the electrocatalyst, Cu-CeO2-3.9 with a large surface area of 95.2 m(2) g(-1) and mesoporous structure exhibits high electrocatalytic activity toward the N-2 reduction reaction (NRR), delivering an NH3 yield rate of 5.3 x 10(-10) mol s(-1) cm(-2) and a faradaic efficiency of 19.1% at -0.45 V (vs. RHE) in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte (pH = 6.3), much higher than the NRR performance achieved with pure CeO2 nanorods. The Cu doping can effectively tune the concentration of multiple oxygen vacancies in CeO2, thus resulting in significantly improved NRR activity.									103	9	0	0	1	0	104			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000462657900013	30778469	
J	Gholipour, Hamed; Kermani, Mohammad J.; Zamanian, Rahim								Coupled pore network model for the cathode gas diffusion layer in PEM fuel cells								ACTA MECHANICA SINICA				37	2			331	348		10.1007/s10409-020-01005-7		NOV 2020		FEB 2021	2021	A pore network model (PNM) is developed for gas diffusion layer (GDL) in the cathode side of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The model is coupled to network models of reactant oxygen and electron transport inside GDL and also to simple models of catalyst layer and membrane. The coupled model captures the simultaneous effect of reactant and charge access to reaction sites and the resulting water generation, allowing it a transient nature up to reaching the steady state, which is a notable modification to the available PNMs which assume uniform invasion of liquid water from catalyst layer. The results show strongly non-uniform water saturation distributions inside GDL with maxima under the current collector ribs. As an extra feature, the model can predict time evolution of oxygen concentration and water generation rate at catalyst layer as a result of liquid water build-up in GDL. Also included is a dry case coupled model in order to be compared with the main model. The local water blockages in GDL inflict an average of 38.8% loss on the produced limiting current of the fuel cell. Finally, the coupling allows prediction of concentration overvoltages which emerges to be most pronounced in the under-rib region.

It is found that the presence of platinum nanoparticles has a significant influence of the morphology of the platinum electrodeposited onto the electrode surface. Even though the morphology of the materials is affected, the overall surface area is similar. The electrochemical behaviour of the platinum nanostructures is investigated in 1 M H2SO4 where distinct differences are observed in the exposed surface sites for platinum electrodeposited in the presence of nanoparticles. The influence of these surface sites is then studied for a variety of electrocatalytic reactions such as methanol and ethylene glycol oxidation and the hydrogen evolution reaction. In the case of organic molecule oxidation reactions, the platinum structures created using platinum nanoparticles in the electrodeposition solution exhibited earlier onset potentials and increased current densities compared to those that were electrodeposited in their absence.

In this study, low-cost and hollow structured bimetal phosphide nanowires are synthesized directly on Ni foam via the Kirkendall effect by using NaH(2)PO(2)as a phosphorizing agent at 350 degrees C. Both the crystal and hollow structures of the obtained phosphide can be efficiently tuned by controlling the amount of phosphorizing agent and the phosphorizing time. The morphology and microstructure of the obtained phosphides are characterised using various techniques, which indicate that the formation mechanism of the hollow structure is consistent with the Kirkendall effect. The optimized bimetal phosphide sample demonstrates a low onset potential (59 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), low charge transfer resistance (0.83 omega) and superior durability in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for water electrolysis. The electrochemical results clearly demonstrate that the hollow structure can efficiently improve the HER properties and the obtained phosphide is a promising HER catalysts for water splitting in KOH or seawater electrolytes.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000556852800001	32604073

Herein, we report Ru nanoparticles anchored at edge-selectively nitrogenated graphitic nanoplatelets (Ru-ENG) instead of on the basal plane in two-dimensional (2D) graphitic substrate. The Ru nanoparticles interacted with both of armchair-ENG and zigzag-ENG substrate lead to favorable hydrogen evolution activities of icosahedron cluster Ru-13 in Ru-ENG at a universal pH, compared to Ru metal cluster. The spontaneous electron re-construction between edge-site of N and ruthenium particles in Ru-ENG catalyst is attributed to the faster reaction kinetics with lower Tafel slopes and higher turnover frequencies than the benchmark Pt/C catalyst in any pH conditions. More importantly, the Ru-ENG electrocatalyst exhibited superior long-term consecutive stability (over 1,500 h) at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in the practical water-splitting system.									13	1	0	0	1	0	14			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000571078800001

With the help of this method, in situ surface modification of electrocatalyst is achieved without using pre-made seeds or complex synthesis procedure. Herein, with the purpose of finding an in situ and simple electrochemical activation protocol, the green synthesis of Au/Pd nanoparticles (AuPd) by means of polyoxometalate (POM) is reported. Structural analysis of the AuPd nanohybrid unveil the Au-core/Pd-shell structure which surrounded by POM. We propose a novel cathodic electrochemical activation in phosphate buffer solution which can greatly boost the electrocatalytic activity of the as-prepared AuPd and Pd electrocatalyst not only for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as a model of electro-reduction, but also for methanol and ethanol electro-oxidation reaction (MOR & EOR). For the HER in 1 M NaOH solution, after the electrochemical activation, the needed potential to drive a geometrical current density of 10 mA cm(-2) significantly decreases from - 400 mV vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) to -290 mV vs. RHE. For the EOR and MOR, electrochemically activated AuPd realized 3.4- and 2.9- fold increase in mass current density (mA mg(Pd)(-1)) with respect to the pristine AuPd electrocatalyst, respectively.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2046-2069		WOS:000629770100022	35423543

In this way, catalytic and diffusion properties of the electrodes can be evaluated at the same time. Moreover, DEMS, allows the detection of volatile and gaseous products and intermediates generated in the electrochemical reactions with good sensitivity. In this way, CO2 conversion efficiencies are evaluated during alcohol oxidation reaction. In the present communication, the electrochemical behaviour towards hydrogen evolution and CO and alcohol electrooxidation at different platinum-based catalysts has been studied using the new DEMS cell configuration. The relative yields of CO2 and by-side products during methanol oxidation have been evaluated to determine the CO2 conversion efficiency. In addition, the diffusional properties of diverse GDEs have been considered. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhang ZeMing; Shen Kun; Zhao XuDong; Shi Chao								Fluid during the UHP metamorphism: constraints from the petrology, oxygen isotope and fluid inclusion studies of the Sulu UHP metamorphic rocks.								ACTA PETROLOGICA SINICA				22	7			1985	1998						JUL 2006	2006	Based on the comprehensive investigations of the petrology, oxygen isotope, fluid inclusion and nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs) of the ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphic rocks from the Sulu orogenic belt it has been shown that fluids have played important and multiple roles and experienced complicated evolution processes by fluid-rock interactions during the subduction and exhumation of the continental crust. The features are as follows. (1) The supracrustal materials were extensively hydrated by the interaction with cold meteoric water with extremely low oxygen isotopic compositions. (2) A series of dehydration reactions took place during subduction of the hydrated continental crust; the released fluids mainly entered into volatile-bearing HP and UHP minerals, such as glaucophane, phengite and epidote, apatite, and into nominally anhydrous minerals, such as garnet, omphacite, rutile and coesite. (3) The salinity of the fluids increased by selective reactions with UHP metamorphic minerals; consequently high-salinity and high density aqueous fluids were produced at the peak-UHP metamorphism. In addition, fluids of CO2, N-2, CH4 or their mixtures occurred locally that are probably related with decomposition of organic substances. (4) Fluids exsolved from the NAMs are the main source for the HP hydrations of retrogression and for the forming of local HP veins during the early stage of uplift of UHP rocks. (5) Extensive amphibolite-facies retrograde metamorphism of UHP rocks took place by pervasive activities of low-salinity aqueous fluids. (6) The greenschist-facies overprinting and low-pressure quartz veins were produced by low-temperature fluid-rock interactions along the ductile-shear zones and brittle faults during the late stage of uplift of UHP rocks. (7) H2O and/or CO2-HO2 fluids with variable salinity were dominated during the subduction and exhumation of the continental crust.									14	12	0	0	0	0	19			1000-0569	2095-8927		WOS:000245957000026		
J	OLANDER, DR								INTERPRETATION OF LABORATORY CRUCIBLE EXPERIMENTS ON UO2 DISSOLUTION BY LIQUID ZIRCONIUM								JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS				224	3			254	265		10.1016/0022-3115(95)00085-2				SEP 1995	1995	The available experimental data on dissolution of UO2 crucibles by a molten Zircaloy charge are compare to a two-stage kinetic model. During the initial stage, melt saturation by uranium and oxygen is approached by natural-convection mass transfer. In the following precipitation stage, no further UO2 dissolution occurs but oxygen enters the melt as the crucible is reduced to UO2-x. This stage is controlled by solid-state diffusion of oxygen in the crucible. During this stage, the solid mixed-oxide (U, Zr)O-2-x precipitates from the melt. Comparison of the model with data from three sources includes the temporal. evolution of the uranium content of the melt and the effect of the oxygen content of the initial Zircaloy charge on the extent of crucible dissolution. Qualitative agreement of the model with the major features of the experimental data is obtained. The disagreement between data sets concerning behavior during the precipitation stage could not be resolved by the model, which did not (and could not) fully agree with all of the conflicting observations.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0022-3115			WOS:A1995RU45400008

The observation that folate in human serum is photosensitive supports the hypothesis that humans developed dark skin in high ultraviolet fluences areas in order to protect folate in the blood from UV radiation. However, folates alone are quite photostable. Therefore, in this study, we examined for the first time the photodegradation of 5MTHF in the presence of the endogenous photosensitizer uroporphyrin (Uro), which is sometimes present in low concentration in human serum, under UV and near-UV light exposure. We found strong indications that while 5MTHF alone is rather photostable, it is degraded quickly in the presence of Uro. Using deuterium oxide (D2O) as an enhancer of the lifetime of singlet oxygen and the singlet oxygen sensor green reagent (SOSG) as a scavenger of singlet oxygen, we have found that the photodegradation most likely proceeds via a type 11 photosensitization. Our results show that singlet oxygen is likely to be the main intermediate in the photodegradation of 5MTHF mediated by Uro. Our findings may be useful for further studies the evolution of human skin colours. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The kinetics of O-2 evolution is investigated as a function of either the catalyst concentration or the oxidant concentration by employing Ce(NH4)(2)(NO3)(6) as an oxidant; these catalysts can be classified into two groups that have different rate laws for O-2 evolution. In one class, the rate of O-2 evolution is linear to both the catalyst and Ce4+ concentrations, as briefly reported for [Ru(terpy)(bpy)(OH2)](2+) (S. Masaoka, K. Sakai, Chem. Lett. 2009, 38, 182). For the other class, [Ru-(tmtacn)(R(2)bpy)(OH2)](2+), the rate of O-2 evolution is quadratic to the catalyst concentration and independent of the Ce4+ concentration. Moreover, the singlet biradical character of the hydroxocerium(IV) ion was realized by experimental and DFT investigations. These results indicate that the radical coupling between the oxygen atoms of a Ru-v=O species and a hydroxocerium(IV) ion is the key step for the catalysis of [Ru(terpy)(bpy)(OH2)](2+) and [Ru(tpzm)(R(2)bpy)(OH2)](2+), while the well-known oxo-oxo radical coupling among two Ru-v=O species proceeds in the catalysis of [Ru(tmtacn)(R(2)bpy)-(OH2)](2+). This is the first report demonstrating that the radical character provided by the hydroxocerium(IV) ion plays a crucial role in the catalysis of such ruthenium complexes in the evolution of O-2 from water.									99	0	0	0	10	0	99			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000284515100008	20857479	
J	Ma, Zhong; Yuan, Chuan; Zhang, Shuai; Lu, Yonggang; Xiong, Junhui								Effect of supports on the redox performance of pyrite cinder in chemical looping combustion								CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING				37				168	174		10.1016/j.cjche.2020.11.034				SEP 2021	2021	Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is a clean and efficient flame-free combustion technology, which combust the fuels by lattice oxygen from a solid oxygen carrier with inherent CO2 capture. The development of oxygen carriers with low cost and high redox performance is crucial to the whole efficiency of CLC process. As the solid by-product from the sulfuric acid production, pyrite cinder presented excellent redox performance as an oxygen carrier in CLC process. The main components in pyrite cinder are Fe2O3, CaSO4, Al2O3 and SiO2 in which Fe2O3 is the active component to provide lattice oxygen. In order to systematic investigate the functions of supports (CaSO4, Al2O3 and SiO2) in pyrite cinder, three oxygen carriers (Fe2O3-CaSO4, Fe2O3-Al2O3 and Fe2O3-SiO2) were prepared and evaluated in this study. The results showed that Fe2O3-CaSO4 displayed high redox activity and cycling stability in the multiple redox cycles. However, both Fe2O3-Al2O3 and Fe2O3-SiO2 experienced serious deactivation during redox reactions. It indicated that the inert Fe-Si solid solution (Fe2SiO4) was formed in the spent Fe2O3-SiO2 sample, which decreased the oxygen carrying capacity of this sample. The XPS results showed that the oxygen species on the surface of Fe2O3-CaSO4 could be fully recovered after the 20 redox cycles. It can be concluded that CaSO4 is the key to the high redox activity and cycling stability of pyrite cinder.

We systematically explore electrocatalytic performances of Pt doped Mo2TiC2O2 monolayer by the first principles calculations. Our results show that the presence of donor defects in Mo2TiC2O2 can always increase the reaction free energy of hydrogen adsorption and further promotes the performance in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). More interestingly, the substitution of Pt for O in the Mo2TiC2 can modify the free energy to an ideal value and is responsible for the significantly enhanced catalytic activity. Furthermore, the large value of diffusion barrier indicates that single Pt atoms can be stabilized onto the O vacancy sites, which can effectively prevent them to aggregate into nanoparticles. Our works are useful for understanding the recent experimental observations and pave the way for further experimental improvements of catalytic activity for the HER.

An Analysis of the Impact of Particle Growth on Transport Losses in Polymer-Electrolyte Fuel Cells								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				168	5					054512	10.1149/1945-7111/abfcd8				MAY 1 2021	2021	Voltage cycling causes catalyst nanoparticles in polymer-electrolyte fuel cells to grow. The concomitant loss of interfacial area results in larger kinetic, transport, and possibly ohmic overpotentials. This paper uses recently published experimental data and mathematical models to investigate the evolutions of transport and ohmic resistances to platinum nanoparticles located on the surface and inside the micropores of carbon black supports. Resistance to oxygen transport rises as surface area declines primarily because the flux to each remaining larger platinum particle increases. The path lengths governing oxygen diffusion to surface and buried platinum sites also increase as nanoparticles grow. Platinum nanoparticles on the surface become relatively less favorable as voltage cycling proceeds because they grow faster than platinum in micropores. Because voltage cycling causes total interfacial area to decline, and the fraction located inside micropores to increase, nanoscale ohmic losses increase as a catalyst layer decays. The practical importance of this effect is difficult to discern because proton conductivity in carbon micropores is not well characterized.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000649127800001

They have high activity and maximal platinum-atom utilization. However, the bonding environment of platinum during operation is poorly understood. In this work, we present a mechanistic study of platinum SSCs using operando, synchrotron-X-ray absorption spectroscopy. We synthesize an atomically dispersed platinum complex with aniline and chloride ligands onto graphene and characterize it with ex-situ electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (XANES), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS). Then, by operando EXAFS and XANES, we show that as a negatively biased potential is applied, the Pt-N bonds break first followed by the Pt-CI bonds. The platinum is reduced from platinum(II) to metallic platinum(0) by the onset of the hydrogen-evolution reaction at 0 V. Furthermore, we observe an increase in Pt-Pt bonding, indicating the formation of platinum agglomerates. Together, these results indicate that while aniline is used to prepare platinum SSCs, the single-site complexes are decomposed and platinum agglomerates at operating potentials. This work is an important contribution to the understanding of the evolution of bonding environment in SSCs and provides some molecular insights into how platinum agglomeration causes the deactivation of SSCs over time.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000773693300042	35558899

These data define a steep, coherent gradient in delta 18O that is displaced a short distance (similar to 4 cm) into the periclase-free (Cal + Fo) layer. SEM and ion microprobe analyses show two isotopically and texturally distinct types of calcite at the grain scale. Clear (well polished) calcite grains are isotopically homogeneous (within analytical uncertainty; +/- 0.27, 2SD). More poorly polished (pitted), texturally retrograde 'turbid'-looking calcite has lower and more variable delta 18pO values, and replaces clear calcite along fractures, cleavage traces or grain boundaries. Despite significant lowering of the delta 18O values in calcite throughout both layers during prograde metamorphism, ion microprobe analyses indicate that individual clear calcite grains are now isotopically homogeneous across the entire gradient in delta 18sO. Diffusion calculations indicate that conservative time scales required for isotopic homogenization of calcite grains by volume diffusion, 30,000-62,000 years at 575-600 degrees C, exceed significantly the timescale (similar to 1,250 years) estimated for the prograde development of the delta 18O gradient at the boundary between these two marble layers. The ion microprobe data and these diffusion calculations suggest instead that surface reaction mechanisms accompanying recrystallization are responsible for the observed oxygen isotope homogeneity of these calcite grains. Thus, the ion microprobe data are consistent with the formation of calcite in oxygen isotope exchange equilibrium with infiltrating fluid during prograde reaction and recrystallization.									36	0	0	0	1	0	36			0010-7999	1432-0967		WOS:000260836600005

Coordination polymers (CPs) are promising candidates for various applications, including catalysis and energy storage, and their tailorable architecture provides the opportunity to realize enhanced performance. Herein, we report the synthesis of copper-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (Cu-PDA) based CPs and complexes with different structural motifs and their structure-controlled, highly stable, enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in neutral and alkaline medium. Cu-PDA CPs with water coordination and H-bonding functionality displayed superior HER activity (j(max) = 85 to 105 mA cm(-2)) compared to non-water-coordinated CPs and water-coordinated complexes. Importantly, water-coordinated Cu PDA-3 CPs required a low overpotential (eta = 290 mV) to achieve a geometric current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in neutral medium. The durability studies indicate that the catalyst is stable for 24 h without significant loss of activity. Impedance studies further support the higher activity of the water-coordinated and H-bonded functional network structure. According to our knowledge, this is the lowest overpotential reported for pure CP electrocatalysts in neutral medium without requiring complementary conducting materials.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000480640900016

A solid metallic precursor method has recently been developed for preparing thin BaTiO3/noble metal laminates. In the present paper, the phase and microstructural evolution of Ba-Ti metallic precursors were examined after oxidation at 300-degrees to 900-degrees-C in pure oxygen at 1 atm pressure. Barium peroxide, BaO2, formed rapidly during oxidation at 300-degrees-C, with titanium largely remaining as unoxidized particles in the peroxide matrix. Between 375-degrees and 500-degrees-C, the solid-state reaction of barium peroxide with metallic titanium yielded barium orthotitanate, Ba2TiO4. Further exposure to temperatures between 500-degrees and 900-degrees-C resulted in the oxidation of residual metallic titanium. The oxidized titanium then reacted with the orthotitanate matrix to form barium metatitanate, BaTiO3. The rate of formation of BaTiO3 was found to be strongly dependent on the degree of milling of the Ba-Ti precursors and on the heating rate between 300-degrees and 500-degrees-C.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:A1994NB05500017

Maxwell-Stefan analysis is uniquely applied to both micro and macropores within the framework of the dusty-gas model to account for the bidisperse nature of the char, which differs significantly from the conventional models that are based on a single pore type. The peripheral fragmentation and random-pore correlation incorporated into the model enable prediction of structure/reactivity relationships. The occurrence of chemical reaction within the boundary layer reported by Biggs and Agarwal (Chem. Eng. Sci. 52 (1997) 941) has been confirmed through an analysis of CO/CO2 product ratio obtained from model simulations. However, it is also quantitatively observed that the significance of boundary layer reaction reduces notably with the reduction of oxygen concentration in the flue gas, operational pressure and film thickness. Computations have also shown that in the presence of diffusional gradients peripheral fragmentation occurs in the early stages on the surface, after which conversion quickens significantly due to small particle size. Results of the early commencement of peripheral fragmentation at relatively low overall conversion obtained from a large number of simulations agree well with experimental observations reported by Feng and Bhatia (Energy & Fuels 14 (2000) 297). Comprehensive analysis of simulation results is carried out based on well accepted physical principles to rationalise model prediction. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It has been inevitable to develop metal-free catalysts in terms of sustainability, the environment, and economic feasibility. Carbon-based materials are called metal-free electrocatalysts and are regarded as one of the most promising candidates due to their abundant source, but they often show poor activity. The strategic aim of this study is to convert commercial carbon fiber into heteroatom-doped graphene-like surfaced fibers via an eco-friendly and fast intercalation/semi-exfoliation mechanism called Yucel's method. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) verified that the intercalation has successfully taken place and that the heteroatoms (S, O) are connected to the graphene-like structure by covalent bonds. The catalysts with 1 M H2SO4 showed superior HER performance compared to bare CF.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2196-0216			WOS:000747395000010

Herein, density functional theory (DFT) predictions reveal that the electronic structure and localized charge density at the heterointerface of NiP2-FeP2 can be significantly modulated upon coupling with metallic Cu, resulting in optimized proton adsorption energy and reduced barrier for water dissociation, synergistically boosting alkaline HER. Motivated by theoretical predictions, we developed a facile strategy to fabricate interface-rich NiP2-FeP2 coupled with Cu nanowires (Cu-NW) grown on Cu foam (NiP2-FeP2/Cu-NW/Cu-f). Benefiting from the superior intrinsic activity, conductivity, and copious active sites, the obtained catalyst exhibited exceptional alkaline HER activity requiring a low overpotential of 23.6 mV at -10 mA/cm(2), surpassing the state-of-the-art Pt. Additionally, a full electrolyzer required a cell voltage of 1.42/1.4 V at 10 mA/cm(2) in alkaline water/seawater with promising stability. This work highlights a design principle for advanced HER catalysts and beyond.									66	3	0	0	2	0	67			2380-8195			WOS:000619803400007

The EF experiments have been performed in an electrochemical cell using a carbon-felt cathode. The effect of applied current in the range 60-500 mA and catalyst concentration in the range 0.05-0.5 mM on the kinetics of oxidative degradation and mineralization efficiency have been investigated. Degradation of LEV by hydroxyl radicals was found to follow pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics. The absolute rate constant for oxidative degradation of LEV by hydroxyl radical has been determined by a competition kinetics method and found to be (2.48 +/- 0.18) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1). An optimum current value of 400 mA and a catalyst (Fe2+) concentration of 0.1 mM were observed to be optimal for an effective degradation of LEV under our operating conditions. Mineralization of aqueous solution of LEV was performed by the chemical oxygen demand analysis and an almost mineralization degree (>91%) was reached at the end of 6 h of electrolysis. A number of intermediate products have been identified using high performance liquid chromatography and liquid chrmatography-mass spectrometry analyses. Based on these identified reaction intermediates, a plausible reaction pathway has been suggested for the mineralization process. The formation and evolution of[GRAPHICS]and[GRAPHICS]ions released to the medium during the process were also discussed.									34	4	0	0	22	0	38			0959-3330	1479-487X		WOS:000371814600011	26508263

Relevant experimental and theoretical findings of the dynamic structural evolution of bimetallic catalysts under the reaction conditions are emerging, thus enabling the design of more consistent, reliable, and efficient bimetallic catalysts. In an initial attempt to provide an atomic-level understanding of the adsorption-induced structural evolution of bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) under CO oxidation conditions, we used density functional theory to study the details of CO-adsorption-driven Pd surface segregation in (AuPd)(147) bimetallic NPs. The strong CO affinity of Pd provides a driving force for Pd surface segregation. We found that the vertex site of the NP becomes a gateway for the initial Pd-Au swapping and the subsequent formation of an internal vacancy. This self-generated internal vacancy easily diffuses inside the NP and activates Pd-Au swapping pathways in the (100) NP facet. Our results reveal how the surface and internal concentrations of bimetallic NPs respond immediately to changes in the reaction conditions. Our findings should aid in the rational design of highly active and versatile bimetallic catalysts by considering the environmental factors that systematically affect the structure of bimetallic catalysts under the reaction conditions.									19	0	0	0	3	0	19			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000408435400030	28799609

In particular, we calculate the oxygen yield for a given IMF, using the most recent calculations of supernova nucleosynthesis. Assuming instantaneous recycling of oxygen, we calculate the resultant oxygen abundance. The predicted and observed oxygen abundances in our Galaxy are compared, and we find that the overall abundance is well explained by the IMF determined in the solar neighborhood. It is shown that the oxygen abundance is very sensitive to the underlying IMF; some of the modified IMFs proposed for our Galaxy and starburst galaxies result in an oxygen abundance an order of magnitude larger than solar. Thus the fact that the available data for normal spiral galaxies including our own Galaxy show the overall oxygen abundance to be about solar suggests a rather constant IMF outside the solar neighborhood. We take into account the effects of infall and ejection of material in normal disk galaxies and find that the impact on the metallicity is in general small compared to any modification of the IMF. We discuss implications of our results for models of starburst galaxies. We conclude that truncation of the IMF in starburst regions results in an oxygen abundance in conflict with the available observations, unless very large mass loss (perhaps 10 times more than the mass presently observed in these regions) has occurred.									42	0	0	0	0	0	42			0004-637X			WOS:A1993KU60700024

The aim of this work is to develop a better understanding of electrochemical characteristics of these intermetallic phases. In particular, information was sought concerning (a) their galvanic couple relationship with respect to Al and (b) the relationship between the passive film formed on each phase and its ability to support both cathodic and anodic electron transfer reactions (ETR). The open circuit potentials (OCPs) of all three intermetallic phases were more positive than that of Al in inert solutions ranging from pH 2 to 12. The Al2Cu phase supports the reduction of water reaction at enhanced rates relative to pure Al due to the presence of metallic Cu(o) in an Al2O3 rich oxide but supports oxygen evolution due to a combination of this effect as well as formation of more electrically conductive copper oxides. A similar effect is observed for Al3Ta and is attributed mainly to the formation of a more conductive mixed oxide containing Ta2O5.

Facile and scalable synthesis of these 2D ultrathin nanosheets, however, is still a great challenge. Here, we report a liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) method to synthesize single- and few-layer TM (oxy)hydroxide and oxide nanosheets (beta-Ni(OH)(2), delta-FeOOH, beta-CoOOH, and monoclinic LixMnO2) with high-yield and rapid procedure. In the LPE synthesis, the preformed Li2O2 nanosheets with (001) exposed planes function as substrates, enabling the epitaxial growth of TM hydroxides with coherent interface. The final TM (oxy)hydroxides and oxides ultrathin nanosheets can be obtained by in situ oxidation and removal of Li2O2 with simple distilled water washing. To demonstrate their potential applications, the obtained single- and few-layer beta-Ni(OH)(2) ultrathin nanosheets are coupled with functionalized graphene sheets (FGS), and tested as catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and as cathodes for alkaline Ni/Fe battery. Importantly, the single-layer beta-Ni(OH)(2)/FGS composite electrode exhibits excellent catalytic performance for OER and superior charge storage capability for Ni/Fe battery. The present work provides new opportunity for the high-yield synthesis of 2D materials for energy-related applications and beyond.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2405-8297			WOS:000586658000006

In multi-scale problems such as carbon fiber composite oxidation, these effects need to be tracked at the microscopic scale of individual carbon fibers. A multi-scale model is derived in this paper for predicting species distribution in such problems using a fully coupled multi-scale homogenization approach. The homogenized fluxes from the micro-scale are derived using Hill's macro-homogeneity condition accounting for both flux jumps and species density field jumps at the reacting interface in the micro-scale unit cell. At the macro-scale, the competition between the transport of reacting species (oxygen) and the reaction product (carbon dioxide) is modeled using homogenized mass conservation equations. The moving reaction front in carbon fibers at the micro-scale is tracked using level set method and an adaptive meshing strategy. The macroscopic weight loss of the composite when exposed to oxygen is simulated as a function of time using a coupled finite element methodology at various locations in a validated macroscopic model.

Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis cells use iridium, one of the scarcest elements on earth, as catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction. In the present study, the expected iridium demand and potential bottlenecks in the realization of PEMWE for hydrogen production in the targeted GW a(-1) scale are assessed in a model built on three pillars: (i) an in-depth analysis of iridium reserves and mine production, (ii) technical prospects for the optimization of PEM water electrolyzers, and (iii) PEMWE installation rates for a market ramp-up and maturation model covering 50 years. As a main result, two necessary preconditions have been identified to meet the immense future iridium demand: first, the dramatic reduction of iridium catalyst loading in PEM electrolysis cells and second, the development of a recycling infrastructure for iridium catalysts with technical end-of-life recycling rates of at least 90%.

J	Singh, JP; Singh, RN								Electrocatalytic properties of spinel-type MxCo3-xO4 oxides prepared by a new sol-gel route for O-2 evolution in alkaline solutions								INDIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY SECTION A-INORGANIC BIO-INORGANIC PHYSICAL THEORETICAL & ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				39	8			819	825						AUG 2000	2000	Electrocatalytic properties of the spinel-type MxCo3-xO4 (M = Cu, Ni or Mn) oxides, prepared by a new sol-gel route, for O-2 evolution in alkaline solutions have been studied using AC impedance, cyclic voltammetry and Tafel polarization techniques. The oxides have been produced in the film form on pretreated Ni-supports by an oxide-slurry painting method. Results show that 0.25 and 0.5 mol Ni/or Cu substitutions in the base oxide enhance the oxide roughness greatly; but their higher substitutions (> 0.5 mel) do not improve the roughness further. Mn-substitutions seem to have little influence on the oxide roughness. Cu and Ni substitutions enhance the apparent electrocatalytic activity of the oxide also; the electrocatalytic influence, however, is highest with 0.5 mol in the case of Cu and 0.75 mol in the case of Ni-substitution. The apparent electrocatalytic activity is improved with 0.25 mol Mn also. In contrast, the real electrocatalytic activity of the oxide is considerably reduced in the presence of Ni, Cu and 0.5-1.0 mol Mn. Tafel slope and the reaction order for the O-2 evolution reaction on each oxide are similar to2.3 RT/F and similar to1, respectively.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0376-4710			WOS:000090123200005

While Ir is the only catalyst with good activity and durability for PEMWE, Ir is the rarest material on earth. Ir minimization is crucial to expand the application of PEMWE. Previously, we reported ultrathin IrO2 nanoneedles (NN) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in PEMWE. Although IrO2 NN showed good electrical conductivity, its activity should be improved. Here, the OER activity of the NNs is further improved by depositing amorphous Ir atomic clusters (AC) on the one-dimensional NNs. The amorphous Ir ACs are highly active for the OER and the crystalline NN backbone aids facile electron transfers to the surface ACs. The het-erostructure of the Ir AC/NN catalysts decouple a trade-off relation between the OER activity and durability. PEMWE with the Ir AC/NN catalysts achieves a current density of 3 A cm(-2) at only 1.82 V and operates stably for more than 90 h, whereas pristine IrO2 NN and IrO2 particles synthesized by Adams-fusion method require higher potentials of 1.92 V and 1.97 V, respectively, at 3 A cm(-2).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000779263900002

Since raising the voltage beyond the thermodynamic potential for water splitting (1.23 V) can boost the energy density, there has been much effort on water-stabilizing salvation additives such as Li2SO4 that can provide an aqueous electrolyte capable of withstanding similar to 1.8 V. Guided by the first-principles calculations that reveal water can promote hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, here, we pursue a new strategy of covering the electrode with a dense electroplated polymerized polyacrylic acid, which is an electron insulator but a proton conductor and proton reservoir. The combined effect of salvation and coating expands the electrochemical window throughout pH 3 to pH 10 to 2.4 V for both fast and slow proton-mediated redox reactions. This allows activated carbon to quadruple the energy density, a kilogram of nitrogen-doped graphene to provide 127 Watt-hour, and both to have improved endurance because of suppression of water-mediated corrosion. Therefore, aqueous supercapacitors can now achieve energy densities quite comparable to that of a lithium-ion battery, but at 100 times the charging/discharging speed and cycle durability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2639-5274		WOS:000576609200001	33103117

In our work, in situ electrooxidation as an effective way has been used to modulate the electronic states of active sites for ruthenium hydroxides, which provides obviously enhanced activity for HER in alkaline media. Ag-modified nickel foam (NF) as substrate can provide the excellent conductivity to improve the charge transfer rate of Ru(OH)(x)/Ag/NF. In situ electro-oxidation process has been conducted for Ru(OH)(x)/Ag/NF through OER measurements in alkaline media, which results in the formation of more Ru (IV) as higher actives sites for HER. Compared to Ru(OH)(x)/NF, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and polarization curves prove that Ag doping in Ru(OH)(x)/Ag/NF may contribute to the oxidization of ruthenium from Ru (III) to Ru (IV) during in situ electro-oxidation. The obtained Ru(OH)(x)/Ag/NF exhibits Pt-like HER activity with a very low overpotential of 103.2 mV to drive 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. The excellent stability of Ru(OH)(x)/Ag/NF has also been demonstrated. Therefore, our work provides a new strategy by modulating valence state of active sites for transition metal hydroxides for efficient HER. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, enzymes belonging to this class exhibit a very low stability in the presence of peroxides. With the aim of bypassing this fast and irreversible inactivation, we study the use of a gradual supply of hydrogen peroxide to maintain its concentration at stoichiometric levels. In this contribution, we report a multienzymatic cascade for in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide. In the first step, in the presence of NAD(+) cofactor, formate dehydrogenase from Candida boidinii (FDH) catalysed the oxidation of formate yielding CO2. Reduced NADH was reoxidised by the reduction of the flavin mononucleotide cofactor bound to an old yellow enzyme homologue from Bacillus subtilis (YqjM), which subsequently reacts with molecular oxygen yielding hydrogen peroxide. Finally, this system was coupled to the hydroxylation of ethylbenzene reaction catalysed by an evolved peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita (rAaeUPO). Additionally, we studied the influence of different reaction parameters on the performance of the cascade with the aim of improving the turnover of the hydroxylation reaction.									12	0	0	0	3	0	12			0939-5075	1865-7125		WOS:000459670900007	30379645	
J	Siess, L.								Evolution of massive AGB stars III. the thermally pulsing super-AGB phase								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				512						A10	10.1051/0004-6361/200913556				MAR-APR 2010	2010	Aims. We present the first simulations of the full evolution of super-AGB stars through the entire thermally pulsing AGB phase. We analyse their structural and evolutionary properties and determine the first SAGB yields.Methods. Stellar models of various initial masses and metallicities were computed using standard physical assumptions which prevents the third dredge-up from occurring. A postprocessing nucleosynthesis code was used to compute the SAGB yields, to quantify the effect of the third dredge-up (3DUP), and to assess the uncertainties associated with the treatment of convection.Results. Owing to their massive oxygen-neon core, SAGB stars suffer weak thermal pulses, have very short interpulse periods and develop very high temperatures at the base of their convective envelope (up to 140 x 10(8) K), leading to very efficient hot bottom burning. SAGB stars are consequently heavy manufacturers of He-4, C-13, and N-14. They are also able to inject significant amounts of Li-7, O-17, Mg-25, and Al-26,Al-27 in the interstellar medium. The 3DUP mainly affects the CNO yields, especially in the lower metallicity models. Our post-processing simulations also indicate that changes in the temperature at the base of the convective envelope, which would result from a change in the efficiency of convective energy transport, have a dramatic impact on the yields and represent another major source of uncertainty.									122	0	0	0	0	0	122			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000276245500044

We used angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy combined with density-functional theory (DFT) to study the reactivity of V-O-induced states at the (001) surface of anatase TiO2, where both 2D metallic and deeper lying in-gap states (IGs) are observed. The 2D and IG states exhibit remarkably different evolutions when the surface is exposed to molecular O-2: while IGs are almost completely quenched, the metallic states are only weakly affected. DFT calculations indeed show that the IGs originate from surface V(O)s and remain localized at the surface, where they can promptly react with O-2. In contrast, the metallic states originate from subsurface vacancies whose migration to the surface for recombination with O-2 is kinetically hindered on anatase TiO2 (001), thus making them much less sensitive to oxygen dosing.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2475-9953			WOS:000517314500009

Herein, we demonstrate a facile one-pot hydro thermal synthesis of ultrafine and monodisperse NiS/NiS2 heteronanoparticles (ca. 3.2 nm) uniformly in situ grown on N-doped reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (denoted as NiS/NiS2@N-rGO hereafter). In such unique NiS/NiS2@N-rGO sample, the tiny-sized NiS/NiS2 heteronanoparticles with abundant intimate interfacial contacts allow the effective modification of the electronic structure and more exposure of catalytically active sites. Moreover, the conductive N-rGO support could serve as a "highway" of in-plane charge transfer and facilitate the mass diffusion during the electrocatalytic process. As a consequence, the resultant NiS/NiS2@N-rGO catalyst exhibits a superior HER performance with an overpotential of 148 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution. The NiS/NiS2CPN-rGO catalyst could also endure long-term operation for 12 h with negligible activity attenuation and morphological change. The present study provides a feasible approach to explore efficient and robust non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for a variety of renewable electrochemical applications.

In addition, the mechanisms involved in the photoinduced changes of the NP PL spectrum are discussed. The NPs of CdSe/ZnS placed on a thin film of an insulator (GaAsOx/GaAs or SiO2/Si) exhibited PL decay and blueshifts on a time scale of minutes depending on the excitation wavelength, i.e., higher photon energy induces a faster PL decay with a larger and faster blueshift. The PL decay with 435 nm excitation was a single exponential in temporal evolution, while the delayed acceleration of decay was observed with 365 nm excitation. The excitation-wavelength dependence of the blueshift was much larger than that of the PL decay, indicating that they originate from independent photoinduced reactions. This was confirmed by an ultrahigh vacuum measurement where only PL decay was observed without any blueshift. This result clearly reveals that the blueshift is caused by photoinduced oxidation with atmospheric oxygen. Similar temporal PL evolutions were observed in single-NP measurements as gradual changes in colors. The most probable mechanism for PL decay is the photoinduced extraction of surface-protecting molecules from the NPs, which induces nonradiative recombinations of photoexcited electron-hole pairs.

The unique ultrathin structure provides an alternative way of modifying the surface phase or electronic structure for engineering the intrinsic electrocatalysts properties. Here, we focus on recent attempts to discuss the concerning surface chemical modification strategies of surface atoms incorporation, defect engineering, and surface structure modulation, which could respectively enhance the intrinsic electrical conductivity, optimizing the reaction energy barrier while maintaining the primary 2D structural stability. Following this review, we listed the surface-functional 2D materials for enhanced electrocatalytic processes involved in the water splitting, oxygen/nitrogen reduction reactions, as well as density functional theoretical (DFT) calculation to study the relationship between electronic structure, adsorption energy, and apparent activity sites.

J	Shin, JY; Cheney, MA								Abiotic dealkylation and hydrolysis of atrazine by birnessite								ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY				24	6			1353	1360		10.1897/04-248R.1				JUN 2005	2005	Atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) and its degradation products are important contaminants of world water systems and have effects on aquatic life. These effects are modulated by the degradation of atrazine, which depends, in part, on its reactivity with soil minerals. We have studied the degradation reaction of atrazine on synthetic birnessite (delta-MnO2) in the aqueous phase using a batch reactor and a developed high-performance liquid chromatography method. The reaction was studied in the absence of light at 25 degrees C and between pH 2.3 to pH 8.3. The reaction rates increased with decreasing pH and increasing delta-MnO2 loading, and they did not follow simple first-order kinetics. The major products are hydroxylated and mono- and didealkylatrazine. Ammeline and cyanuric acid also were detected. The half-life (t(1/2)) for the degradation of atrazine was approximately 16.8 d and independent of oxygen. Manganese(II) evolution was a minor product. The mechanism of dealkylation involved proton transfer to Mn(IV)- stabilized oxo and imido bonds, with no net oxidation and reduction. Oxidation was a secondary reaction. The proposed abiotic pathway for the transformation of atrazine on delta-MnO2 was identical to the reported biotic pathway. Thus, delta-MnO2, a common soil component, facilitated the efficient N-dealkylation and hydrolysis of the herbicide atrazine at 25 degrees C, possibly via a nonoxidative mechanisms. The N-dealkylation has been attributed strictly to a biological process in soils.									23	1	0	0	17	0	25			0730-7268	1552-8618		WOS:000229140400007	16117110

Introducing hydroxyls in TiO2 is respected to reduce the energy barrier of hydrogen formation. Herein, a simple one-step fabrication of highly self-hydroxylated TiO2 mesocrystals (MCs) for enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is proposed. TiO2 single crystals (SCs), polycrystals (PCs) and MCs are obtained via regulating the pH of the precursor during hydrothermal treatment. Results indicate that the moderate alkaline condition is favorable for the synthesis of highly self-hydroxylated TiO2 MCs. Compared with SCs, PCs and commercial P25 TiO2 nanoparticles, MCs exhibit the best photocatalytic activity in H-2 evolution. Specifically, the maximum hydrogen evolution rate under solar light illumination (22.8 mmol/h/g) is 10.5 times higher than that of P25. Moreover, the MCs exhibit excellent catalytic stability and the hydrogen evolution rate can be maintained at 20.8 mmoVh/g under solar illumination after five cycles of reactions. The highly selfhydroxylated TiO2 MCs are constructed from crystallographically oriented nanocrystals with abundant hydroxyls. The unique superstructure and large surface area of MCs enable the effective charge separation and transport. Moreover, the high density of hydroxyls can reduce the recombination rate of photo-generated free charges and energy barrier for hydrogen formation while facilitate light absorption. The synthesis of highly self-hydroxylated TiO2 MCs and the underlying mechanism offer interesting insights for modifying the structure and properties of TiO2 towards high-performance hydrogen evolution.

A standardized method for the stable isotopic analysis of skeletal carbonate has not yet been established, despite the importance of these data. In this study, significant differences in the stable oxygen isotope values of bones and dental enamel were observed, which arose due to instrument- and methodology-based differences. The same target archaeological samples were analyzed in three laboratories, and the stable isotope analyses were supplemented by Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements, which detected a strong OH- concentration-dependence in the stable oxygen isotopic shifts measured between the three laboratories. Laboratory experiments were conducted to quantify the effects of reaction temperature and phosphoric acid (H3PO4) concentration on the oxygen isotopic composition of carbonate, both of which resulted in significant, though smaller delta O-18 changes than the OH-related delta O-18 change. As such, we suggest that the delta O-18 values of bone structural carbonate should not be included in anthropological interpretation and that the analysis of tooth enamel should be conducted at 70 degrees C using 102% H3PO4, in order to make the results comparable. Furthermore, carbonated hydroxylapatite (CHAP) reference materials with varied isotopic compositions should be developed in the near future.									10	1	0	0	6	0	11			0305-4403	1095-9238		WOS:000486100900001

Heptafluorobutanoic acid could be degraded with this photocatalyst in a light-induced reaction generating carbon dioxide and fluoride anions. Carbon dioxide evolution in a significant amount occurred only in the presence of molecular oxygen and the photocatalyst.The light-induced degradation of trifluoroacetic acid, pentafluoropropanoic acid, nonafluorobutanoic acid, pentadecafluorooctanoic acid, nonafluorobutanesulfonic acid, and heptadecafluorooctanesulfonic acid in the presence of titanium dioxide was also studied. The perfluorocarboxylic acids under investigation are degraded to generate CO(2) and fluoride anions while both perfluorinated sulfonic acids are persistent under the experimental conditions employed in this study.For all compounds photonic efficiencies of the mineralization reaction were estimated to be smaller than 1 x 10(-5).To increase the photocatalytic activity mixed systems containing homogeneous phosphotungstic acid and heterogeneous titanium dioxide catalysts were also investigated.

J	SABAT, SC; VIJAYAVERGIYA, V; TRIPATHY, BC; MOHANTY, P								INHIBITORY EFFECT OF CROWN COMPOUND ON PHOTOELECTRON TRANSPORT ACTIVITY OF BEET SPINACH THYLAKOID MEMBRANES								ZEITSCHRIFT FUR NATURFORSCHUNG C-A JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES				46	1-2			87	92						JAN-FEB 1991	1991	The effect of K-picrate-18-crown-6 (crown) on the photoelectron transport activity of beet spinach thylakoid membranes was investigated. Addition of micromolar concentration of crown to thylakoid preparation inhibited p-benzoquinone, chloride-indophenol, methyl viologen supported Hill activities maximally by 75 per cent in a concentration dependent manner. However, the photosystem I catalyzed reaction remained insensitive to crown suggesting that crown specifically inhibits photosystem II electron transport. Addition of exogenous electron donors like hydroxylamine or diphenylcarbazide failed to restore the crown induced inhibition of photosystem II electron transport and lowering of steady state chlorophyll a fluorescence yield. These observations suggest that crown also inhibits photosystem II catalyzed electron transport after the donation sites of these exogenous donors. Washing of the crown pre-treated thylakoids with isolation buffer, relieved the crown inhibited electron transport activity, indicating that this inhibition is reversible. Furthermore, in hydroxylamine washed thylakoids which are devoid of O2 evolution capacity, the hydroxylamine induced increase in chlorophyll a fluorescence of variable yield was quenched by the addition of crown. These observations suggest that crown affects the oxygen evolution and inhibits at a site close to photosystem II reaction centres.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			0939-5075			WOS:A1991EZ40600013

In this study, the novel 3D ultrafine Ni NP-embedded and B- and N-codoped hierarchically porous carbon nanowires (denoted as Ni@BNPCFs) were successfully synthesized via pyrolysis of the corresponding 3D nickel acetate [Ni(AC)(2)center dot 4H(2)O]-hydroxybenzeneboronic acid-poly-vinylpyrrolidone precursor networks woven by electrospinning. After optimizing the pyrolysis temperatures, various structural and morphological characterization analyses indicate that the optimal Ni@BNPCFs-900 networks own a large surface area, abundant micro/mesopores, and vast carbon edges/defects, which boost doping a large amount of B (5.81 atom %) and N (5.84 atom %) dopants into carbon frameworks with 6.36 atom % of BC3, pyridinic-N (pyridinic-N-Ni), and graphitic-N active sites. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that Ni@BNPCFs-900 reveals the best hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction catalytic activities in an alkaline solution. The HER potential at 10 mA cm(-2) [E-10 = -164.2 mV vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)] of the optimal Ni@BNPCFs-900 is just 96.2 mV more negative than that of the state-of-the-art 20 wt % Pt/C (E-10 = -68 mV vs RHE). In particular, the OER E(10 )and Tafel slope of the optimal Ni@BNPCFs-900 (1.517 V vs RHE and 19.31 mV dec(-1)) are much smaller than those of RuO2, (1.557 V vs RHE and 64.03 mV dec(-1)). For full water splitting, the catalytic current density achieves 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.584 V for the (-) Ni@BNPCFs-900 parallel to Ni@BNPCFs-900 (+) electrolysis cell, which is 10 mV smaller than that of the (-) 20 wt % Pt/C parallel to RuO2 (+) benchmark (1.594 V) under the same conditions. The synergistic effects of 3D hierarchically porous structures, advanced charge transport ability, and abundant active centers [such as Ni@BNC, BC3, pyridinic-N (pyridinic-N-Ni), and graphitic-N] are responsible for the excellent water-splitting catalytic activity of the Ni@BNPCFs-900 networks. Especially, because of the remarkable structural and chemical stabilities of 3D hierarchically porous Ni@BNPCFs-900 networks, the (-) Ni@BNPCFs-900 parallel to Ni@BNPCFs-900 (+) water electrolysis cell displays an excellent stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000820818800001	35604016

Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based carbon (C)@NiO/Ni nanofibers were fabricated via simple electrospinning method. The as-prepared C@NiO/Ni nanofibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning electron microscopy Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectra. The SEM and TEM analyses revealed that NiO/Ni nanoparticles distributed on the PAN based carbon nanofibers. EDS, XPS and XRD results confirm the presence of the nanoparticles. The catalytic activity and durability of C@NiO/Ni nanofibers containing different weight ratio of Ni salt content (2%, 3%, & 4%) were examined for HER in 1 M KOH solution. It has been observed that C@NiO/Ni nanofibers containing Ni content (4%) showed the highest catalytic activity. It indicates that the catalytic activity of electrocatalyst can be enhanced by increasing the effective active sites. Noteworthy to mention here that the nanofibers catalyst reached a current density of 60 mA/cm(2). The as-prepared catalyst showed remarkable stability up to 22 h and retained 99% of its initial activity even after 16 h of reaction. (C)2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In this work, carbon aerogel supported platinum-nickel solid solution alloy catalysts (Pt3Ni/CA) with small particles (similar to 3.5 nm) and uniform distribution were prepared via a simple one-step rapid reduction method during which no structure guide or stabilizer is added. In rotating disk electrode (RDE), the mass activity (MA, 0.25 A mg(pt)(-1)) and specific activity (SA, 4.69 A m(-2)) of the optimized Pt3Ni/CA catalysts for ORR are nearly 3.8 times and 6.5 times that of the state-of-the-art commercial carbon-supported platinum catalysts (Pt/C, 0.07 A mg(pt)(-1) and 0.72 A m(-2)), respectively. After the accelerated durability test (ADT), the as-prepared Pt3Ni/CA catalysts still keep a satisfactory MA and SA which are more than 3.4 and 8.9 times as high as that of Pt/C. The Koutecky-Levich (K-L) equation shows that the electrochemical reaction conforms to be a 4e(-) process.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000724637100002

However, the origin of the promoter effect is not fully understood. Herein, we investigated the potassium promotion effect on CuCl2/gamma-Al2O3 catalyzed ethylene oxychlorination by kinetic experiments and DFT calculations. Kinetic experiments observed the effect of KCl on individual steps, and the evolution of the reaction mechanisms with Cl/Cu ratios. Further exploration via DFT found that KCl increases the formation energy of Cl vacancy (Delta E-v) and thus inhibits the reduction activity, which is attributed to the shift-down of Bader charge of Cl. Delta E-v boosts with the decline of Cl/Cu ratios; thus, ethylene can extract Cl atoms from the surface with a Cl/Cu ratio of 2, while it anchors to metal atoms at lower Cl/Cu ratios. The distinct adsorption modes reflect the evolution of reaction mechanisms with Cl/Cu ratios. KCl facilitates the adsorption of oxygen owing to the shift-up of the Bader charge of Cu atom. Potassium reduces the Gibbs free energy barrier of the oxidation step, which agrees with the experimental observation. It is concluded that the potassium promoter effect on the catalytic performance mainly results from the modification of the charge of surface atoms.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000545298400005

Herein, based on the observation of an unexpected phenomenon that the alloying of Pt and transition metals by co-reduction is more preferential than the formation of pure Pt NCs, we propose a feasible one-pot strategy to synthesize a uniformly epitaxial core-shell Pt-Ni structure with a Ni-rich alloy as the core and a Pt-rich alloy as the shell. The as-prepared Pt-Ni core-shell structures are subsequently etched into monocrystalline Pt-Ni branched nanocages with the wall thickness being 2.8 nm. This unique structure exhibits excellent catalytic performance and stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution which is of great significance for the energy-intensive water-alkali and chlor-alkali industry.									28	2	0	0	1	0	29			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000428787200007	29509197

Core-shell hierarchical heterostructure materials with strong synergistic effects based on non-noble metal elements have been developed to compensate for inadequacy. In this work, a core-shell hierarchical heterostructure Co9S8/Ni3S2@NiFe-LDH electrocatalyst was prepared via hydrothermal and electrodeposition methods. The resultant Co9S8/Ni3S2@NiFe-120 electrocatalyst consists of Co9S8 substrates as the core and NiFe-LDHs as the shell, and exhibits excellent overall water splitting electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 229 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and 151 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and a full cell voltage of 1.62 V at 10 mA cm(-2) current density. The core-shell heterostructure constructed by electrodeposition endows the catalyst with outstanding stability and low degradation in long-term catalytic processes as shown by continuous chronopotentiometry tests at current densities of 50, 100 and 200 mA cm(-2) for 72 h. The as-prepared core-shell hierarchically heterostructural Co9S8/Ni3S2@NiFe-120 with high-efficiency and good-durability is a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst towards practical applications in overall water splitting.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2398-4902			WOS:000626710500012

Herein, we succeed to introduce tensile strain into various perovskites via a facile thermochemical reduction method, which can greatly improve material performance for the bottleneck oxygen-evolving reaction in water electrolysis. As an ideal proof-of-concept, such a chemical-induced tensile strain turns hydrophobic Ba5Co4.17Fe0.83O14-delta perovskite into the hydrophilic one by modulating its solid-liquid tension, contributing to its beneficial adsorption of important hydroxyl reactants as evidenced by fast operando spectroscopy. Both surface-sensitive and bulk-sensitive absorption spectra show that this strategy introduces oxygen vacancies into the saturated face-sharing Co-O motifs of Ba5Co4.17Fe0.83O14-delta and transforms such local structures into the unsaturated edge-sharing units with positive charges and enlarged electrochemical active areas, creating a molecular-level hydroxyl pool. Theoretical computations reveal that this strategy well reduces the thermodynamic energy barrier for hydroxyl adsorption, lowers the electronic work function, and optimizes the charge/electrostatic potential distribution to facilitate the electron transport between active sites and hydroxyl reactants. Also, this strategy is reliable for other single, double, and Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites. We believe that this finding will enlighten rational material design and in-depth understanding for many potential applications.

Herein, we investigated the potential of a new class of experimentally available boron-containing materials, i. e., cubic boron phosphide (BP) and boron arsenide (BAs), as metal-free NRR electrocatalysts by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our results revealed that gas phase N2 can be sufficiently activated on the B-terminated (111) polar surfaces of BP and BAs, and effectively reduced to NH3 via an enzymatic pathway with an extremely low limiting potential ( 0.12 V on BP and 0.31 V on BAs, respectively). In particular, the two proposed B-terminated (111) surfaces not only have a large active region for N2 reduction, but also can significantly inhibit the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, and thus have rather high efficiency and selectivity for the NRR. Therefore, cubic BP or BAs with mainly exposed (111) facets may serve as promising metal-free NRR catalysts with superior performance.									66	5	0	0	3	0	66			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000471010900037

Information on these several properties was obtained by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance. For the photoelectrochemical tests, NaCe(MoO4)(2) microcrystals were deposited on conductive indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate by drop coating, and the activity of the as-prepared photoanode toward oxygen evolution reaction was investigated in the absence and presence of blue light-emitting diode irradiation. Studies carried out by linear sweep voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy attested to a significant photoelectroactivity of molybdate associated with the fast electron-hole pairs generation. The steady-state photocurrent density recorded under irradiation achieved a remarkable increase, varying from 1.5 mu A cm(-2) (light off) to 44.1 mu A cm(-2) (light on), in addition, it presents high stability after on-off cycles, what proves the proper performance of NaCe(MoO4)(2)/ITO as photoanode for water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1546-542X	1744-7402		WOS:000610435500001

In this work, at first, we present a manganese oxide-based catalyst in the form of xerogel, providing a complete description of the material. Later on, we present the comparison of two nanostructured manganese oxide-based catalysts, prepared from the same precursor, manganese acetate, but with different templating agents and with two different nanostructures: the xerogel previously discussed, and the nanofibers. With these two nanostructures, we prepared carbon-based electrodes, obtaining cathodes to be tested in microbial fuel cells. One of these cathodes performed very well and its performance was comparable to that of the reference which used Pt/C as catalyst. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, the low intrinsic activity of nonnoble metal catalysts often limits their development, and using heteroatoms to modify catalyst electronic structures is an efficient way to improve electrocatalyst performance. Herein, we successfully embed highly dispersed V-doped FeNi(3)alloy nanoparticles into carbon spheres through a simple soaking adsorption method. The unique structure with nanoparticles coated by carbon can not only expose more active sites but can also increase the stability of the nanoparticles. As a result, the catalyst requires an overpotential of 293 mV for the OER to reach 10 mA cm(-2)in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the substitution of the V atom for the Ni site in the FeNi(3)alloy can effectively increase the d-band center compared with that of FeNi(3)and thus strengthen the catalyst adsorption of reaction intermediates. This research can help us establish a new way to study alloy catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000582178000001

Among them, The former is of great significance to produce high-purity hydrogen industrially, while The latter is considered to be a efficient, low energy consumption and a green way of hydrogen production. Herein, we design a simple hydrothermal method to synthesize VSe2 with superior photocatalytic activity and HER/OER Electrochemical experiments reveal the samples with overpotential of 0.796 V in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.011 V in 1 M KOH for HER at current density of -10 mA cm(-2), respectively. The VSe2 also exhibited optimal electrocatalytic properties for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a low Tafel slope of 134.4 mV dec(-1) (in 0.5 M H2SO4) and 242.44 mV dec(-1) (in 1 M KOH), respectively. Furthermore, VSe2 has an extremely overpotential of 2.467 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 247.43 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH for OER. The electrochemical properties of VSe2 are mainly attributed to the high conductivity and the atomic composition way of each layer. Photoelectrochemical tests prove that the photocurrent density of VSe2 exhibits 10(7) mu A/cm(2) in 1 M KOH at 0.8 V. The superior photocatalytic activity is benefited from its intrinsic electronic structure.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0921-5107	1873-4944		WOS:000564520100007

The mechanistic explanation is evident through the analysis of the internal cell pressure profile and the corresponding individual electrode potential variation in the aging process. Three different stages, each associated with a predominant mechanism for self-discharge, were identified at room temperature, corresponding to a short (10-100 s), an intermediate (10 min-25 h), and a long (2 days-several months) period of aging. All three stages involved reactions with hydrogen gas, which led to the capacity loss. Most of the capacity loss was temporary and could be recovered from subsequent recharge. The effect from oxygen evolution and recombination only showed in the beginning of the self-discharge process and diminished after about 4 h of aging from the fully charged state. Through the remaining part of the intermediate stage, the residual hydrogen gas continued to reduce the positive electrode capacity via a partial discharge. In the final stage of the long aging period, the capacity loss was probably caused by a minute leakage current. From this study, we derived the charge retention as a function of aging time, which can be used for capacity prediction. Good agreement between the predicted value and the test result was found.

Here, [BMIM] [NTf2] ionic liquid (IL) modification of microporous ZnCoNC catalysts (derived from ZIF-ZnCo) is investigated to study their behavior in PEMFCs and to elucidate the catalytic mechanisms in practical operation. The high O-2 solubility of ILs enhances the utilization of active sites with porous ZnCoNC, and their hydrophobic nature facilitates the water transport during fuel cell operation. The half-cell measurement in aqueous HClO4 shows that with the 20 wt % IL modification, the electron-transfer number increases from 2.58 to 3.88, approaching the desired 4-electron-transfer ORR. The power density obtained shows 140% improvement in single-cell PEMFC tests. The catalyst also yields an interesting performance in alkaline anion-exchange membrane fuel cells.									31	2	0	0	0	0	31			2380-8195			WOS:000486361500012

Herein, we designed a series of single-site Fe-N-C catalysts, which present high surface area and good conductivity by incorporating into mesoporous carbon supported on carbon nanotubes, to study the doping effect of N and P on the bifunctional activity. The additional P-doping dramatically increased the content of active pyridine-N and introduced P-N/C/O sites, which not only act as extra active sites but also regulate the electron density of Fe centers to optimize the absorption of oxygenated intermediates, thereby ultimately improving the bifunctional activity of Fe-N-C sites. The optimized catalyst displayed a half-wave potential of 0.882 V for ORR and a low overpotential of 365 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, which significantly outperforms the counterpart without P, as well as noble-metal-based catalysts. The ZABs with air cathodes containing the N,P-co-doped catalysts exhibited a high peak power density of 201 mW cm(-2) and a long cycling stability beyond 600 h. Doping has shown to be an effective way to optimize the performance of single-site catalysts in bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis, which can be extended to other catalyst systems.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000861490700001	36150018

Illuminated PTTh in combination with a MnOx anode in a two-electrode setup exhibited stable water-splitting at a bias-potential of only 0.3 V at pH 12. This confirms that PTTh used as photocathode can produce photovoltages of at least 900 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction at high pH and is therefore a suitable match for traditional water-oxidation catalysts such as MnOx, CoOx, and RuOx. Films of PTTh were fabricated using a novel, metal-free method where iodine vapor is used as oxidant; thus, previously observed interference from metal residuals was omitted and thereby a gravimetric photo electrocatalytic conversion rate of 330 mmol(H-2) h(-1) g(-1) was achieved in phosphate buffer (pH 7) at 0 V vs. RHE. A striking property of this new strand of polythiophene was an "inverse" correlation (compared to that predicted using the Nernstian relationship) between the onset potential for the light-assisted water reduction reaction and pH: the potential (vs. RHE) required for a given current was more positive at higher pH, which is not observed for other (photo-) electrocatalytic materials, and indicates that the charge neutralization of PTTh (rather than the pH) guides the onset potential.									36	1	0	0	3	0	36			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000432599100021

A photosensitizer (1) based on [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) and decorated with two methylenediphosphonate (M2P) groups has been designed and synthesized for this purpose. The M2P groups in complex 1 allow for coordination of cobalt ions to afford a novel molecular-heterogeneous hybrid material P1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize P1 as an amorphous, non-uniform material that contains Ru and Co in a ratio of 1:2. A suspension of P1 in a buffered aqueous solution is active as a light-driven water oxidation catalyst in the presence of persulfate (S2O82-) as electron acceptor. The yield of oxygen is higher when P1 is prepared in situ by mixing and illuminating 1 and Co2+ in the presence of S2O82-. After oxygen evolution ceases, a second material P2 can be isolated from the reaction mixture. P2 is characterized by a lower Ru content than P1, and contains Co in a higher oxidation state. Interestingly, P2 as a freshly prepared suspension is also active for light-driven water oxidation. It is shown that 1 resides in the interior of P1 and P2, and is thus in a location where undesirable quenching pathways of the photo-excited state of 1 limit the oxygen production yields for both P1 and P2.									10	1	0	0	1	1	10			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000330779700036	24419175

Platinum (Pt) is the best-known element for HER catalysis. Due to the scarcity of Pt, the development of non-Pt nanocatalysts is desired to achieve broad scale implementations. Here we demonstrate that the PdCu nanostructure containing an intermetallic B2 phase (PdCu-B2) shows a smaller Tafel slope, higher exchange current density, and lower overpotential for HER compared to commercial Pt/C in acidic conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the improved HER performance in acidic conditions can be attributed to the decrease in the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) on the compressed intermetallic PdCu-B2, shifting the HBE to a more optimal position even compared to Pt/C. In addition, PdCu-B2 exhibits the highest mass activity toward the formic acid oxidation reaction, making it a good anode catalyst candidate for formic-acid-based fuel cells.									24	2	0	0	1	0	24			2380-8195			WOS:000599605500003		
J	Kim, Kwanwoo; Kim, Youjin; Kim, Jooheon								Enhanced cathodic catalytic activity of an N-doped micropore structure obtained through the six-coordinate bond of an EDTA-Ce composite for the oxygen reduction reaction								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				505						144418	10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.144418				MAR 1 2020	2020	The development of catalytic materials to increase the efficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which effects an important role in next generation energy storage and conversion systems, is essential but challenging. Electrocatalysts for ORR in alkaline solution, including Ce/N-doped micropore carbon materials (CNMCs), are prepared as nonprecious-metal catalysts from an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate complex. The material obtained via a simple manual synthesis method has a microporous and octahedral structure as a result of six-coordinate bonds between EDTA and Ce metals. The CNMC materials have high surface areas, which advantageous for electrochemical catalysts. Furthermore, the micropore structure positively affects the ORR by allowing three phases (solid/catalyst-liquid/electrolyte-gas/oxygen) to coexist in a wide range. Ultimately, a new cathodic catalyst based on EDTA, which has not been reported thus far, is obtained after the optimal Ce content is determined. The electrocatalytic performance of CNMCs toward the ORR is characterized using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique. The RDE results obtained with the CNMCs reveal an onset-potential and half-wave potential similar to those of a Pt/C catalyst. In addition, the CNMCs exhibit good long-term stability and excellent durability. Therefore, these materials may be alternative cathode electrocatalysts in commercial use.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000510846500045

However, there is still a lack of potential materials with significant activity under visible light. Because of safety, chemical inertness, low cost, stability and other characteristics, transition metal oxide semiconductors have been widely applied as photocatalysts for hydrogen generation. Albeit, wide usage of semiconductor photocatalysts were prevented by its inability to exploit solar energy of visible region. Here we show synthesis of a nano-sized mixed metal oxide (MMO) Ca3MnO6 through wet-chemistry methods such as co-precipitation, ultrasonic, microwave, reflux, and hydrothermal methods. The nano-sized Ca3MnO6 has initially selected based on morphology and respective particle diameters. The selected sample shows a well-defined single crystal, free from any impurities, complete structural formation, and a band gap energy (E-g) of around 5.3 eV. The best product synthesized in ultrasonic method which shows the best morphology, purity and the highest efficiency for splitting of water to hydrogen and oxygen. Irrespective of preparation methods and morphologies, all samples split water into hydrogen and oxygen, as confirmed from their respective photocatalytic analysis. When the selected sample combined with (NH4)(2)Ce(NO3)(6), the single-crystal Ca3MnO6 nanoparticles split water into hydrogen and oxygen more efficiently under visible light. Our findings demonstrate the importance of nanostructured Ca3MnO6 single crystal photocatalysts in solar water splitting. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

During the course of evolution, plants have adapted to ROS toxicity, and use ROS as signalling messengers that activate defence responses. Cysteine (Cys) residues in proteins are one of the most sensitive targets for ROS-mediated post-translational modifications, and they have become key residues for ROS signalling studies. The reactivity of Cys residues towards ROS, and their ability to react to different oxidation states, allow them to appear at the crossroads of highly dynamic oxidative events. As such, a redox-active cysteine can be present as S-glutathionylated (-SSG), disulfide bonded (S-S), sulfenylated (-SOH), sulfinylated (-SO2H), and sulfonylated (-SO3H). The sulfenic acid (-SOH) form has been considered as part of ROS-sensing pathways, as it leads to further modifications which affect protein structure and function. Redox proteomic studies are required to understand how and why cysteines undergo oxidative post-translational modifications and to identify the ROS-sensor proteins. Here, we update current knowledge of cysteine reactivity with ROS. Further, we give an overview of proteomic techniques that have been applied to identify different redox-modified cysteines in plants. There is a particular focus on the identification of sulfenylated proteins, which have the potential to be involved in plant signal transduction.									67	5	0	0	57	0	72			0022-0957	1460-2431		WOS:000356223900011	25750420

The products of electro-oxidation formed, which depend on the composition and the crystal phase of CoNi deposits, have been identified; for this, Co-fcc, Co-hcp, Co7Ni3-fcc, Co7Ni3-hcp, Co5Ni5-fcc and Ni-fcc films have been electrodeposited and oxidized. The influence of the crystalline phase of the films in the nature of the superficial oxides formed has been demonstrated: the electrodes prepared from CoNi-fcc films contained beta-co(x)Nio((1-x))oH(2), while those prepared from Co7Ni3-hcp films contained Co2NiO4 and beta-co(x)Ni((1-x))(oH)(2). The catalytic behaviour of the electro-oxidized electrodes for urea electro-oxidation was evaluated. Separate tests were performed to differentiate the influence of the composition and the crystalline structure of the initial films and, therefore, of the different oxidized species formed. The electrodes prepared by electro-oxidation of the Co7Ni3-hcp films show better electro-catalytic performance for urea's oxidation than those obtained by oxidation of the Co7Ni3-fcc, because they induce higher intensity, lower onset potential and lesser simultaneous oxygen evolution, becoming a good anode for urea electro-oxidation in urea electrolysis for hydrogen production or waste water treatment.

However, it remains a great challenge to avoid the aggregation of isolated atoms into nanoparticles during the preparation and application of SACs. Here, the evolution of Pd species is investigated on different crystal facets of CeO2, and vastly different behaviors on the single-atomic dispersion of surface Pd atoms are surprisingly discovered. In situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in situ near-ambient-pressure-XPS (NAP-XPS), in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveal that, in a reducing atmosphere, more oxygen vacancies are generated on the (100) facet of CeO2, and Pd atoms can be trapped and thus feature atomic dispersion; by contrast, on the CeO2 (111) facet, Pd atoms will readily aggregate into clusters (Pd-n). Furthermore, Pd-1/CeO2(100) gives a high selectivity of 90.3% for the catalytic N-alkylation reaction, which is 2.8 times higher than that for Pd-n/CeO2(111). This direct evidence demonstrates the crucial role of crystal-facet effects in the preparation of metal-atom-on-metal-oxide SACs. This work thus opens an avenue for the rational design and targeted synthesis of ultrastable and sinter-resistant SACs.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000767033100001	35142396

The coal soot data served as a guide to selection of the temperature range that would be most fruitful for investigation of the evolution of aerosols composed of soot and tars that are generated from model compounds. The evolution of the different materials in the gas phase followed different paths. The coal derived soots exhibited loss of aliphatic and oxygen functional groups prior to significant growth in average aromatic cluster size. Between 1410 and 1530 K, line broadening occurs in the aromatic band, which appears to have a Lorentzian component that is observable at the lower temperature and is quite pronounced at the higher temperature. The data indicate that the average aromatic cluster size (the number of carbon atoms in an aromatic ring system where the rings are connected through aromatic bridgehead carbon atoms) may be as large as 80-90 carbons/cluster. The data obtained for the biphenyl samples exhibit a different path for pyrolysis and soot growth. A significant amount of ring opening reactions occurs, followed by major structural rearrangements, after the initial ring opening and hydrogen transfer phase. The cluster size not only grows significantly, but the crosslinking structure also increases, indicating that soot growth in biphenyl soots consists not only of cluster size growth but also cluster cross-linking. The evolution of pyrene aerosol samples follows still another path. Little evidence is noted for ring opening reactions. Major ring growth has not occurred at 1410 K but cross-linking reactions are noted, indicating the formation of dimer/trimer structures. Although a significant amount of ring growth is noted, the data are inconclusive regarding the mechanism for ring growth in the pyrene aerosols between 1410 and 1460 K.									127	6	0	0	4	0	131			0887-0624			WOS:000170022500027

In this work, the photogenerated carrier transfer and photocatalytic properties of TiO2/h-BN heterostructure are systematically explored by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The calculations indicate that a stable heterojunction structure is composed of TiO2 (100) surface and h-BN monolayer. According to the analysis of electronic structure and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD), TiO2/h-BN heterostructure can be classified as S-scheme photo catalyst with strong redox ability. The strong interlayer interaction, built-in electric field and band bending can be formed by the construction of heterostructure, which will bring about recombination (separation) of electron hole pairs with weak (strong) redox ability at the interface. Both HER and OER process of water splitting can be carried out spontaneously by TiO2/h-BN heterostructure under light irradiation and different pH values. Besides, the band gap and type of TiO2/h-BN heterostructure are almost unchanged under the action of biaxial strain, which illustrates that TiO2/h-BN heterostructure possesses strain resistance. Therefore, the present works not only discover a potential S-scheme photocatalyst for water splitting, but also offer a way to develop high-performance photocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000786608000002

The NiWO4-WO3 fibers produced by the electrospinning method were post treated in an argon atmosphere at 800 degrees C which yielded NiWO4-WO3-WO2.9 nanocrystals attached together forming a string-like structure. The presence of WO2.9 phase was confirmed by both the XRD and TEM diffraction pattern analysis. String morphology and structure were found to change with different post treatment conditions such as by changing the calcination temperature from 550 degrees C under oxygen to 800 degrees C under pure argon atmosphere. This material was investigated for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.1 M KOH electrolytes. These composite strings showed good electrocatalytic activity compared to the NiWO4-WO3 fibers reported previously (Anis et al. in J. Mater. Sci. 52:7269-7281, 2017). It was concluded that the presence of WO2.9 phase increases the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst as compared to the NiWO4-WO3 fibers with overpotentials as low as 40 and 50 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.1 M KOH, respectively.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1073-5623	1543-1940		WOS:000512002400024

Usually, a high C-3 selectivity is a tradeoff with conversion for most catalysts. Thus, we used solketal as the reactant, which is acetal-protected glycerol with acetone. CV experiments showed that solketal is oxidized over nickel boride (NixB) at potentials where NiOOH is formed. Electrolysis over NixB in a thin-film spectroelectrochemical flow cell at 1.58 V vs. RHE to avoid pronounced oxygen evolution showed a stable current density of ca. 6 mA cm(-2). Simultaneously recorded ATR-FTIR spectra revealed solketal conversion to solketalate and formate. Indeed, 59 % conversion and 77 % selectivity to glyceric acid were determined by HPLC after acidic cleavage of the acetal, resulting in a yield of 45 %. Therefore, solketal is a promising reactant for the selective electrosynthesis of glyceric acid.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-0216			WOS:000728416000001

Although graphene oxide (GO) is a versatile material in this direction, its use is limited by the production of metastable, chemically inhomogeneous and spatially disordered GO structures under current synthetic protocols, which results in poor optoelectronic properties. Here, we present a mild thermal annealing procedure, with no chemical treatments involved, to manipulate as-synthesized GO on a large scale to enhance sheet properties with the oxygen content preserved. Using experiments supported by atomistic calculations, we demonstrate that GO structures undergo a phase transformation into prominent oxidized and graphitic domains by temperature-driven oxygen diffusion. Consequently, as-synthesized GO that absorbs mainly in the ultraviolet region becomes strongly absorbing in the visible region, photoluminescence is blue shifted and electronic conductivity increases by up to four orders of magnitude. Our thermal processing method offers a suitable way to tune and enhance the properties of GO, which creates opportunities for various applications.									262	6	3	0	30	0	267			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000330187300015	24451592

The purpose of the research is to provide complete characterization of the impact of partial A- and B-site substitution on the reactivity, kinetics, redox reaction repeatability and charging/discharging storage capacity. The perovskite oxides were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at temperatures of 500-1100 degrees C. Thermal energy storage was evaluated in terms of the enthalpy of the reversible reactions of oxygen release (reduction) and uptake (oxidation) upon heating the oxide materials in air stream. Among the perovskites tested, Ba0.3Sr0.7CoO3-delta and Ba0.7Sr0.3CoO3-delta powders were suitable thermochemical storage materials operating at above 600 degrees C in terms of chemical reactivity, charging/discharging temperatures and storage capacities, kinetics of oxygen uptake/release, and repeatability of thermochemical cycling. Further, charging/discharging capacity for both perovskites was comparable to that for Fe-doped manganese oxide. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Solid solubilization between Ta component and IrO2 rutile in the mixed films was measured, and three typical surface morphologies of the oxide coatings were observed. The surface electrochemical properties of Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5; electrodes were studied by cyclic voltammetry at varying potential scan rate, and a 'double-layer' electrochemical structure containing the 'inner' and 'outer' layers has been distinguished. The voltammetric charge appears to decline with the decrease of grain size of oxide coatings as a result of the effect of surface tension. However, the coatings of 70% IrO2+30% Ta2O5 with the finest grains still exhibit the highest apparent activity for oxygen evolution evaluated by the anodic current at a constant potential. This result is interpreted by the measurements of open-circuit potential (E-oc) and double-layer capacitance (C-dl) using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Thereby, the reliability of voltammetric charge obtained in 'double-layer' potential region in determining the real electrocatalytic activity for O-2 evolution has been discussed.

While the correlation between coal structure and catalyst was not clear owing to the heterogeneous nature and complicated compositions of coal, along with the multiple reactions during coal pyrolysis. In this study, two coals were extracted by tetrahydrofuran to afford residues and extracts. The thermal behavior and product distribution of coals, residues and extracts with/without FeCl3 were studied by Gray-King assay reactor and thermogravimetry coupled with mass spectrometry. The results showed that the catalyst not only affects the cleavage of chain aliphatic hydrocarbons at lower temperature, but also facilitates the cracking of oxygen-containing functional groups, leading to the variation of liquid products generation and gaseous products evolution. With the FeCl3 catalyst addition, tar yields of all samples (coals and residues) increased, meanwhile, the conversion of residues enlarged in comparison with that of corresponding raw coals. The composition of tars obtained from coals and residues with catalyst addition varied greatly, especially for phenols and two-ring aromatics. With the catalyst addition, the conversion of extracts increased, and the temperature at which the residual yield kept nearly unchanged was decreased. The extracts act as hydrogen donors to stabilize the radical fragments in the catalytic depolymerization of lignite.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000479141700124

However, under fuel cell operating conditions, state-of-the-art oxygen reduction reaction alloy catalysts either feature high atomic percentages of noble metals (>70%) with limited durability or show poor durability when lower percentages of noble metals (<50%) are used. Here, we demonstrate a highly-durable alloy catalyst derived by alloying PtPd (<50%) with 3d-transition metals (Cu, Ni or Co) in ternary compositions. The origin of the high durability is probed by in-situ/operando high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction coupled with pair distribution function analysis of atomic phase structures and strains, revealing an important role of realloying in the compressively-strained single-phase alloy state despite the occurrence of dealloying. The implication of the finding, a striking departure from previous perceptions of phase-segregated noble metal skin or complete dealloying of non-noble metals, is the fulfilling of the promise of alloy catalysts for mass commercialization of fuel cells. Durability of catalysts under fuel cell reaction conditions is challenging for active nanoalloy electrocatalysts derived from platinum group metals and other transition metals. Here, the authors show that realloying in certain multimetallic nanoalloys plays a major role in enabling the high durability.									72	2	0	0	1	0	74				2041-1723		WOS:000625204500014	33558516

Oxygenic photosynthesis begins with light absorption. followed by excitation energy transfer to the reaction centres, primary photochemistry, electron and proton transport, NADPH and ATP synthesis, and then CO2 fixation (Calvin-Benson cycle, as well as Hatch-Slack cycle). Here we cover some of the discoveries related to this process, such as the existence of two light reactions and two photosystems connected by an electron transport 'chain' (the Z-scheme), chemiosmotic hypothesis for ATP synthesis, water oxidation clock for oxygen evolution, steps for carbon fixation, and finally the diverse mechanisms of regulatory processes. such as 'state transitions' and 'non-photochemical quenching' of the excited state of chlorophyll a.Scope In this review, we emphasize that mathematical modelling is a highly valuable tool in understanding and making predictions regarding photosynthesis. Different mathematical models have been used to examine current theories on diverse photosynthetic processes; these have been validated through simulation(s) of available experimental data, such as chlorophyll a fluorescence induction. measured with fluorometers using continuous (or modulated) exciting light, and absorbance changes at 820 run (Delta A(820)) related to redox changes in P700, the reaction centre of photosystem I.Conclusions We highlight here the important role of modelling in deciphering and untangling complex photosynthesis processes taking place simultaneously, as well as in predicting possible ways to obtain higher biomass and productivity in plants. algae and cyanobacteria.									49	2	1	0	29	0	50			0305-7364	1095-8290		WOS:000591847300002	31641747

CoMoO4 NSAs are prepared by a self-template hydrothermal method without using any hard template and surfactant. Benefiting from a 3D flower-like architecture constituted by ultrathin nanosheets with abundant exposed heterointerfaces as highly active sites and predesigned void spaces, the as-synthesized CoS2/MoS2 HNSAs exhibit an excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with a low overpotential of 50 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and a small Tafel slope of 76 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH, which outperforms most previously reported CoS2 and MoS2 based electrocatalysts with compositional or morphological similarity. This work demonstrates the great potential in developing high-efficiency and earth-abundant electrocatalysts for alkaline HER through heterointerface engineering and morphological design by utilizing transition metal molybdate as a promising platform.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10				2046-2069		WOS:000519540800043	35496514

Herein, a hybrid electrocatalyst, i.e., 2H-MoS2/N-doped mesoporous graphene, rich in interfacial Mo-pyridinic N coordination is fabricated. The optimized hybrid catalyst delivers long-term durability and outstanding HER activity with overpotentials of 110, 145, and 142 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic, alkaline, and phosphate buffered solutions (PBS) media, respectively, outperforming most of the previously reported MoS2-based catalysts. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the interfacial pyridinic N has a higher tendency to bond with Mo atoms than pyrrolic and graphitic N, and the edge-Mo coordinated with pyridinic N could serve as HER active sites. DFT calculations further reveal that Mo-pyridinic N coordination modifies the charge density of edge-Mo, in turn optimizing the hydrogen absorption energy and facilitating water dissociation, and thereby significantly promoting the intrinsic catalytic activity for the pH-universal HER process.									32	0	0	0	3	0	32			2155-5435			WOS:000641284700012

Herein, a novel 3D self-supporting nickel phosphorus/nickel phosphide/carbon cloth (Ni-P/Ni2P/CC) composite was fabricated by using combined processes of nickel phosphorus electrodeposition, hydrothermal synthesis and low temperature phosphorization techniques, for the loading of Ni-P nanoparticles and Ni2P nanosheets onto the surface of CC. The characteristics of the fabricated Ni-P/Ni2P/CC composite in terms of crystallinity, surface morphology and chemical components were analyzed, and the HER properties in alkaline solution were evaluated. The synthesized Ni-P/Ni2P/CC composite exhibits preeminent HER activity; among the three composites, the Ni-P/Ni2P/CC-2 sample displays the highest catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 95 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, this composite exhibits outstanding electrochemical stability (without apparent loss in HER activity after 2000 cyclic voltammetry cycles). For this self-supporting Ni-P/Ni2P/CC composite, the deposited Ni-P nanoparticles fill the sites not occupied by Ni2P nanosheets on the surface of CC, and thus the effect of the synergy between Ni-P and Ni2P on the enhancement in HER performance is verified. The fabricated Ni-P/Ni2P/CC composite deserves to be considered as an appealing candidate for HER application in alkaline solution.									9	1	0	0	1	0	10			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000537294300003

Herein, a facile one-step electro-deposition strategy is developed to synthesize a novel phase -separated NiCu/NiMn(OH)2 nanocomposite (NiCuMn). Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that low electronegativity Mn trigger the formation of low valence state Ni delta+ in NiMn(OH)2 to accelerate the Volmer step while Cu can optimize the d-band center of NiCu alloy to facilitate the Heyrovsky/Tafel step. Benefiting from this steering of elementary steps by the synergistic components, the obtained NiCuMn nanocomposite achieves ultralow overpotential of 17 and 62 mV to drive 10 and 100 mA cm(-2 )in 1 M KOH, respectively, and ultrahigh turnover frequency of 0.78 s-1 at overpotential of 100 mV. Moreover, NiCuMn exhibits outstanding durability with a slight potential degradation after 10,000 cyclic voltammetric test. This study not only provides atomic -level insight into optimizing the elementary steps through dual sites synergies, but also introduces a new way to simply prepare advanced HER electrocatalysts and beyond.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000856018700004

This complex phenomenon raises continuous interests in both science and industry for understanding the structure-activity dynamics under electrochemical conditions. Here we report the first theoretical attempt, by combining the machine-learning-based global optimization (SSW-NN method) and modified Poisson-Boltzmann continuum solvation (CM-MPB) based on first-principles calculations, to elucidate the potential-dependent structure evolution on a stepped Pt surface and its catalytic activity, in which the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves are simulated to compare with experiment. We selected four types of structure domains on Pt(110), namely, Type-Ia: ordered Pt(110)-(1 x 1); Type-Ib: disordering of Pt(110)-(1 x 1); Type-II: ordered Pt(110)-(1 x 2) (the missing-row reconstruction); and Type-III: reconstructed Pt(110)-(1 x 4), and reveal the potential dependence of the coverage of H atom adsorbate, the total passed charge, and the CV of these Pt(110) surface domains. In particular, the surface reconstruction from Type-Ia to -Ib occurs at +0.20 V vs NHE when the average H coverage is above 0.60 ML, which produces the key five-coordinated Pt (Pt-5c) sites. The Pt-5c sites exhibit the superior activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and are the key species responsible for the high HER activity of Pt electrode.									2	1	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000657357100014

Herein, we report a strategy to prepare noble metal-decorated porous carbon-based nanomaterials by direct carbonization of porphyrinic metal-organic frameworks of M-PCN-222(Hf) that are also denoted as M-PMOF-2(Hf) (M=Rh, Ir or Pt) at an elevated temperature under an Ar atmosphere. The M-PCN-222(Hf) samples with the nanorod shape are synthesized by the self-assembly of M-TCPP (TCPP=tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) and HfCl4, and the noble metals within the frameworks are uniformly dispersed at the atomic level. Through pyrolysis at 600, 700 or 800 degrees C and followed by acid etching with HF, noble metal-decorated porous carbon-based nanomaterials that are termed as M-PCN-222(Hf)-T (T is the pyrolysis temperature) are obtained, in which the noble metal nanoparticles are dispersed uniformly within the porphyrin ligand-derived nitrogen-doped carbon matrix. Inheriting the structural characteristics of the MOF template, M-PCN-222(Hf)-T display relatively high BET surfaces up to 310 m(2).g(-1)and large mesopores with an average pore diameter around 6 nm. Catalytic results show that the prepared M-PCN-222(Hf)-T samples display high HER catalytic activities in a 0.5 M H(2)SO(4)solution (pH=0.36).									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2365-6549			WOS:000571508100021

We have intentionally added oxygen at the interfaces of Al0.3Ga0.7As/GaAs superlattice layers to examine its effect on interfacial and surface roughness in these structures. Small angle X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to quantify and compare both small scale interfacial roughness and large scale surface roughness. Interfacial oxygen incorporation was found to increase with increasing substrate misorientation angle off (100) toward the (110) and this was reflected in increased interfacial roughness. Large scale surface structures with spacings of similar to 2.0 mu m were observed using AFM for growth on nominally (100) substrates. The existence of these features is also indicated in X-ray correlated roughness measurements. A mechanism of preferential oxygen incorporation at surface step edges is proposed to explain the evolution of roughness in the superlattice layers.					7th International Conference on Metalorganic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (ICMOVPE-VII)7th International Conference on Metalorganic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (ICMOVPE-VII)	MAY 31-JUN 03, 1994MAY 31-JUN 03, 1994	JAPAN SOC APPL PHYS; FDN ADV INT SCIJAPAN SOC APPL PHYS; FDN ADV INT SCI	YOKOHAMA, JAPANYOKOHAMA, JAPAN	7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0022-0248			WOS:A1994QC54300125

DFT calculation reveals that Ni-In or Ni-Cu paired on the (100) plane serve as primary active sites. The Ni-Cu pair exhibits stronger OH* and H* affinity that correspondingly reduce OH* and H* adsorption free energy. Introducing specific amounts of the Ni-Cu pair, that is In:Cu = 0.6:0.4 in Ni3In0.6Cu0.4N, can optimize OH* and H* adsorption free energy to facilitate water dissociation in the HER process, while avoiding OH* adsorption getting too strong to block active sites. Besides, Ni3In0.6Cu0.4N turns the water adsorption step spontaneous, which may be attributed to the shifted d-band center and polarizing effect from surface In-Cu charge distribution. This work expands the scope for material design in an antiperovskite system by tailoring the chemical components and morphology for optimal reaction free energy and performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000748427700001	35098651

Kazlauskas, Romas/0000-0002-3570-2411			Different Active-Site Loop Orientation in Serine Hydrolases versus Acyltransferases								CHEMBIOCHEM				12	5			768	776		10.1002/cbic.201000693				MAR 21 2011	2011	Acyl transfer is a key reaction in biosynthesis, including synthesis of antibiotics and polyesters. Although researchers have long recognized the similar protein fold and catalytic machinery in acyltransferases and hydrolases, the molecular basis for the different reactivity has been a long-standing mystery. By comparison of X-ray structures, we identified a different oxyanion-loop orientation in the active site. In esterases/lipases a carbonyl oxygen points toward the active site, whereas in acyltransferases a NH of the main-chain amide points toward the active site. Amino acid sequence comparisons alone cannot identify such a difference in the main-chain orientation. To identify how this difference might change the reaction mechanism, we solved the X-ray crystal structure of Pseudomonas fluorescens esterase containing a sulfonate transition-state analogue bound to the active-site serine. This structure mimics the transition state for the attack of water on the acyl-enzyme and shows a bridging water molecule between the carbonyl oxygen mentioned above and the sulfonyl oxygen that mimics the attacking water. A possible mechanistic role for this bridging water molecule is to position and activate the attacking water molecule in hydrolases, but to deactivate the attacking water molecule in acyl transferases.									34	0	0	0	21	0	35			1439-4227			WOS:000288563000017	21351219

PCC 6803 Delta psbU and Delta psbV mutants reveals important roles of cytochrome c-550 in cyanobacterial oxygen evolution								BIOCHEMISTRY				37	6			1551	1558		10.1021/bi971676i				FEB 10 1998	1998	The functions of cytochrome c-550 and a 12 kDa protein in cyanobacterial oxygen evolution were studied with directed deletion mutants Delta psbV and Delta psbU of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and the following results were obtained. (1) In contrast to the Delta psbU mutant which is capable of autotrophic growth in the absence of Ca2+ or Cl- at a reduced rate, the Delta psbV mutant lacking cytochrome c-550 could not grow at all without Ca2+ or Cl-. (2) The Delta psbV mutant had a significantly reduced thermoluminescence emission intensity and flash oxygen yield, whereas the Delta psbU mutant showed slight decreases in thermoluminescence intensity and flash oxygen yield, indicating corresponding decreases in the concentrations of O-2-evolving centers in these mutants. (3) The Delta psbV and Delta psbU mutants exhibited elevated peak temperature for the thermoluminescence B- and Q-bands indicative of more stable S-2 states. (4) The rise time of the O-2 signal during the S-3-[S-4]-SO transition was increased slightly in the Delta psbV mutant but not in the Delta psbU mutant. (5) The oxygen evolution was inactivated in the dark rapidly in the Delta psbV mutant with a half-time of 28 min, but this did not happen in the Delta psbU mutant. (6) Photoactivation of the oxygen-evolving complex after removal of the manganese cluster by hydroxylamine showed a higher quantum yield in the Delta psbV mutant than in the Delta psbU mutant or wild type. Taken together, these results indicated that cytochrome c-550 plays a substantial role in maintaining the stability and function of the manganese cluster in algal photosystem II, whereas the 12 kDa protein plays primarily a regulatory role in maintaining normal S-state transitions. These functional features of cytochrome c-550 and the 12 kDa protein were compared with those of the 23 and 17 kDa proteins in higher plant photosystem II and of the 33 kDa protein in both algal and plant photosystem II.									123	1	0	0	109	0	124			0006-2960			WOS:000072130500011	9484225

However, in spite of the excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Se-surface, the extremely poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of S-surface hinders the achievement of photocatalytic overall water splitting. Herein, we construct a new 2D van der Waals heterostructure consisting of high-OER-active black phosphorus (BP) and Janus MoSSe monolayer, and demonstrate a new strategy of Janus BP/SMoSe heterostructure to achieve wide-spectral-responsive photocatalytic overall water splitting. The electronic structures and optical properties of two different heterostructures, BP/SMoSe and BP/SeMoS, are systematically investigated via first principles density, exhibiting a type-II band arrangement. Unlike BP/SeMoS, the BP/SMoSe heterostructure shows excellent optical properties, such as a large dielectric constant of 8.14 and a small optical absorption boundary of 0.10 eV. Furthermore, BP/SMoSe heterostructure possesses greater light absorption intensity and a broader light absorption range. It is found that the BP/SMoSe heterostructure exhibits proper band alignment and enhanced intrinsic dipole, which is favorable to obtain high electron-hole separation efficiency. This work provides a feasible strategy of 2D Janus BP/SMoSe heterostructure for approaching almost perfect overall water-splitting photocatalysis. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Here, we found the performance and efficiency of the transition metal phosphides for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can be improved by adjusting the morphology and electronic structure of electrocatalys. In this work, We have developed a kind of catalyst (Ni-doped CoP/Co2P NSs and starfish-like CoP/Co2P) with different morphologies. In electrochemical tests, Ni-doped CoP/Co2P NSs exhibits the excellent catalytic activity, showing that the overpotentials are only 100 mV (0.5 M H2SO4) and 125 mV (1 M KOH) for HER to afford the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 66 mV dec(-1) (0.5 M H2SO4) and 73 mV dec(-1) (1 M KOH). Furthermore, Nidoped CoP/Co2P NSs has great stability and robustness, which demonstrated by 12 h of chronoamperometry test and 3000 cycles test, showing that it maintains 98% (0.5 M H2SO4) and 93% (1 M KOH) of the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The reason for the excellent catalytic performance and robustness of Ni-doped CoP/Co2P NSs may be ascribed to the facts that the addition of Ni element leads to the change of material electron valence states, with synergistic effect with Co atoms, which possess outstanding performance of the catalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000684543700012

In buffered solutions equilibrated with the atmosphere (nondepleted of bicarbonate), the bicarbonate effect is observed only at pH lower than the pK of H2CO3 dissociation (6.4), which indicates that HCO3- is the essential species for the restoration effect, The addition of just 2 Mn2+ atoms per one PSII reaction center is enough for the maximal reactivation when bicarbonate is present in the medium, Analysis of bicarbonate concentration dependence of the restoration effect reveals two binding sites for bicarbonate with apparent dissociation constant (K-d) of approximate to 2.5 mu M and 20-34 mu M when 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone is used as electron acceptor, while in the presence of silicomolybdate only the latter one remains, Similar bicarbonate concentration dependence of O-2 evolution was obtained in untreated Mn-containing PSII membrane fragments. It is suggested that the K-d of 20-34 mu M is associated with the donor side of PSII while the location of the lower K-d binding site is not quite clear. The conclusion is made that bicarbonate is an essential constituent of the water-oxidizing complex of PSII, important for its assembly and maintenance in the functionally active state.									65	2	3	0	57	0	69			0027-8424			WOS:A1997WZ25700043	11038543

The first mixed-valent iron beta-diketonates with different Fe-III/Fe-II ratios have been synthesized by applying the mixed-ligand approach. Based on nearly quantitative reaction yields and analysis of iron-oxygen bonds, these compounds were formulated as [Fe-III(acac)(3)][Fe-II(hfac)(2)] (1) and [Fe-II(hfac)(2)][Fe-III(acac)(3)][Fe-II(hfac)(2)] (2). In the above heteroleptic complexes, the Lewis acidic, coordinatively unsaturated Fe-II centers chelated by two hfac (hexafluoroacetylacetonate) ligands with electron-withdrawing substituents maintain bridging interactions with oxygen atoms of electron-donating acac (acetylacetonate) groups that chelate the neighboring Fe-III atoms. Switching the ligands on Fe-III and Fe-II atoms in starting reagents resulted in the instant ligand exchange between iron centers and in yet another polynuclear homometallic diketonate [Fe-II(hfac)(2)][Fe-III(acac)(2)(hfac)][Fe-II(hfac)(2)] (3) that adheres to the same bonding pattern as in complexes 1 and 2. The proposed synthetic methodology has been extended to design heterometallic diketonates with different M : M' ratios. Homometallic parent molecules have been used as templates to obtain heterometallic mixed-valent [Fe-III(acac)(3)][Mn-II(hfac)(2)] (4) and [Ni-II(hfac)(2)] - [Fe-III(acac)(3)][Ni-II(hfac)(2)] (5) complexes. The combination of two different diketonate ligands with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents was found to be crucial for maintaining the above mixed-valent heterometallic assemblies. Theoretical investigation of two possible "isomers", [Fe-III(acac)(3)][Mn-II(hfac)(2)] (4) and [Mn-III(acac)(3)][Fe-II(hfac)(2)] (40) provided an additional support for the metal site assignment giving a preference of 9.78 kcal mol(-1) for the molecule 4. Heterometallic complexes obtained in the course of this study have been found to act as effective single-source precursors for the synthesis of mixed-transition metal oxide materials MxM2-xO3 and MxMi-xO. The title highly volatile precursors can be used for the low-temperature preparation of both amorphous and crystalline heterometallic oxides in the form of thin films or nanosized particles that are known to operate as efficient catalysts in oxygen evolution reaction.									18	0	1	0	0	0	19			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000353223100021	29142682

In this study, the optimal Fe-Mo-S/Ni3S2@NF with a coral-like microstructure and multiple interfaces is fabricated successfully by a facile one-step hydrothermal method. Systematic experiments, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), verify that these multiple interfaces in Fe-Mo-S/Ni3S2@NF will promote charge transfer and yield abundant active sites, leading to a synergistic effect on electrocatalytic reactions. As a result, this electrode material exhibits high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. When employing Fe-Mo-S/Ni3S2@NF as a bifunctional electrode for overall water splitting, the integrated electrolysis device can achieve an extremely low cell voltage of 1.51 V at 20 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution, outperforming the noble Pt/C-IrO2 couple (1.8 V @20 mA cm(-2)), as well as exhibits remarkable durability. Additionally, the favourable contributions of the multi-interface toward HER and OER are deeply investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This study provides insights into the significance of coupling interfaces, and it also suggests a possible design for future electrolysis catalysts.									33	2	0	0	0	0	33			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000603357000014

From manganese oxidation to water oxidation: assembly and evolution of the water-splitting complex in photosystem II								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				152	2	SI		107	133		10.1007/s11120-022-00912-z		APR 2022		MAY 2022	2022	The manganese cluster of photosystem II has been the focus of intense research aiming to understand the mechanism of H2O-oxidation. Great effort has also been applied to investigating its oxidative photoassembly process, termed photoactivation that involves the light-driven incorporation of metal ions into the active Mn4CaO5 cluster. The knowledge gained on these topics has fundamental scientific significance, but may also provide the blueprints for the development of biomimetic devices capable of splitting water for solar energy applications. Accordingly, synthetic chemical approaches inspired by the native Mn cluster are actively being explored, for which the native catalyst is a useful benchmark. For both the natural and artificial catalysts, the assembly process of incorporating Mn ions into catalytically active Mn oxide complexes is an oxidative process. In both cases this process appears to share certain chemical features, such as producing an optimal fraction of open coordination sites on the metals to facilitate the binding of substrate water, as well as the involvement of alkali metals (e.g., Ca2+) to facilitate assembly and activate water-splitting catalysis. This review discusses the structure and formation of the metal cluster of the PSII H2O-oxidizing complex in the context of what is known about the formation and chemical properties of different Mn oxides. Additionally, the evolutionary origin of the Mn4CaO5 is considered in light of hypotheses that soluble Mn2+ was an ancient source of reductant for some early photosynthetic reaction centers ('photomanganotrophy'), and recent evidence that PSII can form Mn oxides with structural resemblance to the geologically abundant birnessite class of minerals. A new functional role for Ca2+ to facilitate sustained Mn2+ oxidation during photomanganotrophy is proposed, which may explain proposed physiological intermediates during the likely evolutionary transition from anoxygenic to oxygenic photosynthesis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000781280700001	35397059

The physicochemical properties of the IrO2 catalyst were studied by termogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The electrochemical activity of this catalyst for oxygen evolution was investigated in a single cell PEM electrolyzer consisting of a Pt/C cathode and a Nafion membrane. A current density of 1.26 A cm(-2) was obtained at 1.8 V and a stable behavior during steady-state operation at 80 degrees C was recorded. The Tafel plots for the overall electrochemical process indicated a slope of about 80 mV dec(-1) in a temperature range from 25 degrees C to 80 degrees C. The kinetic and ohmic activation energies for the electrochemical process were 70.46 kJ mol(-1) and 13.45 kJ mol(-1), respectively. A short stack (3 cells of 100 cm(2) geometrical area) PEM electrolyzer was investigated by linear voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy and chrono-amperometric measurements. The amount of H-2 produced was 80 lh(-2) at 60 A under 330 W of applied electrical power. The stack electrical efficiency at 60 A and 75 degrees C was 70% and 81% with respect to the low and high heating value of hydrogen, respectively. (C) 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu.

For the first time, the detailed structure of dehydrated VOx species was revealed on the polycrystalline ceria support. VOx species can coexist on ceria surface in the structure of 1 monomer, dimer, trimer, polymer, crystalline V2O5, and CeVO4 as a function of VOx loading. These species interact strongly with both the defect sites and labile surface oxygen of ceria, passivating the redox property of ceria. Under ambient condition, the dispersed VOx species are hydrated into polyvanadate species that can be reversibly dehydrated back to the original structure forms. The ceria support with defect sites facilitates the interaction between water ((H2O)-O-18) and (VOx)-O-16 species, leading to very facile isotopic oxygen exchange between the two even at room temperature. During H-2 reduction, both the VOx species and the ceria support can be reduced with ceria surface being more reducible. The reducibility of various dispersed VOx species scales with their polymerization degree, that is, polymer > trimer > dimer > monomer. The reoxidation of reduced VOx species is found to proceed via ceria lattice oxygen instead of the gas phase oxygen where ceria acts as an oxygen buffer. The revealed structure evolution of surface VOx species on ceria under hydrated, dehydrated, reduced, and regenerated conditions provides a basis for understanding the vanadia-ceria catalysis.									77	9	0	0	9	0	78			1932-7447			WOS:000298214800023

In the experiments. OEC is advanced to the appropriate S-state at normal pH. Then, the pH is rapidly changed, and a new flash is given. The ability to advance to the next S-state in the cycle at different pHs is determined by measurements of the decrease or increase of characteristic EPR signals from the OEC in different S-states. In some cases the measured EPR signals are very small (this holds especially for the S-0 ML signal at pH >7.5 and pH <4.8). Therefore. we refrain from providing error limits for the determined pK's. Our results indicate that the S-1 --> S-2 transition is independent or pH between 4.1 and 8.4. All other S-transitions are blocked at low pH. In the acidic region, the pK's for the inhibition of the S-2 --> S-3, the S-3 --> [S-4] --> S-0, and the S-0 --> S-1 transitions are about 4.0, 4.5, and 4.7, respectively. The similarity of these pK values indicates that the inhibition of the steady-state oxygen evolution in the acidic range, which occurs with pK approximate to 4.8, is a consequence of similar pH blocks in three of the redox steps involved in the oxygen evolution. In the alkaline region, we report a clear pH block in the S-3 --> [S-4] --> S-0 transition with a pK of about 8.0. Our study also indicates the existence of a pH block at very high pH (pK approximate to 9.4) in the S-2 --> S-3 transition. The S-0 --> S-1 transition is not affected, at least up to pH 9.0. This suggests that the inhibition of the steady-state oxygen evolution, which occurs with a pK of 8.0, is dominated by the inhibition of the S-3 --> [S-4] --> S-0 transition. Our results are obtained in the presence of 5% methanol (v/v). However, it is unlikely that the determined pK's are affected by the presence of methanol since our results also show that the pH dependence of the steady-state oxygen evolution is not affected by methanol. The results in the alkaline region are in good agreement with a model, which suggests that the redox potential of Y-z./Y-z is directly affected by high pH, At high pH the Y-z./Y-z potential becomes lower than that of S-2/S-1 and S-3/S-2. The acidic block, with a pK of 4-5 in three S-transitions, implies that the inhibition mechanism is similar, and we suggest that it reflects protonation of a carboxylic side chain in the proton relay that expels protons from the OEC.									60	0	0	0	41	0	60			0006-2960			WOS:000175365300015	11980487

Earlier research on tungsten based electrocatalyst has been mainly concentrated towards tungsten carbide (WC) and tungsten nitride (WN) as the potential electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), whereas tungsten carbide (W2C) has been least focused upon. Herein, we report a highly active novel strongly coupled tungsten-carbon-nitrogen complex (W2C-NC-WN complex) prepared by in situ carbonization method. This W2C-NC-WN complex exhibits a remarkable electrochemical performance for HER with a small onset potential of 33 mV vs. RHE and requires an overpotential (n) of 145 mV vs. RHE to render-10 mA cm(-2) current density. The Tafel analysis demonstrates a slope of 96 mV dec(-1) which is much better than WN (109.6 mV dec(-1)) and WC (142.4 mV dec(-1)). The strong coupling of W2C and WN within N-doped carbon (NC) framework brings about a significant enhancement in HER kinetics and faster electron transport due to the remarkable reduction in charge transfer resistance. The facile synthetic approach reported here, provides a powerful tool for the structurally controlled modification of the catalyst while simultaneously introducing active species.

J	Wang Meiging; Yang Weihua; Cai Chengjie; Lin Xiaoyan; Fu Fang								Influence of polyvinyl alcohol on structure and property of PbO2 electrode								Journal of Chinese Society for Corrosion and Protection				35	1			81	5		10.11902/1005.4537.2013.218				Feb. 2015	2015	Titanium based PbO2 electrode was surface modified by electrodepositing in a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) containing electrolyte, then its phase composition and microstructure was characterized by SEM and XRD. While the electrochemical properties of the modified electrode was examined by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), linear potential sweep (LPV), degradation experiment of phenol and accelerated lifetime tests. Results show that the modified electrode has a high-dense structure composed of network like PVA on mesh-like PbO2. The surface modification process also results in decreasing the particle size and increasing the specific surface area of the film on electrode. Compared with the original PbO2 electrode, the modified PbO2 electrode presents a relatively lower electrochemical impedance as well as a higher oxygen evolution reaction potential. Finally, the modified PbO2 electrode exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity and longer service time. As an example, 96.9% of phenol in artificial waste water can be removed within 2 h by an electrocatalytic degradation process with a properly modified electrode PbO2-PVA (0.6) and the service time of that electrode was ca 1.5 fold of the original one.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1005-4537			INSPEC:15374673

The cyclic voltammetry (CV), polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) conducted in phenol solution indicate the oxidation ability of PbO2/Ti anode is higher than that of IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti electrode because it can reduce oxygen evolution and thus increase effective current. A novel parameter, gamma, associated with anode materials was proposed to quantitatively describe the effective current applied to main reactions and its value could be achieved through EIS fitted data of the components in equivalent electrical circuits (EEC). The suitability of the used EEC was checked by consistency of the exchange current density between Tafel plots and EIS data. With involvement of the novel parameter (gamma) into organics oxidation, a universal kinetics was thereafter presented to predict variations of chemical oxygen demand, average current efficiency and power consumption. The results of regression analysis and F-test show higher agreement between the experimental and model estimation during phenol oxidation, verifying necessity of the parameter gamma in characterizing effective current for anodic reactions and rationality of the kinetics in describing organics oxidation by different electrodes.

J	Buckmaster, John David								Simultaneous O and Al diffusion in the combustion of sub-micron aluminium drops								COMBUSTION THEORY AND MODELLING				19	4			495	513		10.1080/13647830.2015.1051117				JUL 4 2015	2015	We examine the problem of sub-micron aluminium drop combustion when both O diffusion and Al diffusion occur. During the unsteady evolution of the combustion field the oxide that is generated has the form of a shell whose inner surface encloses an aluminium bath and whose outer surface is exposed to an air bath. The diffusing atoms can react at these surface baths and also, in principle, between themselves in the interior of the oxide. However, the mass concentrations of the atoms are small so that the interior collisions necessary for this reaction are negligible.With this important simplification we are able to define a model that leads to an analytical discussion. For small Damkohler numbers (of which there are two, one defined by the O atoms the other by the Al atoms) the relative values of the bath reaction rates determine the proportion of oxide accretion on the outer surface to accretion on the inner surface. For large Damkohler numbers the relative values of the diffusion coefficients play the same role.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1364-7830	1741-3559		WOS:000357651700004

The samples synthesized by different methods show a single phase structure without any detectable impurities. The SEM results suggest that the particle size of the specimen obtained by the solid phase route is on the micron scale, while that of the specimen fabricated by the sol-gel route is on the nanometer scale. Compared with the ceramic fabricated by solid-state reaction technology, the specimen synthesized by sol-gel technique possesses lower oxygen vacancies and Mn2+ concentration, and Mn3+ concentration. The positron annihilation analyses show that the cation vacancy concentration of the specimen synthesized by the solid phase approach is higher than that of the specimen synthesized via the sol-gel approach. The compound obtained by the solid phase reaction has better dielectric properties than that obtained with the sol-gel method. The magnetic transition temperature and the effective magnetic moment are influenced by the Mn ion valence state in GdMnO3. The stronger magnetization of the ceramic synthesized via the sol-gel approach is associated with the lower concentration of cation vacancies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000818723000002

In this work, the thermal decomposition of LLM-105 was analyzed at 2000, 2250, 2500, 2750, 3000, 3250, and 3500 K. Reaction times were controlled to be 200 ps. The results showed that the main small molecule products in this reaction stage were H2O, N-2, CO2, and H-2. At low temperatures, water molecules form earlier than nitrogen ones, while the opposite is found at high temperatures. In the initial stage of the reaction, LLM-105 often undergoes a large amount of intermolecular H-transfer and dimerization, and this phenomenon is significantly reduced as the temperature rises. On the other hand, LLM-105 itself is very easy to polymerize to form clusters, and its cyclic structure is more likely to form a macromolecular cluster by diverse linkages (e.g. C-N-N-C). As the reaction progresses, the atoms of H, O, and N gradually escape from the cluster structure, but most of the oxygen atoms stay stable. The activation energy of the initial decomposition reaction of LLM-105 is 167.9 kJ/mol, which is in a reasonable range.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2210-271X	1872-7999		WOS:000546766400012

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that Ru-delta(+) can function as the main active center for the NOR process. Remarkably doping Ru into the TiO2 lattice can induce an upshift of the d-band center of the Ru site, resulting in enhanced activity for accelerating electrochemical conversion of inert N-2 to active NO*. Overdoping of Ru ions will lead to the formation of additional RuO2 on the TiO2 surface, which provides oxygen evolution reaction (OER) active sites for promoting the redox transformation of the NO* intermediate to nitrate. However, too much RuO2 in the catalyst is detrimental to both the selectivity of the NOR and the Faradaic efficiency due to the dominant OER process. Experimentally, a considerable nitrate yield rate of 161.9 mu mol h(-1) g(cat)(-1) (besides, a total nitrate yield of 47.9 mu g during 50 h) and a highest nitrate Faradaic efficiency of 26.1% are achieved by the Ru/TiO2 catalyst (with the hybrid composition of RuxTiyO2 and extra RuO2 by 2.79 wt% Ru addition amount) in 0.1 m Na2SO4 electrolyte.									58	5	0	0	1	0	58			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000535040800001	32449560

To explore efficient and durable HER electrocatalysts, we fabricated gold-aryl nanoparticles (AuNPs-COOH) anchored on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) sheets by reducing aryldiazonium tetrachloroaurate(III) salt with sodium borohydride at room temperature in water. Two different nanocomposites, AuNPs-COOH-g-C3N4 (H) (higher amount of g-C3N4) and AuNPs-COOH-g-C3N4 (L) (lower amount of g-C3N4) were prepared. Contact angle measurements revealed that the increased surface wettability of the nanocomposites on glass and silicon wafer surfaces compared to pristine g-C3N4. Cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, double-layer capacitance, linear sweep voltammetry, and chronoamperometry measurements revealed that AuNPs-COOH-g-C3N4 (L) displayed the best HER performance in 0.1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Overall, nanocomposites exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity compared to bare AuNPs-COOH and pristine g-C3N4 in current density and onset potential values. The AuNPs-COOH-g-C3N4 (L) nanocomposite offered an excellent electrocatalytic activity and displayed a current density of 53.4 mA/cm(2) at 0.72 V vs RHE, which is nearly twice compared to bare AuNPs-COOH of 33.1 mA/cm(2). In addition, the nanocomposite showed the lowest onset potential of 0.14 V vs RHE compared to 0.26 V and 0.31 V for AuNPs-COOH-g-C3N4 (H) and AuNPs-COOH, respectively.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0260-3594	1548-9574		WOS:000806093400001

Here, the unique three-dimensional (3D) structure of NF substrate can not only offer large surface area to load more active materials, but also benefit gas products releasing. The hybrid structure of Ni-Se material including NiSe and Ni3Se2 can regulate the surface electronic structure and reconstruct the electrode/solution interface. The doping of Fe can change the surface morphology, increase the electroactive area and reduce the charge transfer resistance. Moreover, an outstanding electrocatalyst Ni/Fe(OOH) formed during the water splitting process further improves the catalytical performance. Thanks to the synergistic effects of 3D structure from NF, the combination of NiSe and Ni3Se2, the doping of Fe and the generation of Ni/Fe(OOH), Fe4Ni-Se/NF electrode showed an excellent electrocatalytic performance. Without IR correction, low overpotential of 93 and 207 mV were needed to reach 10 mA cm(-2) with small Tafel slopes of 90.6 and 36.7 mV dec(-1) for HER and OER, respectively. Moreover, Fe4Ni-Se/NF electrode delivered a very low cell voltage of 1.55 V for water splitting and possessed an outstanding stability during 70 h continuous operation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000819873700015

With first-principle calculations, we explore the possibility of defect engineering to trigger the HER catalytic activity of basal plane by analyzing monolayer PdSe2, PtSe2, PdTe2, and PtTe2. It is found that the double vacancy DVSe (DVTe) and B-doping can modulate appropriately the interaction between H and basal plane and improve the HER activity of these transition-metal dichalcogenides. Especially, the B-doping with high concentration can increase enormously the density of active sites on basal plane.									31	2	0	0	0	0	31			2470-1343			WOS:000444182900192	31459134

Metal oxides, an important family of functional materials with diverse compositions and structures, were traditionally believed inactive towards HER. Encouragingly, the continuous breakthroughs and significant progress in recent years (mainly from 2015 onwards) make engineered metal oxides emerge as promising candidates for HER electrocatalysis. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of recent advances in metal oxide-based electrocatalysts for HER. We start with a brief description of some key fundamental concepts of HER, such as mechanisms, computational activity descriptors, and experimental parameters used to evaluate catalytic performance. This is followed by a overview of various types of metal oxide-based HER electrocatalysts reported so far, including single transition metal oxides, spinel oxides, perovskite oxides, metal (oxy)hydroxides, specially-structured metal oxides and oxide-containing hybrids, with special emphasis on designed strategies for promoting performance and property-activity correlation. Finally, some concluding remarks and perspectives about future opportunities of this exciting field are provided.									179	4	0	0	9	0	177			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000579868500008

To overcome the extra difficulty in alkaline water dissociation during the production of green hydrogen, it is expected that such a built-in electric field can be constructed to boost interfacial electron enrichment to increase the water dissociation and hydrogen evolution kinetics. Herein, an n-type BiPO4 semiconductor is integrated with metallic Ru clusters (Ru/BiPO4) to produce an intrinsically built-in electric field, which causes electron enrichment via unidirectional electron transfer from BiPO4 to Ru. The resultant Ru/BiPO4 nanocomposite demonstrates superior water splitting activity toward electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution to Ru/C without electron enrichment in alkaline solution, and even exhibits nine-fold mass activity of commercial Pt/C in a harsher medium (3 M KOH). DFT calculation demonstrates that the positively charged BiPO4 matrix significantly decreases the energy barrier of water dissociation, while the negatively charged Ru clusters with more active electronic states optimize the proton adsorption and combination kinetics. The Ru layer in close contact with the phosphate matrix accepts the greatest number of electrons and shows the optimal Delta G(H*). This work sheds new light on the advantage of the physical effect for designing advanced electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000653207600001

However, only few edge unsaturated sulfurs functionalize as catalytic sites, which has dramatically limited the catalytic activity and stability. In this work, planar unsaturated sulfurs in (211) plane of the CoS2 nanowires have been successfully activated through constructing Graphdiyne-CoS2 heterojunction nanocomposites. The corresponding electrons transfer energy barriers for these planar unsaturated sulfurs have been significantly diminished, which are induced by the synergetic effects of the sp(1) hybridized carbons and unsaturated planar sulfurs. In addition, DFT simulations reveal the synergetic effects of the sp(1) hybridized carbons and unsaturated planar sulfurs can promote electron transfer kinetics of the key step, Volmer-Heyrovsky step, of the reaction. As expected, the Graphdiyne-CoS2 heterojunction nanocomposites exhibit superior HER catalytic performance with low overpotential of 97 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, the heterojunction shows outstanding stability as well due to the protection of the Graphdiyne (GDY). The approach thus paves the way for the further efficient transition metal disulfides catalyst manufactures.

Herein, we report a facile, general, one-step synthetic method that leads to a family of non-noble metal hydrogen-evolving electrocatalysts that composed of metal phosphide nanoparticles embedded within nitrogen-doped carbon matrix. The synthesis of the materials is achieved via a facile one-step thermal treatment in inert atmosphere of homogeneously mixed urea, diammonium hydrogen phosphate and metal salts (e.g., ammonium molybdate for the synthesis of MoP). The use of inexpensive urea is crucial in the synthesis as it helps the deoxygenation-reduction of some metal salts and phosphor source (i.e., diammonium hydrogen phosphate) and undergoes in situ carbonization, leading to the formation of a composite material containing metal phosphide nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) in one pot. Furthermore, we show that the resulting composite nanomaterials can serve as highly active, stable, noble metal-free electrocatalysts towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In particular, the MoP@NC material exhibits the best electrocatalytic activity in our study. This material affords a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at a low overpotential of 135 mV, exhibits excellent catalytic stability as long as 20 h, and gives nearly 100% Faradaic yield towards HER.

Herein we directly synthesized porous NCN material via the facile pyrolysis of chitosan and urea without the requirement of any catalyst or post-treatment. As-prepared material exhibits a very large BET surface area of similar to 1510 m(2) g(-1) and a high ratio of graphitic/pyridinic nitrogen structure (2.69 at. % graphitic N and 1.20 at. % pyridinic N). Moreover, compared to a commercial Pt/C catalyst, NCN displays excellent electrocatalytic activity, better long-term stability, and methanol tolerance ability toward the oxygen reduction reaction, indicating a promising metal-free alternative to Pt-based cathode catalysts in alkaline fuel cells. This scalable fabrication method supplies a low-cost, high-efficiency metal-free oxygen reduction electrocatalyst and also suggests an economic and sustainable route from biomass-based molecules to value-added nanocarbon materials.									114	4	0	0	7	0	117			0743-7463			WOS:000339229000038	24945900

Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) is considered an effective catalyst for non-aqueous Li-O-2 batteries owing to its excellent oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction activity. However, low electrical conductivity and agglomeration of Co3O4 can degrade the electrochemical performance properties. We present a facile method of synthesizing porous carbon/Co3O4 composites derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) via post-thermal treatment for use as the cathode in rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries. Use of cobalt-containing MOFs as a sacrificial template produces uniformly distributed Co3O4 nanoparticles in the carbonaceous matrix, alleviating the problems of Using only Co3O4 aS the cathode material. As-synthesized porous carbon/Co3O4 composites show superibr electrochemical performance, for example, a low overpotential and high reversible capacity of about 9850 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1). They also exhibit excellent cyclability up to the 320th cycle, with a limited capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 200 mA g(-1). The improvement is attributed to the catalytic activity and mesoporous structure of uniformly distributed Co3O4 nanoparticles in the carbonaceous matrix. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The composite Ni3Se2/Ni(OH)(2)/Ni was obtained through a hydrothermal process and subsequent selenization reaction by heat treatment, while the Ni3Se2/Ni was synthesized only through a selenization reaction by heat treatment. The materials were characterized by confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. The results that displayed different structures were grown on the Ni-foam, such as Ni(OH)(2) nanoleaflets, Ni3Se2 nanosticks composed of spheres, and Ni3Se2 nanowires between Ni(OH)(2) nanoleaflets, for Ni(OH)(2)/Ni, Ni3Se2/Ni, and Ni3Se2/Ni(OH)(2)/Ni composites, respectively.

The phosphidation degree, namely the P dosage in these phosphides shows pronounced influence on the catalytic performance but is hard to control. In this work we developed a reliable strategy to synthesize Rh2P-based nanoparticles with controlled phosphidation degree, and investigated the influence of phosphidation degree on HER. It is found that the heterostructured Rh2P/Rh nanoparticle, i.e., the P-deficient composite with mixed metallic and phosphide phases, outperforms either the metallic Rh or pure Rh2P nanoparticles. As-synthesized Rh2P/Rh nanoparticles supported on P/N co-doped graphene (denoted as Rh2P/Rh-G) display remarkable HER activity with tiny overpotential of 17 and 19 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density in alkaline and acid, efficiently surpassing its Rh-based rivals and benchmark Pt/C catalyst. Meanwhile it illustrates a large mass-specific activity (3.23 and 6.26 A mg(-1)@50 mV overpotential in alkaline and acid, respectively) due to its high activity and low metal loading. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicates that the Rh2P/Rh heterostructured interface possesses the optimal close-to-zero value of hydrogen adsorption energy and water dissociation process is accelerated, and thus boosts HER activity.

The metal Zn derived from zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) was combined with the S element to form ZnS nanoparticles, and then embedded in N-enriched carbon during the sulfurization process. Following this, the P element was well-dispersed in the catalyst via phosphorization. It was found that ZnSP/NC exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity when used as a catalyst for the HER process. ZnSP/NC, with an overpotential of 171 mV and a Tafel slope of 54.78 mV dec(-1), demonstrates superior electrocatalytic activity as compared to Zn/NC (277 mV, 92.34 mV dec(-1)) and ZnS/NC (241 mV, 76.41 mV dec(-1)). During the HER process, ZnS and P serve as active sites, while the N-enriched carbon provides reliable electronic transmission. The synergistic effects among the ZnS, P, and N-enriched carbon result in an excellent electrocatalytic activity of ZnSP/NC for the HER process. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, the kinetics of the anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline media is much more sluggish than the case in acid media. Ruthenium (Ru) possesses reasonable hydrogen binding energy and oxyphilic ability to reach balanced adsorption of OHad and H-ad at low anode potentials, and, to a certain degree, Ru-based electrocatalysts are considered as potential alternatives to Pt toward the alkaline HOR. Although a number of reviews have overviewed the development of alkaline HOR electrocatalysts from different viewpoints, a systematic review on Ru-based alkaline HOR electrocatalysts is still rare. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in Ru-based electrocatalysts for the alkaline HOR. The fundamental reaction mechanisms of the electrocatalytic HOR under alkaline conditions are introduced and discussed. Then, the recent advances in Ru-based electrocatalysts are summarized on the basis of four catalyst-design strategies including the composition effect, support effect, size effect, and structure effect. Finally, perspectives on the challenges and opportunities toward developing advanced Ru-based HOR electrocatalysts are also highlighted.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000862319200001

An important key factor in this process is the oxygen carriers (OCs) used to transfer oxygen from the air to the fuel. In this work, three natural iron ores from Brazil were selected as interesting oxygen carriers for the CLC process due to their low cost and abundance in nature. Their chemical composition, redox properties, and structural evolution when submitted to a reactivity test in a thermobalance with 15% CH4 and H-2 were investigated. The OCs (ItaHP-MG, ItaHP-RN, and ItaLP-RN) revealed good resistance to fracture, and their reactivity increased after the first reaction cycle due to the occurrence of an activation process, leading to a gain in reactivity in the following cycles. The reactivity tests showed that for all OCs, the reactivity with hydrogen was higher when compared to methane, highlighting ItaHP-MG oxygen carrier with relevant rate index values for both fuels (9.60%/min and 3.55%/min for H-2 and CH4, respectively). However, OCs performed differently depending on the degree of use of the Fe2O3 phase. Interestingly, ItaHP-MG, with a high Fe2O3 content (96.5%), showed a regeneration of only 60%, while ItaLP-RN, whose Fe2O3 content is 41.5%, presented a degree of use above 85%. This effect is the result of preferential gas-solid interaction on the surface of the OC.									5	0	0	0	1	0	4			0888-5885			WOS:000763116000009

The CoSe2@NiSe2 materials were first prepared and in situ grown on nickel foam by typical hydrothermal and selenification process at 120 degrees C. The results show that the CoSe2@NiSe2 material used as the 3D substrates electrode can maximize the synergy between the CoSe2 and NiSe2, and also exhibits high efficiency of water splitting reaction. The lower overpotential of only 235 mV is presented to attain 20 mA cm(-2) compared to the benchmark of RuO2 electrodes (270 mV @ 20 mA cm(-2)). Besides, the CoSe2@NiSe2 material also shows a remarkable improved hydrogen evolution reaction activity compared to NiSe2 (192 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) and Co precursor catalysts (208 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) individually, which a low overpotential of only 162 mV is achieved at 10 mA cm(-2). The CoSe2@NiSe2 catalysts exhibit excellent water splitting performance (cell voltage of 1.50 V@ 10 mA cm(-2)) under alkaline conditions. It was proved that the high water splitting performance of the catalyst is attributed to high electrochemical activity area and synergistic effect. The work offers new ideas for the exploitation of synergistic catalysis of composite catalysts and adds new examples for the exploitation of efficient, better and relatively non-toxic electrocatalysts.

In previous works, the NDW has been implicated as a possible source of r-process and light p-process isotopes. In this paper, we present time-dependent hydrodynamic calculations of nucleosynthesis in the NDW which include accurate weak interaction physics coupled to a full nuclear reaction network. Using two published models of PNS neutrino luminosities, we predict the contribution of the NDW to the integrated nucleosynthetic yield of the entire supernova. For the neutrino luminosity histories considered, no true r-process occurs in the most basic scenario. The wind driven from an older 1.4M(circle dot) model for a PNS ismoderately neutron-rich at late times however, and produces Rb-87, Sr-88, Y-89, and Zr-90 in near solar proportions relative to oxygen. The wind from a more recently studied 1.27M(circle dot) PNS is proton-rich throughout its entire evolution and does not contribute significantly to the abundance of any element. It thus seems very unlikely that the simplest model of the NDW can produce the r-process. At most, it contributes to the production of the N = 50 closed shell elements and some light p-nuclei. In doing so, it may have left a distinctive signature on the abundances in metal-poor stars, but the results are sensitive to both uncertain models for the explosion and the masses of the neutron stars involved.									100	7	0	0	0	0	104			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000282908900080

Herein a simple synthetic route to heterometallic metal-organic nanofibers (Pd-Co, Pd-Ni, and Pd-Mn, etc.) is developed via metal-organic gelation synthesized from pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid, Pe, and various transition-metal ions at molar ratio of 2:1:2 at room temperature. These nanofiber catalysts show excellent electrochemical performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Especially, heterometallic Pd-Co nanofibers loaded on nickel foam by drop-casting showed the best HER performance at 96 mV (Pd-Ni, 107 mV; Pd-Mn, 132 mV) under the current density 10 mA cm(-2) and it has a smaller Tafel slope at 63 mV dec(-1). The HER performance of the heterometallic Pd-Co nanofibers is greatly improved by in situ electrochemical activation (EA) strategy (activated at the current density of 10 mA cm -2 for about 40000 s) to obtain EA Pd-Co@Pd NPs. EA Pd-CopPd NPs showed low overpotential of 57 mV (vs RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2). and 134 mV (vs RHE) at 100 mA cm(-2), and smaller Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1) than Pd-Co nanofiber, which implies faster HER kinetics after EA. The HER performance of EA Pd-Co@Pd NPs is even better than that of commercial Pt/C at high current density, which is attributed to the formation of Pd nanoparticles (Pd NPs) grown on the fibrous network during the EA process. The valence state of Pd changes from +2 to 0 valence after the EA, and the resulting Pd NPs exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity for HER. Meanwhile, EA Pd-Co Pd NPs are stable at ambient temperature and exhibit excellent electrochemical stability for more than 80 h. This work provides opportunities for the development of metal-organic materials for advanced energy conversion, and a method is proposed to improve the efficiency of using precious metals as electrocatalysts for HER.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2574-0970			WOS:000526396200031

Selective leaching of excess Ni in electrodeposited NixP1-x enabled fabrication of a nanoporous NiP GDE with a large electrochemical surface area (ECSA). In half-cell tests, the nanoporous NiP GDE demonstrated a hydrogen-evolving current density of -10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 103 mV with good stability. In the single-cell tests, the PEMWE employing a nanoporous NiP cathode exhibited a current density of 1.47 A/cm(2) at a cell voltage of 2.0 V, which was the competitive performance among state-of-the-art non-noble cathodes reported to date.									19	1	0	0	3	0	20			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000484073400027	31381294

Values of E-corr of the alloys are markedly influenced by their composition. The anodic behaviour in the active region is controlled by Fe in the alloys and the dissolution reaction is characterized by Tafel slopes, b(a), between 64 and 88 mV (decade)(-1). A two-electron transfer mechanism for the anodic dissolution is proposed. Passivation of the alloys is due to the formation of oxide layers including Fe2O3 and/or Fe3O4. Both critical and passive c.d. (I-cc and I-P) are markedly increased in the presence of Cl- ions, but the presence of F- ions inhibit the active dissolution of the alloys. The Tafel slope for oxygen evolution reaction (o.e.r.) in the transpassive region, b(O) is 240 +/- 25 mV. In the proposed mechanism for the o.e.r., the rate determining step is an electron transfer reaction and possible interpretation of the high Tafel slopes is given based on the dual barrier model.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0021-891X			WOS:000086110200009

It is of great importance to design and develop robust electrocatalysts, for hydrogen production from water electrolysis, composed exclusively of low cost, non-precious elements that exhibit activity and stability comparable to those of the noble metals.In the present work, taking into account the high conductivity of carbon, a nitrogen-doped ultrathin carbon sheath covered Cu2S-Cu3P (Cu2S-Cu3P@C) as integrated architecture is synthesized. Remarkably, Cu2S-Cu3P@C, as a novel HER cathode operating in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte exhibits a low onset potential of 48 mV, an overpotential of 85 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 34 mV dec(-1). Meanwhile, after 80 h holding at -400 mA cm(-2), the decrease in activity is negligible, demonstrating an excellent stability that outperforms most of the Cu-based electrocatalysts reported recently. The performance improvement is due to a unique carbon encapsulation structure, which could enhance the conductivity, facilitate the charge transfers and improve the corrosion resistance. This study will be beneficial to design and development of high performance non-precious metal electrocatalysts applied for electrocatalytic hydrogen generation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Rohde, Sebastian; Wiltsche, Helmar; Cowley, Aidan; Gollas, Bernhard								Dissolution and electrolysis of lunar regolith in ionic liquids								PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE				219						105534	10.1016/j.pss.2022.105534				SEP 15 2022	2022	Oxygen extraction from lunar regolith is one of the key in-situ resource utilization methods required for a per-manent human presence on the moon. In this work an electrolysis-based extraction method was investigated, which works with innocuous chemicals and at moderate temperatures. EAC-1 was utilized as lunar regolith simulant and the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate was used as electrolyte. The working principle of this method, which was pioneered by Paley et al.2009, is envisaged as a three step process. First, water is generated by the dissolution of regolith in the Bronsted acidic ionic liquid. This water is electrolyzed, yielding oxygen and hydrogen as an intermediate product. Finally, the ionic liquid is regenerated by anodic oxidation of hydrogen and cathodic reduction of the dissolved metal ions. A gravimetric investigation showed that approximately 30 wt% of EAC-1 can be solubilized, if at least 6 g of ionic liquid are used per gram of EAC-1. Phosphorous oxide was found to be the most soluble compound with 82.0 +/- 3.1% of the total amount in solution, followed by MgO, Na2O, K2O, Al2O3, iron oxides, TiO2 and CaO in decreasing order as determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Cyclic voltammetry of the neat ionic liquid revealed that reduction of H+ is the dominant cathodic reaction of the electrolyte. The cyclic voltammogram of the EAC-1 solution showed a Fe2+/Fe3+ redox peak pair, yet no distinct current, which could be attributed to further reduction of metal ions and electrodeposition. An investigation of the electrode surfaces with SEM and EDX after potential controlled electrolysis experiments at strongly negative cathodic potentials did not reveal any signs of metal deposition and ionic liquid regeneration. Hence, more work is required to enable the ionic liquid regeneration of this oxygen extraction method by either inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction in the ionic liquid electrolyte or facilitating metal deposition.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0032-0633	1873-5088		WOS:000835189100007

However, the main obstacles in their industrial application are the scarcity and high cost of Pt resources. Herein, we proposed a novel confined replacement method to synthesize PtCu nanoalloys with molybdenum dioxide supported by a porous octahedral carbon matrix (PtCu-MoO2@C)viaa metal-organic framework (MOF)-assisted strategy. Cu-based MOFs and MOF-derived octahedral carbon served as substrates to co-promote the formation and high dispersion of PtCu nanoalloys by thein situreduction of Pt ions, resulting in fast electron transfer during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As expected, our electrocatalyst requires very small overpotentials (24 mV in 1.0 M KOH and 42 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4) to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, it exhibits a superior mass activity (0.30 A mg(Pt)(-1)at -0.05 V in alkaline media and 0.49 A mg(Pt)(-1)at -0.05 V in acidic media), which is about 1.6 times that of commercial Pt/C catalysts, and high durability when compared with that of Pt/C, with a nearly 100% faradaic yield of hydrogen production. This synthetic strategy can provide new approaches to the design of noble metal-based electrocatalysts for future energy systems.									32	1	0	0	1	0	32			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000573889000014

In this study, a family of hierarchical architectures constructed from dendritic quaternary PtFeRuRh, ternary PtFeRh or PtFeRu and binary PtFe nanoalloys are achieved via a general liquid-phase strategy for hydrogen evolution in alkaline electrolyte. Among them, the PtFeRuRh nanoalloys exhibit the lowest overpotential (20.0 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (21.1 mV dec(-1)). At a potential of -0.07 V, the mass activity of the PtFeRuRh nanoalloy is 7.04 A mg(Pt)(-1), it is 6.97 times that of commercial Pt/C. The dendritic PtFeRuRh nanoalloys exhibit a negligible decrease in activity after 20 h of continuous testing at 10 mA cm(-2)/100 mA cm(-2) and 3000 cyclic voltammetry cycles. In a practical application, the cell voltage of a PtFeRhRu (-) parallel to IrO2 (+) couple is 1.568 V at 10mA cm(-2) with almost 100% faradaic efficiency. The turnover frequency of the PtFeRhRu electrocatalyst at 70 mV was 78.5 s(-1), which is 11.71 times as large as that of commercial Pt/C (6.7 s(-1)). (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In this perspective, we demonstrate graphene-like hierarchical porous nanosheets derived from an inexpensive dry spathe-pollen waste of palm plant as an efficient HER catalyst by pursuing "energy from waste" strategy. Investigation of chemical composition and micro-environment by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirms the presence of pyridinic, pyrrolic, and graphitic nitrogen innate from N-containing organic components. The textural features with N-2 sorption measurements suggests complimentary of high surface area (1297 m(2) g(-1)), pore volume (0.6 mL g(-1)), and hierarchical micro/mesoporous architecture which could strongly promote the performance in HER catalysis. Tested as a HER catalyst, the as-prepared carbon material furnish a smaller overpotential (eta(10)) of 0.33 V vs. RHE, at 10.0 mA cm(-2) along with a small Tafel slope value of 63 mV dec(-1) and long-term stability under acidic medium. The hydrogen binding energy of HPNS and undoped carbon were calculated from DFT studies to support the HPNS activity. Such exquisite properties may be attributed to unique combination of high surface area, facile electrolyte percolation within hierarchical bimodal pore system, robust electrode/electrolyte interface, and N-dopant.

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirm the lattice spacing is expanded by prolonged sulfuration. Performance studies demonstrate that Bi2S3 with the largest lattice expansion (Bi2S3-9.7%, where 9.7% represents the lattice expansion) exhibits a greater electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity compared to Bi2S3 and Bi2S3-3.2%. Density functional theory calculations reveal the expansion of the lattice spacing reduces the bandwidth and upshifts the band center of the Bi 3d orbits, facilitating electron exchange with the S 2p orbits. The resultant intrinsic electronic configuration exhibits favorable H* adsorption kinetics and a reduced energy barrier for water dissociation in hydrogen evolution. Operando Raman and post-mortem characterizations using XRD and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal the generation of pseudo-amorphous Bi at the edge of Bi2S3 nanorods of the sample with lattice strain during HER, yielding Bi2S3-9.7%-A. It is worth noting when Bi2S3-9.7%-A is assembled as a positive electrode in an asymmetric supercapacitor, its performance is greatly superior to that of the same device formed using pristine Bi2S3-9.7%. The as-prepared Bi2S3-9.7%-A//activated carbon asymmetric supercapacitor achieves a high specific capacitance of 307.4 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), exhibiting high retention of 84.1% after 10 000 cycles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000856974700001

Herein, amorphous quaternary alloy phosphide NiCoFeP@NiCoP/NF with pagoda-like hierarchical nanoarrays structure grown on Ni foam is synthesized. The synergy effect between alloy components, the superior hierarchical nanoarrays structure and superaerophobic characteristic enables NiCoFeP@NiCoP/NF to be a pH-Universal electrocatalyst with high electrocatalytic performance toward HER and simulated seawater. To achieve 10 mA cm(-2), this catalyst just required overpotential of 77, 136 and 184 mV in alkaline, acidic and neutral aqueous solution. The NiCo2O4@Ni [Fe (CN)(6)]/NF has stable HER performance (over 10 h) and a Faradic efficiency of 90.5% in simulated seawater. This work is expected to open up a new road for the construction of amorphous alloy phosphides with hierarchical nanoarrays structure for energy storage and conversion.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000474530600056

Here, employing the industrial 316 L stainless steel (SS), the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of a series of SS meshes with different mesh number (100-1600) were studied in acidic condition. The results exhibit that the cheap industrial 316 L SS meshes have excellent electrocatalytic HER activity. Meanwhile, the electrocatalytic HER performance of the 316 L SS meshes increases with the increase of mesh number. The HER activity was increased with the mesh number increases from 100 to 1600 meshes, where the optimized 316 L SS1600 obtains a low overpotential of 209.8 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope (115.6 mV dec(-1)). However, with further increase of the mesh number from 1600 meshes to 2800 meshes, the HER performance started to decrease. A possible mechanism for the effect of the mesh number on HER performance was proposed, which can be ascribed to the electrochemical specific surface area and the tight interweaving of SS mesh for hydrogen release. This work provides an important direction for the performance improvement of the low-cost industrially available electrodes towards scale-up electrocatalytic hydrogen production and renewable energy storage.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2				2352-152X		WOS:000674627000003

Although various metal architectures based on metal nanoligaments and nanowires are well known, they typically show a tradeoff between mechanical robustness, high surface area, and high (macro)porosity, which, when combined, could significantly improve the performance of devices such as batteries, electrolyzers, or sensors. In this work, we rationally designed templated networks of interconnected metal nanowires, combining for the first time high porosity of metal foams, narrowly distributed macropores, and a very high surface area of nanoporous dealloyed metals. Thanks to their structural uniformity, the few-micron thick nanowire meshes are also remarkably flexible and durable. We show how the textural properties of the material can be precisely tuned to optimize the nanowire networks for applications in different devices. In an exemplary application in electrolytic production of hydrogen, thanks to its high surface area, a few-micron thick nanomesh outperformed a 300 times thicker nickel foam. Furthermore, thanks to its high porosity, the Pt-doped nanomesh surpassed a microporous Pt/C cloth, demonstrating benefits of the optimally designed nanowire structure for a simultaneous improvement and miniaturization of electrochemical devices. This work extends the potential of interconnected nanowires to multiple new research and industrial applications requiring highly porous and flexible conductive materials with a high surface-to-volume ratio.									14	0	0	0	0	0	15			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000454751600048	30484309

Different current densities (20, 40 and 60 mA cm(-2)) and temperatures (25, 40 and 60 A degrees C) were studied during electrochemical treatment. After that, the EO of each of these dyes was separately investigated. The EO of each of these dyes was performed, varying only the current density and keeping the same temperature (25 A degrees C). The elimination of colour was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy, and the degradation of organic compounds was analysed by means of chemical oxygen demand (COD). Data obtained from the analysis of the dye mixture showed that the EO process was effective in colour removal, in which more than 90 % was removed. In the case of COD removal, the application of a current density greater than 40 mA cm(-2) favoured the oxygen evolution reaction, and no complete oxidation was achieved. Regarding the analysis of individual anodic oxidation dyes, it was appreciated that the data for the NY were very close to the results obtained for the oxidation of the dye mixture while the RR dye achieved higher colour removal but lower COD elimination. These results suggest that the oxidation efficiency is dependent on the nature of the organic molecule, and it was confirmed by the intermediates identified.									38	3	0	0	10	0	40			0944-1344	1614-7499		WOS:000340613200033	24801286

Compared with a simple ABO(3) perovskite, the A-site-ordered quadruple structure AA'3B4O12 shows enhanced OER activity, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Herein, we find that the quadruple perovskite oxide CaCu3Ir4O12 has stable and superior electrochemical activity with a very low overpotential of 252 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) in alkaline solution. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that the B-site Ir is an OER active site with a variable valence state from the initial Ir4+ approach to Ir5+, while the A'-site Cu is inactive with a constant valence state during the OER process. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the A'-B intersite cooperation synergistically enhances OER activity via the corner-sharing Cu-O-Ir framework owing to the strong 3d-2p-5d orbital hybridizations, regardless of the inactive Cu site. In the structural constitution of CaCu3Ir4O12, a small Cu-O-Ir bond angle (110.7 degrees) forms. The special orbital symmetry as well as the delicate 3d-5d levels enhance the orbital overlap and therefore promote the charge transfer, favoring the superior OER activity of CaCu3Ir4O12.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000753956100026

Herein, we synthesized nitrogen-containing nanocarbons (NCNs) with a nitrogen content of 27.6 atom % by a photochemical approach. We found that this NCNs structure can act as a catalyst to drive the reduction of CO2 into carbon monoxide (CO). The CO evolution activity over the NCNs reached 34.5 mu mol/30 min (1 mg NCN) with a selectivity of 80.4%. The quantum efficiency over the NCNs was 2.3% at 450 nm irradiation, which is comparable to those of the metal-based catalysts for CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation. The reaction processes of CO2 reduction were investigated by CO2 adsorption, CO2 temperature-programmed desorption, and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. Results suggested that the pyridinic nitrogen sites within NCNs were the main active species for CO2 reduction catalysis. Besides, we observed that nanocarbons with oxygen modification can also drive the CO2 reduction reaction. However, the promotion effect of the nitrogen modification on CO2 reduction was better than that of the oxygen modification on CO2 reduction. Additionally, using this photochemical approach, we synthesized different nanocarbons by changing carbon precursors, highlighting the versatility of this approach. This work expands the application of nanocarbon for photosynthetic CO2 conversion.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900032

This electrochemical deuteration method with high efficiency and selectivity furnishes a series of D-labelled chemicals and pharmaceuticals in high yields with excellent D-incorporation. The reaction efficiency and selectivity, that is, the precise substitution of deuterium atoms at different halogen positions, can be tuned by varying the applied voltages.

We demonstrate that this effect, which is a major reason for failures of the wire bonds in microelectronics, can be utilized for producing hollow AlAu2 nanoparticles attached to sapphire substrate. To this end, we produced the core-shell Al-Au nanoparticles by performing a solid state dewetting treatment of Al thin film deposited on sapphire substrate, followed by the deposition of thin Au layer on the top of dewetted sample. Annealing of the core-shell nanoparticles in air resulted in outdiffusion of Al from the particles, formation of pores, and growth of the AlAu2 intermetallic phase in the particles. We demonstrated that the driving force for hollowing is the oxidation reaction of the Al atoms at the Au-sapphire interface, leading to the homoepitaxial growth of newly formed alumina at the interface. We developed a kinetic model of hollowing controlled by diffusion of oxygen through the Au thin film, and estimated the solubility of oxygen in solid Au. Our work demonstrates that the core-shell nanoparticles attached to the substrate can be hollowed by the Kirkendall effect in the thin film spatially separated from the particles.

The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and control experiments provide strong evidence for the reaction mechanism proving the applicability of the CTFs to activate oxygen into superoxide species. This report highlights the importance of a self-templating procedure to introduce N functionalities for the development of metal-free catalytic materials. The presented findings reveal an important step toward the use of CTFs as inexpensive and high-performance alternatives to metal-based materials not only for catalysis but also for biorelated applications dealing with O-2 activation.									35	0	0	0	1	0	35			2375-2548			WOS:000523302400027	32284980

However, nanosheets are typically stacked horizontally toward the current collector, leading to poor utilization of individual nanosheets. Although most studies have fabricated three-dimensional (3D) structures using nanosheets, the wall thickness was a few hundred nanometers, suggesting that hundreds of nanosheets were restacked along the wall. In this study, we demonstrated the fabrication of a 3D structure constructed by NiO nanowalls with a thickness of 2-3 nm (3D-NiO). The specific surface area of 3D-NiO was found to be 42 m(2) g(-1), which is 2.6 times larger than that of NiO nanoparticles. The specific capacity of 3D-NiO was 2.5 times higher than that of NiO nanoparticles and could be attributed to the large specific surface area because of the nature of the thin nanowalls. The O-2-evolution reaction (OER) activity of 3D-NiO at 1.65 V vs RHE was sixfold greater than that of NiO nanoparticles. The enhanced OER activity of 3D-NiO could be attributed to both the large specific surface area and the fabrication of diffusion paths within the 3D structure. The OER activity of 3D-NiO after 500 cycles was four times higher than that of NiO nanoparticles. Our results show that the 3D structure fabricated with thin nanowalls is a promising porous material for capacitor electrodes and electrocatalysts for applications in electrolysis and fuel cells.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2574-0970		WOS:000692034900048

First, an as-prepared sponge-like NiAu nanoalloy is obtained by using NaBH4 to reduce a NiCl2 and HAuCl4 mixture without using any surfactant. Second, this as-prepared sponge-like NiAu nanoalloy is treated by argon plasma under atmospheric pressure with a treatment time of 15 min to obtain the final plasma-treated sponge-like NiAu nanoalloy. The HER electrocatalytic performance of the plasma-treated sponge-like NiAu nanoalloy is then investigated in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. From the results, the plasma-treated sponge-like NiAu nanoalloy exhibits enhanced HER performance compared to the as-prepared sponge-like NiAu nanoalloy due to the exposure of more active/edge sites. The overpotential at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) of the plasma-treated sponge-like NiAu nanoalloy (88 mV) is lower than that of the as-prepared sponge-like NiAu nanoalloy (134 mV), and this is due to the plasma treatment process. In addition, plasma-treated sponge-like NiAu nanoalloy shows an excellent durable ability of HER activity for 80,000 s.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000482179500012

In this work, We use crab shell waste as a carbon source through carbonization, activation, and sol-gel method to synthesize activated functional carbon (AFC) and fabricate CoPt/AFC catalyst for Li-O2 batteries. The as-prepared AFC possesses abundant hydroxyl (OH-) and amino (NH2-) groups as the link bridge for enhancing the metal-support interaction. Revealed by the density functional theory calculations, the tuned adsorption for intermediates and reduced overpotentials for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) are achieved on such the composite structure. Experimentally, CoPt nanoparticles are evenly distributed on the surface of OH- and NH2- functionalized porous carbon through the sol-gel method. The abundant pore structures in the resultant catalyst (CoPt/AFC) can provide sufficient room for depositing discharge products. Moreover, the side reactions are effectively suppressed, as evidenced by the insitu Raman spectra. As a result, the LOBs with the CoPt/AFC cathode present excellent electrochemical performances with a high discharge specific capacity of 8.25 mAh cm-2, a low overpotential of 0.47 V, and good cycling stability of 156 cycles.									38	3	0	0	2	0	38			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000649702900004

The poly-Co(II) TAPP modified electrode presented Z 60.26 nm and RMS 4.73 nm values. In addition, a supramolecular assembly of Co(II) TAPP physisorbed on the polymeric film of the same porphyrin modified electrode was prepared (SMA-Co(II)TAPP/poly-Co(II)TAPP/GC). This supramolecular assembly presented Z 115.55 nm and RMS 37 nm values obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) surface characterization. The polymer film and the p-p staking supramolecular assemblies were characterized by atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). These modified electrodes were compared as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction at pH 6.8, phosphate buffer. Oxygen electrocatalytic reduction at the supramolecular modified electrode started at 0.20 V vs. Ag/AgCl, shifting the potential ca. 0.15 V with respect to the polymer modified electrode. On the other hand, under the same experimental conditions the catalytic current increased ca. 30 %. Carbon dioxide electrocatalytic reduction assays afforded similar results at both modified electrodes. Nevertheless, within the studied potential range for the reaction, hydrogen evolution takes place decreasing thus the carbon dioxide electrocatalytic reduction.									9	0	1	0	1	0	10			1452-3981			WOS:000312933600056

In this work, graphdiyne overlayer was proposed as a more excellent material than graphene or hexagonal boron nitride for two-dimensional confined catalysis on Pt(111) surface. Density functional theory calculations revealed the superiority of graphdiyne overlayer originates from the steric hindrance effect which increases the catalytic ability and lowers the reaction barriers. Moreover, with the big triangle holes as natural gas tunnels, graphdiyne possesses higher efficiency for the transit of gaseous reactants and products than graphene or hexagonal boron nitride. The results in this work would benefit future development of two-dimensional confined catalysis.									6	1	0	0	2	0	6			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000431832900003

In this work, nitrogen-doped molybdenum carbide nanobelts (N-Mo2C NBs) with porous structure are synthesized through a direct pyrolysis process using the pre-prepared molybdenum oxide nanobelts (MOO3 NBs). Nanocellulose instead of Nafion-bonded N-Mo2C NBs (N-Mo2C@NCs) exhibits superior performance toward HER, because of excellent dispersibility and multiple exposed catalytically active sites. Furthermore, the conductive film composed of N-Mo2C NBs, graphene nanosheets, and nanocellulose (N-Mo2C/G@NCs) is fabricated by simple vacuum filtration, as flexible and editable electrode, which possesses excellent performance for scale HER applications. This work not only proposes the potential of nanocellulose to replace Nafion for binding powder catalysts, but also offers a facile strategy to prepare flexible and conductive films for a wide variety of nanomaterials.									27	2	0	0	2	0	27				2589-0042		WOS:000488278300091	31527009

For this purpose, it is important to compare the catalytic activities measured using different methods and under different conditions. To achieve this, it is of utmost importance to avoid certain methodological and instrumental issues that can severely affect the obtained experimental results. Using well-defined systems, we demonstrate the importance of experimental conditions in the assessment and benchmarking of the activity of catalytic processes for various reactions. Particularly, we demonstrate that the correction of the uncompensated ohmic resistance using impedance spectroscopy measurements requires particular attention and additional procedures which are normally ignored. Additionally, we demonstrate how the uncompensated resistance changes with the potential if a non-conducting gas phase is accumulated in the system, hence influencing the activity measurement. It is further shown that a correct choice for surface-limited reactions for the determination of the real surface area of catalytic electrodes plays a key role in ensuring more meaningful activity assessment.									41	1	0	0	4	0	41			2196-0216			WOS:000347973500017

These characteristics strongly depend on the valence states of Mo in the oxides such as IV, V, and VI, which can be efficiently altered through oxygen deficiencies within the oxides. Here, we present a colloidal electrodeposition method to introduce oxygen vacancies in such Mo oxide films. We prepared uniform MoOx films and investigated their electrochemical characteristics under different valence states IV, V, and VI. In this paper, we demonstrate that MoO2+x films, where Mo in valence states IV and V, can be used for high-performance supercapacitor electrodes. Due to their high conductivity, they exhibit an areal capacitance of 89 mF cm(-2) at 1 mA cm(-2) and negligible capacitance loss within 600 cycles. Additionally, we demonstrate that, in a complementary electrochromic device configuration, the introduction of an MoO2+x counter electrode remarkably lowers the activation potential of WO3 from -2 to -0.5 V and achieves a fully bleached state at 0.5 V. These properties make the MoO2+x film an ideal counter electrode to store ions for an electrochromic device. Furthermore, MoO3-y films, where Mo in the valence states V and VI, are obtained by annealing the electrodeposited MoO2+x film under 200 degrees C for 24 h. Such films exhibit an excellent catalytic for the HER with an overpotential of 201 mV. Furthermore, we show that MoO3 films, where Mo at its highest oxidation state (VI), can be obtained via annealing the MoO2+x film at 300 degrees C for 6 h, and the resulting films exhibit battery characteristics. Our research provides a new and facile strategy to fabricate substoichiometric molybdenum oxide nanofilms and reveals the effect of different valences on the electrochemical performance of molybdenum oxide films, which opens new doorways for future research in the electrochemical applications of transition metal oxides.									56	1	0	0	0	0	56			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000470938500080	31094499

Herein, fully ordered Au-doped PtCo nanoparticles (L1(0)-PtCoAu NPs) with a size of sub-4 nm are successfully synthesized by annealing the PtAu alloy which coated by CoO shell (PtAu@CoO) under H-2 atmosphere. The artificially introduced vacancies during annealing process can accelerate the atomic diffusion, which is beneficial to the conversion from disordered alloy structure to intermetallic structure. And the addition of Au and Co atoms synergistically tunes the crystal and electronic structure of Pt. As a result, the electrochemical tests show that the mass activity of fully ordered L1(0)-PtCoAu0.1/C catalyst is 1.08 A mg(Pt)(-1), which is 6 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. Due to the protective effect of Au atoms and the stable ordered structure, the prepared L1(0)-PtCoAu0.1/C catalyst show enhanced durability compared with commercial Pt/C after 20,000 potential cycles. This work provides a facile and scalable method to prepare small-sized Pt-based intermetallic alloy catalyst with improved activity and durability for ORR. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Beneficial from the acceler-ated electron/optimized adsorption of intermediate of JMPA-NPs and the nature of high entropy effect of HEA-NPs, the catalyst (HEA/JMPA) exhibits superior OER and HER catalytic performance with excellent stability in 1 M KOH solution. For OER, the overpotential required to reach 20 mA cm- 2 (120) is only 314 mV, which is much better than that of commercial RuO2 catalyst. During the long-term operation at 10 mA cm-2, the potential presents almost no attenuation after 21 h. For HER, the 110 is only 85 mV with superior stability of 108 h. The water electrolyzer which is conducted with HEA/JMPA as both cathode and anode in 1 M KOH (HEA/JMPA (+,-)) exhibits excellent overall water splitting activity. The voltage of HEA/JMPA (+,-) to reach 100 mA cm-2 is only 1.75 V and the current density is as high as 305 mA cm-2 at 1.9 V.

Fe3N@Co4N@CoFe alloy nanoparticles were prepared by using an in situ coupling method. The obtained catalyst showed a satisfactory OER performance in alkaline solution with a low overpotential of 225 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density and a small Tafel slope of 48 mV/dec. Meanwhile, the HER performance was also improved in alkaline solution after cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles of OER due to the formation of CoFe oxyhydroxides, which required an overpotential of 135 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density and a Tafel slope of 109 mV/dec. More importantly, the obtained Fe3N@Co4N@CoFe alloy electrode and Fe3N@Co4N@CoFe alloy-CV electrode (treated through CV cycles of OER) were used as anode and cathode to assemble a two-electrode system for overall water splitting. The constructed system displayed an impressive competency with a voltage of 1.59 V at 10 mA cm(-2) current density.

Nevertheless, high chlorine evolution efficiency is still required for an effective chlorine production process. In this study, high chlorine electrocatalytic active RuO2-TiO2 electrodes were fabricated using several ranges of polystyrene microsphere templates (0.1, 0.46 and 1.1 mu m) resulting in novel three-dimensional ordered macroporous structures. Higher chlorine evolution efficiency was observed in the macroporous RuO2-TiO2 electrodes than that in the nontemplated electrode at the same Ru loadings. In particular, a macroporous electrode fabricated with a specific polystyrene size (0.46 mu m) exhibited the highest chlorine evolution efficiency in this study indicating the existence of an optimal macropore size for RuO2-TiO2 electrodes in the chlorine evolution reaction. This chlorine evolution efficiency could be attributed to the well-developed outer active surface area formed by the optimal pore structure which contributes to the easy mass transfer of chloride ions and removal of produced chlorine gas bubbles. This novel idea strategically provides a new method for preparing inexpensive RuO2-TiO2 electrocatalysts with a high electrochemically active surface area, especially the outer active surface area for chlorine evolution.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1944-3994	1944-3986		WOS:000407719900013

Now, this safety issue is overcome in the aminocarbonylation of alkynes by replacing the external oxidant O-2 by electrochemistry facilitating a mild and safe reaction.Palladium-catalysed oxidative carbonylation using oxygen as the oxidant is an economical approach; however, the gas mixture of CO and air has an explosive limit of 12.5-74.0% that could hamper extensive application of this process. Herein we report an electrochemical aminocarbonylation of alkynes under atmospheric pressure in an undivided cell without an external oxidant. The transformation has a broad substrate scope (83 examples) that involves primary amines and ammonium salts. Furthermore, mechanistic studies through cyclic voltammetry, in situ infrared and quick-scanning X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy reveal the reasons for this protocol proceeding smoothly under electrochemical conditions.									44	7	0	0	10	0	44			2520-1158			WOS:000523950500001

The calculations indicate that a demonstrator module can now be constructed that is capable of producing O(2)(1)triangle fractional yields in excess of 35% at 50 torr total pressure, while developing 0.05 to 0.1 moles/second O(2)(1)triangle. A more detailed and accurate understanding of process dynamics has emerged, which has been incorporated into the excitation methodology and generator design. Fabrication of this generator should begin shortly. The next step will be to characterize its fractional O(2)(1)triangle yield using spectroscopic techniques. The generator should be capable of driving a supersonic-flow, transverse oxygen iodine laser aimed toward developing 3-6 KW continuous power in blow-down configuration. Tentative design details and characteristics for the integrated generator-laser system are be presented.

J	Pei, Yuhou; Wang, Chunling; Zhong, Heng; Jin, Fangming								Concurrent Electrolysis under Pressured CO2 for Simultaneous CO2 Reduction and Hazardous SO2 Removal								ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING											10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c03407		SEP 2022			2022	Although elevating CO2 pressure facilitates electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), the paired anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can hardly gain the benefit due to its sluggish kinetics at near-neutral pH. Here, we replaced the OER with sulfite electrooxidation reaction (SOR) at near-neutral pH to realize a CO2/sulfite concurrent system, which can serve as a promising strategy for the dual treatments of CO2 and SO2 in flue gas. The anodic SOR reaction catalyzed by the non-noble nanoporous NiO supported on the nickel foam electrode exhibited a voltage saving by ???1 V in contrast to the OER at 50 mA cm???2. On the other hand, BiOI-catalyzed cathodic CO2-to-formate conversion at 20 bar CO2 offered a remarkably broadened potential range and enhanced current density in contrast to the results tested at 1 bar CO2. An overall electricity-to-formate energy conversion efficiency of 65% for the CO2RR + SOR system was successfully obtained at a cell voltage of 1.8 V, which is 20% higher than that of the CO2RR + OER system. Based on these, an efficient and energy-saving full electrolysis system for concurrent electrolysis of CO2RR and SOR at 20 bar CO2 has been successfully constructed.<comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000859751500001

In this work, Ag-ITQ2 zeolites have been prepared by different methods: incipient wetness impregnation, ion exchange and preformed Ag-nanoclusters supported on the zeolite. The samples have been pretreated with oxygen or hydrogen previously to the catalytic test in the CO oxidation reaction. The results allow to correlate the nature of the Ag-species with its catalytic activity in this reaction as metallic silver is active for the CO oxidation but cationic silver does not show significant activity. It is shown that Ag-0 is formed on the catalysts prepared by impregnation even without a reduction treatment. On the contrary, Ag-nanoclusters form stable partially charged silver species that only can be reduced to Ag-0 nanoparticles under severe thermal conditions. Silver species formed in the catalysts prepared by ion exchange also present a partial positive charge. We concluded that this reaction is a useful test for monitoring the nature and evolution of silver species in the zeolite and to determine the stability of the silver nanoclusters.					8th Czech-Italian-Spanish Symposium on Zeolites and Catalysis8th Czech-Italian-Spanish Symposium on Zeolites and Catalysis	JUN, 2019JUN, 2019		Amantea, ITALYAmantea, ITALY	8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000522039100004

Part I. C-H activation by sigma-bond metathesis								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY				17	11			990	1006		10.1002/poc.842				NOV 2004	2004	Mononuclear Cr(III)-silica models have been studied by quantum chemical methods with respect to catalytic activity toward dehydrogenation of ethane. Both cluster and slab models have been developed and used to explore the conceptual model of mononuclear Cr(III) with three covalent ligands that coordinate through oxygen. The study focuses on a reaction mechanism consisting of three main reaction steps: (1) C-H activation of ethane according to Q-bond metathesis and accompanied by the formation of O-H and Cr-C bonds, (2) beta-H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene and (3) regeneration of the chromium site under evolution of H-2. An alternative mechanism is also explored, in which C-H activation takes place at a reactive hydridochromium complex. Stationary points pertaining to these reactions have been optimized, and free energy calculations are used to identify the rate-determining steps. The influence of the local structure of the chromium surface sites is explored by means of a number of idealized surface models and electronic energy profiles for the reactions.

J	Joo, Taigyu; Hu, Leiming; Hong, Bo Ki; Oh, Jong-Gil; Litster, Shawn				Hu, Leiming/AAS-7934-2021				On the origin of deactivation of reversal-tolerant fuel cell anodes under voltage reversal conditions								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				472						228439	10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228439				OCT 1 2020	2020	Over the past decade, extensive efforts have been carried out to increase the durability of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) under voltage reversal conditions primarily caused by hydrogen starvation. One common strategy is the use of reversal tolerant anodes (RTAs) that incorporate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts (e.g., IrO2) to promote harmless water electrolysis over carbon oxidation and delay severe carbon support degradation. The present study investigates the RTA catalyst deactivation mechanism under hydrogen starvation conditions and the relative humidity (RH) dependence of the OER and carbon oxidation reactions to understand the relatively quick failure of an RTA at a high RH. The comparison of the OER durability of membrane electrode assemblies with and without carbon under hydrogen starvation conditions shows that the presence of carbon deactivates the OER catalyst through carbon oxidation species poisoning. The catalytic activity of IrO(2 )measured by the current density response shows a linear dependence on RH, while the rate of carbon oxidation reactions increases exponentially with RH, suggesting that the decreased durability of RTAs is related to the exponentially increased rate of carbon oxidation reactions. These findings can be used to design more robust electrodes for automotive fuel cells under hydrogen starvation conditions.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000558890300010

Processes such as cation exchange, chemical weathering, deuteric alteration, leaching, pseudomorphism, metasomatism, diagenesis and metamorphism are all linked by common features in which one mineral or mineral assemblage is replaced by a more stable assemblage. The aim of this paper is to review some of these aspects of mineral replacement and to demonstrate the textural features they have in common, in order to emphasize the similarities in the underlying microscopic mechanisms. The role of volume change and evolution of porosity is explored both from natural microtextures and new experiments on model replacement reactions in simple salts. It is shown that the development of porosity is often a consequence of mineral replacement processes, irrespective of the relative molar volumes of parent and product solid phases. The key issue is the relative solubility of the phases in the fluid phase. Concepts such as coupled dissolution-precipitation, and autocatalysis are important in understanding these processes. Some consequences of porosity generation for metamorphic fluid flow as well as subsequent crystal growth are also discussed.					18th General Meeting of the International-Mineralogical-Association18th General Meeting of the International-Mineralogical-Association	SEP, 2002SEP, 2002	Int Mineral AssocInt Mineral Assoc	EDINBURGH, SCOTLANDEDINBURGH, SCOTLAND	821	24	5	0	38	0	837			0026-461X	1471-8022		WOS:000181759900005

Using the former mode, the heterogeneous electron transfer (ET) kinetics for H-2 oxidation was studied, while the latter mode allowed mapping of the distribution of local [H-2] at the nanoparticulate/aqueous interface, followed by monitoring the transients at the tip. These preliminary studies demonstrate that SECM is useful in evaluating the activity of nanophase electrocatalysts. Particularly, if one employs nanometer-sized tips or hydrodynamic microjet electrodes where the mass transfer rate is significantly high, it should be possible to investigate the ET kinetics more accurately.									12	1	0	0	1	0	13			0910-6340	1348-2246		WOS:000223925000008	15478337

In this work, a three-dimensional (3D) defect-rich bifunctional electrocatalyst (CoFe/N CNFs) comprising irregular hollow CoFe nanospheres in N-doped carbon nanofibers is presented, which is fabricated from CoFe ZIFs-derived (ZIF: zeolitic-imidazolate framework) polymer nanofibers precursor. The CoFe ZIFs with tunable particle size and composition are constructed using a confined synthesis strategy. Moreover, the Kirkendall diffusion process is available for forming the irregular hollow CoFe nanospheres, and the decomposition of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) results in forming the defective carbon nanofibers, which provide more efficient active sites and enhance the electrocatalytic properties toward both OER and ORR. The optimized CoFe/N CNFs exhibit superior bifunctional activities, outperforming that of the benchmark Pt/C + RuO2 catalyst. As a result, the CoFe/N CNFs as an air-cathode endow the rechargeable Zn-air battery with an excellent power density of 149 mW.cm(-2), energy density of 875 Wh.kg(-1), and cycling stability. This work provides a new strategy to develop bifunctional electrocatalysts with desired nanostructure and regulated performance toward energy applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000826835100001

This study reports the development of an in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique for electrochemical systems, including the design, fabrication, and successful performance of a sealed AFM cell operating in a controlled atmosphere. Documentation of reversible physical processes on the cathode surface was performed on the example of a highly reactive lithium-oxygen battery system at different water concentrations in the solvent. The AFM data collected during the discharge-recharge cycles correlated well with the simultaneously recorded electrochemical data. We were able to capture the formation of discharge products from correlated electrical and topographical channels and measure the impact of the presence of water. The cell design permitted acquisition of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, contributing information about electrical double layers under the system's controlled environment. This characterization method can be applied to a wide range of reactive surfaces undergoing transformations under carefully controlled conditions.									6	2	0	0	0	0	8			2190-4286			WOS:000467203400001	31165020	
J	Melnick, RE; Palmore, GTR								Impedance spectroscopy of the electro-oxidation of methanol on polished polycrystalline platinum								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				105	5			1012	1025		10.1021/jp0030847				FEB 8 2001	2001	The electro-oxidation of methanol on smooth polycrystalline platinum in the presence of a sulfuric acid solution was investigated using impedance spectroscopy. The impedance response of both the electro-oxidation of methanol and the adsorption of hydrogen were measured directly at potentials where these processes are active. The time dependence of the impedance of the adsorption of hydrogen in the presence of methanol was used as an in situ probe of the formation of methanol adsorption products. Monitoring the formation of methanol adsorption products by this method yielded kinetic information for the electro-oxidation of methanol at low potentials that previously has been difficult to obtain. The fitting of the impedance of the electrooxidation of methanol to an appropriate model provided the values of impedance parameters whose potential dependence reveal information about the kinetics of the reaction, changes in the coverage of the adsorbed intermediate, and the effect of coadsorbed oxygen containing species. The results indicate the presence of five different potential regions between 40 and 800 mV vs RHE where a change in the reaction mechanism occurs. The mechanistic changes are interpreted as bring due to the presence of oxygen containing species with different reactivities at different potentials.									76	3	0	0	0	0	76			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000166846100014

In this work, we examine the role of spectator cations in modifying the rate of heterogeneous ET for an [Fe(CN)(6)](3-)/[Fe(CN)(6)](4-) redox pair. We combine the results of electrochemical measurement, in situ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS), classical molecular dynamics simulation, and theoretical modeling to demonstrate how changing the identity of the spectator cation species over a series that includes Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ to Cs+ influences the solvation properties and ET kinetics of the redox species. By analyzing the results in the context of the Marcus-Hush-Chidsey (MHC) theory, we find that the solvent reorganization energy increases systematically as the cationic radius decreases. The trend can be attributed to cation-dependent coordination environments of the redox species, whereby more cations of less charge density such as Cs+ than Li+ are present in the redox solvation shell in bulk and at the electrified interface, promoting weaker hydrogen bonds and lowering the effective interfacial static dielectric constant. We discuss the implications of these findings for enabling the tunability of reaction thermodynamics and rates in electrochemical processes.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000626769100010

The first electrochemical degradation reaction is identified between 3.3 V and 3.5 V, and the chemical degradation is limited above 3.5 V, suggesting that a chemically stable SEI layer has been formed.

Defect annealing and formation reactions have been observed over the temperature range 80-350 K. In p-type silicon, new species-dependent levels are observed immediately after implantation, but these levels anneal out at or below room temperature. The well-known divacancy and interstitial defects, usually reported after room temperature implantation, are revealed in the DLTS spectra only upon annealing at 160-200 K. In n-type silicon, vacancy-oxygen pairs are observed immediately after implantation. However, vacancy-related defects continue to form over a broad temperature range in samples implanted with Si or Ge. These observations are consistent with a model whereby vacancies and interstitials are released from defect clusters at temperatures >200 K to form divacancies and other defect pairs which are stable at room temperature.

Although bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) as the photocatalyst has been developed for enhancing the kinetics of the water oxidation reaction, it still suffers from challenges of fast recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and poor photocatalytic activity. Herein, six M-II-Co-III Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) cocatalysts are synthesized and deposited on the surface of BiVO4 for boosting the surface catalytic efficiency and enhancing photogenerated carries separation efficiency of BiVO4. Six M-II-Co-III PBAs@BiVO4 photocatalysts all demonstrate increased photocatalytic water oxidation performance compared to that of BiVO4 alone. Among them, the Co-Co PBA@BiVO4 photocatalyst is employed as a representative research object and is thoroughly characterized by electrochemistry, electronic microscope as well as multiple spectroscopic analyses. Notably, BiVO4 coupling with Co-Co PBA cocatalyst could capture more photons than that of pure BiVO4, facilitating the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers between BiVO4 and Co-Co PBA as well as the surface catalytic efficiency of BiVO4. Overall, this work would promote the synthesis strategy development for exploring new types of composite photocatalysts for water oxidation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000838157600001	35789002

Herein, a unique pyrolysis strategy is demonstrated for the synthesis of RhPx nanoparticles (NPs) in N, P co-doped thin carbon nanoshells (RhPx@NPC nanoshells) that display high electrocatalytic activity and stability over a wide pH range. This strategy involves simultaneous phosphorization and pyrolysis processes that can produce highly-dispersed RhPx NPs within N, P co-doped carbon nanoshells and at the same time induce thinning of carbon nanoshells from inside out. The resulting RhPx@NPC nanoshells not only possess Pt-like activity for HER with low overpotentials to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) (22 mV in 0.5 m H2SO4, 69 mV in 1.0 m KOH, and 38 mV in 1.0 m phosphate buffered saline (PBS)) but also provide long-term durability in a wide pH range. The remarkable HER performance of RhPx@NPC nanoshells is ascribed to the high surface area, abundant mesoporosity, strong catalyst-support interaction, ultrathin carbon encapsulation, and N, P co-doping. This work provides an effective strategy for designing heterostructured electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and stability desired for reactions that may occur under harsh conditions.									74	5	0	0	0	0	75			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000482137900015

Splitting of water by electrolysis is catching up to be a productive method to produce pure hydrogen with low cost and high efficiency using highly active non-noble metal electrocatalysts. MoS2 has been widely studied for energy conservation devices for its 2D layered structure, excellent electronic conductivity, and high specific surface area. Incorporating transition metals (Co or Ni) will alter the intrinsic characteristic of MoS2 by enhancing its electrocatalytic property for hydrogen evolution reaction. Hence MoS2, CoMoS2, Co0.5MoS2 and a composite of Co0.5MoS2 with nitrogen sulfur doped graphene oxide were prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. Better performance was observed for the composite of Co0.5MoS2 with N, S-rGO compared to other prepared catalysts with a low onset potential of 85 mV, overpotential (at 10 mA/cm(2)) of 178 mV and Tafel slope of 63.8 mV/dec. Further, the stability of the catalyst evaluated by chronoamperometric analysis demonstrated steady electrochemical performance for 12 hours.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000523285400001

Different from many single-atom catalysts that show high performance in obtaining C-1 products, Cu supported on carbon nitride (Cu-C3N4) has shown a unique capability to generate C-2 products by providing asymmetrical active sites. Herein, we study 17 possible pathways and reaction mechanisms of CO2 reduction toward ethylene - a featured C-2 product, on Cu-C3N4. The possible reaction intermediates along with different reaction pathways on three active sites of Cu-C3N4 (Cu, C, and N) were obtained by density functional theory (DFT) computations. The most probable reaction pathway toward C2H4 production is 1.08 eV at open circuit conditions, which is benefited by the synergistic effect of both Cu and C active sites. Comparing with other pathways utilizing Cu/N and C/N active sites, the carbon atom provides a perfect settling centre for the first CO2 after reduction by Cu and leaves Cu vacant for the second CO2 reduction. Our study provides reaction mechanism insights for C-2 production on Cu-C3N4 and sheds light on designing electrocatalysts with dual active sites.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000599883200007

The hydrogen generated, due to the parallel reaction of borohydride hydrolysis, was measured during the electrolysis obtaining less than 0.1 cm(3) min(-1) H-2 between -1 and 0 V vs. Hg/HgO (-0.86 and 0.14 V vs. SHE), while the current densities for the oxidation of borohydride were up to 367 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 mol dm(-3) NaBH4 + 3 mol dm(-3) NaOH. The low rate of hydrogen generation suggests that Pd-Ir could be a promising catalyst for borohydride oxidation. However, higher rates of hydrogen were generated at the open circuit potential, which is inconvenient in the direct borohydride fuel cell. Cyclic voltammetry allowed analysis of the oxidation peaks due to the borohydride oxidation. To obtain a further understanding of the borohydride oxidation mechanism at Pd-Ir electrodes, density functional theory (DFT) was used to examine the reaction mechanism at Pd-2-Ir-1(111) and Pd-2-Ir-2(111) surfaces. The competition between borohydride oxidation and hydrogen evolution on the Pd-Jr alloys is compared with that on pure Pd(111), suggesting that the presence of Ir favors borohydride oxidation rather than hydrogen evolution.

After deposition onto glassy carbon rotating disk electrodes, the electrocatalytic performance of the Co3O4 NPs in water oxidation has been tested in 1M NaOH. The activity has been benchmarked with that of state-of-the-art Co3O4 NPs through electrochemically-active surface area (ECSA) and specific current density measurements. Furthermore, the covalent grafting of photosensitive polypyridyl-based RuII complexes onto the surface of Co3O4 NPs afforded hybrid nanostructured materials able to photo-oxidize water into O-2, while steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic measurements gave some further insight into kinetics and pertinent reaction steps following excitation. These first-row transition metal oxide hybrid nanocatalysts display better catalytic performance than simple mixtures of non-grafted photosensitizers and Co3O4 NPs, thus evidencing the advantage of the direct coupling between the two entities for the photo-induced water oxidation reaction.

Such coatings were obtained by photoinduced crosslinking of a PEG-diacrylate monomer associated with the eosin Y dye which was used as both a radical photoinitiator and an antibacterial agent. A dual curing process was followed by combining compatible and solvent-free polymerization mechanisms, i.e. Aza-Michael reaction and free-radical polymerization in the presence of amines. The kinetics evolution of the photopolymerization process was followed using in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, allowing for the elucidation of the underlying mechanistic pathways. The influence of eosin Y and amines on the thermal and mechanical properties of the films was evidenced and discussed in terms of crosslinking chemistry. The antibacterial properties of the coatings against two different strains (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) were evaluated on short and long terms, revealing that eosin confers both photodynamic inactivation and antimicrobial properties to the films. These coatings are therefore particularly promising for disposable medical devices.									13	0	0	0	3	0	14			2050-750X	2050-7518		WOS:000411442600012	32264232

HEM electrocatalysts are usually prepared through hydrothermal reactions or calcination, which could generate undesired heterogeneous structures that hinder the exploration of the structure-property relationship of these HEM electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a sol-gel method to synthesize homogeneous HEM electrocatalysts for electro-oxidation of methanol and urea (methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR)), through an acid-catalyzed gelation at room temperature. With Ni as the primary component for MOR and UOR, Co can reduce the overpotentials, while Fe can increase the catalytic activities and durability. Borate and phosphate can tune the charge distribution in active sites and speed up the reaction kinetics through fast proton transfer. Thus, the optimal Ni2Fe0.5Co0.5-BP HEM catalyst demonstrates superior catalytic activity together with good durability and great resistance to CO poisoning. In addition, a direct methanol fuel cell with Ni2Fe0.5Co0.5-BP electrode can not only provide power, but also produce formic acid with high yield and high Faraday efficiency. This work presents a simple strategy to prepare high-performance HEM electrocatalysts for fuel cells and production of value-added chemicals.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000770226500003

However, pristine 2D MOs & MCs generally show the relatively poor catalytic performances due to the low electrical conductivity, few active sites and fast charge recombination. Therefore, considerable efforts have been devoted to engineering 2D MOs & MCs by rational structural design and chemical modification to further improve the catalytic activities. Herein, we comprehensively review the recent advances for engineering technologies of 2D MOs & MCs, which are mainly focused on the intercalation, doping, defects creation, facet design and compositing with functional materials. Meanwhile, the relationship between morphological, physicochemical, electronic, and optical properties of 2D MOs & MCs and their electro- and photocatalytic performances is also systematically discussed. Finally, we further give the prospect and challenge of the field and possible future research directions, aiming to inspire more research for achieving high-performance 2D MOs & MCs catalysts in energy storage and conversion fields.

In this work, a novel hierarchical flower-like Co3O4 was synthesized by the imidazolateinduced hydrothermal and subsequent thermolysis method. The effect of reaction parameters as well as the phase evolution of the flower-like structure was investigated in detail. For comparison, a rod-like Co3O4 was also prepared with urea under similar conditions. The morphology-dependent effect of Co3O4 towards toluene oxidation was studied. Moreover, the physicochemical properties of Co3O4 were analyzed by various characterization techniques. The flower-like Co3O4 catalyst presented a higher catalytic activity for toluene oxidation than the rod-like Co3O4, which was associated with hierarchical flower-like morphology, reactive exposed planes, abundant adsorbed oxygen species at surface and better low-temperature reducibility.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2468-8231			WOS:000626272300003

The three-dimensional Euler equations with a simple chemical reaction model are used as the governing equations for the detonation problem. The spatial derivatives are evaluated using the WENO scheme, and the temporal derivative is calculated using the TVD Runge-Kutta method. It is verified that the detonation front is composed of incident shocks and Mach stems, joined at the lines of triple points by transverse waves. And the clear cellular structure is displayed by using a three-dimensional numerical visualization. The process of generating unburned gas pockets is shown by the spatial isosurface profiles of the reaction progress parameter in the exothermic period, and it is explained that the triple lines play a role of "shutter". Furthermore, the rectangles, enclosed by the triple lines, vary with the movement of the triple lines. Consequently, the evolution between the diagonal detonation and the rectangular detonation is realized.

Enhanced activity is observed with Co(PHOPD)2 used as heterogeneous catalyst and with cobalt:HPHOPD (1:1) complex heterogenized by adsorption on alumina, while in case of solutions of cobalt(II) chloride and cobalt: HPHOPD (1:1), used as homogeneous catalysts, the activity is comparatively low and negligible respectively. The reaction rate, in general, is found to increase with increase in temperature and quantity of the catalyst. Various thermodynamic parameters have been calculated. The adduct formation with a heterocyclic base like pyridine, 3-methyl pyridine, chloro pyridine or quinoline is found to inhibit the catalytic activity of Co(PHOPD)2. The probable reaction mechanisms have been suggested for Co(PHOPD)2 and alumina-Co(II)-HPHOPD as catalysts.									40	0	0	0	3	0	40			0304-5102			WOS:A1994PB31200002

Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)											10.1039/d2dt02908a				2022-Oct-28	2022	An effective pathway to cope with the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is to accelerate the electron transfer kinetics. Transition metal with high valence states doping can accelerate the reaction kinetics to afford high inherent activity. Herein, a novel trimetallic NiFeCr nanoalloy as an OER electrocatalyst is synthesized by replacing partial Fe in the Ni3Fe alloy with Cr. In the OER process, Cr leached from the surface layer of the NiFeCr alloy to form a core-shell NiFeCr@NiFeOOH structure. The electrons from the OER intermediates were significantly accelerated by the high-valence Cr6+ as an electron acceptor at the core-shell interface. As a result, NiFeCr@NiFeOOH exhibited excellent OER performances with a low overpotential of 209 mV at 25 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH on conductive carbon paper, outperforming the Ni3Fe alloy without Cr doping. Our work provides a new strategy to design and synthesize the NiFe-based alloy with high OER activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1477-9234		MEDLINE:36305271	36305271

Yet, no general concepts for the rational catalyst design to improve the oxidation efficiency have been discussed. Herein, we studied the hypophosphite oxidation as an example, showing that the hydrogen oxidation reaction and the X-species oxidation reaction need to be considered jointly. By means of density functional theory calculations, the activity-volcano plots have been constructed and a Pd-B catalyst, with B doping in the subsurface of Pd, has been designed to optimize the Pd-H and Pd-P bond strengths on Pd surfaces to improve the oxidation efficiency. Finally, a palladium catalyst with a full-boron-doped subsurface has been synthesized to confirm our theoretical predictions. We show that the as-synthesized Pd-B/C catalyst raises the faradaic efficiency from 28% (Pd/C) to 62% in 3 h discharge, which reaches 85% in discharge to 0 V.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000562945600006

Herein, we report on the efficacy of a laboratory-scale wastewater electrolysis cell (WEC) using real human waste for the first time with semiconductor electrode utilizing a mixed particle coating of bismuth oxide doped titanium dioxide (BiOx/TiO2). A comprehensive environmental analysis has been coupled together with a robust kinetic model under the chemical reaction limited regime to investigate the role of various redox reactions mediated by chloride present in human waste. The oxidative elimination of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonium ion can be modelled using empirical, pseudo-first-order rate constants and current efficiencies (CE). In combination with an anaerobic pre-treatment step, human waste containing high-levels of COD, protein, and color are eliminated within 6 hours of batch treatment in the WEC. The reactor effluent has a residual inorganic total nitrogen (TN) concentration of similar to 40 mM.

Considering the Co2+, Cu2+ and Ni2+ non-noble metal ions supported by C2N, we use density functional theory to demonstrate dehydrogenation energy barriers as low as those for pure Pt and Pd catalysts. The high catalytic performance is ascribed to the reaction occurring through a dual-active center composed of TMx+ and a nearby N atom of C2N. Specifically, C2N-Co2+ in the low spin state (S = 1/2) greatly promotes HCOOH dehydrogenation by decreasing the barrier of the rate-determining step to only 0.30 eV, mainly due to the strong ability of TMx+ to extract charges from HCOOH and C2N. The obtained mechanistic insights help the rational design of single-atom based transition metal ion catalysts supported by 2D materials.									35	1	0	0	1	0	35			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000435829000003

The factors that could affect catalytic activity of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol were investigated. The interaction between Cu and ZrO2 is crucial for determining the catalytic activity. The catalyst possessing the strongest interaction between Cu and ZrO2, exhibited the optimum catalytic activity. The evolution of carbonaceous species and pyridine adsorption over CZ catalysts were investigated using in situ DRIFT spectroscopy. It is found that the hydrogenation of formate species is a rate-limiting step and H spillover plays an important role. The hydrogenation of formate species and H spillover are strongly dependent on the interaction. These results provide a new way of understanding the activity dependence and reaction mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol over CZ catalysts.									61	5	0	0	5	0	64			2046-2069			WOS:000393758700074

Herein, we report the facile preparation of a bifunctional electrocatalyst consisting of FeCo alloy nanoparticles embedded in ultralong N-doped carbon nanotube (denoted FeCo/LNCNT) by capitalizing on the coordination interaction between triphenylimidazole-containing crosslinked polymer and metal salts followed by the two-step pyrolysis under the presence of melamine. The FeCo alloy nanoparticles play the crucial role in the formation of ultralong carbon nanotube with increasing pyrolysis time under the assistance of melamine. The resulting FeCo/LNCNT manifests remarkable ORR and OER activity together with outstanding durability. The small potential gap (0.756 V) of FeCo/LNCNT demonstrates a promising application as ORR/OER bifunctional elctrocatalyst. The assembled zinc-air battery using FeCo/LNCNT as the air anode exhibits higher open-circuit voltage (1.52 V), specific capacity (779 mAh g(Zn)(- 1)) and power density (144 mW cm(-2)) than the Pt/Ir counterpart. Notably, the zinc-air battery assembled with FeCo/LNCNT can remain stable for more than 600 cycles without significant voltage drop and efficiency loss, representing an excellent cycling stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1387-1811	1873-3093		WOS:000791279300002

These effects are classified into thermal effects, which arise from the temperature rise caused by microwaves, and non-thermal effects, which are attributed to interactions between substances and the oscillating electromagnetic fields of microwaves. However, there have been no direct or intrinsic demonstrations of the non-thermal effects based on physical insights. Here we demonstrate the microwave enhancement of oxidation current of water to generate dioxygen with using an alpha-Fe2O3 electrode induced by pulsed microwave irradiation under constantly applied potential. The rectangular waves of current density under pulsed microwave irradiation were observed, in other words the oxidation current of water was increased instantaneously at the moment of the introduction of microwaves, and stayed stably at the plateau under continuous microwave irradiation. The microwave enhancement was observed only for the alpha-Fe2O3 electrode with the specific surface electronic structure evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This discovery provides a firm evidence of the microwave special non-thermal effect on the electron transfer reactions caused by interaction of oscillating microwaves and irradiated samples.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2045-2322			WOS:000385313600001	27739529

It has been found that, even in the absence of oxygen, complete oxidation of carbohydrates toward CO2 can be achieved, which is accompanied by evolution of hydrogen in the gas phase. The overall reaction may be described as aqueous reforming of saccharides and may proceed at ambient conditions. Results are explained by considering that carbohydrates act as sacrificial electron donors by consuming photogenerated holes (and other oxidants) thereby suppressing the rates of electron-hole recombination and oxygen-hydrogen back reaction, which are mainly responsible for the relatively low hydrogen production rates observed in the photocatalytic cleavage of pure water. The rate of hydrogen production increases by almost two orders of magnitude with increase of saccharide concentration in the range 0-0.5 M, and to a lesser extent with increase of solution pH or temperature. It is concluded that the photoreforming process may provide a sustainable route for the production of renewable hydrogen with simultaneous mineralization of waste products of biomass processing industries.									44	1	1	0	6	0	44			1203-8407			WOS:000274182800015

The O(2) yield strongly depended on the duration of irradiation, CeO(2) concentration, concentration of the electron acceptor, and pH of the suspension. The optimum photoproduction for O(2) was obtained under the following operating conditions: Illumination time: > 10 h, CeO(2) concentration: 2-5 g dm(-3). [Ce(4+)]: 4-5 mM, pH < 3, and illumination wavelength < 420 nm. During long-term runs, CeO(2) suspensions showed a satisfactory photostability and activity even after 400 h of illumination. The obtained data show that, with an appropriate design, cerium dioxide is a promising material that can be used as a photoactive component in photocatalytic reactions. The studied system utilizes CeO(2) to accomplish the initial light absorption, charge separation, and O(2) evolution from the interaction of water molecules with holes photogenerated in the CeO(2) valence band, in the presence of Ce(aq)(4+) or Fe(aq)(3+) species as an acceptor of conduction band electrons.

Water structure near the surface of Weyl semimetals as catalysts in photocatalytic proton reduction [arXiv]								arXiv								7 pp.	7 pp.						21 April 2020	2020	In this work, second-generation Car-Parrinello-based QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations of small nanoparticles of NbP, NbAs, TaAs and 1T-TaS2 in water are presented. The first three materials are topological Weyl semimetals, which were recently discovered to be active catalysts in photocatalytic water splitting. The aim of this research was to correlate potential differences in the water structure in the vicinity of the nanoparticle surface with the photocatalytic activity of these materials in light induced proton reduction. The results presented herein allow to explain the catalytic activity of these Weyl semimetals: the most active material, NbP, exhibits a particularly low water coordination near the surface of the nanoparticle, whereas for 1T-TaS2, with the lowest catalytic activity, the water structure at the surface is most ordered. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of several organic and metalorganic photosensitizers in the hydrogen evolution reaction was experimentally investigated with NbP as proton reduction catalyst. Unexpectedly, the charge of the photosensitizer plays a decisive role for the photocatalytic performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						INSPEC:20909475

Structural design of Ni-based nanoalloys is a promising approach to attain excellent electrocatalytic activity as well as stability of these catalysts. This study reports a facile method to prepare NixRhy nanosponges while using NaBH4 as a reducing agent without any surfactant. The ratio of Ni and Rh has been changed to obtain various NixRhy electrocatalysts (Ni, Ni3Rh1, Ni1Rh1, Nt(1)Rh(3), and Rh), respectively. Among the prepared catalysts, Ni1Rh3 electrocatalyst exhibits a high electrocatalytic activity with an overpotential of 48 mV at a current density of -10 mA cm(-2) and a superior stability even after 2000 cycles of CV in 0.5 MH2SO4 electrolyte. In addition, the Ni1Rh3 electrocatalyst shows good electrocatalytic activity in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte compared to commercial Pt/C (20 wt% of Pt) (c-Pt/C). Moreover, the overall water splitting system of the Ni1Rh3 cathode and the commercial RuO2 anode is evaluated, not only exhibiting excellent performance with a potential of 1.52 Vat a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), but also proving very stable operation for over 100,000 s in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte.

Tremendous efforts over the past decade have been focused on exploring alternative catalytic materials, including a variety of earth-abundant transition-metal-based catalysts, to replace traditional noble metals such as Pt, Ir, or Ru. Nevertheless, few efforts have been carried out for (1) scalable catalyst synthesis on current collectors and (2) practical device design toward large-scale H-2 generation. Herein, we designed a modular alkaline water-splitting electrolyzer system with scaled-up metal foam electrodes covered by low-cost NiMo alloy and Ni3Fe oxide for efficient hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution, respectively. An electrolyte circulation system facilitates the mass transport and thus can further boost the H-2 generation particularly under large currents. As a result, the overall water-splitting performance of one-unit cell with a dimension of 10 x 10 cm(2) under room temperature presents an early onset voltage of 1.54 V and delivered practical currents of 20 and 55 A (9.1 and 25.0 L/h H-2 generation) under 2.2 and 2.9 V without iR compensations, respectively. This demonstration could stimulate new focuses in water splitting toward more practical applications.									24	2	0	0	1	0	24			1944-8244			WOS:000457816900032	30604959

Salt stress resulted in a significant decrease in photosynthetic oxygen evolution activity and PSII electron transport activity, but a significant increase in PSI electron transport activity. Analyses of the polyphasic fluorescence transients (OJIP) showed that, with an increase in salt concentration, the fluorescence yield at the phases J, I and P declined considerably and the transient almost leveled off at 0.8 M NaCl. Analyses of the JIP test demonstrated that salt stress led to a decrease in the maximal efficiency of PSII photochemistry, the probability of electron transfer beyond Q(A), and the yield of electron transport beyond Q. In addition, salt stress resulted in a decrease in the electron transport per PSII reaction center, but an increase in the absorption per PSII reaction center. However, there was no significant change in the trapping per PSII reaction center. Furthermore, there was a decrease in the concentration of the active PSII reaction centers. Analyses of 77 K chlorophyll fluorescence emission spectra excited either at 436 or 580 nm showed that salt stress inhibited excitation energy transfer from phycobilisomes to PSII but induced an increase in the efficiency of energy transfer from phycobilisomes to PSI. Based on these results, it is suggested that, through a down-regulation of PSII reaction centers and a shift of excitation energy transfer in favor of PSI, the PSII apparatus was protected from excess excitation energy.

The full exposure of active sites in catalysts can enhance catalytic activity dramatically. Here, novel Fe-N-doped graphene is successfully synthesized via a one-step in situ ball milling method. Pristine graphite, ball milling graphene, N-doped graphene and Fe-N-doped graphene are applied in air cathodes, and enhanced performance is observed in microbial fuel cells with graphene-based catalysts. Particularly, Fe-N-doped graphene achieves the highest oxygen reduction reaction activity, with a maximum power density of 1380 +/- 20 mW/m(2) in microbial fuel cells and a current density of 23.8 A/m(2) at -0.16 V in electrochemical tests, which are comparable to commercial Pt and 390% and 640% of those of pristine graphite. An investigation of the material characteristics reveals that the superior performance of Fe-N-doped graphene results from the full exposure of Fe2O3 nanoparticles, pyrrolic N, pyridinic N and excellent Fe-N-G active sites on the graphene matrix. This work not only suggests the strategy of maximally exposing active sites to optimize the potential of catalysts but also provides promising catalysts for the use of microbial fuel cells in sustainable energy generation.									13	3	0	0	4	0	15			2095-2201	2095-221X		WOS:000513599200001

The adsorption and semiconductor characteristics of hierarchical porous Co-NS@CuPD, interlacing by Co(OH)(2) nanosheets on the Cu dendrites surface, are selectively modified to optimize anodic HzOR and cathodic HER performance through doping B and P heteroatoms, respectively. The working potential of HzOR on B-doped Co-NS@CuPD negatively shifts to -146 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), while that of HER on P-doped Co-NS@CuPD positively shifts to -70 mV. Consequently, the hydrazine electrolysis device using B-/P-doped catalysts output a small voltage of 60 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), achieving co-generation of hydrogen and electricity for the first time. This work brings an intrinsic break in hydrogen-rich molecule-assisted water electrolysis for hydrogen production.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000783883700005

Cu2O catalysts were synthesized with a highly uniform nanocube and nano-octahedra morphology under PVP surfactant-assisted reaction conditions. A series of structural, morphological, optical and electrical characterizations are done to optimize the growth of nanostructures with different morphologies. Finally, the nanostructures are exploited as photo- and electrocatalysts. Interestingly, we find dissimilitude behaviour of nano-octahedra and nano-cube samples towards photo and electrocatalytic activities. The nano-octahedra samples are approximate to 57% more photocatalytically active (half-life time(octahedra) approximate to 10.7 minutes) than the nanocube samples, which is one of the highest reported photocatalytic efficiencies reported to date. However, the same nano-octahedra samples show lower electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as compared with the nanocube sample.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000426488900061

In this work, N-C/NiO nanocomposites with different morphologies were synthesized by one-pot hydrothermal method. Interestingly, the tremella-like N-C/NiO nanocomposites turned into looser flower-like structure at the existence of N-C-SiO2 nanosheets supporting in the hydrothermal process. Meanwhile, the silica in the N-C-SiO2 nanosheets was removed by urea in hydrothermal reaction. The introduction of the N-C-SiO2 nanosheets has a vital influence to enhance the electrochemical performance of the N-C/NiO nanocomposites.

The reaction results showed that Mn oxidation in the presence of CO2 creates highly pure MnO (99.4 mol %) and a small portion of another manganese oxide (Mn3O4 (III)) with the evolution of CO. It is striking that the oxidation path of manganese under CO2 environments is totally reverse compared to that under oxygen (O-2) environments, and it produces MnO at much lower temperature (around 700 C) than the temperature (1700 degrees C) from the O-2 oxidation path. The different patterns of Mn oxidation by both CO2 and O-2 can arise from the differences in thermodynamic stability and reactivity of CO2 and O-2. Additionally, mass spectroscopic measurements revealed that CO generation originates from the CO2 reduction. Above 700 degrees C, more CO was produced by the reverse Boudouard reaction occurring between the carbon deposited on the manganese oxide surface and CO2. This Mn-CO2 reaction system provides an opportunity for producing more valuable products such as MnO and CO by utilizing the greenhouse gas.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			2168-0485			WOS:000336942100019

John/0000-0002-7372-3512; 			Oxygen-promoted catalyst sintering influences number density, alignment, and wall number of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes								NANOSCALE				9	16			5222	5233		10.1039/c6nr09802a				APR 28 2017	2017	A lack of synthetic control and reproducibility during vertically aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) synthesis has stifled many promising applications of organic nanomaterials. Oxygen-containing species are particularly precarious in that they have both beneficial and deleterious effects and are notoriously difficult to control. Here, we demonstrated diatomic oxygen's ability, independent of water, to tune oxide-supported catalyst thin film dewetting and influence nanoscale (diameter and wall number) and macro-scale (alignment and density) properties for as-grown vertically aligned CNTs. In particular, single-or few-walled CNT forests were achieved at very low oxygen loading, with single-to-multi-walled CNT diameters ranging from 4.8 +/- 1.3 nm to 6.4 +/- 1.1 nm over 0-800 ppm O-2, and an expected variation in alignment, where both were related to the annealed catalyst morphology. Morphological differences were not the result of subsurface diffusion, but instead occurred via Ostwald ripening under several hundred ppm O-2, and this effect was mitigated by high H-2 concentrations and not due to water vapor (as confirmed in O-2-free water addition experiments), supporting the importance of O-2 specifically. Further characterization of the interface between the Fe catalyst and Al2O3 support revealed that either oxygen-deficit metal oxide or oxygen-adsorption on metals could be functional mechanisms for the observed catalyst nanoparticle evolution. Taken as a whole, our results suggest that the impacts of O-2 and H-2 on the catalyst evolution have been underappreciated and underleveraged in CNT synthesis, and these could present a route toward facile manipulation of CNT forest morphology through control of the reactive gaseous atmosphere alone.									30	0	0	0	1	0	30			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000399809400022	28397885

Simultaneous gas- and particle-phase measurements elucidate the effect of alkane structure on the chemical mechanisms underlying SOA growth. Reaction of branched structures leads to fragmentation and more volatile products, while cyclic structures are subject to faster oxidation and lead to less volatile products. Product identifications reveal that particle-phase reactions involving peroxyhemiacetal formation from several multifunctional hydroperoxide species are key components of initial SOA growth in all four systems. The continued chemical evolution of the particle-phase is structure-dependent, with 2-methylundecane SOA formation exhibiting the least extent of chemical processing and cyclododecane SOA achieving sustained growth with the greatest variety of chemical pathways. The extent of chemical development is not necessarily reflected in the oxygen to carbon (O : C) ratio of the aerosol as cyclododecane achieves the lowest O : C, just above 0.2, by the end of the experiment and hexylcyclohexane the highest, approaching 0.35.									33	3	2	0	12	0	37			1680-7316	1680-7324		WOS:000327101900036

Herein, inspired by the experimentally synthesized (phen(2)N(2))FeCl molecule, a stable 2D organometallic framework, namely (phen(2)N(2))FeCl monolayer, is proposed as a qualified candidate by means of constant-potential first-principles computations. Unlike most 2D organometallic frameworks that feature pyrrolic coordination, the (phen(2)N(2))FeCl monolayer exhibits a pyridinic-type FeN4 ligation environment. The unique structure of the monolayer enables a high single-atom Fe loading in a heterogeneous system, superior to the typical Fe-N-C materials. Constant-potential energy analysis and microkinetic modeling demonstrate that the monolayer holds great potential for facilitating bifunctional ORR/OER in both the acidic and alkaline conditions, showing theoretical activity higher than the Fe-N-C materials, (phen(2)N(2))FeCl molecule, and Pt/IrO2. Moreover, (phen(2)N(2))MCl monolayers (M = Mn, Co, and Ni) are explored, and the (phen(2)N(2))MnCl monolayer is also identified to have excellent bifunctional activity. This work highlights the rational design of local coordination environments for boosting the electrocatalytic performance of 2D organometallic frameworks.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000838618000001

However, applying them in acidic proton-exchange membrane fuel cells remains a significant challenge because of their low efficiency. Herein, we rationally design efficient dual-metal single atom ORR electrocatalysts based on TMZnN6 (TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) moiety in acid by density-functional theory calculations. The results show that NiZnN6 and CuZnN6 show the potential application in ORR, which lies in the favorable end-on O-2 adsorption way. After considering the *OH as the modifying ligand, CoZnN6(OH) and NiZnN6(OH) display excellent ORR performance with the limiting overpotential 0.47 and 0.41 eV, which is lower than on Pt(111) (0.48 V), showing potential alternatives for Pt/C. Importantly, changing transition-metal atoms would lead to distinct catalytic performances, perhaps reaching the top of the volcano curve [In(k(TM)/k(Cu)) vs Delta G*O)], and it will help in obtaining the best ORR electrocatalyst. This 2D monolayer can be extended to other electrocatalysts, that is, it can be used in N-2 or CO2 reduction or H-2 or O-2 evolution.									38	0	0	0	0	0	38			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000614615700001		
J	Su, Yi; Luo, Yonghao; Chen, Yi; Wu, Wenguang; Zhang, Yunliang								Experimental and numerical investigation of tar destruction under partial oxidation environment								FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY				92	8			1513	1524		10.1016/j.fuproc.2011.03.013				AUG 2011	2011	Tar in biomass product gas is a major problem because it reduces the reliability of the equipment and enhances pollutant emission. Partial oxidation is effective for reducing tar inside gasifiers. In order to predict tar reduction with partial oxidation technology, knowledge of the fate of tar during partial oxidation process is paramount.A continuous reactor was developed for tar destruction experiment under partial oxidation environment. Tar components and non-condensable gasses were measured and analyzed. Results show that the defined "primary tar" contents share about 60% of the total tar amounts. Phenolics prevail under initial reaction, but it is easy to form PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) by polymerization reactions under certain ER (actual mass flow rate of oxygen/oxygen required for complete oxidation of biomass feed stock). This process results in an increase of tertiary tar. Hydrogen's evolution curve shows a steep rise with ER, which could be an indicator for the crack of secondary tar. A model was developed for describing partial oxidation of tar. Phenol, toluene, benzene and naphthalene were chosen as model compounds. Fluid flow, chemical mechanism and heat transfer are considered in the model. The calculated total tar amounts are in qualitative agreement with experimental results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Xia, Zhongyuan; Deng, Binglu; Wang, Yongjie; Jiang, Zhongqing; Jiang, Zhong-Jie								Synergistic co-doping induced high catalytic activities of La/Fe doped Co3O4 towards oxygen reduction/evolution reactions for Zn-air batteries								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A											10.1039/d2ta06726a		SEP 2022			2022	La/Fe co-doped Co3O4 nanoparticles supported on aminated carbon nanotubes (LaFe-Co3O4/NCNTs) have been demonstrated to be active bifunctional catalysts for oxygen reduction/revolution reactions (ORR/OER). With optimal La/Fe doping levels, LaFe-Co3O4/NCNTs exhibits an overall ORR/OER bifunctional catalytic activity higher than most catalysts reported recently. The high performance of LaFe-Co3O4/NCNTs mainly originates from the specific La/Fe co-doped structure of the LaFe-Co3O4 NPs, which increases both the ORR and OER catalytic activities of the LaFe-Co3O4 NPs to higher degrees. DFT calculations have shown that the La/Fe co-doping can decrease the overpotentials of both the ORR and the OER and increase the stability of the LaFe-Co3O4 NPs. Additionally, carbon coating can further increase the catalytic activities of LaFe-Co3O4/NCNTs by the decrease of the polarization losses caused by the electrical resistance. When used in zinc-air batteries (ZABs), the carbon coated LaFe-Co3O4/NCNTs (C@LaFe-Co3O4/NCNTs) can exhibit a maximum power density of 122.2 mW cm(-2), which is >20% higher than that of mixed catalysts of Pt/C + RuO2. This, along with the much higher cycling stability of C@LaFe-Co3O4/NCNTs, suggests great potential for its use as a bifunctional catalyst for practical applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000863645600001

The addition of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as the surfactant during the hydrothermal process is beneficial for the high dispersion of CoO NPs on the surface of MC. Among the as-acquired products, the CoO/MC nanocomposite prepared with 1.5 g PVP as the surfactant (CoO/MC-1.5) exhibits much better catalytic activity for the ORR with a more positive onset potential, a highly efficient four-electron transfer pathway and a larger current density than the others. Furthermore, the CoO/MC-1.5 nanocomposite demonstrates outstanding durability based on current-time chronoamperometric tests, which significantly prevails over a commercial Pt/C catalyst. The eminent catalytic activities of the CoO/MC-1.5 nanocomposite should be a result of the synergistic effect of the highly dispersed CoO nanoparticles and the ordered mesostructures with large specific surface area, which are advantageous for increasing the exposure of the active sites and promoting fast transfer of the reactants and products.									12	2	0	0	0	0	12			2046-2069			WOS:000381513100007

However, its catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under alkaline conditions is relatively poor. Herein, to improve the HER catalytic activity of NiFe LDH under alkaline conditions, we design a heterostructure of NiS and NiS2 on NiFe LDH and successfully achieve Mo element doping. The catalyst named NiFe-LDH@Mo-NiS-NiS2/NF possesses a three-dimensional nano-flower-like structure and shows an outstanding catalytic performance for both HER and OER. Specifically, in 1 M KOH solution, it requires the low overpotentials of 261 and 120 mV to achieve the current density of 50 and 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively. Simultaneously, when NiFe-LDH@Mo-NiS2-NiS/NF is used as the bifunctional catalysts, it only needs a low voltage of 1.63 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The outstanding catalytic performance is attributed to its special heterostructure and the synergy between Mo and NiSx, resulting in comparability with most reported non-noble metal-based catalysts. The doping of metal elements and the construction of heterostructures provide new ideas for the structure regulation and performance improvement of bifunctional electrocatalysts.

Sample temperature is measured with a pyrometer while the presence of reaction products is determined with an optical spectrometer. The temporal evolution of major radiative species is measured. The results show that the samples are rather immune to the Ar afterglow. H2 afterglow causes substantial heating of the sample due to heterogeneous surface recombination of H-atoms, while O2 plasma treatment results in etching of the material which is substantial already at room temperature. The specific behaviour of reactive species is explained by taking into account spectrometer calibration curves, excitation energies and radiative species lifetimes.									21	0	0	0	3	0	21			1612-8850	1612-8869		WOS:000309750300012

Here, by means of oxidative etching of surface confinement stacking faults, a comparative study of the influence of defects on the growth and lattice strain of PtAgPb core-shell nanoplates for ORR is conducted. Stacking faults are key to forming the core-shell structure and induce tensile and compressive strains to improve catalytic performance of nanoplates. In particular, the compressive strain arising from the optimal composition of nanoplates enhances the ORR activity. The findings show how compressive strain in core-shell nanoplates shift the electronic band structure of platinum (Pt) and weakens chemisorption of oxygenated species. As a result, the obtained PtAgPb-IV/C nanoplates display superior specific and mass activities (5.06 mA cm(-2) and 2.24 A mg(Pt)(-1)) for ORR that are approximate to 18 and approximate to 13 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C, placing it among the best reported Pt based ORR electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the PtAgPb-IV/C catalyst exhibits substantially improved durability relative to commercial Pt/C catalysts. This work represents a major step toward the deterministic synthesis of Pt-based multimetallic nanocrystals with specific structure and surface strain for efficient ORR performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000832976600001

However, the low electric conductivity and limited catalytic active site exposure caused by the large particle size and severe lamella stacking are the main challenges. Herein, an interconnected, highly active and ultra-thin NiMn-LDHs is deposited on 3D Ni foam and used as integrated porous catalyst substrate (NiMn-LDHs substrate), the NiMn-LDHs substrate is functional as both current collector and catalyst layer, and the NiMn-LDHs substrate exhibits high catalytic activity and robust stability, the substrate successfully plays the function of tunning the electrochemical process of Li-O-2 battery. The Li-O-2 battery uses this kind of substrate exhibits much improved discharge capacity and long cycle performance compared with pristine Ni substrate. The benefit of the porous NiMn-LDHs in improving the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activities is also supported by rotating disc electrode techniques. This work highlights the strategy of fabricating high efficient LDHs catalyst and provides a new direction for achieving highly efficient integrated catalytic cathode for practical use.

Although superior performances (in terms of the voltage efficiency, qv) were obtained from the electrodes containing higher amounts of platinum, a deterioration of these electrodes with cycling was evident (after 150 cycles). At rotation rates between 600 rpm and 1200 rpm, high qv (> 90%) could be obtained as long as the current density j applied was below the mass transport limiting current density, jL. For j ' s above this value, the oxygen evolution reaction occurred with Ce3+ oxidation whereas the Ce4+ reduction was accompanied by oxygen reduction, resulting in lowered qv ' s. Better stability towards cycling and higher qv's were observed at 60 C compared to 25 C, especially for the etched Pt electrodes. The optimum loading for the Pt substrates was 3 g m(-2) while for the case of the heat treated samples 10 g m(-2) of Pt. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the existent challenges to the AEMFCs is the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline solution. The alkaline HOR mechanism is yet in debate, which would be a major barrier to the design of high-performance catalysts. Here, we explore the HOR mechanism on graphene-supported Ru@Pt core-shell nanoparticles. The Pt shell was precisely tailored at atomic monolayer level through controlling Cu underpotential deposition (UPD)-Galvanic displacement (GD) cycle. The relationship between the HOR electrocatalytic activity and the electronic structure of the catalysts has been investigated based on the results from electrochemical rotating disk electrode and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic characterizations. We find that the hydrogenbinding energy (HBE) is not the sole descriptor of HOR activity, the reactive oxygen species on the catalyst surface also promotes the HOR kinetics through the bifunctional mechanism. This research offers the fundamentals for designing high performance HOR catalysts in alkaline solution and contributes to the commercial application of hydrogen fuel cells. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report our design with p-type Ag2O and n-type Zn(O,S) loaded on mesoporous silica to form SiO2/Ag2O/Zn(O,S) with the nano p-n hetero-junction to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The photocatalysts were systematically characterized to identify their properties. Through the optimization of the Zn(O,S)-loaded amount and position of p-Ag2O, the highest hydrogen production rate of 9200 mu mol.g(-1).cat.h(-1) was achieved by SiO2/Ag2O/Zn(O,S)-0.6 catalyst with corresponding apparent quantum yield of 10.3%, which was about 2.7 times higher than pure Zn(O,S). By placing n-Zn(O,S) of diodes outward was proposed for the electron-rich part to enhance the reduction reaction, while placing p-Ag2O inward for the hole-rich part to modulate the electron concentration and establish the built-in electrical nanofield.

Utilization of ferric chelates is beneficial because hydrogen sulfide solubility is higher in these solutions. This paper discusses from a multiphase reactor engineering perspective, the design of a randomly countercurrent packed bed column by setting an exhaustive modeling framework in which are integrated both the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide in reactive ferric chelate solutions of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and the regeneration of ferrous chelates resulting from oxidation of hydrogen sulfide. A one-dimensional model based on the volume-average species balance equations in the gas and liquid phases coupled with the diffusion-reaction equations for the reacting species in the liquid film was developed for the description of the space evolution of the species concentration in this important class of environmental reactions. The discretization of the diffusion-reaction equations in the film and the species balance equations in the gas and liquid phases was carried out by the method of orthogonal collocation and Newton-Raphson method was employed to solve the resulting non-linear system equations.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-5748	1542-6580		WOS:000208592900027

Thus, the synthesis and development of high performance, inexpensive and durable catalysts for ORR is a necessity. Metallic nanostructures decorated heteroatoms-doped carbons have been recognized as excellent catalysts in energy applications. However, nitrogen-doped partially oxidized three-dimensional carbonaceous supports were seldom studied for ORR. Herein, the synthesis of low Fe-Co bimetallic contents deposited on three-dimensional (3D) activated carbon (AC) is reported as an efficient and cost-effective catalyst for ORR in alkaline electrolyte. In the present work, AC was thermally treated by direct heat in air at 430 degrees C to enhance its electrochemical activity through increasing structure deficiency. AC and nitrogen doped AC (N-AC) were used to synthesize Fe-Co/AC and Fe-Co/N-AC. In both Fe-Co/AC and Fe-Co/N-AC, low amounts of non-precious Fe and Co nanoparticles were deposited on carbonaceous substrates. The air oxidation process, for partially oxidation of carbon structure and catalyst post treatment, was used for introducing defects to the catalyst structure. The performance of synthesized samples was evaluated by ORR process in alkaline medium.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2468-8231			WOS:000522122100011		
J	Xia, Hai-feng; Zhang, Bao; Wang, Chun-hui; Cao, Liang; Luo, Bi; Fan, Xin-ming; Zhang, Jia-feng; Ou, Xing								Surface engineered carbon-cloth with broadening voltage window for boosted energy density aqueous supercapacitors								CARBON				162				136	146		10.1016/j.carbon.2020.02.033				JUN 2020	2020	An efficient strategy of surface engineering is developed to extraordinarily boost the energy density of multiscale porous carbon cloth for aqueous symmetric supercapacitors by optimizing the oxygen-containing functional groups. The operating voltage with neutral electrolyte is remarkably broadened from 1.3 to 1.8 V for electrochemical oxidized active carbon cloth (EOACC), enabling its ultrahigh areal capacitance (1548 mF cm(-2)) and extraordinary energy density (239.25 mu Wh cm(-2)). More importantly, engineering such a functionalized electrode with improved operating potential window is critically hinged on the fundamental understanding of the underlying electrochemical mechanism. The outstanding performance can be attributed to the enlarged ions-accessible specific surface area and created electrochemical active C=O quinone-type groups, contributing to the combination of electrical double-layer capacitance and pseudo-capacitance, respectively. More significantly, the broadened potential window is originated from the increase of the onset overpotential for oxygen evolution reaction, induced by the physical barrier of adsorbed Na+ and the kinetic limitations of fast faradic redox reactions. This strategy sheds a light on the understanding of the electrochemical mechanism for broadened potential range, which provides a promising way for designing and engineering carbon-based aqueous supercapacitors with boosted energy density.

Various carbonaceous materials have been used as supports for transition metals or other materials. These support materials have shown their potential for development of green and sustainable approaches to heterogeneous catalysis. In this review, we discuss the utilization of carbon-based materials as supports for heterogeneous catalysts, especially in organic transformations. We have focused our discussions predominantly on four categories of carbonaceous supports, namely graphene (including, graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO)), graphitic carbon nitride (GCN), carbon nanotubes (CNT) and activated carbon (AC) for various organic transformation reactions. Several approaches for the synthesis of these materials along with their application as heterogeneous catalysts for organic transformation reactions have been elaborated in detail. In addition, different aspects of organic synthesis, including hydrogenation, oxidation, reduction, condensation, and multi-component reactions, catalyzed by these materials have been discussed. Furthermore, organic transformations leading to the sustainable synthesis of valuable products from biomass have also been discussed. Finally, after a brief summary, the future perspectives of this very interesting class of materials are provided.									40	1	0	0	2	0	40			2193-5807	2193-5815		WOS:000476439400001

Nano-micro letters				14	1			209	209		10.1007/s40820-022-00955-w				2022 Oct 31	2022	A rational regulation of the solar water splitting reaction pathway by adjusting the surface composition and phase structure of catalysts is a substantial approach to ameliorate the sluggish reaction kinetics and improve the energy conversion efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate a nanocrystalline iron pyrophosphate (Fe4(P2O7)3, FePy)-regulated hybrid overlayer with amorphous iron phosphate (FePO4, FePi) on the surface of metal oxide nanostructure with boosted photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. By manipulating the facile electrochemical surface treatment followed by the phosphating process, nanocrystalline FePy is localized in the FePi amorphous overlayer to form a heterogeneous hybrid structure. The FePy-regulated hybrid overlayer (FePy@FePi) results in significantly enhanced PEC performance with long-term durability. Compared with the homogeneous FePi amorphous overlayer, FePy@FePi can improve the charge transfer efficiency more significantly, from 60% of FePi to 79% of FePy@FePi. Our density-functional theory calculations reveal that the coexistence of FePi and FePy phases on the surface of metal oxide results in much better oxygen evolution reaction kinetics, where the FePi was found to have a typical down-hill reaction for the conversion from OH* to O2, while FePy has a low free energy for the formation of OH*.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2150-5551		MEDLINE:36315297	36315297

In this work, we have determined the contribution of individual reactants behind the maintenance of conducive solvothermal reaction conditions to produce phase-pure NiCo2Se4 and Co3Se4 from elemental selenium. The maintenance of reductive conditions throughout the reaction was found to be crucial for their synthesis, as a decrease in the reductive conditions over time was found to produce nickel/cobalt selenites as the primary product. Further, the reluctance of Ni(II) to oxidize into Ni(III) in comparison to the proneness of Co(II) to Co(III) oxidation was found to have a profound effect on the final product composition, as a deficiency of ions in the III oxidation state under nickel-rich reaction conditions hindered the formation of a monoclinic "Co3Se4-type" phase. Despite its lower intrinsic OER activity, Co3Se4 was found to show geometric performance on a par with NiCo2Se4 by virtue of its higher textural and microstructural properties.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000671099600036	34143621

These cycles take place within the sorption-enhanced steam-methane reforming process for hydrogen production including sorbent regeneration step. Experiments of steam-methane reforming and reverse water-gas shift reactions were carried out to obtain a complete characterisation of the system kinetics. After 80 cycles, methane conversion increased, while carbon dioxide conversion remained fairly constant. After 125 cycles, methane showed no significant changes in conversion compared to the increase exhibited by carbon dioxide. The kinetic model of Xu and Froment fitted the experimental results to provide the activation energies of the main reactions, which presented an evolution with redox cycles in line with the trends observed for conversion. The reactions with methane initially reduced their activation energy, facilitating conversion, while the reactions with carbon dioxide initially kept the activation energy constant, subsequently reducing it.

Recently, extensive attention has been focused on three phase engineering for the construction of gasliquid-solid three phase catalytic interfaces to promote the interfacial mass transfer processes, therefore providing significantly improved catalytic performance favorable for potential large scale applications. This Spotlight highlights our latest progress in three phase photocatalysis and electrocatalysis and discusses the substantial role of three phase interface engineering in improving the overall catalytic performance mainly from three aspects: (1) wettability modification, (2) interface characterization, and (3) tandem and parallel triphase interfaces.

The electrochemical oxidation of methanol is investigated at NiCo2O4 modified electrode in the alkaline medium using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry methods. Electrocatalytic activity of NiCo2O4 is compared with the NiO and Co3O4 modified electrodes. A detailed investigation is made for the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol by varying several reaction parameters such as potential scan rate, methanol concentration, etc. Mechanism of methanol oxidation is proposed based on the cyclic voltammetry study. Double steps chronoamperometry study shows that the methanol electro-oxidation is an irreversible reaction.

ANALUSIS				24	6			217	224						JUL-AUG 1996	1996	The variation of solvation of numerous ionic species (Ag+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Cl-, LET (diethyl-dithiophosphate), Br, etc) in 5.5 M phosphoric acid progressively neutralized by sodium hydroxide (from Na/P = 0.0 to Na/P = 1.1) is characterized by their solvation transfer activity coefficients, f. They are calculated from the normal potentials of redox systems, and indicate an increasing solvation of cations and decreasing solvation of anions with increasing neutralization percentage. The results obtained in neutralized phosphoric media are compared to the corresponding dilute 5.5 M phosphoric acid solutions. The amplitude of variation of solvation for each species depends on its number of charges, on the presence of oxygen atoms in its structure, on its basic properties and on the composition of the solution. The consequences of the variation of solvation on oxidation-reduction reactions and solubility properties are examined. Forecasting of evolution of acid attack and equilibrium constants of liquid-liquid extraction reactions are also analyzed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0365-4877			WOS:A1996VL57800012

GQDs were prepared from fenugreek seed extracts (300 degrees C, 8 h) and wrinkled Si NSs were obtained from pyrolysis of rice husks (700 degrees C, 2 h). The Si-GQD NCs fabricated glassy carbon electrode (GCE) has greater electrocatalytic activity for ORR in comparison to Si NSs and GQDs modified GCEs, showing the synergistic effect provided by Si NSs and GQDs. The GQDs enhance O-2 adsorption and ORR activity, while Si NSs function as a support to increase charge transfer. Additionally, high surface area and the wrinkled structure of Si NSs allow efficient mass transfer, leading to greater ORR activity. The onset potential of the Si-GQD NC electrode is -0.33 V (versus Ag/AgCl) with a current density of 2.61 +/- 0.27 mA cm(-2), showing greater electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the Si-GQD NC electrode exhibits greater tolerance against methanol and carbon monoxide poisoning than the Pt/C electrode. The environmentally-friendly, active, stable and inexpensive Si-GQD NCs hold great potential for DMFCs.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2046-2069		WOS:000389342800088

In particular, metallated porphyrins and phthalocyanines combined with carbon nanotubes have been tested for the oxygen reduction reaction in electrocatalytic systems, and these nanotube/MN4 hybrids have demonstrated promising properties. Here, a series of hybrid materials made of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) coated with strapped porphyrins have been fabricated. Iron porphyrin derivatives were polymerized around the nanotubes via Hay coupling and the resulting materials were fully characterized. Two porphyrins were probed; both were strapped with the same skeleton and they differed only in the presence or absence of overhung carboxylic acids. In the porphyrin, the carboxylic acid group could possibly act as a proton relay between the medium and the catalyst. Although the presence of the carboxylic acid groups (acting as intramolecular proton relays) did not exhibit a significant influence on the catalytic properties, the combination of both components - the MWNTs and porphyrin - led to a better catalytic activity than those of the nanotubes or the porphyrins taken separately. The synergic affect is due to the MWNTs which ensure the availability of electrons to the porphyrin catalysts and allow the ORR to occur via the 4-electron pathway, avoiding the production of hydrogen peroxide.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000456501100050

Photosystem II (PSII) oxidizes water to produce oxygen, electrons and protons under solar light irradiation. This light-driven water oxidation initiates a series of reactions in photosynthesis. Basic photoelectrochemical studies on PSII are directed toward the enzymatic applications of PSII for sustainable production of electricity or solar fuels. To maximize the photoelectrochemical catalytic activity of PSII on electrode substrates, interfacial designs between PSII and electrode substrates are important. Herein, we report bio-inorganic photoanodes of PSII and ferricyanide-intercalated layered double hydroxide (LDH) for visible-light-driven water oxidation. PSII is simply drop-cast onto a ferricyanide-intercalated cobalt-aluminum LDH and then shows a turnover frequency of 0.5 +/- 0.1 s(-1) and a turnover number of 920 +/- 40 for 1 h at pH 6.5 at thorn0.5 V vs. NHE under visible light irradiation. Photoelectrochemical experiments using a PSII inhibitor or a bio-engineered PSII suggest that interfacial electron transfer from the plastoquinone QA site of PSII to ferricyanide may play an important role in improving the photo-electrocatalytic activity and stability of PSII. Our studies will open up new possibilities in fundamental or advanced photoelectrochemical studies of PSII. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this present study, we show that a series of molecular cobalt-salen complexes can serve as catalyst precursors, to form nanostructured and amorphous cobalt-based thin films during electrodeposition, which can catalyze the water oxidation, reaction at low overpotentials. Cyclic voltammetry and bulk electrolysis using the cobalt-based film electrodes demonstrated obvious catalytic currents in 0.1 M KBi solution at pH 9.2. The onset catalytic potentials of the catalyst films are at similar to 0.84 V (vs Ag/AgCl) with a film made by electrodeposition of cobalt-salen complex 2 on FTO and at similar to 0.85 V for complex 4. Oxygen gas bubbles were clearly seen on the FTO electrode when the applied potential was above the onset potential. The Tafel plots using a catalyst film made of complex 4 showed that appreciable catalytic current was Observed starting at eta = 0.26 V for the film (a current density of 0.01 mA/cm(2) required eta = 290 mV), accompanied by a Faradaic efficiency >93% at 1.2 V. The catalyst film was further characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).									56	1	1	0	5	0	57			1932-7447			WOS:000353930700002

Oxygen Reduction Reactions in Ionic Liquids and the Formulation of a General ORR Mechanism for Li-Air Batteries								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				116	39			20755	20764		10.1021/jp306718v				OCT 4 2012	2012	Oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORRs and OERs) have been studied in ionic liquids containing singly charged cations having a range of ionic radii, or charge densities. Specifically, ORR and OER mechanisms were studied using cyclic and rotating disk electrode voltammetry in the neat ionic liquids (ILs), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMITFSI) and 1-methyl-1-butyl-pyrrolidinium bis-(triflouromethanesulfonyl)imide (PYR14TFSI), and in their solutions containing LiTFSI, NaPF6, KPF6, and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF(6)). A strong correlation was found between the ORR products and the ionic charge density, including those of the ionic liquids. The observed trend is explained in terms of the Lewis acidity of the cation present in the electrolyte using an acidity scale created from C-13 NMR chemical shifts and spin-attice relaxation (T-1) times of C-13=O in solutions of these charged ions in propylene carbonate (PC). The ionic liquids lie in a continuum of a cascading Lewis acidity scale with respect to the charge density of alkali. metal, IL, and TBA cations with the result that the ORR products in ionic liquids and in organic electrolytes containing any conducting cations can be predicted on the basis of a general theory based on the hard soft acid base (HSAB) concept.									177	8	0	0	6	0	181			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000309375700013

Herein, a series of transition metal dimer and nitrogen codoped graphene (M2N6-Cra, M = Cr-Cu) acting as electrocatalysts for CO2RR are investigated based on the density functional method. For M2N6-Cra (M = Cr, Mn), the selectivity is poor and CO poisoning is serious. Fe2N6-Cra is the best CO2RR catalyst due to the good selectivity and catalytic activity. The calculated overpotential is very small, i.e., 0.03 V for COOH channel, 0.05 V for HCOO channel. Hydrogen evolution reaction is also refrained on the Fe2N6-Cra surface, which further supports its high catalytic performance. For M2N6-Cra (M = Co, Ni, Cu), the catalytic activity is poor due to large overpotentials. These results indicate that if designed carefully, the transition metal dimer and nitrogen codoped graphene would be good candidate for the high efficient and selective CO2RR catalyst.

Practical applications of this technology are limited by the development of electrocatalysts with low cost, high activity, and long durability. Huge advances have been achieved in electrocatalyst discovery during the past decades, and computational means have played an irreplaceable role. Inspired by this, we introduce and discuss ???how computations accelerate electrocatalyst discovery???in this review, from the aspects of providing insights and guidelines. By using some typical examples, the advances of theoretical investigations aimed at identifying the active sites and understanding the reaction mechanisms and activity origin are first summarized. Then, an overview of the design principles and screening strategies for superior electrocatalysts is highlighted.

However, the poor cycling stability restricts their large scale industrial applications. To solve this problem, we fabricate several NiCo-LDH nanosheets through regulating the ratio of Ni and Co ions. The as-obtained samples are utilized as cathode for supecapacitor. Thereinto, the NiCo3-LDH product possess a specific capacitance of 699 C g(-1) at 1 A g(-1).

With the continuous development of the energy sector, researchers are constantly exploring and developing new high-performance, inexpensive catalysts to meet the demand. Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) as ever-evolving catalytic materials have received more and more attention. Many studies have suggested that transition metal phosphides could be ideal catalysts due to their low cost, abundance, and high efficiency. In many areas, TMPs can be applied as stable and efficient catalytic materials. Therefore, many kinds of TMPs are designed and synthesized by different methods. This article has summarized the recent research progress of TMPs, including their preparation methods and morphologies. Moreover, the application and catalytic performance of TMPs in different catalytic fields are further elaborated, and views on the opportunities and challenges faced by phosphide catalysts are presented.									143	9	0	0	2	0	145			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451813300004

This complex reacts with oxygen to form the square-planar complex (BINAP(O))Rh(CO)Cl in approximately 50% yield, along with free BINAP dioxide (BINAP(O)(2)). The evolution of CO2 gas and the formation of other unidentified products were also detected. In the presence of excess BINAP under CO/O-2 gas mixtures, the reaction is catalytic with a TOF of 0.16 h(-1) at ambient temperature. The kinetics of this transformation were investigated and a mechanism is proposed. To the best of our knowledge, this chemistry represents the first example of a reaction exhibiting oxidation of both phosphorus atoms on the BINAP ligand and concurrent oxidation of one phosphorus atom and the CO ligand in the same complex.

J	Stracke, Jordan J.; Finke, Richard G.								Distinguishing Homogeneous from Heterogeneous Water Oxidation Catalysis when Beginning with Polyoxometalates								ACS CATALYSIS				4	3			909	933		10.1021/cs4011716				MAR 2014	2014	Polyoxometalates (POMs) have been proposed to be excellent homogeneous water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) due to their oxidative stability and activity. However, recent literature indicates that even these relatively robust compounds can be transformed into heterogeneous, metal-oxide WOCs under the oxidizing reaction conditions needed to drive O-2 evolution. This review covers the experimental methodology for distinguishing homogeneous and heterogeneous WOCs; it then addresses the "what is the true catalyst?" problem for POMs used as precatalysts in the oxidation of water to O-2. These results are also compared to the broader WOC literature. The primary findings in this review are the following: (1) Multiple, complementary experiments are needed to determine the true catalyst, including determination of catalyst stability, speciation, and kinetics under operating conditions. (2) Controls with hypothetical heterogeneous metal-oxide catalysts are required to determine their kinetic competence in the reaction and support the conclusion of either a homogeneous or heterogeneous catalyst. (3) Although many studies observe qualitative stability of the starting POM under the reaction conditions, there is a lack of quantitative stability studies; if one does not know where the (pre)catalyst mass lies, then it is very difficult to rule out the possibility of an alternative species as the true catalyst. (4) The stability of POMs is dependent on the polyoxometalate, the metal center, and the reaction conditions. And, (5) as a result of the variable stability of POMs under different reaction conditions, those different conditions can influence the dominant catalyst identity. Overall, knowledge of which POMs (or other starting materials) tend to transform into heterogeneous WOCs, and how they do so, is therefore critical to developing the next generation of higher stability, higher activity, and truly long-lived POM and other water oxidation catalysts.									164	0	0	0	16	0	164			2155-5435			WOS:000332756700022

Two systems were studied. System A consisted of pure naphthalene mixed with oxygen and water: 0.065 M Nap + 1.441 M O-2 + 8.549 M H2O. System B included, in addition to O-2 and H2O, a heavy metal and an ash to simulate their roles in the destruction of Nap: 0.065 M Nap + 1.441M O-2 + 0.008 M Cr(NO3)(3) + 0.065 M Al2Si2O5 center dot(OH)(4) + 8.624 M H2O. It was shown that, in general, the oxidation process can be divided into three stages characterized by H2O2 decomposition to H2O and O-2 (Stage 1), oxidation in saturated/subcritical water up to 360 degrees C and 225 atm (Stage 2), and fast oxidation in the supercritical region (Stage 3). The oxidation process revealed different reaction rates in different systems. Relatively low activation energy of 10-30 kJ/mol was obtained below 360 degrees C and 225 atm in the System A and in the whole temperature range in the System B. High activation energy (139.5 kJ/mol) was obtained for supercritical water oxidation of naphthalene in the System A. The catalytic effect of Cr3+/ash stimulated naphthalene oxidation. Time-resolved yields of major products and intermediates were obtained. The reaction pattern was proposed. It describes the evolution of naphthalene and intermediates as a sequence of reactions comprising transformations of the main compounds and their inter-conversion. This radical-involving reaction mechanism is mainly based on the quantification of the profiles of the intermediates. (C) 2010 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Evolution of SO2, CO2 and CO was observed while the sample was quickly heated in N2 to 820-degrees-C. SO2 emission (<5% of the total S in the sample) was the result of a reaction of pyrite with a high concentration of steam produced from the free moisture and clay-bound water. One-third of the CO, release was from the decomposition of calcite. Pyrolysis of char and reduction of iron oxides by carbon produced the rest of the CO2 and CO. The combustion following the pyrolysis was characterized by a high molar CO/CO2 ratio and a long delay in SO2 emission. Combustion of char consumed initially all available oxygen in the feed gas and therefore delayed the combustion of pyrite/pyrrhotites.					6TH AUSTRALIAN OIL SHALE WORKSHOP6TH AUSTRALIAN OIL SHALE WORKSHOP	DEC 05-06, 1991DEC 05-06, 1991		UNIV QUEENSLAND, QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIAUNIV QUEENSLAND, QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0016-2361			WOS:A1993LD46100023

Hydrogen production on demand by redox-mediated electrocatalysis: A kinetic study								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				407						126721	10.1016/j.cej.2020.126721				MAR 1 2021	2021	Producing hydrogen from water using a redox mediator on solid electrocatalyst particles in a reactor offers several advantages over classical electrolysis in terms of safety, membrane degradation, purity and flexibility. Herein, vanadium-mediated hydrogen evolution on a commercial and low-cost Mo2C electrocatalyst is studied through the development of a reaction kinetics model. Based on a proposed mechanistic reaction scheme, we established a kinetic rate law dependent on the concentration of V2+, the state-of-charge of the vanadium electrolyte from a vanadium redox flow battery and the amount of available catalytic sites on solid Mo2C. Kinetic experiments in transient conditions reveals a first-order dependence on both the concentration of V2+ and the concentration of catalytic active sites and a power law with an exponential factor of 0.57 was measured on the molar ratio V2+/V3+, i.e. on the electrochemical driving force generated on the Mo2C particles. The kinetic rate law was validated by studying the rate of reaction in steady-state conditions using a specially developed rotating ring-disk device (RRD) methodology. The kinetic model was demonstrated to be a useful tool to predict the hydrogen production via the chemical oxidation of V2+ over Mo2C at low pH ( > 1 M H2SO4). For a perspective, the model was implemented in a semi-batch reactor. The simulations highlight the optimal state-of-charge (SOC) to carry out the reaction in an efficient way for a given demand in hydrogen.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000607599400001

In step ii, air is bubbled through a sparger to maintain a relatively high concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water, and the boiling water serves to control the temperature of the carbon during its gasification by the dissolved oxygen. Carbon dioxide is observed to be the only gaseous product of the oxidation chemistry. The oxidation results and the properties of the activated carbons from AOBW are similar to those obtained by controlled atmospheric air oxidation. However, the rate of CO2 formation is observed to increase with time to a plateau for AOBW, whereas the gasification rate decreases with time for atmospheric air oxidation. Multiple cycles, involving AOBW followed by activation, efficiently increase the specific surface area of the carbon to values approaching 1000 m(2)/g. Increases in the specific surface area occur by the removal of carbon during the AOBW step(s) and the activation step(s). Our findings indicate that carbon removal by desorption of chemisorbed oxygen during the activation step creates a specific surface area more efficiently than a prolonged, low-temperature gasification of the carbon during the AOBW step. If we assume a simple kinetic model in which the gasification reaction is first order with respect to dissolved oxygen and zero order in carbon, the activation energy for AOBW is estimated to be 108 kJ/mol between 513 and 533 K, according to measured CO2 evolution rates and dissolved oxygen concentrations. This value is near the range of activation energies observed in gaseous air oxidation at low temperatures.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			0888-5885			WOS:000166528400011

However, their widespread applications are hindered by many technical challenges, such as the low efficiency and poor long-term cyclability, which are mostly affected by the changes at the reactant/electrode/electrolyte interfaces. These interfacial processes involve ion/electron transfer, molecular/ion adsorption/desorption, and complex interface restructuring, which lead to irreversible modifications to the electrodes and the electrolyte. The understanding of these interfacial processes is thus crucial to provide strategies for solving those problems. In this review, we will discuss different interfacial processes at three representative interfaces, namely, solid-gas, solid-liquid, and solid-solid, in various electrochemical energy systems, and how they could influence the performance of electrochemical systems.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000698142300001	34494049	
J	Wen, Xinzhu								Cobalt Nitride Supported on Nickel Foam as Bifunctional Catalyst Electrodes for Urea Electrolysis-Assisted Hydrogen Generation								NANO				15	01			110	119						2020	2020	Replacing the high theoretical potential of anodic water decomposition (oxygen evolution reaction) with the low theoretical potential of urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an urgent need for hydrogen energy storage and conversion. Cobalt nitride nanoflakes, high-performance bifunctional catalysts supported on nickel foam (Co5.47N NF/NF), were synthesized by hydrothermal and calcination method. The morphology and composition of the catalyst were studied by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, HRTEM and elemental analysis. In order to conduct electrochemical performance and stability, a two-electrode electrolyzer composed of Co5.47N NF/NF as both anode and cathode materials is constructed (Co5.47NNF/NF||Co5.47N NF/NF). Only a voltage of 1.687 V is needed to complete 100 mA Â· cm -2. It is much lower than the voltage of Pt/C||IrO2 (1.816 V), because of which it is believed that this work provides a valuable route for the design of inexpensive and efficient urea electrolysis-assisted hydrogen generation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1793-2920			KJD:ART002544119

Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) is used both as the structure-directing template for the SiO2 and TiO2 shell layer during TEOS and TEOT hydrolysis/condensation and as the mesopore-channel template in the shell. The resulting core-shell particles display high properties for the specific surface area and pore volume. In addition, the reaction parameters for the formation of the SiO2 and TiO2 shell during the solgel process are broadly investigated. Consequently, this directed mesoporous core-shell structure can serve as a platform for further surface modifications to facilitate the rapid translation of particles to a wide range of end applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2365-6549			WOS:000392302300018

The first is a kinetic model and is based on first order nonlinear ordinary differential equations describing the rates of photoinitiator, monomer, and live and dead radicals of different chain lengths. In the second model, a stochastic Monte Carlo approach is used to predict the time evolution of the photopolymerization process. In this model the chain affects are incorporated both in the propagation and termination rate constants. The simulations of these models for the predictions of gelation times are compared with the experimental values measured in the absence of oxygen in the reaction volume by using passive microrheology technique. The nonlinear decrease of gelation time with increasing photoinitator concentration and number of acrylate fragments on each monomer is best captured with the second model. Furthermore, the second model is successfully verified with kinetic data generated from FTIR and DSC experiments.

In this Perspective, we review concepts and tools in theoretical and computational chemistry that can help to accelerate the rational design of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. In particular, we focus on the following three topics: (1) identification of key intermediates and transition states in a reaction using the energetic span model, (2) disentanglement of factors influencing the relative stability of the key species using energy decomposition analysis and the activation strain model, and (3) discovery of new catalysts using volcano relationships. To facilitate wider use of these techniques across different areas, we illustrate their potentials and pitfalls when applied to the study of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts.									46	0	0	0	2	0	45			2155-5435			WOS:000434369600095

High Photoconversion Efficiency Obtained from Novel TiO2 Photoanodes								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE				11	8			6848	6861		10.20964/2016.08.22				AUG 2016	2016	High photoconversion efficiency for photoelectrochemical water splitting was obtained using nanocaves TiO2 and highly uniformed TiO2 nanotubes. The photoanodes were synthesized via electrochemical anodization of a titanium foil in a glycerol-based solution containing NH4F at 10 V. Pulse electrodeposition was used to incorporate Cu ions into the uniform TiO2 nanotubes. The photoconversion efficiency performance was examined under simulated visible light illumination (lambda >= 380 nm) in a 1 M solution of NaOH. The photocurrent density, the Mott-Schottky, the EIS, and the photoconversion efficiency measurements were determined. The highest photocurrent density i.e. 5.77 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE was obtained from nanocaves TiO2 photoanode. The incorporation of Cu resulted in a reduction in photocatalytic activity of the oxygen evaluation reaction (OER) and an increase of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1452-3981			WOS:000384906500037

Nitrogen gas was also added to the DC thermal plasma process in order to dope the hematite with N for enhancing photoelectrochemical properties of hematite nanoparticles. The efficiency of water splitting reaction was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) under solar simulator. In LSV measurements, the onset potential and maximum current density at a fixed voltage were measured. The durability of electrodes was checked by repeating LSV measurements. CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) binder with 50 : 1 composition exhibits the highest current density of 12 mA/cm2 and CMC binder with 20 : 1 composition, showing the initial current density of 3 mA/cm2, endures 20 times of repetitive LSV measurements.Effects of nitrogen doping on hematite nanoparticles were proven to be insignificant.				본 연구에서는 광 전기화학적 물 분해 전극 재료로 이용되는 산화철(Fe2O3, hematite)을 표면적을 크게 하기 위하여DC 열플라즈마 장치를 이용하여 나노입자로 합성한 후 전극을 제조 시 binder의 종류 및 조성을 다르게 하여 염기성전해질에서 각각의 물 분해 효율을 측정하는 실험을 진행하였으며 질소 도핑을 통해 질소가 산화철의 광전기화학반응에 끼치는 영향을 확인하였다. 산화철 전극을 제조하여 solar simulator를 이용한 LSV 실험을 통해 각 전극의 onset potential 및 설정한 전압 범위에서의 최대 전류밀도를 측정하였으며, 전극의 내구성 평가를 위하여 LSV 실험을 반복하여 진행하였다.

Basic principles of chemical processes with the involvement of H2O2 are discussed, considering its dual donor-acceptor properties and broad applications in the numerous environmental and technological redox processes. The paper highlights the importance of revealing these processes mechanisms, since they have been insufficiently studied so far, or the related data have a fragmentary and incomplete character. A special attention is given to catalytic oxidation reactions, formation and properties of intermediates, their role in the natural environment. The H2O2 plays a specific role in biochemical transformations in living organisms. Its presence in natural fresh water bodies is considered to be a necessary condition for waters self-purification, a process opposite to water pollution, especially given that the share of H2O2 decomposition leading to the formation of active OH center dot radicals is 10-50%.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1857-1727	2345-1688		WOS:000744174700003

As a type of intensively studied materials, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with a tunable pore structure and various functional groups are promising catalysts for CO2RR. Herein, COF synthesized by 2,6-diaminoanthraquinone and 2,4,6-triformylphloroglucinol is employed to assist the synthesis of electrocatalysts from Cu single atoms (SAs) to nanoclusters by controlling the electrodeposition. A tandem catalyst for CO2-to-CH4 conversion is thus achieved by the Cu nanoclusters dispersed among the isolated Cu SAs in the COF network. It is proposed that CO2 is first reduced to CO over the atomically isolated Cu SAs, followed by diffusion onto the neighboring Cu nanoclusters for further reduction into CH4. In addition, mechanistic analysis suggests that the coordinated K+ ions on the COF network promote the activation of CO2 and the adsorption of reaction intermediates, thus realizing the suppressed hydrogen evolution reaction and selective production of CH4. This study presents a new insight of COFs for the confined synthesis of a tunable SA to nanocluster electrocatalysts, disclosing the great potential of COFs in electrocatalysis.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2766-8525	2688-819X		WOS:000844493100015

Owing to the introduction of transition metals like Ag and Cu, the unique hollow sphere-like structure, electronic effects among the ternary metals and so on, the electrocatalytic activity and durability have been tremendously enhanced. In detail, PdAgCu HNSs show superior electrocatalytic performances for ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) with the mass activity of 3230.4 mA/mg(pd) and retained mass activity of 211 mA/mg(pd) after the durability measurement towards ethylene glycol oxidation, which are 3.39 and 3.05 times higher than those of commercial Pd/C, respectively, indicating that the PdAgCu HNSs possess the most powerful functionality in both electrocatalytic activity and stability. Remarkably, based on the present method, large-scale commercialization of PdAgCu HNSs electrocatalysts with low-priced, easy-to-use, and eco-friendly properties will in part assist in sustainable development.

Recently, electrochemical methods have attracted considerable attention for the remediation of metal pollution, originating from their environmental compatibility, high efficiency/selectivity/feasibility, and cost effectiveness. This review aims at recent advances in electrochemical metal recovery techniques, such as electrodeposition, electrosorption, electrodialysis, electrodeionization, and bioelectrochemical and photoelectrochemical methods. Additionally, the mechanisms and behaviors of different strategies are reviewed and compared, to overcome the limitations of concentration polarization from dilute metal ions, production of dendrites and spongy deposits, sluggish kinetics of ions transportation, and side-reactions from the hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions. Furthermore, the current challenges and future prospects of electrochemical metal recovery applications are also provided, to establish a process-mechanism-products (PMP) rational design of metal recovery, rather than simple metal removal.									52	1	0	0	14	0	52			2168-0485			WOS:000526592900002

The effect of variation in the concentration of hydrogen peroxide-and in the quantity of catalysts on the extent of disproportionation has also been studied. Enhanced activity has been observed in presence of alumina-adsorbed complexes. The reaction rate is found to increase with increase in temperature and quantity of the catalyst. The effect of stereochemical aspects of the complexes on the kinetics of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide has also been studied. Various thermodynamic parameters have been calculated. A probable reaction mechanism has been suggested and the results have been interpreted on the basis of formation of a surface-active intermediate and its subsequent interaction with hydrogen peroxide.									14	0	1	0	1	1	15			0022-4456			WOS:000230434500005

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) containing both inorganic and organic components have attracted extensive attention on energy applications because of their tunable structures and fascinating properties. Particularly, liquid-phase epitaxial (LPE) layer by layer (LBL) growth of MOFs thin films on various substrates surfaces (called SURMOFs, surface-coordinated MOF thin films) possess the advantages of controlled thickness, preferred growth orientation and homogeneous film, which provide ideal candidates for energy storage and conversion. In this review, we summarize the fabrication strategies of SURMOFs including the layer by layer dipping, pump, spray, spin-coating and flowing methods, the classification and advantages of SURMOFs, and then discuss the related energy applications of SURMOFs, encapsulated SURMOFs, and SURMOF-derivative on electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and solar cells etc.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2589-7780			WOS:000728583600001

The model is validated against an extensive set of experimental data obtained in our laboratory. This includes full-cell voltages, positive and negative electrode potentials monitored against reference electrodes inserted into the battery half-cell compartments and Ce(IV) concentrations in the positive electrolyte over 5 cycles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive set of experimental data used to fit and validate a flow battery model. The validated model is then used to predict the cell voltages and limiting redox reactions during battery operation for different model parameters to provide a guide to further improve the performance of zinc-cerium RFBs.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000686592100005

In nature, the reaction is efficiently catalyzed by a metal-complex-based catalyst surrounded by hole-transporting amino acid residues. However, in artificial systems, there is no example of a water oxidation system that has a catalytic center surrounded by hole transporters. Herein, we present a facile strategy to integrate catalytic centers and hole transporters in one system. Electrochemical polymerization of a metal-complex-based precursor afforded a polymer-based material (Poly-1). Poly-1 exhibited excellent hole-transporting ability and catalyzed water oxidation with high performance. It was also revealed that the catalytic activity was almost completely suppressed in the absence of the hole-transporting moieties. The present study provides a novel strategy for constructing efficient molecule-based systems for water oxidation.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000613294000001	33258167

Electrical energy storage (EES) is critical for efficiently utilizing electricity produced from intermittent, renewable sources such as solar and wind, as well as for electrifying the transportation sector. Rechargeable batteries are prime candidates for EES, but widespread adoption requires optimization of cost, cycle life, safety, energy density, power density, and environmental impact, all of which are directly linked to severe materials challenges. This article presents a brief overview of the electrode materials currently used in lithium-ion batteries, followed by the challenges and prospects of next-generation insertion-reaction electrodes and conversion-reaction electrodes with a Li+ working ion. Finally, we discuss future directions involving solid electrolytes, multi-electron transfer hosts, and other working ions.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			0883-7694	1938-1425		WOS:000382508600010

A modified electrode was tested in several electrolytic media for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, offering a wider potential window for oxidation than for reduction. It is apparent that oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) is minimized in presence of poly-PDMB. Morphology of the deposit depends on deposition time. Conductivity of poly-PDMB, tested in solution, was found to be higher when morphology of the deposit consisted in dimples arrangement. Silver deposition on the polymer surface was performed as qualitative proof of its conductivity and to demonstrate that reactions are taking place on the polymeric matrix rather than on the platinum surface.

The sluggish kinetics of the electrocatalysts toward the ORR requires large amounts of platinum to be used as cathode material, which calls for alternatives to replace or minimize the amount of the noble metals used. This study describes the synthesis and complete characterization of a copper metallopolymer (Cu MP) based on a conducting polymer (CP) and single-site catalytic centers for the electrocatalytic ORR. The copper (II) catalyst, embedded in a redox-active and conducting polymeric environment, was pursued as a potential candidate to replace noble metals in fuel cell applications. Performance studies at a rotating disk electrode (RDE) showed that the metallopolymer exhibited a direct four-electron reduction at potentials between - 150 and - 350 mV vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and high kinetic current densities of over 22.62 mA/cm(2). The kinetic current densities obtained at the Cu MP electrode outperformed most of the reported state-of-the art electrocatalysts toward the ORR. Further analysis of the Cu/CP hybrid revealed the copper being largely reduced to the oxidation state +I.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2073-4360			WOS:000449988800071	30960927

Herein, the article focused on the synthesis of uniformly distributed nano-sized bimetallic Fe2O3-MoO3 oxide encapsulated nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) (Fe2O3-MoO3/NG core-shell structure) catalyst through well-controlling reaction parameters and its prospective applications towards ORR for the first time. Thus, these unique synergistic interactions of bimetallic Fe2O3-Fe2O3 and NG support could modify the surface-strain effects, which led to enriching catalytic activity. Thus, Fe2O3-MoO3/NG core-shell structure demonstrated excellent catalytic activity, and far exceeding in long-term durability, better methanol tolerance compared to commercial Pt/C catalyst. Furthermore, the monometallic oxide (Fe2O3 or MoO3) or NG individually have poor activity for ORR, but their hybrid materials (Fe2O3-MoO3/NG) influenced strongly due to their structural properties, such as crystal structure, exclusive porosity, particle size and multiple active interfaces, display unexpected and remarkably high ORR activities similar to Pt/C in alkaline medium, This makes Fe2O3-MoO3/NG core-shell structure a suitable and efficient non-precious electrocatalysts with high catalytic ability, that could open up a new promising approach to advanced catalysts for electrochemical energy conversion and storage.									14	2	0	0	1	0	16			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000621665200001

However, such systems are intrinsically complex, with multiple interacting components. Herein, we explore a whole-cell photocatalytic system for hydrogen (H2) gas production as a model system for semiartificial photosynthesis. The employed whole-cell photo catalytic system is based on Escherichia coli cells heterologously expressing a highly efficient, but oxygen-sensitive, [FeFe] hydrogenase. The system is driven by the organic photosensitizer eosin Y under broad-spectrum white light illumination. The direct involvement of the [FeFe] hydrogenase in the catalytic reaction is verified spectroscopically. We also observe that E. coli provides protection against O-2 damage, underscoring the suitability of this host organism for oxygen-sensitive enzymes in the development of (photo) catalytic biohybrid systems. Moreover, the study shows how factorial experimental design combined with analysis of variance (ANOVA) can be employed to identify relevant variables, as well as their interconnectivity, on both overall catalytic performance and O-2 tolerance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2168-0485			WOS:000841289600001	36035441

A well-established water oxidation catalyst, RuO2 powder is used to fabricate different types of commonly used electrodes found in literature including: dropcast electrodes, doctor-blade electrodes and pressed electrodes. A variety of support substrates are used based on materials such as platinum, titanium, nickel and glassy carbon. Additionally, a variety of substrate geometries are also investigated, including: discs, foils and foams. The results show that the OER activity of the RuO2 powder is significantly varied depending on the electrode fabrication and substrate combination utilised.

Solvothermal and annealing methods were used to synthesize the MWCNTs-Mo2C composite. The morphology and size of the synthesized materials were characterized using a scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscope. The MWCNTs-Mo2C composite shows a large effective surface area and reveals high electron transfer rate, indicating its excellent electrocatalytic activity. Under optimal conditions, the modified electrode used to analyze rifampicin shows an excellent linear relationship between the peak current and the rifampicin concentration in the range from 0.5 to 74 mu M.

SO3 evolution from anhydrous alpha-COSO4: Gas equilibrium and kinetic approach								SO3 evolution from anhydrous alpha-COSO4: Gas equilibrium and kinetic approach								72 pp	72 pp						July 1977	1978	Starting from a cyclic sulphate process for the thermochemical splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen by means of nuclear heat of high temperature from high-temperature reactors, the thermal decomposition of anhydrous alpha-cobalt sulphate has been examined experimentally. Radiographic investigations of the solid decomposition products reveal the presence of two different cobalt oxides. When effecting decomposition at temperatures below 1082K, pure CoO is found, whereas above 1106K pure CO3O4 is being detected. Furthermore it was proved that anhydrous cobalt sulphate occurs in two different modifications. The values specified by Bodenstein and Pohl (1905) for the equilibrium constant of SO3 splitting have been confirmed experimentally in the temperature range between 980 and 1080K. In the course of an experiment to investigate the kinetics of the SO3 splitting, the reaction was found to be of the third order.									0	0	0		0	0	0						INSPEC:1162492

This is mostly due to their lack of stability with respect to several external factors, e.g., humidity, heat, light, and oxygen. Even though extensive studies have been carried out over the last decade, a lot of questions regarding their thermal stability still remain, and various publications have put forth different approaches for measuring and quantifying the conditions of their decomposition. However, differences in the experimental setups and in the reported values make comparisons of the reported results challenging. We show an approach, where MAPbI(3) thin films are thermally decomposed in high vacuum within a temperature range from 220 degrees C to 250 degrees C, while monitoring changes in the crystal structure using an in situ x-ray diffraction setup. This process reveals the complete phase evolution of the thin films from MAPbI(3) into PbI2. The time resolved data was then evaluated in view of the reaction kinetics using three different approaches. First, an Arrhenius fit was applied to ln k over 1/T, where the rate constant k was determined by fitting a first order exponential decay onto the decreasing peak area of the most prominent diffraction peaks. Secondly, a model fitting approach was used, where the data was tested against a set of different reaction models. Lastly, a model free isoconversional approach was applied. By doing this, we succeed in characterizing the decomposition and determine the kinetic triplet, consisting of the activation energy E, the frequency factor A, and the reaction model f (a). With the help of the kinetic triplet the decomposition reaction can be expressed in a physically meaningful way and allows us to predict the decomposition dynamics of MAPbI(3) thin films for varying temperatures.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2475-9953			WOS:000664650200008

Herein, we report the formation of iridium oxide nanostructured cages, via a water-based process performed at room temperature, using cheap Cu2O cubes as the template. In this synthetic approach, based on Pearson's hard and soft acid-base theory, the replacement of the Cu2O core by an iridium shell is permitted by the difference in hardness/softness of cations and anions of the two reactants Cu2O and IrCl3. Calcination followed by acid leaching allow the removal of residual copper oxide cores and leave IrO2 hierarchical porous structures with outstanding activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction. Fundamental understanding of the reaction steps and identification of the intermediates are permitted by coupling a set of ex situ and in situ techniques including operando time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy during the synthesis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000862296900001	36320917

All experiments were carried out in 0.1 M KOH. A remarkable finding is that the turnover frequency cobalt oxide. The activity of small amounts of cobalt oxide deposited on Pt, Pd, Cu, and Co decreased for the OER exhibited by similar to 0.4 ML of cobalt oxide deposited on Au is 40 times higher than that of bulk monotonically in the order Au > Pt > Pd > Cu > Co, paralleling the decreasing electronegativity of the substrate metal. Another notable finding is that the OER turnover frequency for similar to 0.4 ML of cobalt oxide deposited on Au is nearly three times higher than that for bulk Ir. Raman spectroscopy revealed that the as-deposited cobalt oxide is present as Co(3)O(4) but undergoes progressive oxidation to CoO(OH) with increasing anodic potential. The higher OER activity of cobalt oxide deposited on Au is attributed to an increase in fraction of the Co sites present as Co(IV) cations, a state of cobalt believed to be essential for OER to occur. A hypothesis for how Co(IV) cations contribute to OER is proposed and discussed.									1077	36	0	0	70	1	1086			0002-7863			WOS:000289829100061	21413705

The MC-MDQT method allows the realtime nonequilibrium quantum dynamical simulation of proton transport along water chains and provides a framework for analyzing the detailed dynamical mechanisms of these multiple proton transfer reactions. In this paper, the protein environment is modeled by applying structural restraints to the oxygen atoms of the chain, by applying external electric fields, and by including solvating water molecules hydrogen-bonded to the ends of the water chain. Our simulations illustrate that the protein environment could strongly impact the dynamics of proton wires through a combination of structural restraints, fluctuating electric fields, solvation, and hydrogen bonding. Our simulations also indicate that quantum effects such as hydrogen tunneling and nonadiabatic transitions play a significant role under certain nonequilibrium conditions.

In this work, an oxygen vacancy (VO)-Ti ensemble engineering on Ru catalyst was established to boost the catalytic activity toward water dissociation. The VO in VO-Ti ensemble plays as electron promoter to transfers electrons to surface Ru atoms. The rich electron state of Ru boosts the catalytic activity toward water dissociation. As an experimental verification, the turnover frequency of 1.5-RTVO-4 in ammonia borane hydrolysis reaches up to 1370 min-1 (9710 min-1 depend on the dispersion of Ru), exceeding the benchmark value set up by Ru-based catalysts. This research provides a novel electronic tuning strategy for VO as imaginary atom via electron promoter effect to enhance the intrinsic catalytic activity of metal catalysts toward inert molecule dissociation in the next generation energy chemistry field.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000783879600002

The Ag(CN)(2)(-) anion-exchanged precursor was reduced by EG to form metallic Ag-0. Furthermore, the effect of TEOA on confining the particle size of Ag-0 was demonstrated. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) property of metallic Ag-0 intercalated CoAl LDHs was examined in alkaline aqueous solution. A typical sample synthesized by the addition of TEOA for 180 min exhibited excellent ORR catalytic activity with a high current density of 5.5 mA cm(-2) at 0.2 V (vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and good stability. Koutecky-Levich (K-L) calculations and rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) measurements further revealed that the ORR of the as-prepared catalyst proceeded mainly via an almost ideal four-electron transfer process. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity was ascribed to the intercalated Ag-0, confined nanoparticle size and the expanded interlayer space, which effectively facilitate the reactant transfer and electron migration.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000457270000033	30601553

However, the large overpotential due to the sluggish kinetics involved with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is coercing scientific communities toward finding alternative ways of hydrogen generation. Recently, the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has evolved as a promising anode reaction for the electrocatalytic production of hydrogen. Herein, we report the fabrication of a composite of a nanostructured nickel(ii) trithiocarbonate (Ni-ttc-d) complex with g-C3N4 fabricated by a simple mechanochemical method and demonstrate its use as a robust and efficient catalyst for the UOR. The 35-Ni-ttc-d/g-C3N4 composite with 35 weight% of Ni-ttc-d displayed the highest electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and double-layer capacitance (C-dl) along with the lowest R-ct and required a potential of 1.38 V (vs. RHE) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the UOR, which is about 290 mV lower than that of the OER process. The Ni-ttc-d/C3N4 composite also showed excellent amperometric and potentiometric stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2633-5409		WOS:000830671600001

That was a major contribution of computational chemistry in building the theory of electrocatalysis. The possibility of computational electrocatalyst design had a massive impact on the way of thinking in modern electrocatalysis. At the same time, substantial criticism towards popular DFT models was developed during the years, due to the oversimplified view on electrified interfaces. Having this in mind, this work proposes an experimental methodology for quantitative description of adsorption energies at solid/liquid interfaces based on the Kelvin probe technique. The introduced approach already gives valuable trends in adsorption energies while in the future should evolve into an additional source of robust values that could complement existing DFT results. The pillars of the new methodology are established and verified experimentally with very promising initial results.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000569007500002

Development of facile approaches toward highly active carbon materials for ORR is urgently desirable. We accidentally discovered a method for preparing heteroatom-doped carbon catalyst through an in situ self-templating and self-sacrificing strategy during the carbonization of a single polymer precursor. The prepared N,S co-doped and hierarchical porous carbon possesses a large specific surface area up to 2446 m(2) g(-1), which is the state-of-the-art among the porous carbons prepared by direct pyrolysis of linear polymer precursors. The use of in situ nanoarchitecturing and active-site engineering ensures that the N,S co-doped porous carbon catalyst has sufficient active sites for charge/mass transport and catalysis. As expected, as-prepared carbonaceous electrocatalyst exhibited superior ORR activity in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes and outperformed the state-of-the-art benchmark Pt/C and the best carbonaceous electrocatalysts for ORR in aqueous media so far. Moreover, the N,S co-doped carbon catalyst was demonstrated to be a highly efficient air cathode for Zn-air batteries. Thus, this study provides a new and economical method of fabricating feasible carbon electrocatalysts with exceptional catalytic activities for energy conversion and storage.									42	0	0	0	0	0	42			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000463032200024

The focus is on 1D and 2D nanomaterials, starting with carbon nanotubes, through graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides to black phosphorus, and closing the circle with graphene in 3D-printed materials. Through these examples, we show that detailed materials characterization is paramount prior to assigning catalytic properties to specific functionality. We show that while metallic impurities in nanocarbons and black phosphorus are often a source of perceived electrocatalysis of these materials, the different phase and valency impurities are often sources of electrocatalysis in transition metal dichalcogenides. These impurities should not be viewed negatively because if their amount is controlled, then they become dopants and can be beneficial for the intended applications of these nanomaterials.									23	0	0	0	0	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800008

This membrane reactor combined a hydrogen-selective amorphous silica membrane prepared with dimethoxy-diphenylsilane and oxygen and employing counter-diffusion chemical vapor deposition, and Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. The silica membrane showed excellent hydrogen permeance at 573 K of the order of 10(-6) mol m(-2) s(-1) Pa-1 and high hydrogen/sulfur hexafluoride permselectivity of around 10(4). The membrane reactor exhibited equilibrium shifts as expected under reaction temperatures ranging from 473 to 553 K and reaction pressures ranging from 0.1 to 0.25 MPa, and these performances were successfully predicted using a simulation model, which was also developed in this study. Finally, we demonstrated that hydrogen with purity as high as 99.95% was produced from methylcyclohexane in the membrane reactor without using carrier gas or sweep gas.									51	2	0	0	1	0	53			0888-5885			WOS:000283916700020

The samples so obtained were heat treated in He flow up to 1200 K following the evolution of CO and CO2 by mass spectrometry. Results found show that during this treatment the CO disproportionation reaction takes place only in those supported catalysts obtained from the oxidized activated carbon. This reaction was catalyzed by Cr2O3 which is formed during the heat treatment. After He treatment up to 1200 K, the samples were treated in a He-O-2 flow (10 vol % of oxygen) at 573 K for 5 min.

Degradation of the cathode catalyst layer during automotive fuel cell operation was simulated by performing 1000 cyclic voltammetry scans between 0.5 V vs. RHE and 1.5 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M perchloric acid at room temperature. The electrochemically active platinum surface area was determined by CO stripping voltammetry with a novel method of baseline subtraction, and was found to reduce by 42% under these conditions. The activity of the metal oxide supported platinum catalyst towards oxygen reduction reaction was determined before and after the degradation test by rotating disk electrode measurements. The absolute kinetic current suffered a loss of 36% during the start /stop cycling. In contrast, the specific kinetic current was found to increase, which could be explained with a particle size effect due to platinum nanoparticle growth during potential cycling.					13th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell Symposium (PEFC)13th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell Symposium (PEFC)	OCT 27-NOV 01, 2013OCT 27-NOV 01, 2013	Electrochem Soc; Electrochem Soc, Ind Electrochemistry & Electrochem Engn Div; Electrochem Soc, Battery Div; Electrochem Soc, Corros Div; Electrochem Soc, Energy Technol Div; Electrochem Soc, Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; N E Chemcat CorpElectrochem Soc; Electrochem Soc, Ind Electrochemistry & Electrochem Engn Div; Electrochem Soc, Battery Div; Electrochem Soc, Corros Div; Electrochem Soc, Energy Technol Div; Electrochem Soc, Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; N E Chemcat Corp	San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1938-5862		978-1-60768-446-6; 978-1-60768-445-9	WOS:000354475600181

As cathode reaction the diffusion controlled copper ion deposition process has been used, while the anode reactions were either metal dissolution or oxygen evolution on a stable anode. It has been found that in the ITP cells with an insoluble anode the contribution of ITP to the mass transfer enhancement is higher. The relationship between pumping energy and process energy has also been analysed as a function of hydrodynamic conditions for each cell separately. The application of ITP cells has significant advantages in electrowinning and plating processes, while they are not suitable, from an energy perspective, in galvanising processes, in which soluble anodes are used. In the case of electrowinning the minimum energy consumption is found to be in the region of 0.1 - 1 g dm-3 of reacting ions, depending on the kind of cell used.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:A1994NV17900010

Hydrogen is as one of the energy sources that can resolve the abovementioned problems. Water splitting promotes ecofriendly hydrogen production without the formation of any greenhouse gas. The most common process for hydrogen production is electrolysis, wherein water molecules are separated into hydrogen and oxygen through electrochemical reactions. Solar-energy-induced chemical reactions, including photocatalysis and photoelectrochemistry, have gained considerable attention because of the simplicity of their procedures and use of solar radiation as the energy source. To improve performance of water splitting reactions, the use of catalysts has been widely investigated. For example, the novel-metal catalysts possessing extremely high catalytic properties for various reactions have been considered. However, due to the rarity and high costs of the novel-metal materials, the catalysts were considered unsuitable for universal use. Although other transition-metal-based materials have also been investigated, carbon-based materials, which are obtained from one of the most common elements on Earth, have potential as low-cost, nontoxic, high-performance catalysts for both photo and electrochemical reactions. Because abundancy, simplicity of synthesis routes, and excellent performance are the important factors for catalysts, easy optimization and many variations are possible in carbon-materials, making them more attractive. In particular, low-dimensional carbon materials, such as graphene and graphitic carbon nitride, exhibit excellent performance because of their unique electrical, mechanical, and catalytic properties. In this mini-review, we will discuss the performance of low-dimensional carbon-based materials for water splitting reactions.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15				1996-1944		WOS:000515499300114	31881793

By using first-principles calculations, the TM-embedded C3N monolayer (TM@C3N) has been theoretically investigated for HER, for which eighteen TMs are selected from the 3d, 4d, and 5d rows. The M-CC catalysts, with the TM atom embedded into the C-C double atomic vacancy, are the most stable among the various TM@C3N materials. All the M-CC catalysts show metallic conductivity and high thermal stability. The hydrogen binding free energy for the M-CC catalysts can be optimized to be close to 0 eV by choosing a suitable TM, and the kinetic barrier under the Tafel mechanism for further gaseous hydrogen evolution can be reduced to as low as 0.58 eV. These results suggest that the HER catalytic activities of the M-CC catalysts are likely comparable or even higher than those of the well-explored MoS2 nanostructures or Pt catalysts. Moreover, the HER activities of the M-CC catalysts can be illustrated by the electronic state distribution near the Fermi level of the catalytically active sites. This study provides a new possibility for cost-efficient HER catalysts of high activity and for the application of C3N nanostructures.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000487555400068	31502629

On the clean surface the eta-2(C,O) configuration was the dominant form of acetone. This species was characterized by a nu-(CO) frequency of 1380 cm-1. This value was 430 cm-1 below the nu-(CO) frequency of liquid acetone, indicating a substantial reduction in bond order arising from the binding of acetone to the metal surface via the pi and pi-* orbitals of the carbonyl. The strength of this interaction was also indicated by the reactivity of the eta-2(C,O)-acetone intermediate. All acetone molecules adsorbed in the first monolayer on the clean surface decomposed to CO, H2, and surface carbon. This decomposition exhibited a primary kinetic isotope effect upon deuterium substitution in both TPD and HREELS experiments. Thus C-H rather than C-C scission was the rate-determining step in acetone decomposition on Rh(111). Three different methods of estimating the acetone decomposition kinetics from the hydrogen TPD were compared. Accurate modeling of the kinetics required inclusion of the effect of hydrogen atom recombination kinetics on the rate of hydrogen evolution from the surface. Modification of the surface by addition of a (2 x 2) overlayer of oxygen resulted in a change in the acetone binding configuration from eta-2(C,O) to eta-1(O). This shift was the result of electronic modification of the surface by the electronegative oxygen atoms. The nu-(CO) frequency of acetone observed on the oxygen-predosed surface, 1660 cm-1, was much higher than that observed on the clean surface. The reduced interaction of acetone with the modified surface was also reflected in the decreased reactivity of this absorbate. eta-1(O)-Acetone tended to desorb rather than decompose as observed for eta-2(C,O)-acetone.									56	2	0	0	0	0	56			0022-3654			WOS:A1991FK32200059

The deformation charge density and adsorption energies (DFT) indicate the dual electronic regulations by N-doping and metal Co can significantly accelerate O-2 adsorption and improve conductivity, which are beneficial for ORR performance of carbon materials. This work provides a facile method to obtain highly active carbon materials via the electronic regulation for efficient catalysis.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2574-0962			WOS:000526598300034

ChemSusChem											10.1002/cssc.202201584				2022-Oct-04	2022	Small molecules induction can achieve the oriented migration of metal elements, which affords functional materials with synergistic components. In this paper, P-WO3/NF catalyst was obtained by phosphating the nickel foam (NF) supported octahedral WO3 with phosphine. Through a series of test results, it is proved that Ni forms Ni-P bond to migrate from NF to WO3 under the induction of P, leaving complex oxide W1.3Ni0.24O4 and Ni2P2O7in the particle interior and nickel phosphide on the octahedral grain surface. The catalytic activity of urea oxidation reaction (UOR) can be improved by synergistic action of the components in the synthesized hybrid particles, which can be used as another anodic hydrogen production reaction of oxygen evolution reaction. At the potential of 1.305 V, the current density of 10 mA/cm2 can be reached, the double layer capacitance (Cdl) value of the catalyst is significantly increased, and the electron transfer impedance of catalytic UOR is reduced. This work demonstrates that small molecule induction is suitable for constructing co-catalysts with complex components in a simple protocol, which provides a new idea for the design of highly efficient urea oxidation catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1864-564X		MEDLINE:36195829	36195829

The effect of preheating of the gas to a temperature of 1200 K on the degree of methane conversion in the discharge is studied. A kinetic model that describes the processes of methane decomposition and oxidation in CH4/CO2, CH4/H2O, and CH4/O2 mixtures is developed. The effect of the discharge parameters and gas additives on the efficiency of methane decomposition is investigated. The optimum temperature of the mixture, particle lifetime, and initial concentration of oxygen for the production of hydrogen molecules are found.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1062-0125			INSPEC:6330260

However, a comprehensive understanding of nucleation site distribution remains elusive. These limitations are due to the challenge of probing micro/nanoscopic nucleation sites and inadequate statistical interpretation of the nucleation process. Here we report direct experimental observation of nucleation site distribution in droplet condensation using phase-enhanced environmental scanning electron microscopy We also use statistical theory to demonstrate that the population of nucleation sites is governed by the Poisson distribution, whereas the nearest-neighbor distance follows the Rayleigh distribution instead of the commonly used Poisson distribution. We further show the broad applicability of these insights into nucleation site distribution to hydrogen-evolving reactions and chemical vapor deposition. Our platform, combining precise characterization and theory, advances the fundamental understanding of nucleation phenomena and guides designs from materials to devices.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11				2666-3864		WOS:000658758300006

These discoveries include important aspects of different enzymes responsible for various reactions, notably the reaction that allows the photolysis of water. This makes possible important steps towards the realization of systems able to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water using light and also for non-polluting fuel cells. A second group of discoveries concerns the way light is concentrated in photosynthetic systems. This biological concentration system has been found in some circumstances to rely on long distance quantum effects, of interest both for the production of high efficiency photovoltaic devices, and for the production and evolution of quantum computing systems.

In this paper we show that CO white dwarfs are strongly enriched in oxygen in the central regions and that this property is even strengthened by the crystallization process. These profiles are relevant for the cooling time scales of white dwarfs as well for determining the ignition density of thermonuclear supernovae.

The properties of treated fibers were characterized by elemental analysis (EA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) respectively. The SEM results show that cross section of the pre-carbonized fibers is circular with no apparent skin-core structure. During the pre-carbonization process (320-380A degrees C), fracture mode of the fibers gradually changes from ductile to brittle and fibril diameter gradually decreases. Pre-carbonization temperature at 350A degrees C significantly accelerates chemical reactions. The FTIR results show that a stable oxygen structure is generated as treated at 320A degrees C.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			1229-9197	1875-0052		WOS:000428281800024

Li-ion batteries (LIB) have been the most successful energy storage system with their long-life cycle and efficiency, lower energy density, and notable cost effectiveness with small-scale energy storage. However, with large-scale energy storage and for long duration, work still needs done to make LIB efficient on such a scale as well. Recently Li-air batteries have been suggested as potential energy storage systems that can provide the solution for large- and long-term electrical energy storage. The Li-air battery utilizes the catalyst-based redox reaction, and still, it is not applicable commercially due to low current density, poor life cycle, and energy efficiency. Generally, such problems are associated with the materials used as an electrocatalyst and on the selection of the electrolyte. Herein, we briefly review the current advancements in the field of electrocatalysts for Li-air batteries which hinders their improvement toward commercial applications, and this review also provides an outlook for future Li-air battery systems.									23	3	0	0	0	0	24			2168-0485			WOS:000484071600001

Herein, a tetranuclear nickel(II) complex with bis-[(E)-N'-(1-(pyridin-2-yl)ethylidene)]carbohydrazide (HL), was synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic methods and single crystal X-ray analysis. The complex is a tetranuclear complex and the ligands are coordinated to the metal ions in the mono-negative form, (L)(-) to form a tetranuclear [NiL](4)(4+)unit. Each Ni(II) ion is six-coordinated by pyridine nitrogen, azomethine nitrogen and oxygen atoms of two perpendicular carbohydrazone ligands in the mer configuration. The complex was studied as a water-oxidizing catalyst. In the next step, the role of the Ni-based compound for water oxidation on the surface of fluorine doped tin oxide as one of the true catalysts was investigated by scanning transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, spectroelectrochemistry, and electrochemistry. The electrode after water oxidation by the complex was studied and a relation between the decomposition of the Ni complex and water-oxidation reaction was proposed. The experiments show that under water-oxidation condition in the presence of the complex, a Ni-based compound on the electrode is a candidate as a contributor to the observed catalysis.

Herein, we report the synthesis of Bi2O3/CeOx catalysts containing abundant heterointerfaces and oxygen vacancies by a two-step strategy. The prepared hybrid catalyst exhibits a superior selectivity of 98.28% for formic acid production and outstanding durability with an operation period of up to 32 h for CO2 electroreduction. Theoretical calculations show that the interface in this structure provides efficient electron transfer rates, improves the adsorption of key adsorbates, and also alleviates the reaction energy potential barrier. The electron modulation induced by the interface achieves high selectivity and yield of HCOOH. This work provides new insights into the structural impact of rare earth oxides in Bi-based catalysts and provides strong support for the further development of catalysts containing rare earth metals.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000869018000001

Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is a powerful tool for visualizing the surface properties and localized electrochemical activity down to the atomic scale in situ and even operando, thus plays an essential role in studying heterogeneous electrocatalysis mechanisms. We summarize recent advancements in SPM for investigating energy-related electrocatalysis based on three unique characteristics of SPM-surface property imaging, in situ/operando monitoring, and nanoscale electrochemical mapping,outline the application of SPM in investigating the structure- activity relationship, material transformations, and electrochemical processes. The specific SPM techniques discussed here include scanning tunneling microscopy, atomic force microscopy, scanning electrochemical microscopy, scanning ion conductance microscopy, and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of SPM in electrocatalysis are discussed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2590-2393	2590-2385		WOS:000717532100011

To understand the origin of sensing, we combined catalytic conversion measurements with simultaneously performed operando diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy and DC resistance measurements. We applied our operando investigation technique to the relevant analytes, CO2, C2H4, and C2H2, in order to identify the type and role of different adsorbates. DRIFT spectra revealed that at 150 degrees C, the reaction with both acetylene and ethylene resulted in surface formate species; at higher temperatures, this was the case only for acetylene. Accordingly, LFO responds to both gases at 150 degrees C but only to acetylene at 250 degrees C. Finally, we could identify the mechanism by which the formate species are responsible for the sensor response and the essential role played by Pt electrodes in the detection of ethylene and the temperature-dependent selectivity.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000526328500036

Herein, the NiMn layer double hydroxide (NiMn-LDH) is developed using the sonochemical route at different reaction times, which act as a multifunctional electrode for supercapacitors and overall water splitting. The capacitance of layer double hydroxide (LDH) synthesized at 4 h (NiMn-LDH-4 h) of reaction time was found to be 527 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), with 91.2% capacitance retention after 5,000 cycles at 2 A g(-1) in 6 M KOH. For hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, the NiMn-LDH-4 h electrode exhibits a standard of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 120 mV and 296 mV, respectively, in 1 M KOH. Moreover, fabricated NiMn-LDH-4 h||NiMn-LDH-4 h electrolyzer for overall water splitting benchmarks 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.6 V.

In a conventional process to accelerate the water oxidation, oxygen evolution cocatalysts (OECs) are usually used on the surface of a photoanode. As an alternative strategy, we considered employing a composite photoanode made up of a semiconductor and carbon spheres, for it is expected that the photogenerated electrons on the semiconductor particles can be captured by the carbon spheres as electron reservoirs and leave the photogenerated holes on the surface of the semiconductor particles, which promotes the effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. More importantly, the holes accumulated in the valence band accelerate the water oxidation reaction rate with the rapid release of electrons stored on the carbon sphere. Therefore, the composite photoanode achieves a higher photocurrent at a lower applied bias. We provide a proof of concept for this strategy by preparing a composite photoanode by combining bismuth vanadium oxide BiVO4 with carbon spheres and find that the resulting photoanode displays a remarkable enhancement in the rate of the photoanode water oxidation.									30	1	0	0	1	0	30			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900060

In this work, first-principles calculations have been carried out to explore the properties of the two-dimensional perovskite-based MgPSe3. Dynamic and mechanical analyses confirm the stability of this low-dimensional material. Our calculated Raman frequencies are in good agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, a topological bonding analysis, based on the electron localization function, indicates a covalent and ionic character for the P-Se and Mg-Se bonds, respectively. From a reactivity point of view, water interacts poorly with MgPSe3 and its associative interaction is physisorbed and governed by weak interactions. Consequently, the low dissociative energy of H2O molecules affects the reaction taking place on the surface of the material, making it unfavorable for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. However, the computed electronic properties show that MgPSe3 is a promising material for optoelectronic applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000810135800001	35695885

There are fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic limitations to direct water splitting and a number of strategies have been developed to overcome them. These include the development of catalysts which have little activity for the back reaction of hydrogen oxidation, systems with spatially separated H-2 and O-2 production and the interception of the oxygen species by sacrificial water reductants. Success has been achieved in these areas over the last 20 years or so, but more needs to be done in terms of the development of high quantum efficient photo-absorbers which operate over the useable light range, and of two-photon efficient processes which can extend the useable range further. There is also an urgent need for fundamental investigations of the nature of the range of surface processes which occur during photocatalysis, and which have to occur in synchrony.

Curves of fractional decomposition (alpha) against time could be described by the Ginstling-Brounshtein diffusion model (low alpha) and the first-order rate equation (BaO2, alpha > 3.0; SrO2, alpha > 0.5). The activation energy for the main deceleratory process of the decomposition of BaO2 is 185 +/- 5 kJ mol(-1), which is considerably higher than the value of 119 +/- 2 kJ mol(-1) for the deceleratory stage of the SrO2 decomposition. Non-isothermal kinetic analyses gave similar E(a) values for the decompositions of both BaO2 and SrO2, namely 165 +/- 5 kJ mol(-1).

Photosensitizer molecules absorb the excitation light photons triggering a series of photochemical reactions in the presence of oxygen in the target tissue. During such interactions it is produced the de-excitation of the photosensitizer molecules in the singlet excited state which return to their minimum energy state by emitting fluorescence photons. These days, there are fixed clinical PDT protocols that make use of a particular optical dose and photosensitizer amount. However treatment response varies among patients and the type of pathology. In order to adjust an optimal dosimetry, the development of accurate predictive models plays an important role. The photosensitizer fluorescence can be used to estimate the degradation of the photoactive agent and as an implicit dosimetric measurement during treatment. However it is complex to know the fluorescence dependence with the depth in the tumor from observed fluorescence in the pathology surface. We present a first approach to predict the photosensitizer fluorescence dependence with depth during the PDT treatment applied to a skin disease commonly treated in the dermatological clinical practice. The obtained results permit us to know the photosensitizer temporal fluorescence evolution in different points of the tumor sample during the photochemical reactions involved in PDT with a predictive purpose related to the treatment evolution. The model presented also takes into account the distribution of a topical photosensitizer, the propagation of light in a biological media and the subsequent photochemical interactions between light and tissue. This implies that different parameters related with the photosensitizer distribution or the optical source characteristics could be adjusted to provide a specific treatment to a particular pathology.

Developing active and robust water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) is the key to constructing efficient artificial photosynthesis systems, but it is still facing enormous challenges in both fundamental and applied aspects. Here, the recent developments in molecular catalysts and heterogeneous nanoparticle catalysts are reviewed with special emphasis on biomimetic catalysts and the integration of WOCs into artificial photosystems. The highly efficient artificial photosynthesis depends largely on active WOCs integrated into light harvesting materials via rational interface engineering based on in-depth understanding of charge dynamics and the reaction mechanism.									148	11	0	0	10	0	149			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000485573500001	31495962	
J	Lu, Siqi; Zhuang, Zhongbin								Investigating the Influences of the Adsorbed Species on Catalytic Activity for Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction in Alkaline Electrolyte								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				139	14			5156	5163		10.1021/jacs.7b00765				APR 12 2017	2017	Catalysts for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline electrolyte are important for anion exchange membrane fuel cells. Understanding the role of OH- during the HOR catalytic process in alkaline electrolyte is essential to design highly active HOR catalysts. Here, we attempt to isolate the influence of OH- by using surface-controlled Pt based nanoparticles as the model catalysts. With a comparison of the HOR activity between PtNi nanoparticles and acid washed PtNi nanoparticles, which have almost the same hydrogen binding energies but much different OH binding energies, it was found that the HOR activity in alkaline electrolyte is not mainly controlled by the OH adsorption. Therefore, a bifunctional catalyst promoting OH adsorption may not useful for HOR in alkaline electrolyte. Tuning the hydrogen binding energy was found to be an efficient way to enhance the HOR activity, and making Pt base alloy is a reasonable way to tune the hydrogen binding energies.									171	18	0	0	11	0	172			0002-7863			WOS:000399353800031	28324656

Contributing parameters to the overall volume change of a replacement reaction are the molar volume of parent and product and their solubility ratio within a given solution. Based on simple model salt systems, the contribution of solubility to volume change is quantitatively determined. For NaCl-KCl as an example of a binary salt system without solid solution, the relative volume changes can be calculated for various reaction paths using the slope of the solubility from a simple solubility diagram. For KBr-KCl as an example of a binary salt system with complete solid solution, the determination of the solubility curve is based on a modified Lippmann phase diagram called a solubility phase diagram. It allows a quantitative calculation of the relative volume change based on the solid solution-aqueous solution (SS-AS) relationships for variable solution compositions and reaction paths in the salt-water system. Reaction kinetics, textures and the compositional evolution of replacements in both salt systems can be conclusively explained by the relative volume change on the basis of experimentally constrained reaction paths. The analogy from simple model system to replacement reactions at the Earth's surface and crustal conditions (for example in apatites or feldspars) may offer insights to successfully describe volume changes and porosity generation in mineral reactions on the basis of solubility data towards a more quantitative modeling of interface-coupled dissolution-precipitation reactions.									62	1	0	0	7	0	62			0002-9599			WOS:000292017200002		
J	FALK, S; BRUCE, D; HUNER, NPA								PHOTOSYNTHETIC PERFORMANCE AND FLUORESCENCE IN RELATION TO ANTENNA SIZE AND ABSORPTION CROSS-SECTIONS IN RYE AND BARLEY GROWN UNDER NORMAL AND INTERMITTENT LIGHT CONDITIONS								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				42	2			145	155		10.1007/BF02187125				NOV 1994	1994	The size of the Photosystem II light harvesting antenna and the absorption cross-sections of PS I (sigma(PSI)) and PS II (sigma(PSII)) were examined in relation to photosynthetic performance fluorescence. Wild-type (WT) rye (Secale cereale) and barley (Hordeurn vulgare) as well as the barley chlorophyll b-less chlorina F2 mutant were grown under control and intermittent light (IML) conditions. (sigma(PSII)) in control barley F2 was similar to IML grown WT rye and barley, which, in turn was 2.5 to 3.5 times smaller than for control WT plants. In contrast, sigma(PSI) was similar for all control plants. This was 2.5 to 4 times larger than for IML-grown WT plants. IML-grown barley mutant plants had the smallest absorption cross-sections. Photosynthetic light response curves revealed that the barley chlorina F2-mutant had rates of oxygen evolution on a per leaf area basis that were only slightly lower than control WT rye and barley while IML-,grown plants had strongly reduced photosynthetic performance. Convexity (Theta) for control barley chlorina F2-mutants was equal to the WT controls (0.6-0.7), while all IML-grown plants had a Theta of 0. This indicates that, in contrast to control barley mutants, IML-plants were limited by PS II turn-over rates at all irradiances. However, on a per leaf Chl-basis the IML-grown plants exhibited the highest photosynthetic rates. Thus, the comparatively poor photosynthetic rates for IML-grown plants on a per leaf area basis were not due to less efficient photosynthetic reaction centers, but may rather be due to an increased limitation from PS II turn-over and a reduction in the number of reaction centers per leaf area.									13	0	0	0	13	0	14			0166-8595			WOS:A1994PZ67200005	24306502

Contrary to the shape-controlled method, herein, we reported a selective segregation-etching strategy to highly increase the active sites of a bimetallic alloy as a high-performance electrocatalyst. The surface composition of the PdCo alloy was manipulated by its preferential segregation in the atmosphere according to the predictions of the density functional theory (DFT). By leaching Co atoms from the surface having a balanced composition with consecutive potential cycling in an acid solution, the surface reconstructed to show a high density of high-index Pd facets identified by Cs-corrected transmission electron microscopy. Using hydrogen evolution as a model reaction, the resulting catalyst exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activity and outstanding long-term stability. This study provides a general principle to design a transition metal alloy with highly active sites, which has a great potential in broad areas such as batteries, fuel cells, and beyond.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2398-4902			WOS:000503876500033

However, large-scale water electrolysis has been greatly hindered due to the lack of non-noble metal catalysts with high catalytic performance. Benefitting from unique hollow structures with large surface area and adjustable chemical compositions, hollow design plays an important role in improving the electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report an effective multi-step strategy to prepare hierarchical Co-decorated Mo2C hollow spheres (CMCHSs) as electrocatalyst for HER. To be specific, the preparation process involves a metal-chelated polymerization and a subsequent surface modulation process. Owing to the unique hollow structure and incorporation of Co species, the as-prepared CMCHSs demonstrate largely enhanced HER performance with a low overpotential of 139 mV at the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) and good cycling durability in acid. The present research work highlights a new feasible strategy for the design of HER electrocatalyst via hollow designs and surface engineering.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000651681100001

The electrochemical activity of these multi-component systems toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in PE;M water electrolysis is investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry and steady state polarization techniques. The utilization of the catalysts is assessed applying a repetitive potential cycling at varying scan rate (5-300 mV.s(-1)) to determine the morphology factor f, which serves as a measure for the unusable part of the catalyst. The results obtained show that for all systems under study part of the catalyst is not accessible for the electrochemical reaction. The morphological factor is lowest for the Cr-containing composite. This catalyst has also a superior catalytic activity related both to inter-metallic electronic interactions and to geometry factors such as decreased crystallite size and increased active surface.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1310-1331			WOS:000307127700007

The effect of La doping on their electrochemical performance upon UV illumination are investigated. The doped electrodes show higher density of cracks and rugosity in microscale on the surface than the undoped ones. They also have a negative shift of the onset potential of oxygen evolution from 1.1 V to 1.0 V and higher current intensity under UV irradiation as well. Electrochemical impedence spectroscopy analysis demonstrates a better electrical conductivity of the doped film. Electron paramagnetic resonance results show that the obtained La-doped TiO2 surface provides a higher density of oxygen vacancies. This anode also has 7.5% higher degradation rate of the methylene blue than La-undoped ones under UV irradiation. This is probably due to the increased surface rugosity and better electric conductivity, higher density of oxygen vacancies under UV irradiation by the doping of La ions.									13	0	0	0	3	0	13			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000498639000067

The amount of Fe in the precursor mixture is varied to scrutinize the effect of Fe on the structural and catalytic properties of the resulting Fe-N-C. The electrocatalytic activity of the optimized sample in acidic electrolyte is comparable to that of commercial Tanaka Pt/C electrocatalyst. The catalysts were also assembled in a membrane electrode assembly as a cathode electrode for a single cell test, which shows remarkable fuel cell performance compared to other related studies of non-precious metal-based catalysts for the ORR. Such a high ORR catalytic performance can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the Fe-N-C species, high-density pyridinic N species, N-doped carbon-encapsulated iron carbide (NC-Fe3C) nanoparticles, and high electrical conductivity as well as the porous framework structure of the as-prepared ZIF-based Fe-N-C catalysts. In addition, different properties of catalysts prepared in a nitrogen or ammonia (NH3) atmosphere are also investigated. Interestingly, it is found that NH3 treatment helps not only to improve carbon porosity and nitrogen content but also to increase carbon graphitization and induce NC-Fe3C formation, leading to enhanced ORR activity and durability of thus-prepared catalysts.									36	1	0	0	2	0	36			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000448338700026

DELTApH-dependent quenching is a physiological mechanism which protects Photosystem II by converting excess excitation energy to heat in response to acidification of the thylakoid lumen. The energy quenching has been proposed to occur either at quenching centres in the light-harvesting antenna or as a result of charge recombination processes at the Photosystem II reaction centre. These models have proved difficult to distinguish by conventional methods, but make radically different predictions for the timescale of the heat release. Here, we use laser-induced optoacoustic spectroscopy to show that the heat release associated with DELTApH-dependent quenching is complete within 1.4 mus. This indicates that charge recombination in the reaction centre is not involved.									22	1	1	0	18	0	23			0005-2728			WOS:A1994NE09600014

The pH dependency of reduction potentials of ionized iron and copper species facilitated the elimination of copper inclusion in electrodeposited iron-based layers. Hydrogen evolution in competition with iron reduction from preferentially ferric ions was also diminished by increasing pH of the solution with NaOH addition. Adding malonic acid was effective to considerably diminish the oxidation of reduced iron due to the complexation between ferric ion and malonate (Mal) ligand. However, iron oxidation could not be completely inhibited by adding malonic acid because a partial transition of Fe(Mal)(+) ions to ferrous ions, which can react readily with oxygen during electrodeposition, would occur at low cathodic potentials. Controlling malonic acid concentration could lead to the formation of alpha-Fe with very low oxygen content less than 0.15 wt%. (C) The Author(s) 2014. Published by ECS.

This is a trivial fact but has profound implications since the forming of life on the early Earth required water. The sources of water and the related amount of delivery depend not only on the conditions on the early Earth itself but also on the evolutionary history of the solar system. Thus we ask where and when water formed in the solar nebula-the precursor of the solar system. In this paper we explore the chemical mechanics for water formation and its expected abundance. This is achieved by studying the parental cloud core of the solar nebula and its gravitational collapse. We have identified two different sources of water for the region of Earth's accretion. The first being the sublimation of the icy mantles of dust grains formed in the parental cloud. The second source is located in the inner region of the collapsing cloud core - the so-called hot corino with a temperature of several hundred Kelvin. There, water is produced efficiently in the gas phase by reactions between neutral molecules. Additionally, we analyse the dependence of the production of water on the initial abundance ratio between carbon and oxygen.					11th European Workshop on Astrobiology of the European-Astrobiology-Network-Association (EANA)11th European Workshop on Astrobiology of the European-Astrobiology-Network-Association (EANA)	JUL 11-14, 2011JUL 11-14, 2011	Helmholtz Alliance; European Astrobiol Network Assoc (EANA); European Space AgcyHelmholtz Alliance; European Astrobiol Network Assoc (EANA); European Space Agcy	German Aerosp Ctr, Cologne, GERMANYGerman Aerosp Ctr, Cologne, GERMANY	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-6149	1573-0875		WOS:000305985800002	22644567

Oxidation occurred mainly in the TiN matrix, because Ti5Si3 was resistant to oxidation. The oxidation of the TiN matrix was preceded by the outward diffusion of Ti ions to form an outer TiO2 layer, and the inward diffusion of oxygen ions to form an inner TiO2 layer, together with nitrogen evolution from the TiN matrix.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0030-770X	1573-4889		WOS:000243823700002

Herein, the origins of catalytic activity on single-layer BiOX are investigated by using the density functional theory. The grand potential calculations show that the Bi-and BiO-terminations of single-layer BiOX are stable in O-poor and O-rich environments, respectively. The Bi- and BiO-terminations of single-layer BiOX are found to have obviously active sites for HER, whereas the (001) basal planes are inert. The Gibbs free energies for the adsorption of hydrogen atoms on the Bi- and BiO-terminations are close to the optimal value of 0 eV, indicating that single-layer BiOX possess favorable HER performances. The enhanced HER activities on the Bi- and BiO-terminations are attributed to the localized edge states around the Fermi level, which are caused by the Bi 6p-orbital density of the fringe bismuth atoms and O 2p-orbital density of the fringe oxygen atoms, respectively. The results of this work suggest that single-layer BiOX are a family of promising catalysts for water splitting.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000489676400080	31556603

In this perspective, we emphatically present the recent progresses in the strategies of enhanced mass transport for 2D nano-catalysts, which could be roughly classified into three categories: layer modification, space regulation between layers and using supporters. Their resultant extraordinary performance as the result of enhanced mass transport will arouse people to put more efforts into the design of mass-transport channels. Finally, in the consideration of mass transport, the future developments of 2D nano-catalysts are also briefly proposed. We hope our perspective will pave a way to the guidance of integral catalyst engineering with both the activity and mass transport.									4	1	0	0	2	0	4			2452-2627			WOS:000468158900004

Previous theoretical and experimental results have shown that some two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides (MXenes) can be effective electrocatalysts for the HER, based on the assumption that they are functionalized entirely with oxygen or hydroxyl groups on the basal plane. However, it is known that MXenes can contain other basal plane functionalities, e.g., fluorine, due to the synthesis process, yet the influence of fluorine termination on their HER activity remains unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the role and effect of basal plane functionalization (T-x) on the HER activity of 5 different MXenes using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. We first studied Ti3C2Tx produced by different fluorine-containing etchants and found that those with higher fluorine coverage on the basal plane exhibited lower HER activity. We then controllably prepared Mo2CTx with very low basal plane fluorine coverage, achieving a geometric current density of -10 mA cm(-2) at 189 mV overpotential in acid. More importantly, our results indicate that the oxygen groups on the basal planes of Mo2CTx are catalytically active toward the HER, unlike in the case of widely studied 2H-phase transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS2, in which only the edge sites are active. These results pave the way for the rational design of 2D materials for either the HER, when minimal overpotential is desired, or for energy storage, when maximum voltage window is needed.									206	7	0	0	9	0	206			2574-0962			WOS:000458705000025

While bimetallic materials have been discovered as a group of promising catalysts for electrochemical water splitting, a facile and reliable synthesis approach toward 2D morphology to fully release its electrochemical catalytic potential is still lacking. In this work, bimetallic Co-Mo-O ultrathin nanosheets were synthesized by ionic layer epitaxy with controlled composition ratio. The Co-Mo-O nanosheets exhibited a quadrangle shape with a uniform thickness of similar to 2.5 nm. This 2D morphology largely enriched the surface catalytic active site ratio. Particularly, nanosheets with 2:1 Co-to-Mo ratio showed a substantially enhanced OER catalytic activity with a 3 orders of magnitude higher mass activity compared to benchmark IrO2 and RuO2 in an alkaline environment. This study introduces a promising possibility for creating high-performance electrocatalysts from 2D bimetallic materials with a high efficiency for material utilization.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2380-8195			WOS:000696180500039

Modeling is playing an increasing vital role in process optimization and understanding of governing physical and chemical process. In this paper, a chemical kinetics model is developed to analyze the time evolution of the different main species involved in the flue gas initially stressed by a single pulse corona discharge at the atmospheric pressure and 300K. The typical gas composition in this model is N-2/O-2/H2O/CO2=74/5/6/15 with 500 ppm NO and 1000 PPM SO2. The calculations indicate that sulfur dioxide is removed principally by reactions with OH radicals to produce sulfuric acid. The removal rate of SO2 increased with increasing water vapor and oxygen content in the flue gas indicating that OH radical is important for SO2 removal.

In this work, we report that bimetallic Pt-In nanoparticles with uniform size distribution and controllable composition can be synthesized through a one-step, facile colloidal approach. Various characterization tools such as XRD, TEM, XPS, and synchrotron techniques have been used to characterize the as-obtained nanoparticles. It is demonstrated that the Pt and In elements are homogeneously distributed in the whole nanoparticle. The bimetallic Pt-In nanoparticles have shown great catalytic performance, including high activity, high selectivity, and high stability, for the propane dehydrogenation reaction to produce propene, one of the most important chemicals. The excellent catalytic performance makes Pt-In bimetallic nanoparticles promising catalysts in future industrial application.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0008-4042	1480-3291		WOS:000413728800008

Correspondingly, at the deep discharge to 2.0 V the batteries show increased specific capacity. Upon charge, the AuNPs exhibit promotion effect on the Li2O2 decomposition by improving the conduction property of the discharge-formed particles, rather than by imposing the conventional electrocatalytic effect on the oxygen evolution reaction. Moreover, the AuNPs show promotion effect on decomposition of carbonate species arising from the side reactions. These effects consequently lead to the reduced charge overpotentials and extended cycle operation of the batteries. The results here provide a new as well as clear picture on the role of incorporated AuNPs in the Li2O2 formation and decomposition, which would be helpful for better understanding and constructing of high-performance air cathodes.									36	3	0	0	1	0	37			1932-7447			WOS:000334571700011

This structure, being assigned to recurrences in the motion along the symmetric stretch coordinate on the saddle point region of the first excited state, a motion orthogonal to the reaction coordinate on the excited H + SH or H + OH reactive potential energy surfaces. represents the spectroscopy of the transition state. We then describe how our recent measurement of the emission spectrum of dissociating H2S Selectively accesses a particular resonance and probes the evolution of the dynamics into the exit channel of the reactive trajectories. Such dynamics cannot be probed in photodetachment studies, which necessarily form the neutral collision complex at a wide range of energies, not just within a chosen resonance.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0009-2614			WOS:A1991GB80500002

In several mutants, including some that evolve oxygen, a significant fraction of photosystem II reaction centers are shown to lack photooxidizable Mn ions. In this fraction of reaction centers, either the high-affinity site from which Mn ions rapidly reduce the oxidized secondary electron donor, Y-Z(+), is devoid of Mn ions or the Mn ion(s) bound at this site are unable to reduce Y-Z(+) It is concluded that the Mn clusters in these mutants are unstable or are assembled inefficiently in vivo. Mutants were constructed in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The in vivo characterization procedures employed in this study involved measuring changes in the yield of variable chlorophyll a fluorescence following a saturating flash or brief illumination given in the presence of the electron transfer inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea or following each of a series of saturating flashes given in the absence of this inhibitor. These procedures are easily applied to mutants that evolve little or no oxygen, facilitate the characterization of mutants with labile oxygen-evolving complexes, permit photosystem II isolation efforts to be concentrated on mutants having the stablest Mn clusters, and guide systematic spectroscopic studies of isolated photosystem II particles to mutants of particular interest.									134	4	0	0	119	0	138			0006-2960			WOS:A1994NN47200013	8193127

Forms I, II, and III catalyse the carboxylation and oxygenation of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, while form IV, also called the Rubisco-like protein (RLP), does not catalyse either of these reactions. There appear to be six different clades of RLP. Although related to bona fide Rubisco proteins at the primary sequence and tertiary structure levels, RLP from two of these clades is known to perform other functions in the cell. Forms I, II, and III Rubisco, along with form IV (RLP), are thought to have evolved from a primordial archaeal Rubisco. Structure/function studies with both archaeal form III (methanogen) and form I (cyanobacterial) Rubisco have identified residues that appear to be specifically involved with interactions with molecular oxygen. A specific region of all form I, II, and III Rubisco was identified as being important for these interactions.					14th International Congress of Photosynthesis14th International Congress of Photosynthesis	JUL 22-27, 2007JUL 22-27, 2007		Glasgow, SCOTLANDGlasgow, SCOTLAND	230	7	1	0	204	0	238			0022-0957	1460-2431		WOS:000256274800007	18281717

Herein, a reasonable space division strategy of Ni foam (NF) was proposed to design a bifunctional catalyst. Ni-P alloy was loaded on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through Pd-free electroless plating (Ni-P/CNTs). Subsequently, the Ni-P/CNT catalysts mixed with melamine were annealed for N doping. The N-doped CNTs coated with N-doped Ni3P and Ni nanoparticles (N-Ni3P-Ni/N-CNTs) were obtained. Finally, the N-Ni3P-Ni/N-CNTs were used as a filler to divide the pore size of NF by electroplating Ni, obtaining a network-like hierarchical porous electrode (N-Ni3P-Ni/N-CNTs/NF). This hierarchical porous structure exposed abundant catalytically active sites, facilitated the mass transfer, and prevented the catalyst agglomeration and corrosion that promote electrolyte contact and favor facile electron transfer kinetics. On the basis of the rational design, a selfsupported N-Ni3P-Ni/N-CNTs/NF electrode showed a high specific surface area and exhibited superior electrocatalytic performances. The electrode achieved low overpotential of 73 and 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. Besides, it required a cell voltage of only 1.57 V to achieve 20 mA cm(-2) when assembled in a 1 M KOH electrolyte for overall water splitting. Hence, this study represented a rational design of self-supported bifunctional electrode for overall water splitting.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4				2574-0970		WOS:000677582900094

Lignin-first biorefinery methods have attracted increasing attention recently for their high-value of aromatic chemicals, and high biofuels productivity from lignocellulosic wastes. Thermostable laccase has proven to be an excellent alternative catalyst in degrading lignin for its versatile catalytic abilities under industrial conditions and pollution-free by-products. Thermostable laccases can be found in native extreme environments or modified by biologically based technologies such as gene recombination expression and enzyme direct evolution. This review demonstrated thermostable laccases and their application in lignin degradation.

The development of scalable, cost-efficient and robust synthetic routes toward well-defined solid state structures is a major objective in this field. While monometallic oxides have been studied in much detail, reliable synthetic recipes targeting specific crystal structures of mixed metal oxide nanoparticles are largely missing. Yet, in order to meet the requirements for a broad range of technical implementation it is necessary to tailor the properties of mixed metal oxides to the particular purpose. Here, we present a study on the impact of the nature of the gas environment on the resulting crystal structure during a post-synthesis thermal heat treatment of manganese-cobalt oxide nanoparticles. We monitor the evolution of the crystal phase structure as the gas atmosphere is altered from pure nitrogen to synthetic air and pure oxygen. The particle size and homogeneity of the resulting nanoparticles increase with oxygen content, while the crystal structure gradually changes from rocksalt-like to pure spinel. We find the composition of the particles to be independent of the gas atmosphere. The manganese-cobalt oxide nanoparticles exhibited promising electrocatalytic activity regarding oxygen evolution in alkaline electrolyte. These findings offer new synthesis pathways for the direct preparation of versatile utilizable mixed metal oxides. (C) 2016 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics.

To change the electronic structure, chemical composition, and photocatalytic activity of CN, we report the deficient quinone ring monomer here. Thermal copolymerization of urea with 2,6-diaminoantandantquinone (DQ) monomer is an efficient synthesis of a sequence of modified CN photocatalysts. Results show that the optical absorption capacity is improved by modulating the quinone ring in the CN framework, improving its charge transfer and separation of photogenerated electron and holes. The modified CN shows a notable improvement in the photocatalytic activity of overall water splitting, such as hydrogen evolution rate (HER) and oxygen evolution rate (OER). The co-polymerized CN-DQ(5.0) displays a remarkable activity of 520.8 mu mol/h of H-2 evolution and 6.8 mu mol/h of O-2 evolution, which is around 8 times and 4.5 times greater than CN. The universal copolymerization by a small, optimized amount of monomer DQ explores a remarkable improvement in the photocatalytic activity. Novelty Statement We manifested the process of molecular doping with carbon nitride (CN) semiconductor for utilization of solar heat radiation into chemical energy under sunlight perspective. Here, we suggest a novel nanoscopic organic-conjugated heterocyclic monomer 2,6-diaminoantandantquinone (DQ) monomer as a demonstrator within CN that boost the photocatalytic properties. An identifiable undulation occurred in the surface area, electronic structure, calculated band gap, and chemical composition analysis of CN and also improved its electronic generation process under visible light radiance. The superior photocatalyst stimulated a tremendous photocatalytic activity of water reduction and water oxidation as enhanced catalytic performances compared of pristine sample, respectively.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000683361800001

However, it is still very challenging to achieve a high NH3 yield and efficiency under ambient conditions. Herein, we for the first time synthesize one-dimensional screw-like MoS2 with oxygen partially replacing sulfur (1D-MoS2-xOy) nanosheets by a one-step solvothermal method as an efficient non-noble metal electrocatalyst for NRR. In a 0.1 M HCl solution, 1D-MoS2-xOy exhibits excellent NRR performance, with a remarkable average ammonia yield rate of 5.56 x 10(-8) mols(-1) cm(-2) at-0.35 V, and a high Faradaic efficiency of 9.86% at-0.3 V. The isotope labeling experiment proves that the generation of NH3 is completely derived from the feed-in N-2. Density functional theory calculations show that MoS2 with oxygen partially replacing sulfur can reduce the Gibbs free energy of the potential determination step (PDS). Besides, the unique screw-like structure can provide more N-2 adsorption sites for NRR. This work proposes a promising strategy for the reasonable design of non-precious metal-based NRR electrocatalysts.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773070900005

Correlation of adsorption of NGr and subsequent interpenetration through the specific surface plane of nickel particles as well as the concomitant interaction of N and C with Ni in the nano-regime has been investigated. Apart from the benefits of the synergistic interactions between Ni, N, and C, the overall integrity of the structure and its intra-molecular connectivity within the framework help in achieving better oxygen evolution characteristics at a significantly reduced overpotential. The engineered Ni-NGr nanocage displays a substantially low overpotential of similar to 290 mV at a practical current density of 20 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH. In comparison, NGr and Ni-particles as separate entities give overpotentials of similar to 570 and similar to 370 mV under similar conditions. Moreover, the long term stability of Ni-NGr was investigated by anodic potential cycling for 500 cycles and an 8.5% increment in the overpotential at 20 mA cm(-2) was observed. Additionally, a chronoamperometric test was performed for 15 h at 20 mA cm(-2), which highlights the better sustainability of Ni-NGr under the actual operating conditions. Finally, the quantitative estimation of evolved oxygen was monitored by gas chromatography and was found to be 70 mmol h(-1) g(-1) of oxygen, which is constant in the second cycle as well.									31	1	0	0	0	0	31			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000344997500118	25255470	
J	Long, Jilan; Zhou, Di; Chen, Cheng; Shen, Kui								Structural and interface engineering of Co nanocatalysts induce boosting the electrochemical performance for rechargeable zinc-air battery								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				602						154304	10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.154304				NOV 15 2022	2022	The development of highly-efficient bi-functional catalysts for Zn-air battery is of importance for sustainable energy-storage field. Rational utilization the integral advantages of metal-organic frameworks and traditional templates is an effective strategy to achieve high performance multi-functional catalysts. Herein, the di-nuclear Co-Zn-MOF was synthesized on the surface of polystyrene (PS) with a facile method, then the porous N, P co -doped carbon encapsulated Co-based catalysts were developed by calcining the PS@Co-Zn-MOF template fol-lowed by acid-mist treatment. The characterization results reveal that acid-mist treatment strategy can efficiently modify the surface feature, and remove the surface-adsorbed and unstable metal nanoparticles, thus improving the stability of catalysts. Moreover, this work also proves that low concentration acid-mist treatment can improve the graphitization degree, while high concentration acid can lead to the increase of defective carbon. With this strategy, the obtained Co@PNC-850-0.1H catalyst achieves an impressive enhanced ORR/OER performance, and the potential difference between ORR and OER is only 0.734 V at 0.1 M KOH condition. Additionally, the Co@PNC-850-0.1H based aqueous and all-solid-state Zn-air batteries (ZABs) also deliver excellent performances with extraordinary power density (194.3 mW.cm(-2); 70.7 mW.cm(-2)), high specific capacity (779.7 mAh.g(-1)@10 mA.cm(-2); 723 mAh.g(-1)@5 mA.cm(-2)), and ultra-high stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000848403900004

Here we report hierarchically porous carbon microspheres with a trace amount of encapsulated cobalt as highly active and stable electrocatalysts for the ORR under wide pH values ranged from high alkaline to high acidic conditions. We use renewable natural date pulp as the carbon precursor and a facile hydrothermal carbonization method with in situ formed recyclable cobalt as a template for the synthesis. These catalysts yield competitive catalytic activity (a small Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1)) as well as superb durability and methanol tolerance compared to the benchmark Pt/C catalyst in alkaline electrolyte. Even under harsh acidic conditions, the catalysts deliver a satisfactory catalytic performance and good stability, indicating their extensive applicability. This performance is mainly attributed to the rich surface defects and the hierarchically porous structure that provide abundant active sites for the ORR. In situ formed cobalt nanoparticles are critical to the creation of the abundant mesopores, high specific surface area, and catalytically active defect sites over the carbon material. The encapsulated cobalt residual further enhances the ORR activity of the catalysts, while having a negligible effect on the cost due to its trace level (0.2 at.%).									34	1	0	0	1	0	34			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000600993200002

In earlier studies, the electrochemical fabrications of Ni-Fe oxide catalysts were exclusively carried out by cathodic reduction of Ni(II) and Fe(III, II) in an individual solution that is different from the alkaline media commonly used for the OER. The procedure does not suggest that the dissolution/corrosion of the film catalysts could be countered by continual catalyst formation during the OER Herein, we report a highly active NiFeOx catalyst by in situ rapid (3-15 min) anodic deposition of Ni(II) and Fe(III,II) in concentrated carbonate solution. At a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode, the conformal deposition of NiFeOx, (7-11-atom layer) results in a very low optical loss (5-8%) with activity comparable to that of other planar NiFeOx films. Extension, to a 3D nickel foam produces a hierarchical coating of grasslike structure. With few added Ni(II) and Fe(III) atoms to counter the film dissolution/corrosion, the catalyst can deliver a stable current density of 100 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of only 260 mV in alkaline media. This example of a NiFeOx catalyst forms during in situ OER and operates by a self-repair mode, highlighting a truly important feature for the practical application of this state of the art OER electrocatalyst.									88	1	0	0	4	0	89			2155-5435			WOS:000385057900079

The properties of fluids of interest dominate the behavior of Cu, Au in the fluids, including solubility, spicies, and liquid-fluid partition. The species formed responsible for dissolving and transporting metals are determined by oxygen fugacity and Cl/S ratio of the fluids. High temperature, salinity and oxygen fugacity favor Cu-Cl and Au-Cl complexes in the fluids,where S_3~- is likely to serving as an important S-bearing species for dissolving Au. Excessive amount of S with respect to Fe and Cu is benifical to distributing Cu and Au by the form of charged ionic and neutral complexes in liquid-like and vapor-like fluids, respectively, the latter of which would migirate Au as far as epithermal enviroment. The source magama ought to experience adequate fractionation to exsolute fluids with components and properties that are so good for transportation of metals that high-grade porphyry Cu,Au could form. Especially in the case of space-time-related epithermal Au over the porphyry system,it is required that initial state of the fluids is in the supercritical region of the referential binary system of NaCl-H_2O; efficient fluid-evolution patterns, favorable buffering surroundings and suitable sites for precipitation of Au are encouraged as well. Phase separation and fluid-fluid reaction are the two most important manners determining the precipitation of porphyry-epithermal Cu-Au. Vapor-like fluids have characteristic properties and evolving pattern, which should be considered as an important ore-forming fluid.			斑岩-浅成低温热液型Cu-Au成矿流体最具代表性的是H_2O-Cl-S流体。流体的性质强烈控制着Cu、Au的成矿行为,包括溶解性、迁移形式和气-液分配。流体的氧逸度和流体中Cl、S物种相对含量决定金属在流体中的溶解形式,高氧逸度的高温高盐度流体中Cu、Au主要和Cl络合,S_3~-也可能是促进Au溶解的重要S物种形式。而过量的S有利于Cu、Au等元素以含S离子络合物进入液相流体,与含S中性络合物配分进入气相流体并迁移Au至浅成低温热液环境形成矿床。岩浆需要经历充分的分异,出溶成分和性质有利于金属迁移的流体,形成高品位的斑岩型Cu、Au矿体;上覆叠加浅成低温热液型Au矿体可能需要初始的成矿流体状态进入NaCl-H_2O的超临界区、有效的演化方式、良好的流体缓冲环境和有利的Au沉淀场所。相分离和流体-流体反应是沉淀斑岩-浅成低温热液型Cu-Au矿体最重要的流体演化方式。气相流体具有独特的流体性质和演化方式,可能成为十分重要的成矿流体。						0	3	0	0	0	0	3			0371-5736			CSCD:5140995

Garcia/0000-0002-8204-6832; Israelian, Garik/0000-0002-9443-0532			Oxygen abundances in unevolved metal-poor stars from near-ultraviolet OH lines								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				507	2			805	817		10.1086/306351				NOV 10 1998	1998	We have performed a detailed oxygen abundance analysis of 23 metal-poor (-3.0 < [Fe/H] < -0.3) unevolved halo stars and one giant through the OH bands in the near UV, using high-resolution echelle spectra. Oxygen is found to be overabundant with respect to iron in these stars, with the [O/Fe] ratio increasing from 0.6 to 1 between [Fe/H] = -1.5 and -3.0. The behavior of the oxygen overabundance with respect to [Fe/H] is similar to that seen in previous works based on O I IR triplet data. Contrary to the previously accepted picture, our oxygen abundances, derived from low-excitation OH lines, agree well with those derived from high-excitation lines of the triplet. For nine stars in common with Tomkin et al. we obtain a mean difference of 0.00 +/- 0.11 dex with respect to the abundances determined from the triplet using the same stellar parameters and model photospheres. For four stars in our sample we have found measurements of the [O I] lambda 6300 line in the literature, from which we derive oxygen abundances consistent (average difference 0.09 dex) with those based on OH lines, showing that the long-standing controversy between oxygen abundances from forbidden and permitted lines in metal-poor unevolved stars can be resolved. Our new oxygen abundances show a smooth extension of the Edvardsson and coworkers [O/Fe] versus metallicity curve to much lower abundances, with a slope of -0.31 +/- 0.11 (taking into account the error bars in both oxygen abundances and metallicities) in the range -3 < [Fe/H] < -1. The extrapolation of our results to very low metallicities indicates that the first Type II supernovae in the early Galaxy provided oxygen to iron ratios of [O/Fe] greater than or similar to 1. The oxygen abundances of unevolved stars, when compared with values in the literature for giants of similar metallicity, imply that the latter may have suffered a process of oxygen depletion. As a result, unevolved metal-poor stars shah be considered better tracers of the early evolution of oxygen in the Galaxy. The higher [O/Fe] ratios we find in dwarfs has an impact on the age determination of globular clusters, suggesting that current age estimates have to be reduced by about 1-2 Gyr.									227	2	0	0	0	0	228			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000077779700020

In the context of engineering the interfacial band alignment, we demonstrate a novel and straightforward approach to control the electrochemical activity of the bifunctional catalysts with precision by bridging conductive N-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs, 2-3 nm) between La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (LSC) and MoSe2 interfaces. The N-GQDs govern the charge transfer process at the interface, exhibiting higher Co3+ cations and metallic 1 T-MoSe2 phase-transition compared to those of LSC and LSC-MoSe2 composites. As a result, the optimized LSC-N-GQDs-MoSe2 electrocatalyst possessed a lower over -potential, Tafel slope, and charge transfer resistance in HER and OER than pure and LSC-MoSe2 electrocatalysts in an alkaline solution. The Tafel slopes (64 mV & BULL;dec(-1) and 51 mV & BULL;dec(-1) for HER and OER respectively) are smaller than those of current solutions that are commercially available, showing a higher performance at a high current density of 500 mA & BULL;cm(-2) with a long-term 24 h stability test. The key design of the current study is based on conductive bridging in the bifunctional catalyst to improve the interfacial charge transfer and electrochemical reaction.									5	0	0	0	0	0	4			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000781269200004

The results show that Pb(II) does not modify the evolution of oxygen in alkaline solutions, and the reaction taking place at 0.84 V-SHE is under the mixed control of ionic transport and charge transfer. The Koutechy-Levich equation was used to calculate the value of diffusion coefficient D and apparent heterogeneous rate constant k of the PbO2 electrodeposition process at 0.84 V-SHE. The results indicate that NaOH has a negative influence on the diffusion of Pb(II) within a NaOH concentration range of 2.5 similar to 4.5 M. In addition, NaOH has a positive influence on the apparent heterogeneous rate constant of Pb(II) oxidation reactions within a NaOH concentration range of 2.5 similar to 3 M, but a negative influence within a NaOH concentration range of 3 similar to 4.5 M. XRD and SEM were employed to investigate the effects of NaOH concentration on phase composition and surface microstructures of deposits. The results show that PbO2 synthesized in an alkaline solution consists of pure a phase. The deposits are all composed of rounded nanocrystallites, except for the deposit synthesized in a solution of 3 M NaOH, which exhibited rod-like crystallite. (C) The Author(s) 2016.

Nevertheless, the photoactivity has been pretty low to date, and deeper insights into improving CO2 conversion efficiency remain a challenge. Here, BiVO4 atomic layers have been synthesized as ideal platforms to investigate the correlation between the electronic structures and activities for CO2 photoreduction. Cobalt (Co) is then deliberately doped in BiVO4 atomic layers to adjust the electronic structures. XPS analysis, CO2 TPD and electrochemical experiments indicate that Co doping makes the electron densities around O anions increase, which could likely facilitate CO2 activation and electron transfer to CO2 molecules, while photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic oxygen evolution experiments demonstrate that Co doping could also promote water oxidation reactions. Further investigations by density functional theory calculation reveal that Co doping results in the generation of new defect levels above the Fermi level, inferring that a higher hole concentration is favorable for water oxidation, and the doped Co 3d orbits located at the top of valence bands might serve as active centers for water oxidation. As a result, Co-doped BiVO4 atomic layers achieve an efficient and stable CH4 production rate of 23.8 mol g(-1) h(-1) under atmospheric CO2 concentration (400 ppm), which is about three times the activity of pristine BiVO4 atomic layers. This work might help to gain deeper insights into the design of CO2 photoreduction catalysts.									28	2	0	0	1	0	29			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000435659500012

The photoelectrochemical deposition occurred in the solutions containing M2+ ions immediately after the formation of a TiO2 film on the Ti substrate under anodic bias. The film thickness of the TiO2 was controlled by the light energy, i.e., wavelength, during the illumination. The prepared Ti/TiO2/MOx electrodes showed a large tunneling current under anodic bias. Especially, the Ti/TiO2/PbO2 electrode with the thinnest TiO2 film acted as an excellent inert anode in acidic solution, because a large tunneling current for the oxygen evolution reaction was observed and had long term stability under anodic bias.

The evolution processes are characterized by three consecutive stages: (1) aerosol wet scavenging, (2) night-time nitrate formation, and (3) photochemical production and evolution of secondary aerosol species. Our results suggest that wet scavenging of aerosol species tends to be strongly related to their hygroscopicities and also mixing states. The scavenging leads to a significant change in bulk aerosol composition and average carbon oxidation state because of scavenging efficiencies in the following order: sulfate > low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosol (LV-OOA) > semi-volatile OOA (SV-OOA) > hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA). The second stage involves a quick formation of nitrate from heterogeneous reactions at nighttime. During the third stage, simultaneous increases of sulfate and SV-OOA were observed shortly after sunrise, indicating secondary aerosol formation. Organic aerosols become highly oxidized in similar to half day as the result of photochemical processing, consistent with previously reported results from the CO-tracer method (OA/Delta CO). The photochemical reactions appear to progress gradually associated with a transformation of SV-OOA to low-volatility species based on the evolution trends of oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ratio, relationship between f44 (fraction of m/z 44 in OA) and f43 (fraction of m/z 43 in OA), and size evolution of OOA and HOA. Aerosols appear to become more internally mixed during the processing. Our results suggest that functionalization by incorporation of both C and O plays a major role in the early period of OA oxidation (O/C < 0.5). Our results also show that photochemical production of LV-OOA during this event is approximately 2-3 h behind of sulfate production, which might explain, sometimes, the lack of correlations between LV-OOA and sulfate, two secondary aerosol species which often exist in internal mixtures over regional scales.									33	5	0	0	13	0	40			1680-7316	1680-7324		WOS:000298667600013

Here we investigate the effect of carbon on the formation of VO defect and its conversion upon annealing to the VO2 defect. Cz-Si samples with various carbon concentrations were irradiated by 2 MeV electrons. The formation of VO pair, its thermal stability and evolution and its conversion to the VO2 defect were previously monitored and studied by means of infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Modeling of the formation process showed that the VO concentration has a square root dependency on the carbon substitutional (C-s) concentration. The conversion of the VO to the VO2 defect decreases with the increase of the C-s concentration. The results are in agreement with the experimental observed dependency of the conversion ratio on the C-s concentration, since [VO] increases when [C-s] increases.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000344808800025

Herein, we report that cobalt-phosphorous-derived films (Co-P) can act as bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting. The as-prepared Co-P films exhibited remarkable catalytic performance for both HER and OER in alkaline media, with a current density of 10mAcm(-2) at overpotentials of -94mV for HER and 345mV for OER and Tafel slopes of 42 and 47mV/dec, respectively. They can be employed as catalysts on both anode and cathode for overall water splitting with 100% Faradaic efficiency, rivalling the integrated performance of Pt and IrO2. The major composition of the as-prepared and post-HER films are metallic cobalt and cobalt phosphide, which partially evolved to cobalt oxide during OER.									673	40	0	0	15	0	680			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000354260000024	25900260

Though this chemistry is much less explored than that of sulfur and selenium counterparts, the recent work on the applications of metal complexes of tellurium ligands, and nanosized metal tellurides in catalysis indicate that there is a lot of scope for new discoveries. In this review, we have summarized complexes of different transition metals with organotellurium compounds and nanosized metal tellurides, their synthesis and applications in different catalytic transformations with critical analysis of present status of the subject. Such metal complexes have been explored in various organic transformations, but the examples are very limited. Telluroether ligands have been used to prepare several distinct metal complexes. The geometry around the metal centre in the complexes depends on metal. The geometry is square planar or neraly square planar in the complexes of palladium. In case of other metals, the complexes have pseudo-octahedral half sandwich 'piano-stool' geometry. Though the metal complexes show the potential to catalyse different types of reactions (including Suzuki coupling, Heck coupling, C-N coupling, amidation reaction, oxidation of alcohols, transfer hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds, reduction of 4-nitrophenol, hydrosilylation reaction), extensive studies have been conducted on their applications in catalysis of C-C coupling reactions. Nanosized metal tellurides have been synthesized and characterized as catalytically active materials. However, they remain at a back seat with respect to their exploration in catalysis. These materials have been developed with different morphologies (e.g., in the form of nanoparticles, nanotubes and nanowires, etc). The architecture of nanosized crystals mainly reflects the morphology, complexity and the symmetry of its crystal structures. Their synthetic strategies include a variety of methods such as hydrothermal methods, solvothermal methods, ultrasonification, etc. Their catalytic properties have been explored in electrocatalysis, electro-oxidation of alcohols, photocatalysis, dye-sensitized solar cells. Among them, the applications in hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and oxidation of alcohols are quite interesting.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Application of the catalyst dramatically improved the oxygen evolution efficiency and corrosion-resistance of stainless steel, nickel and copper anodes in alkaline media. More than 20 g of catalyst was prepared in a single batch, and it was shown to be effective at surface loadings as low as 20 mu g/cm(2). The catalyst was investigated in three different systems: (1) An alkaline electrolyzer with stainless steel electrodes activated with the catalyst supported 120-200% of the current density of an unactivated but otherwise identical electrolyzer, over a range of applied potentials, and maintained this improved efficiency throughout 1495 h of continuous use in 1 M NaOH. (2) Copper anodes were activated and protected from corrosion in dilute sodium hydroxide for 8 h of electrolysis, before a steady decrease in performance over the next 48 h. (3) Activation of nickel anodes with the catalyst reduced the required overpotential by 90-130 mV at current densities between 7.5 and 15 mA/cm(2), thereby increasing the cell efficiency of water splitting as well as zinc deposition from alkaline zincate electrolytes. The cell efficiency for zinc deposition at a current density of 12.5 mA/cm(2) was improved from 68.0% with a nickel anode to 72.0% with 50 mu g/cm(2) catalyst on the nickel anode.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			2168-0485			WOS:000355645000025		
J	Oyama, V I; Berdahl, B J; Woeller, F; Lehwalt, M								The chemical activities of the Viking biology experiments and the arguments for the presence of superoxides, peroxides, gamma-Fe2O3 and carbon suboxide polymer in the Martian soil.								Life sciences and space research				16				3	8						1978	1978	The evolution of N2, Ar, O2, and CO2 from Martian soil as a function of humidity in the Gas Exchange Experiment are correlated with the mean level of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere. All but O2 are associated with desorption. The evolution of oxygen is consistent with the presence of alkaline earth and alkali metal superoxides; and their peroxides and the gamma-Fe2O3 in the soil can account for the generation of radioactive gas in the Labeled Release Experiment. The slower evolution of CO2 from both the Gas Exchange Experiment and the Labeled Release Experiment are associated with the direct oxidation of organics by gamma-Fe2O3. The Pyrolytic Release Experiment's second peak may be carbon suboxide as demonstrated by laboratory experiments. A necessary condition is that the polymer exists in the Martian soil. We ascribe the activity of the surface samples to the reaction of Martian particulates with an anhydrous CO2 atmosphere activated by uv and ionizing radiations. The surface particles are ultimately altered by exposure to small but significant amounts of water at the sites. From the working model, we have predicted the peculiar nature of the chemical entities and demonstrated that the model is justified by laboratory data. The final confirmation of this model will entail a return to Mars, but the nature and implications of this chemistry for the Martian surface is predicted to reveal even more about Mars with further simulations in the laboratory.									16	0	0	0	5	0	16			0075-9422			MEDLINE:11965660	11965660

In this work, the Fe-doped NiSe2 polyhedron nanocrystals grown on Ni foam (Ni0.75Fe0.Se-25(2)@NF) with controllable surface morphology are developed as high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts. The surfaces of the optimized polyhedron nanocrystals provide high density of catalytic active sites. NiSe2 is originally a catalytic active substance, and the Fe doping in NiSe2 can greatly enhance the conductivity. The optimized Ni0.75Fe0.25Se2@NF (6 h) electrode are performed in an alkaline solution, exhibiting outstanding OER and HER activity with small overpotentials of 210 mV and-117 mV to reach current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and -10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Remarkably, the Ni0.75Fe0.25Se2@NF (6 h) electrode serve as cathode and anode in water splitting electrolyzer also demonstrates highly efficient overall water electrolysis performance, with a relatively low cell voltage of 1.61 V at 10 mA cm(-2) (1.57 V for RuO2(+)//Pt/C(-) couple) and excellent long-term stability of 50 h for overall water electrolysis.									33	0	0	0	1	0	33			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000472476200036

Herein, we construct a new type of Ni3Fe1-xCrx (0 <= x < 0.3) intermetallic integrated electrodes for overall water splitting via an ultrafast carbothermal shock method. The obtained Ni3Fe0.9Cr0.1/CACC electrode exhibits the optimum performance among all developed electrocatalyst electrodes in this work, and the overpotential is merely 239 mV for OER and 128 mV for HER at 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, the Ni3Fe0.9Cr0.1/CACC electrode shows excellent durability during both OER and HER stability tests at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2). An electrolyzer, which was assembled with Ni3Fe0.9Cr0.1/CACC electrodes as both the anode and cathode, operates with a low cell voltage of 1.59 V at 10 mA cm(-2). It has been found that the impressive OER activity of Ni3Fe0.9Cr0.1 nanoparticles (NPs) can be ascribed to the stimulative formation of the OER-active Ni3+/Fe3+ species by the substituted Cr, while the enhanced HER activity is caused by the Cr substitution, which decreases the water dissociation energy barrier. This work provides an ultrafast and facile strategy to develop electrocatalyst-integrated electrodes with low cost and impressive HER/OER bifunctional performance for overall water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000812982000001	35465674

A lightweight polymer-electrolyte-membrane electrolyzer capable of producing oxygen and hydrogen at a balanced pressure of 13.8 MPa has been designed and fabricated by Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems International (HSSSI). This electrolyzer uses a unique metal-laminate cell design that reduces the weight of traditional high-pressure water electrolysis stacks by eliminating the need to place the stack within a pressure vessel. The electrolyzer operates on water fed to the anode and cathode (dual-feed mode). This design simplifies the balance of plant for a regenerative fuel cell system and enhances system safety. The electrolyzer was tested at balanced pressure in the range of 1.72-13.8 MPa using a test system designed and constructed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Current efficiency of 96 to 97% was achieved at a balanced product pressure of 13.8 MPa. The polarization characteristics were governed by the kinetics of oxygen evolution and the ionic resistance of the membrane electrolyte. The electro-osmotic water drag coefficient was determined to be in the range of 2.3-2.4 and this value did not vary with the operating pressure up to 13.8 MPa. The dual-feed electrolyzer is a promising design for achieving high energy efficiencies at high product pressure. (C) 2011 The Electrochemical Society.

Herein, we design a facile and effective preparation strategy for the fabrication of a 3D porous carbon network catalyst comprised of an ultrathin nanosheet and anchored with Fe3C nanoparticles. The catalyst was prepared using an iron-tannin framework coated over g-C3N4 as precursor, and simultaneously with g-C3N4 as a nitriding agent and structural/morphological template. Optimum catalyst exhibits excellent ORR performance and durability in an alkaline medium; the half-wave potential (+0.86 V vs. RHE) is 40 my more positive than that of commercial PVC, and its current density at +0.9 V (vs. RHE) reaches -1.153 mA cm(-2),which is almost 2.42 times that of commercial Pt/C. Significantly, the catalyst also shows outstanding ORR performance in acidic conditions with a half-wave potential of +0.73 V (vs. RHE), comparable to that of Pt/C, and better long-term stability than Pt/C. Based on our characterization results, we ascribe the outstanding performance of catalyst to: the enhanced amount of Fe-N-x active sites and active nitrogen species, including pyridinic-N and graphitic-N; Fe3C nanoparticles covered with ultrathin doped carbon layer; and the high surface area and porous structure.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000461408300014

The HER activity trend was observed as Ni >>alpha-Ni(OH)(2) > beta-Ni(OH)(2), likely attributed to a synergy between metallic Ni and Ni(OH)(2) components on the Ni surface and fast water dissociation kinetics on the alpha-Ni(OH)(2) surface. With the HER proceeding, the metallic Ni surface, however, gradually became alpha-Ni(OH)(2), and alpha-Ni(OH)(2) surface ultimately transformed into beta-phase, leading to a dramatic activity decrease of Ni electrodes. Therefore, Ni electrodes were coated with alpha-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets to slow down the nickel hydroxylation and optimize the surface ratio of Ni(OH)(2) to metallic Ni. This simple coating procedure enhanced both activity and durability of Ni electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000853946600001	35864065

Except for the inert basal plane sites of the MoS2 itself, its inherent low conductivity also hinders the electron transfer process, which adversely affects its efficiency towards HER. Therefore, how to expose more edge active sites and at the same time improve the conductivity of MoS2, either intrinsically or with the help of high conductive substrates, is a key means to improve the HER performance of MoS2. Herein, the polystyrene (PS) nanospheres are used not only as an intercalation agent of graphene carbon sheets, but also as a spherical template for the preparation of 3D spherical hollow graphene. Different nitrogen precursors and nitrogen doping methods are used to prepare the 3D spherical hollow graphene substrate materials with different nitrogen-doping structures, such as amine N, pyrrolic N, pyridinic N or quaternary N. The investigation results show that the structure of doped nitrogen atom has a great influence on the loading of molybdenum disulfide. Among them, amine N was the most favorable for the loading of molybdenum disulfide, followed by pyrrole N, quaternary N and pyridine N. Moreover, the structure of doped N active sites synthesized by different preparation methods can also affect the uniform distribution of molybdenum disulfide on 3D spherical hollow graphene and the corresponding HER performance. The results show that, using ammonia as nitrogen source and PS microspheres as template, the prepared molybdenum disulfide loaded 3D spherical hollow graphene electrode material has the best HER performance, which should be attributed to the uniform distribution of the molybdenum disulfide and its close combination with the substrate, as well as the 3D spherical hollow structure. Moreover, the amorphous structure of molybdenum disulfide formed in the hydrothermal process can also improve the activity of HER. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The catalytic activity of nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) is comparable to that of a catalyst containing Ir, Ru, or Co in terms of O-2 yield and O-2 evolution rate under ambient reaction conditions. NiFe2O4 also possesses robustness and ferromagnetic properties, which are beneficial for easy recovery from the solution after reaction. Water oxidation catalysis achieved by a composite of earth-abundant elements will contribute to a new approach to the design of catalysts for artificial photosynthesis.									219	10	1	0	24	0	221			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000311869600019	23157404

However, precisely anchoring SACs on the surface of a transition metal carbide remains a formidable challenge, although they have been widely reported with 2D carbon-based materials such as graphene and N-doped graphene. Herein, we demonstrate a novel strategy using sacrificial zinc in the controllable pyrolysis of metal atom doped Mo/Zn bimetallic imidazolate frameworks, which enables the designed metal single atoms (e.g., Co, Ni, and Cu) to be successfully anchored on the exposed surface of the in situ produced holey 2D Mo2C nanosheets (namely Me SAs/Mo2C). When applied as a bifunctional catalyst for both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, the representative Co SAs/Mo2C provides favorable OH* adsorption strength and ultralow overpotentials (e.g. 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution) as well as a 2.37-fold higher turn-over frequency (TOF) value at 1.7 V of Co SAs on a nitrogen-doped carbon support. Theoretical calculations disclose that the Co-Mo-3 coordination is responsible for the remarkably enhanced intrinsic catalytic capability. We showcase a disruptive pathway to anchor metal single atoms on 2D morphological carbides for enhancing electrocatalytic performance.									32	3	0	0	1	0	32			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521938400012

For technological applications, thin films of WO3 are particularly appealing, taking advantage from a high surface-to-volume ratio and tunable physical properties. However, the growth of stoichiometric crystalline thin films is challenging because the deposition conditions are very sensitive to the formation of oxygen vacancies. In this paper, we show how background oxygen pressure during pulsed laser deposition can be used to tune the structural and electronic properties of WO3 thin films. By performing x-ray diffraction and low-temperature electrical transport measurements, we find changes in the WO3 lattice volume of up to 10% concomitantly with a resistivity drop of more than five orders of magnitude at room temperature as a function of increased oxygen deficiency. We use advanced ab initio calculations to describe in detail the properties of the oxygen vacancy defect states and their evolution in terms of excess charge concentration. Our results depict an intriguing scenario where structural, electronic, optical, and transport properties of WO3 single-crystal thin films can all be purposely tuned by controlling the oxygen vacancy formation during growth.									15	0	0	0	1	0	16			2475-9953			WOS:000433037000002

The reaction is temperature-sensitive on all of the three catalyst surfaces at their respective overpotential ranges. The kinetic parameters (activation enthalpy (Delta H-#), free energy of activation (Delta G(#)), and preexponential factor (A(f))) toward HER are obtained from the Arrhenius and Eyring relations, and the overall kinetics on the catalyst surfaces is analyzed. Delta H-# for HER is a strong function of the overpotential in the case of both Pt and Pd. On the other hand, the trend in A(f) suggests that the electrocatalysis of HER on MoS2 originates from an increase in entropy factor, perhaps due to the solvent-dipole interaction at the interface. Such analysis is pivotal to the investigation of electrocatalysis of HER, especially on surfaces for which determination of active-site density is not established.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0743-7463			WOS:000822673100019	35364814

The morphology and crystal structure of the Ag3PO4/MoS2 composites were investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, specific surface areas, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Analysis results indicated that Ag3PO4 particles were distributed conformably on the surface of flower-like MoS2 spheres, and both formed an enhanced heterojunction structure. Fluorescence spectra, surface photocurrent spectra, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic results showed that an appropriate amount of MoS2 modification (6 mg) could effectively improve the generation, separation, and migration efficiency of the photogenerated electron/hole pairs (e(-)/h(+)). The photocatalytic activity of the samples was evaluated by photocatalytic O-2 production and photodegradation of the organic molecules under visible-light irradiation. With the increase in the amount of MoS2, the photocatalytic activity of the Ag3PO4/MoS2 samples increased first and then decreased. The photocatalytic rate reached the fastest when the mass of MoS2 was 6 mg, which was 7.66- and 9.28-fold of that of pure Ag3PO4 for pho-tocatalytic O-2 production and photodegradation of organic molecules, respectively. Sacrificial reagent ex-periments and electron spin resonance spectra showed that superoxide radicals (center dot O-2(-)) and holes (h(+)) played a major role in the photocatalytic reaction process. The enhanced photocatalytic performance could be ascribed to the interfacial optimization and formation of Z-scheme heterojunction. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Photocatalyst sheets comprising a particulate hydrogen evolution photocatalyst (HEP) and an oxygen evolution photocatalyst (OEP) embedded in a conductive thin film can realize efficient and scalable solar hydrogen production using Z-scheme water splitting. However, the use of expensive precious metal thin films that also promote reverse reactions is a major obstacle to developing a cost-effective process at ambient pressure. In this study, we present a standalone particulate photocatalyst sheet based on an earth-abundant, relatively inert, and conductive carbon film for efficient Z-scheme water splitting at ambient pressure. A SrTiO3:La,Rh/C/BiVO4:Mo sheet is shown to achieve unassisted pure water (pH 6.8) splitting with a solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency (STH) of 1.2% at 331 K and 10 kPa, while retaining 80% of this efficiency at 91 kPa. The STH value of 1.0% is the highest among Z-scheme pure water splitting operating at ambient pressure. The working mechanism of the photocatalyst sheet is discussed on the basis of band diagram simulation. In addition, the photocatalyst sheet split pure water more efficiently than conventional powder suspension systems and photoelectrochemical parallel cells because H+ and OH- concentration overpotentials and an IR drop between the HEP and OEP were effectively suppressed. The proposed carbon-based photocatalyst sheet, which can be used at ambient pressure, is an important alternative to (photo)electrochemical systems for practical solar hydrogen production.									246	10	0	0	15	0	245			0002-7863			WOS:000393355600052	28059504

This indicates that the anodic deposition of CuO takes place simultaneously with the oxygen evolution and the extent of participation of each reaction depends on the stability and structure of Cu(II)- amino acid complex, pH, electrode potential, etc. The grain size of CuO obtained in the presence of glycine, which was estimated from the diffraction peak of (110), was found to be smallest (12 nm) among those acquired with various amino acids, suggesting that the electrodeposition of CuO from Cu(II)-Gly solution leads to the formation of a denser film. Furthermore, it was revealed that the CuO prepared here possesses a property like a p-type semiconductor. The photoelectrochemical reduction of CuO to Cu2O was confirmed by analysis with X-ray diffraction. (C) 2002 The Electrochemical Society.									37	1	0	0	2	0	37			0013-4651			WOS:000178620700031

Here, using the Na+ de-intercalation/intercalation of a Na0.44MnO2 electrode as a redox mediator, we decouple the chlor-alkali process into two independent steps: a H-2 production step with the NaOH formation in the electrolyte and a Cl-2 production step. The first step involves a cathodic H-2 evolution reaction (H2O -> H-2) and an anodic Na+ de-intercalation reaction (Na0.44MnO2 -> Na0.44-xMnO2), during which NaOH is produced in the electrolyte solution. The second step depends on a cathodic Na+ intercalation reaction (Na0.44-xMnO2 -> Na0.44MnO2) and an anodic Cl-2 production (Cl -> Cl-2). The cycle of the two steps provides a membrane-free process, which is potentially a promising direction for developing clean chloralkali technology.									40	5	0	0	6	0	42			2041-1723			WOS:000423510600015	29382835

Firstly, multilayer films of polyethyleneimine (PEI) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) complex are generated using the layer-by-layer method by making use of the electrostatic interactions between the cationic polyelectrolyte and the negatively charged colloidal polymeric complex. Film assembly shows an exponential growth up to 10 bilayers, with a sharp increase in the amount of deposited material above 4 bilayers. While the electrical connection through the LbL assembled films up to 10 bilayers is efficient, optimal electrochemical performance of the modified electrodes towards the ORR in neutral solutions occurs for 4 bilayers, and then decreases gradually for 6 and 10 bilayers. Subsequently, in order to explore the effect of MOF inclusion on this architecture, Zn-based ZIF-8 nanocrystallites were deposited on the electrodes previously modified with LbL assemblies of 4-bilayers. The micro/mesoporosity, thus added to the films, resulted in an improvement in the ORR performance which can be understood by considering the already demonstrated ability of ZIF-8 for selective oxygen adsorption from solution. Furthermore, ZIF-8 inclusion does not interfere with the ionic transport through the composite film, which is crucial for efficient electrocatalysis. The hereby presented study exemplifies a simple approach for the fabrication and optimization of complex functional interfaces with improved activity towards ORR in neutral pH aqueous environments.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2633-5409		WOS:000706649500001

The change of morphology is evident using electron microscopy and by analyzing electrode pore size distribution with respect to discharge capacity. As a consequence, carbon electrodes with different textural properties exhibit different capacity enhancements in stirred-electrolyte cells. We demonstrate that mass transport can directly control the discharge mechanism, similar to the electrolyte composition and current density, which have already been recognized as determining factors.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000363683000014	26382302

Recent findings revealed that gas evolution also occurred in bulk-type solid-state batteries. To further clarify the effect that the electrolyte has on gassing, we report in this work-to the best of our knowledge-the first study comparing gas evolution in lithium-ion batteries with NCM622 cathode material and different electrolyte types, specifically solid (beta-Li3PS4 and Li6PS5Cl) versus liquid (LP57). Using isotopic labeling, acid titration, and in situ gas analysis, we show the presence of O-2 and CO2 evolution in both systems, albeit with different cumulative amounts, and possible SO2 evolution for the lithium thiophosphate-based cells. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering gas evolution in solid-state batteries, especially the formation and release of highly corrosive SO2, due to side reactions with the electrolyte.									35	1	0	0	2	0	34			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000535170300034	32275815	
J	Zhang, Junze; Wang, Hongning; Chen, Ruoyu								Reparation and Electrochemical Performance of Acetylene Black-Doped Ti-PbO2 Electrode with High Electron Transfer Rate								ECS JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				9	12					123012	10.1149/2162-8777/abd224				DEC 1 2020	2020	During the electrochemical preparation process, the electron transport rate in the PbO2 active layer could be greatly increased resulting from reduction in the oxidation of the Ti substrate, which effectively improved the service life and catalytic degradation efficiency of the PbO2 Dimension Stable Anode (PbO2 DSA) electrode. Through adding nano-acetylene black (ACET) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) into the plating solution, an ACET doped Ti/PbO2 electrode was successfully prepared via an anodic oxidation method. Results of field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), diffraction of X-rays (XRD), transmission Electron Microscope(TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization indicated that 2.10 similar to 2.75 wt% of ACET doping amount hardly changed the morphology and lattice constant of the PbO2 electrode. With electrochemical alternating current impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV), it confirmed that ACET reduced the charge transfer impedance (Rct) of the PbO2 electrode up to 95%, and restrained the potential of oxygen evolution reaction(OER). With the increase of electron transport rate, the generation rate of hydroxyl radicals (OH) on the electrode surface was enhanced significantly. Compared with the Ti/PbO2 electrode, the ACET-doped Ti/PbO2 electrode exhibited higher electrocatalytic efficiency to phenol degradation. During the degradation process, the consumption of time and energy could be reduced by 33% and 34%, respectively. At the same current density, the required voltage for preparing the ACET-modified Ti/PbO2 electrode was much lower. In the assistant of lower deposition voltage, the ACET-doped Ti/PbO2 electrode possessed a stronger binding force to Ti substrate, and meanwhile obtained a longer lifespan.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2162-8769	2162-8777		WOS:000605363400001

Enhanced Oxygen Evolution during Water Electrolysis at De-Alloyed Nickel Thin Film Electrodes								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				164	12			F1196	F1203		10.1149/2.1451712jes				2017	2017	Hydrogen as an energy carrier has tremendous potential to overcome globalwarming issues. In this respect, production of hydrogen by water electrolysis has already been intensively studied, but its efficiency, especially in terms of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), still needs to be improved. The objective of this work is to study the possibility of reducing the OER overpotential by de-alloying Ni thin film electrodes in order to favor bubble detachment. Ni(Al) alloys were first deposited by magnetron co-sputtering, and then chemically leached in a concentrated hydroxide solution with the aim of dissolving out the aluminum. We report X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy and roughness measurements to characterize our (de-)alloyed electrodes. Electrochemical testing, both cyclic voltammetry and chrono-potentiometry, has then been realized in a homemade electrochemical flow cell. Results show that different electrode compositions and intermetallic phases can be obtained by varying the deposition parameters, allowing to generate different Al/Ni atomic ratio's in the as-deposited films. Moreover, our de-alloyed electrodes present significantly lower overpotentials for the OER than untreated pure Ni electrodes. In the optimal case, a drop of as much as 140 mV was obtained at 10 mA/cm(2). (C) 2017 The Electrochemical Society.

However, the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia suffers from poor selectivity and low efficiency owing to constrained catalytic activity and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Spinel-type solid materials have received considerable interest owing to their various applications in catalysis, energy storage, and optical devices. Particularly, mixed transition-metal oxides with a formula of A(2)BO(4) exhibit improved catalytic activity owing to the presence of multiple balance sites for cations (A(2+/3+) and B2+/3+/4+) in their structure. In this study, Ni2GeO4 nanoparticles synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method were investigated as a novel electrocatalyst for the ENRR. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of octahedrally-coordinated Ni2+ and tetrahedrally-coordinated Ge4+ in the prepared spinel-type Ni2GeO4 material. Notably, the Ni2GeO4 electrocatalyst achieved an excellent Faradaic efficiency of 3.57% and an ammonia yield rate of 3.06 mu g h(-1) cm(-2) at -0.1 V vs RHE, owing to the enhanced charge transfer and chemical activity caused by charge polarization between the polyhedral units. The results of this primary investigation can inspire the development of Ni2GeO4-based electrocatalysts using innovative approaches to realize superior ENRR activity.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000711831300001

In this investigation, a highly porous cagelike zirconium metal-organic framework (Zr-MOF) was synthesized by the solvothermal method and used as the ORR catalyst in an air-cathode MFC. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed the successful synthesis of Zr-MOF having a high specific surface area of 858 m(2)/g. Cyclic voltammetry analysis demonstrated a sharp ORR peak current at -0.38 V having a current value of 11 mA compared to the negligible amount of peak current observed for cathode having no catalyst. The MFC having Zr-MOF-catalyzed cathode could translate a power density of 131.2 +/- 3.5 mW/m(2) at a coulombic efficiency of 29.04 +/- 1.54% from the organic matter present in wastewater; these values were comparable with the MFC having 10% Pt/C on cathode (128.7 +/- 4.9 mW/m(2) and 29.03 +/- 2.76%, respectively). The cost of energy production by the Zr-MOF cathode was estimated to be ca. 4.4 times lower than that by the 10% Pt/C cathode. The performance of MFC indicates that Zr-MOF could be an excellent alternative cathode catalyst, to the costly Pt/C, upon ambitious scale-up of MFCs.									31	0	0	0	9	0	31			2574-0962			WOS:000529190300046

A material-based strategy is the inclusion of an oxygen evolution reaction catalyst (e.g., IrO2) in the anode to promote water electrolysis over harmful carbon corrosion. In this work, an Ir-Pt/C composite catalyst with high metal loading is prepared. The membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) with 80 wt% Ir-Pt(1:2)/C shows a first reversal time (FRT) of up to 20 hours, which is about ten times that of MEA with 50 wt% Ir-Pt(1:2)/C does. Furthermore, the MEA with 80 wt% Ir-Pt(1:2)/C exhibits a minimum cell voltage loss of 6 mV@1 A/cm(2) when the FRT is terminated in 2 hours, in which the MEA with 50 wt% Ir-Pt(1:2)/C exhibits a voltage loss of 105 mV@1 A/cm(2). Further physicochemical and electrochemical characterizations demonstrate that the destruction of anode catalyst layer caused by the voltage reversal process is alleviated by the use of the composite catalyst with high metal loading. Hence, our results reveal that the combination of OER catalyst on the Pt/C with high metal loading is a promising approach to alleviate the degradation of anode catalyst layer during the voltage reversal process for PEMFCs.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In manganese systems, the key species is manganese(III), whose high-spin d(4) electronic configuration places an unpaired electron in the e(g) orbital, which is postulated to contribute to electronic and structural features that support catalysis. Based on density functional theory calculations, it is predicted that electron transfer would be facilitated by a catalyst with alternating low- and high-Mn-III-content sheets, which positions neighboring band edges in closer energetic proximity. The preparation of such catalysts is demonstrated for the first time and it is shown that the catalytic activity is maximized in these systems over more uniform, but more Mn-III-rich systems. The best catalyst possesses alternating high-and low-average oxidation state sheets with interlayer Cs+ ions, and has an overpotential of 450 mV at 10 mA, which represents an improvement of 250 mV over the best unmodified synthetic potassium birnessites. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, bandgap modulations consistent with the theoretically predicted band edge shifts are detected.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000702467700001

The elemental composition of the samples changes drastically during heat treatments, affecting mainly Pb, but Sr and Ca also. The identified crystallographic phases, by XRD, were the low T(c) superconducting ''2201'' (Bi2Sr2CuO6) phase, the high T(c) superconducting ''2212'' and ''2223'' phases, and the Ca2PbO4, Ca2CuO3, CuO, CaO, Bi2Sr3-xCaxOy, and (Ca, Sr)3Cu5O8 ''impurities'' compounds. A crystallization sequence from the amorphous state is proposed, involving a reaction at 800-degrees-C between ''2223'', CaO, Ca2CuO3, and Bi2Sr3-xCaxOy to form ''2212'' + Ca2PbO4 + CuO and a 2(''2212'') --> ''2223'' + ''2201'' disproportionation reaction that takes place with the intake of oxygen at a higher temperature. Decomposition of Ca2PbO4, which occurs also at high temperature, causes an increase of ''2212'', which favors the increase of ''2223'' through the disproportionation reaction. The glass transition starts around T(g) = 400-degrees-C, and the crystallization reactions from the amorphous state proceed in two steps, at T(x1) = 465-degrees-C and T(x2) = 504-degrees-C. The Bi2Sr3-xCaxOy ''2212'' and ''2223'' phases are among the first to crystallize as early as after a 1 h treatment (in air) at 488-degrees-C. A gain in weight is observed by thermogravimetry, caused by intake of the oxygen necessary for the formation of the high T(c) superconducting phases. The oxygen intake starts as early as 600-degrees-C. The T(c) onset for the ''2223'' phase is at 122 K, and at 85.5-degrees-C for the ''2212'' phase. Coefficients of thermal expansion have been measured and shown to differ according to crystallographic direction of expansion. The resistivity is increased on cooling, indicating semiconducting behavior of the 2223 BiSCO ceramic (semiconductor-to-metal transition temperature: 210-220 K).									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:A1993LZ66100004

Stabilization of the colloids with dextrated starch allows the process of hydroxide ageing to be stopped at the stage of the formation of primary nuclei (ca. 2-3 nm from transmission electron microscopy data). Molecular mechanics and dynamic light scattering studies indicate a core-shell type structure of the catalysts, where the hydroxide core is stabilized by the molecular starch network (ca. 5-7 nm). The colloidal catalysts are highly efficient in oxidizing water with one electron oxidant Ru(bpy)(3)(3+) at pH 7 to 10. The influence of pH, catalyst concentration, and buffer nature on the oxygen yield is studied. The maximal yields are 72, 53, and 78 % over Fe-, Mn- and Co-containing catalysts, respectively, and turnover numbers are 7.8; 54 and 360, respectively. The Cu-containing catalyst is poorly effective to the water oxidation (the maximal yield is 28 % O-2). The synthesized catalysts are of interest for stopped-flow kinetic studies of the mechanism of the water oxidation and as precursors for anchoring nanosized hydroxides onto various supports in order to develop biomimetic systems for artificial photosynthesis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000457714700010	30520572

Correlations between the effects of polyamines on protein secondary structure and on the rate of oxygen evolution in PSII are also established.									34	1	0	0	26	0	36			0014-5793			WOS:A1997WG10200011	9013855

For related Ni-based materials, the addition of Fe dramatically enhances OER activity. The role of Fe in Co-based materials is not well-documented. We show that the intrinsic OER activity of Co1-xFex(OOH) is similar to 100-fold higher for x approximate to 0.6-0.7 than for x = 0 on a per-metal turnover frequency basis. Fe-free CoOOH absorbs Fe from electrolyte impurities if the electrolyte is not rigorously purified. Fe incorporation and increased activity correlate with an anodic shift in the nominally Co2+/3+ redox wave, indicating strong electronic interactions between the two elements and likely substitutional doping of Fe for Co. In situ electrical measurements show that Co1-xFex(OOH) is conductive under OER conditions (similar to 0.7-4 mS cm(-1) at similar to 300 mV overpotential), but that FeOOH is an insulator with measurable conductivity (2.2 x 10(-2) mS cm(-1)) only at high overpotentials >400 mV. The apparent OER activity of FeOOH is thus limited by low conductivity. Microbalance measurements show that films with x >= 0.54 (i.e., Fe-rich) dissolve in 1 M KOH electrolyte under OER conditions. For x < 0.54, the films appear chemically stable, but the OER activity decreases by 16-62% over 2 h, likely due to conversion into denser, oxide-like phases. We thus hypothesize that Fe is the most-active site in the catalyst, while CoOOH primarily provides a conductive, high-surface area, chemically stabilizing host. These results are important as Fe-containing Co- and Ni-(oxy)hydroxides are the fastest OER catalysts known.									1261	40	0	0	70	2	1274			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000351420800034	25700234

ACS applied materials & interfaces				14	28			31792	31802		10.1021/acsami.2c03668				2022-Jul-20	2022	Quasi-solid-state flexible zinc-air batteries (FZABs) have received enormous attention due to their low cost and high safety. However, the constraints in lifetime resulting from the lack of stable quasi-solid-state electrolyte membranes and efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) hinder the large-scale manufacture and commercialization of FZABs to power electric devices. Herein, a polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based membrane (HPPANP) fabricated via facile coaxial electrospinning, water dissolution, lyophilization, and KOH preimmersion method was utilized as the quasi-solid-state electrolyte membrane. The interconnected hollow porous structure based on PAN nanofibers endows HPPANP with outstanding electrolyte-uptake/retention capabilities for high ionic conductivity and nanolevel wetted electrolyte/anode interface for uniform Zn dissolution/deposition, thus prolonging the lifespan of the FZABs. In addition, the in situ alkaline hydrolysis of KOH solution supplies HPPANP with abundant oxygen-containing groups, which also improves its ionic conductivity. Additionally, we synthesized a Co/N-doped hollow carbon sphere (CoN-CS) electrocatalyst that exhibits superior ORR and OER electrocatalytic activities with a low potential difference (DeltaE) of 0.73 V. Such favorable ORR and OER performances can be mainly attributed to the hierarchical hollow micro/nanostructures with abundant active sites, long-term stability, and favorable electron/ion diffusion pathway. As a result, the assembled FZAB equipped with the CoN-CS catalyst and HPPANP displays high power density (123.8 mW cm-2) and preferable long-term cycling performance (more than 50 h at 3 mA cm-2).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1944-8252		MEDLINE:35786825	35786825

In the past few years, a host of efforts have been made in the development of novel platinum nanostructures with a low amount of Pt because the scarcity and high price of Pt hinder its practical applications. Here, we report the preparation of PtCoFe@CN electrocatalysts with a remarkably reduced Pt loading amount of 4.60% by annealing Pt-doped metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The electrocatalyst demonstrated an outstanding performance with only 45 mV overpotential to achieve the 10 mA cm(-2) current density, which is quite close to that of the commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst. The enhanced catalytic capability is originated from the modification of the electronic structures of CoFe by alloying with Pt. The results indicate that robust and superstable alloy electrocatalysts which contain a very small amount of noble metal could be prepared by annealing noble metal-doped MOFs.									98	4	0	0	1	0	98			1944-8244			WOS:000393355900040	28078886

In this work, temperature-dependent CO2RR over Fe-N-C and Ni-N-C single-atom catalysts are investigated from 303 to 343 K. Increasing the reaction temperature improves and decreases CO Faradaic efficiency over Fe-N-C and Ni-N-C catalysts at high overpotentials, respectively. CO current density over Fe-N-C catalyst increases with temperature, then gets into a plateau at 323 K, finally reaches the maximum value of 185.8 mA cm(-2) at 343 K. While CO current density over Ni-N-C catalyst achieves the maximum value of 252.5 mA cm(-2) at 323 K, and then drops significantly to 202.9 mA cm(-2) at 343 K. Temperature programmed desorption results and density functional theory calculations reveal that the difference of temperature-dependent variation on CO Faradaic efficiency and current density between Fe-N-C and Ni-N-C catalysts results from the varied adsorption strength of key reaction intermediates during CO2RR.									22	2	0	0	0	0	22			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000715328800001	34651393

Thus, developing a highly efficient catalyst for the OER and replacing the OER with hydrazine oxidation (HzOR) are effective strategies for water electrolysis to achieve sustainable hydrogen production. Herein, bifunctional nanosheet arrays Ni0.6Co0.4Se with a porous structure were fabricated on Ni foam (NF) by the bubble dynamic template method during electrodeposition. Compared with CoSe2 and NiSe2, Ni0.6Co0.4Se exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for both the OER and HzOR. A low overpotential of only 249 mV is required to drive 10 mA cm(-2), and a retention rate of nearly 100% after 24 h at 10 mA cm(-2) is observed for Ni0.6Co0.4Se towards the OER. By substituting the OER by HzOR, an extremely high current density of 300 mA cm(-2) at 0.4 V vs. RHE and a retention rate of 86.8% at 200 mA cm(-2) after 12 h can be achieved. Interestingly, the mechanistic reason for the enhanced catalytic ability of Ni0.6Co0.4Se was studied, which is associated with the synergistic effects of Ni and Co, large ECSA, high electrical conductivity and most importantly the superaerophobic nature induced by the porous structure of Ni0.6Co0.4Se. The non-noble metal bifunctional electrocatalyst demonstrates a promising potential for application in both the OER and HzOR.									52	2	0	0	0	0	52			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000531408100019	32026923	
J	LUTZ, C; STEIGER, A; GODDE, D								INFLUENCE OF AIR-POLLUTANTS AND NUTRIENT DEFICIENCY ON D-1 PROTEIN-CONTENT AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN YOUNG SPRUCE TREES								PHYSIOLOGIA PLANTARUM				85	4			611	617						AUG 1992	1992	Long-term fumigation with different mixtures of air pollutants, such as O3, NO2 and SO2, in combination with potassium deficiency in 4-year-old spruce trees shows clearly that the photosynthetic apparatus reacts very sensitively to environmental stress. Even when no change in photosynthetic oxygen evolution of the leaves was measurable, the content of D-1 protein in the reaction center of photosystem II already increased significantly at low stress conditions. With increasing concentrations of pollutants, the content of D-1 protein decreased considerably. This pattern was observed with all combinations of gases, although they differed in effectiveness. The most potent effect on the content of D-1 protein was found with a combined fumigation of SO2 plus NO2. Obviously, the ratio between synthesis and degradation of the D-1 protein is influenced by stress factors. However, the content of D-1 protein was not strongly correlated with photosynthetic oxygen evolution in whole needles nor with electron transport rate in isolated thylakoids. Under controlled potassium deficiency, effects similar to those observed upon ozone fumigation developed. The results suggest unspecific stress answers for the D-1 content and the photosynthetic reactions rather than specific responses.									57	2	0	0	56	0	58			0031-9317			WOS:A1992JL67500008

The extremely low pK(a) value of -2.0 suggests that the electron density on the bridging oxygen atoms is very small. The asymmetric Mn-O-Mn vibration is observed at 670 cm(-1), while the symmetric Mn-O-Mn vibration is present at 702 cm(-1). The unusually high frequencies of these vibrations are due to the small Mn-O-Mn angle of 78 degrees. Protonation of an oxygen bridge shifts both the asymmetric and symmetric vibrations to 683 cm(-1). Electrochemical experiments in acetonitrile have shown that one-electron reduction of the complex is chemically irreversible. IR, EPR, and UV-vis studies of the reduced species suggest the presence of a (MnMnIV)-Mn-III(mu-O)(2)(mu-OH) core. pH-dependent differential pulse voltammetry experiments in aqueous solutions have revealed an apparent pK(a) value of approximately 4.0 for the reduced mixed-valence species in various buffer systems. The reduction wave at pH > 4 is observed at around -0.10 V vs SCE. Cyclic voltammetry has revealed that the reduced species is prone to reaction with carboxylate groups. A bis(carboxylate)mono-oxo-bridged Mn(III)-Mn(III) species is formed in citric acid buffer which exhibits an anodic peak around +0.6 V vs SCE, and a UV-vis spectrum that is typical of such a species.									44	1	0	0	2	0	45			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:A1995RY38400010

However, the ring-opening pathway has not been fully revealed, especially the effect of the surface species in plasma catalytic hybrid system. Herein, a series of Mn based catalysts (with the low Mn content of 1 wt %), Mn/ gamma-Al2O3, Au-Mn/gamma-Al2O3 and Ag-Mn/gamma-Al2O3, were used to clarify the mechanism of plasma catalytic toluene degradation by a closely combined temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Effects of plasma on surface oxygen species were investigated by a comparison study of O2-TPD and plasma-excited O2-TPD. A strong interaction between plasma and Ag-Mn/ gamma-Al2O3 could make better use of plasma-induced active oxygen species (i.e. O3, O*, O2* etc.) and considerably increase the amount of chemically adsorbed oxygen. Moreover, modified NH3-TPD experiments proved that O2 excited by plasma would greatly change the surface acidity of Ag-Mn/gamma-Al2O3, resulting in the desorption activation energy (Ed) of toluene increasing to 19.5 kJ/mol. Finally, possible ring-opening mechanisms over different catalysts were proposed after the evolution of typical intermediates being systematically analyzed by in situ DRIFTS. It was found that the toluene ring-opening reaction on different catalysts might be selectively started at hydroquinone. The present work could provide both a more detailed toluene ring-opening process and new insights into the understanding of the plasma exciting effect on the surface species in VOCs decomposition.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0959-6526	1879-1786		WOS:000863445200005

This paper reports an in-situ study of the oxygen bubble behavior and associated multiphase evolutions in the anode side of PEMECs with titanium (Ti) felt liquid gas diffusion layers (LGDLs) by a high-speed visualization system. The micro oxygen bubble dynamics was captured and analyzed at different locations and virous operating conditions. The results show that the bubble detachment frequency and detachment diameter greatly increase with the operating current density. Additionally, they are significantly impacted by the local pore structure and morphology of Ti felt LGDLs. In the flow channels, there exist only several discrete micro bubbles at a low current density (0.04 A/cm(2)) and a large flow velocity (133 mm/s). At a current density (0.2 A/cm(2)) and a flow velocity (67 mm/s), a number of gas slugs are formed in the follow channels, in addition to discrete micro bubbles. At a high current density (1 A/cm(2)) and a flow velocity (67 mm/s), more bubbles appear in the channel, and the flow field is dominated by slug or annular flows. These investigations can help to better understand the two-phase flow and bubble detachment mechanism, and provide a foundation for electrochemical reaction, multiphase flow studies and optimize the design of gas diffusion layers and flow fields for PEMECs in the future.

In a half-cell with three-electrode configuration, the initial polarization resistance, R-P, of GDC vertical bar SBCCF is 0.16 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C. Under an anodic bias of 200 mV, R-P decreases to 0.03 Omega cm(2); however, under cathodic bias of 200 mV, R-P increases to 0.18 Omega cm(2), indicating that SBCCF is more active towards oxygen evolution reaction than oxygen reduction reaction. During the electrolysis test under 1 A cm (2) at 800 degrees C for 216 h, R-P of GDC vertical bar SBCCF increases to 0.52 Omega cm(2) in the first 96 h and remains at 0.52 Omega cm(2) for the remaining 120 h. In contrast, R-P of GDC vertical bar LSCF increases with a rate of 0.08 Omega cm(2)/100 h at the same time. This result demonstrates that SBCCF is a promising candidate as air electrode in SOECs for stable operation under high electrolysis current, which is critical to achieve high hydrogen production rate and to lower the cost of the system. Effective methods for the improvement of the performance of SBCCF will be developed in future studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show that the chemical structure of OSB samples was dominated by aliphatic structures, with aliphatic carbon ratios of 0.54 and 0.58, respectively. The aromatic carbon structure exhibits a high degree of condensation, but a small number of rings. The structures with the most oxygen-containing functional groups consist of hydroxyl and aliphatic ethers. The sulfur-containing functional groups mainly consist of aliphatic sulfur, followed by aromatic sulfur. By studying the thermal evolution pattern of OSB functional groups at different temperatures, it was found that aliphatic structures form a large number of olefins and alkanes during pyrolysis. In contrast, aromatic structures undergo condensation reactions to form highly polymeric structures that are more difficult to decompose. Moreover, aliphatic sulfur is the main sulfur-containing functional group. It exhibits poor thermal stability and gets easily reduced during pyrolysis, which is more significant than aromatic sulfur. At the same time, only hydroxyl and aromatic ethers in the structure of oxygen-containing functional groups exhibit better thermal stability, even in OSB, at a final temperature of 500 degrees C. Based on the experimental research, the alicyclic structure was used as a "bridge" and the "archipelago" type molecular structure model of OSB was constructed. After energy optimization, the total energies of DBI and EBI were 6410.08 and 6028.55 kJ mol- 1, respectively.

The challenge lies in the development of strategies, which allow for systematic design of element combination and composition optimization in the multinary composition space. This challenge is accompanied by a lack of a suitable analysis method of experimental activity measurements, which can cope with the complex surface structure of this catalyst class. In this work, we propose the advantageous use of inflection points of voltammetric activity curves as activity descriptors enabling to correlate the potential of individual surface site groups to the respective peaks in the adsorption energy distribution pattern. This concept allows to methodologically gather information about the importance of each element in a CSS with respect to activity and stability of the relevant active sites and provides the basis for a guideline for systematic composition optimization. Further, the effect of phase stability on specific surface site groups as induced by degradation of the CSS phase or oxidation can be monitored. These concepts are experimentally evaluated using Cr-Mn-Fe-Co-Ni as a model system. Nanoparticles are synthesized with systematically varied compositions by means of scalable laser ablation synthesis using a multinary target. The composition is optimized with respect to the electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by varying its Mn content via laser ablation synthesis in ethanol. Subsequently, the concept is applied using rotating disk electrodes for ORR analysis in alkaline media.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			2155-5435			WOS:000618540300002

The activity of the platinum catalyst, toward the oxidation of hydrogen, is shown to be potential dependent and exhibits two peaks in activity. These peaks in activity are measured at both random arrays of platinum nanoparticles and at the single entity scale. This alteration in the particle activity is directly reflected in the variation of the electrochemical current. These peaks in current do not relate to a mass-transport limitation of the reaction, and at high overpotentials the oxidation reaction becomes fully inhibited. This potential dependency is revealed at high current densities and arises due to the sensitivity of the reaction rate to the platinum interfacial structure; the decrease in activity [at ca. -0.2 V vs Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl) in a nonbuffered condition] directly correlates with the potential at which underpotential deposited hydrogen is removed from the catalytic interface. The contribution of the internal mesoporous nanoparticle structure toward the total particle catalytic activity is further evidenced through comparison of the time-current transients recorded for individual nanoparticles of differing morphology (solid vs mesoporous) and by evidencing the sensitivity of the single particle catalytic activity to the used supporting electrolyte concentration.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000438475100056

However, the limited exposure of active sites and poor electrical conductivity of hydroxide powder restrict its application. Herein, bifunctional integrated electrode with a 3D hierarchical carbon framework decorated by nickel iron-layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) is developed. A conductive carbon nanowire array is introduced not only to provide enough anchoring sites for the hydroxide, but also affords a continuous pathway for electron transport throughout the entire electrode. The 3D integrated architecture of NiFe-hydroxide and hierarchical carbon framework possesses several beneficial effects including large electrochemical active surfaces, fast electron/mass transport, and enhanced mechanical stability. The as-prepared electrode affords a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 269 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M of KOH. It also offers excellent stability with negligible current decline even after 2000 cycles. Besides, density functional theory calculations revealed that the (110) surface of NiFe-LDH is more active than the (003) surface for OER. Furthermore, the electrode possesses promising application prospects in alkaline battery-supercapacitor hybrid devices with a capacity of 178.8 mAh g(-1) (capacitance of 1609.6 F g(-1)) at a current density of 0.2 A g(-1). The viability of the as-prepared bifunctional electrode will provide a potential solution for wearable electronics in the near future.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000468290000001	30965295

Extremely slow conductivity relaxation was observed below 973 K. This is attributed to slow water incorporation/evolution reaction. Unexpectedly, measured electrical conductivities increased with decrease in temperature at temperatures lower than 1023 K. Proton and oxide ion conductivities were deconvoluted from the total conductivity by simple defect-chemical analysis. At low temperatures, the actual proton conductivity was found to be several times higher than those reported. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It was found that alcohols can be produced under 3 MPa at 180 degrees C in the dark. Under light irradiation, the yield of alcohol increased 1.5 times, and the selectivity was maintained at the same temperature. Based on the XPS results, in situ H-2-pulse chemisorption and in situ diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), it is proposed that Co as an active site can adsorb CO catalysing hydrogenation reactions to produce alcohols. Under the irradiation, CeO2 generates photo-generated electrons and transfers them to Co, so that the electron-rich density of Co facilitates the adsorption and activation of CO. Moreover, the light also induces Cu to produce localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and excite hot electrons, which promotes the dissociation of H-2 and the regeneration of oxygen vacancies on the CeO2 surface. Both light-induced behaviors promote the Fischer-Tropsch reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2052-1553			WOS:000755747900001

Herein, we report a novel trifunctional electrocatalyst, N,P co-doped carbon nanotubes confined WN-Ni Mott-Schottky heterostructured nanoparticles (WN-Ni@N,P-CNT) via one-pot pyrolysis. Attributed to the WN-Ni Mott-Schottky hetemstructure, water dissociation and charge transfer at atomic level are accelerated; thereby, WN-Ni@N,P-CNT performs a Ptlike hydrogen evolution (HER) catalytic activity at high current density. Moreover, a superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity is also achieved for WN-Ni@N,P-CNT demanding 268 mV overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2), 52 mV lower than commercial IrO2; thus, merely 1.57 V is demanded to attain 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting in alkaline medium. Furthermore, half-wave potential for WN-Ni@N,P-CNT (0.84 V vs. RHE) is also similar to the benchmarked Pt/C. Owing to the superior ORR and OER activities, the power density of the assembled rechargeable ZAB outperforms Pt/C parallel to IrO2 by a factor of 1.8 (126.2 mW cm(-2) vs 71 mW cm(-2)). The exceptional battery performance is well-maintained after 330 h discharge-charge process due to the unique structure, in which Ni-WN hetero-nanoparticles are confined by N,P-CNT.									22	0	0	0	2	0	22			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000696929300002

In this work, a simple yet cost-effective strategy is proposed to etch and disperse graphene oxide (GO) and porous hollow carbon shell loaded with CoS2 (PHCS-CoS2) into a porous skeleton similar to "highway" to effectively "trap" graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) via a one-step process. Due to interconnected networks and size effects, N-S codoped porous graphene carbon sheets along with GOQDs (N,S-PGCS(QDs)) have eminent properties for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Furthermore, the metal-free system can be transformed to a metal-based electrocatalyst (N,S-PGCS(QDs)-Co1-xS/Co9S8) loaded with Co1-xS/Co9S8 nanohybrids, which demonstrates superior electrocatalytic characteristics than Pt/C + RuO2 in terms of half-wave potential (0.85 V), current density, methanol tolerance, the potential difference between E-ORR1/2 and EOER10 (0.68 V), and long-term stability. The Zn-air battery assembled with N,S-PGCS(QDs)-Co1-xS/Co9S8 shows a large peak power density of 168.2 mW cm(-2), a capacity performance up to 817.9 mAh g(-1), an ultra-high specific energy density of 973.3 Wh kg(Zn)(-1) and considerable durability. The findings above may provide a scalable synthetic guidance and a novel direction for the design of metal-free and metal-based electrocatalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, detailed density function theory investigations based on the first-principles calculations of high valence state Ti-/Ta-surface-doped LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 are reported. The migration of Ni/Mn ions is simulated into the surface structure of bare and Ti-/Ta-coated LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4. The calculation results suggest that Ti/Ta doping promotes Ni/Mn migration toward the formation of the rocksalt phase. Integrated net spin suggests that the valence state of transition metal ions, especially Ni, around Ti/Ta are slightly reduced in the fully charged state, resulting in a weakened surface oxidative property toward electrolyte. Both Ti/Ta doping and the consequent formation of the rocksalt phase not only stabilizes the oxygen frame of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 by forming stronger metal-O bonds but also suppresses the oxygen evolution during cycling. The stabilized anion frame of oxygen further mitigates the dissolution of Mn ions from the lattice into the electrolyte. These computer simulations are in good accordance with experimental observations. The surface structural stabilization mechanism of the high valence state cation Ti-/Ta-coated LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 can certainly be expanded to improve other cathode electrode materials.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			2196-7350			WOS:000436103900009

The preparation of these materials was carried out using the citrate method. The purity, the surface chemical state and the morphology were investigated by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photon-electron spectrometry (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. An iodometric titration was also performed to evaluate the oxygen (over)-stoichiometry. The catalytic activity of the La2NiO4 +/-delta (L2NO), La2CoO4 +/-delta (L2CO) and La2MnO4 +/-delta (L2MO) oxides towards ORR in alkaline medium was evaluated using the rotating disc electrode in 0.5 M NaOH solution completed by various electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, linear voltammetry, the Koutecky-Levich diffusion model and impedance spectroscopy. The La2NiO4 +/-delta sample is pure and more porous, but the La2CoO4 +/-delta and La2MnO4 +/-delta samples show secondary phases and are less porous. The XPS analysis shows that the surface of the La2NiO4 +/-delta material is rich in hydroxide ions (OH-) and the Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio is very low unlike La2CoO4 +/-delta and La2MnO4 +/-delta materials in which OH over bar are low. Porosity and percentages of OH over bar and B3+/B2+ ratio are parameters influencing the ORR mechanism and therefore favouring, for this purpose, a one-step mechanism on La2NiO4+delta and a two-step mechanism on La2CoO4 +/-delta and La2MnO4 +/-delta electrocatalysts.[GRAPHICS].									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1735-207X	1735-2428		WOS:000708346100001

These novel PTLs, fabricated with advanced manufacturing techniques, produce thin, tunable, multifunctional layers with reduced flow and interfacial resistances and high thermal and electric conductivities. To further optimize their design, it is important to understand their fundamental impact on the transport of protons, electrons, and liquid/vapor mixtures in the electrode. In this work, we develop a two-dimensional multiphysics model to simulate the coupled electrochemistry and multiphase transport in an electrolysis cell operated with the novel PTL architecture. The results show that larger pores improve access of water to the anode catalyst layer, which is beneficial for both the oxygen evolution reaction and membrane hydration. Larger pore sizes also improve oxygen gas transport from the catalyst layer, because generated oxygen gas is forced to travel in-plane through the anode catalyst layer until it reaches a pore opening that is connected to a channel. The discussed results confirm that the proposed thin foil based PTLs are fundamentally different from conventional PTLs, such as felts or layered meshes. The model developed in this work also provides generalizable insight into fundamental PEMEC phenomena, such as the compe-tition between liquid and gas phase transport, membrane hydration and water manage-ment, and nonuniform electrochemical reactions, which are processes relevant to all PEMEC designs.

Lithium titanate required for the study was synthesized in-house. Coupons of In-RAFMS were packed inside lithium titanate powder and heated at 550 degrees C up to 900 h under inert argon atmosphere. The lithium titanate chemically reacted with ferritic martensitic steel to form a brittle and non-adherent oxide layer. The layer grew in a parabolic manner as a function of heating time. Microstructural and phase evolution of this oxide layer was studied using XRD, SEM and EPMA. Iron and chromium enriched zones were found within the oxide layer. Diffusion of oxygen (from Li2TiO3) appears to be controlling the oxide layer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			0920-3796	1873-7196		WOS:000365055600058

On Surface Oxidation Issues Arising during CO Oxidation on a PdAu(110) Surface. An In Situ Study by Complementary Environmental Methods (STM, SXRD, XPS)								Microscopy and Microanalysis				27	S2			53	4		10.1017/S143192762101326X				2021	2021	Summary form only given. CO oxidation is generally performed with an excess of oxygen in the reactive gas mixture. Whether this is a low excess (O2/CO ratio in the 2 to 5 range often used in catalytic tests over realistic powder supported catalysts) or much higher excess (O2/CO ratio in the 10 to1000 range used in more model approaches) the question of surface oxidation and its role in the catalytic reaction is thus relevant. With these issue in mind, we have studied in situ the evolution and catalytic performance of the Pd70Au30(110) in CO oxidation by complementary surface science methods operating in quasi-realistic catalytic conditions (variable T and P gas): NAP-XPS and Environmental STM and SXRD. The STM is a modified, gold-plated, OMICRON instrument operated within a home-made vacuum/pressures ystem. The SXRD environmental system was developed by M.C. Saint-Lager et al to be operated in the ESRF BM32 beamline. Both systems are capable of operating over 12 decades of gas pressure (10-9-103mBar) and variable temperature. Two NAP-XPS systems were operated in gas pressures up to 20 mBar and variable temperature: one system is installed at ALS in beamline 9.3.2., the other system is installed at SOLEIL in beamline TEMPO. The Pd70Au30(110) (from SPL) is an unreconstructed Au-rich (~ 85-90%) surface under stable conditions after preparation cycles (ion bombardment followed by annealing). We have shown that upon exposure to CO, Pd segregates to the surface and the surface becomes rough (corrugation ~0.05 nm). In presence of oxygen, the surface reconstructs exhibiting a (nx2) structure ((1x2) with vacancies)and, as for CO, Pd segregates to the surface(Fig.1). Increasing the temperature and/or oxygen pressure eventually leads to oxidation of the Pd-rich surface. Under reaction conditions, for P(O2)/P(CO)ap10), NAP-XPS reveals that the reaction occurs in the presence of adsorbed oxygen species atthe surface but that the activity strongly decreases when oxidation of the surface appear sat higher T(Fig.2). In the case of P(O2)/P(CO)>>10, SXRD shows that an oxide strained layer (<10atomic layers) is formed(Fig.3) that is the active surface in such conditions. Surface oxidation and its role in the CO oxidation strongly depend on the reaction conditions and for a same system surface oxidation can be either noxious or the best option to the reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1435-8115			INSPEC:21613163

Herein, the first example of a promising MOCVD route for the direct fabrication of MoS2 and WS2 layers under moderate process conditions is reported. This straightforward route is successfully realized by the combination of metalorganic precursors of Mo or W bearing the amidinato ligand with just elemental sulfur.

Multiobjective Differential Evolution (MODE), which is an extension of Differential Evolution (DE) to multiobjective optimization, has been successfully applied to a few chemical process industrial problems. This article presents multiobjective optimization of p-xylene oxidation in the manufacturing process of industrial Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) oxidation using MODE, its improved strategy, i.e., Elitist-Multiobjective Differential Evolution (E-MODE), and NSGA-II. E-MODE algorithm includes the concept of elitism as present in NSGA-II. Four industrially important cases are studied from the multiobjective optimization point of view. The effect of six decision variables identified, namely, catalyst concentration, vent oxygen content, % water in solvent, feed xylene rate, temperature of reactor, and total feed rate, on the formulated objective function for the four cases is studied. The corresponding Pareto optimal sets (i.e., sets of equally good nondominated solutions) are obtained. All decision variables, corresponding to the Pareto optimal solutions, are plotted against each of the objectives. Comparison among the Pareto optimal fronts of four cases is also carried out. Pareto solutions obtained in this study (using MODE, E-MODE, and NSGA-II) lie on same (Global) Pareto front. However, MODE is able to cover a better range than E-MODE and NSGA-II. The results obtained are useful to a plant engineer for possible improvement in the process design decisions.									37	1	0	0	2	0	37			1042-6914	1532-2475		WOS:000263571800009		
J	Bisen, Omeshwari Yadorao; Nanda, Karuna Kar								Alkaline earth metal based single atom catalyst for the highly durable oxygen reduction reaction								APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY				21						100846	10.1016/j.apmt.2020.100846				DEC 2020	2020	Developing nonprecious group single-atom catalyst (SACs) based on alkaline earth metal has been rarely explored. Mg metal hampered the catalytic activity towards ORR due to the strong bonding of active centers with oxygenated group intermediate, whereas N-bonded Mg atoms have optimal bonding strength with intermediate oxygen species by adjusting the p-band center position. The co-ordination environment of Mg-Nx plays very crucial role in exhibiting the excellent catalytic activity towards ORR. We provide very simple MOF free methodology without any post acid treatment or any subsidiary sacrificial metal like Zn. The Mg-N-C catalyst exhibited a half-wave potential of 0.80 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, approaching the recently reported Fe-N-C catalyst. Electrochemical calculation further support the Mg-Nx sites as the origin of ORR via efficient 4-electron transfer pathway in basic medium. Importantly, current density is found to decrease less than 2% in diffusion limited current and loss of activity by only 13% at 0.9 V after 10,0 0 0 cycles in alkaline medium which far superior to the durability limit set by the US department of energy and overpasses the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. The charge transfer resistance is the crucial parameter influencing on the ORR activity along with (pyridinic N + pyrrolic N) content and degree of graphitization. This methodology can be applied to design a variety of other alkaline earth metal based M-N-C electrocatalysts and studied for various applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The shear strength of gold to-alumina joints with a silver layer bonded at 400 degrees C was comparable to that of conventional methods that require a high bonding temperature. Microstructural observations revealed that the adhesion of silver nano particles, which are formed by redox reaction, on an alumina surface improves the strength leading to the fracture of alumina. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis showed the direct bonding between silver and alumina at the interface without diffusion or formation of a reaction layer. Additionally, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis at the interface showed that the bonding of silver and alumina could be attributed to the silver-oxygen bond, which revealed that silver ions generated during the redox reaction could contribute to the bond formation. Further, molecular dynamics simulation confirmed that the presence of silver ions promotes the formation of an initial silver layer, which plays a role in bonding silver nanoparticles to an alumina surface. As mentioned above, it was found that a bonding method utilizing the reduction of silver oxide by reducing agent involves a significant, unique process that realizes metal-to-alumina bonding at a low temperature.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			0921-5093	1873-4936		WOS:000407983500043

Whereas the common approach of using metal overlayers introduces ligand effects in addition to strain, by electrochemically switching between the charging and discharging status of battery electrodes the change in volume can be precisely controlled to induce either compressive or tensile strain on supported catalysts. Lattice compression and tension induced by the lithium cobalt oxide substrate of similar to 5% were directly observed in individual Pt nanoparticles with aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy. We observed 90% enhancement or 40% suppression in Pt ORR activity under compression or tension, respectively, which is consistent with theoretical predictions.									376	23	0	0	32	0	382			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000388531800044	27885028

Synchrotron-Based In Situ Characterization of Carbon-Supported Platinum and Platinum Mono layer Electrocatalysts								ACS CATALYSIS				6	1			69	76		10.1021/acscatal.5b01862				JAN 2016	2016	A detailed understanding of oxidation/dissolution mechanisms of Pt is critical in designing durable catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but exact mechanisms remain unclear. The present work explores the oxidation/dissolution of Pt and Pt monolayer (ML) electrocatalysts over a wide range of applied potentials using cells that facilitate in situ measurements by combining X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurement demonstrated that Pt nanoparticle surfaces were oxidized from metallic Pt to alpha-PtO2-type oxide during the potential sweep from 0.41 to 1.5 V, and the transition state of O or OH adsorption on Pt and the onset of the place exchange process were revealed by the delta mu (Delta mu) method. Only the top layers of Pt nanoparticles were oxidized, while the inner Pt atoms remained intact. At a higher potential over 1.9 V, alpha-PtO2-type surface oxides dissolve due to local acidification caused by the oxygen evolution reaction and carbon corrosion. Pt oxidation of Pt-ML on the Pd nanoparticle electrocatalyst is considerably hampered compared with the Pt/C catalyst, presumably because preferential Pd oxidation proceeds at the defects in Pt MLs up to 0.91 V and through 0 penetrated through the Pt MLs by the place exchange process above 1.11 V.									67	5	0	0	4	0	69			2155-5435			WOS:000367706800008

Here, we report a facile and efficient spray impregnation strategy in enhancing catalytic activity of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (LSCF) due to the introduction of a multitude of homogeneous nanoparticles. With a highly active surface abundance in B-site cations, the modified LSCF cathode manifests an area-specific resistance (ASR) of similar to 0.140 Omega cm(2), only a fifth of that for a pristine LSCF cathode (similar to 0.764 Omega cm(2)) at 600 degrees C, and anode-supported fuel cells with the decorated LSCF cathode show markedly improved peak power densities (similar to 0.94 W cm(-2) at 700 degrees C). Furthermore, the ORR kinetics of the modified LSCF cathode can be further enhanced by impregnating Ni(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O and Co(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O solution again. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicates that the homogeneous nanoparticles alter the distribution of Sr-surface and O-surface. It is found that 'Co' decoration can effectively alleviate the surface aggregation of Sr and 'Co' and 'Ni' decoration play a pivotal role in the reactivation of electrode surface.

However, there is a grand challenge to engineer active sites at the interface. Herein, hierarchical transition bimetal oxides/sulfides heterostructure arrays interacting two-dimensional MoOx/MoS2 nanosheets attached to one-dimensional NiOx/Ni3S2 nanorods were fabricated by oxidation/hydrogenation-induced surface reconfiguration strategy. The NiMoOx/NiMoS heterostructure array exhibits the overpotentials of 38mV for hydrogen evolution and 186mV for oxygen evolution at 10mAcm(-2), even surviving at a large current density of 500mAcm(-2) with long-term stability. Due to optimized adsorption energies and accelerated water splitting kinetics by theory calculations, the assembled two-electrode cell delivers the industrially relevant current densities of 500 and 1000mAcm(-2) at record low cell voltages of 1.60 and 1.66V with excellent durability. This research provides a promising avenue to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of the catalysts by engineering interfacial active sites toward large-scale water splitting. While water splitting is an appealing carbon-neutral strategy for renewable energy generation, there is a need to develop new active, cost-effective catalysts. Here, authors prepare a nickel-molybdenum oxide/sulfide heterojunctions as bifunctional H-2 and O-2 evolution electrocatalysts.									160	4	0	0	13	0	161			2041-1723			WOS:000591379900004	33122636

The as-prepared square nanoplates have been proven to be of {001} crystal facets as two dominantly exposed surfaces. The density functional theory calculation and photo-deposition of noble metal experiment demonstrate the electron and hole separation on different crystal facets and reveal that {001} crystal facets are in favor of the reduction reaction. Since the square nanoplate structure exhibits dominant exposure surfaces of the {001} facets, the molten salt route-based samples basically possess an obviously higher photocatalytic activity than those prepared by the solid state reaction (SSR) method. This study may provide inspiration for fabricating efficient photocatalysts.									27	2	0	0	2	0	28			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000423355300040	29318248

In order to evaluate the degree of ceria dispersion on the carbon support, CeO2/AC was characterized by a number of techniques: thermogravimetry coupled with a mass spectrometer (TG-MS), N-2 adsorption at 77 K, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The analysis of the decomposition process under inert atmosphere indicated that cerium nitrate decomposes at 440-460 K, with the evolution of NO. Furthermore, this process produces an additional oxidation of the carbon surface (with evolution of N2O) and the subsequent onset of new oxygen surface groups, detected by means of temperature-programmed desorption. The ceria deposition process takes place with a decrease in the N-2 adsorption capacity of the starting carbon support, and the analysis of the pore size distribution showed that the majority of ceria particles are situated at the most internal part of the carbon porosity. The temperature-programmed reduction profile of CeO2/AC was very different to that shown by unsupported CeO2, with only one continuous reduction process at low temperatures (800-900 K). Finally, TEM pictures gave direct evidence that ceria is highly dispersed on the carbon surface, with a narrow CeO2 particle distribution centred around 3 nm. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper is focused on the isothermal kinetics of the overall reaction, and of CWF formation, at 850, 950 and 1050 degrees C. Different kinetics models were evaluated for the current data, and model-fitting techniques with linear regression analysis was applied. Microstructural analysis was carried out using SEM and EPMA to understand the evolution of product morphology and the reaction mechanism. The time series experiments and characterization results suggested the formation of CWF phase within 5 min of reaction and the formation of C2F (2CaO center dot Fe2O3) as a transient phase. Kinetic analysis suggested both the overall reaction and CWF formation could be described by Jander model. While there was good evidence for solid-state diffusion-controlled reaction mechanism, further study is required to establish the rate limiting step.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0301-9233	1743-2812		WOS:000472288900001

The present work deals with an effective strategy wherein an efficient Pt-free electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is prepared by stoichiometrically substituting some fraction of Fe with Zn in cobalt ferrite and anchoring these spinel nanoparticles on nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO). Zn substitution is found to be significantly altering the ratio of Fe2+/Fe3+ in the cobalt ferrite nanocrystal system with a concomitant promotional influence on its electrocatalytic activity towards ORR. The nanoparticle composition with a Co, Fe and Zn molar ratio of 1.0:1.7:0.3, represented by the formula CoFe1.7Zn0.3O4(CFZn(0.3)), supported over N-rGO has shown 10 mV and 20 mV positive shift in the onset and half-wave potentials, respectively, for ORR in 0.1 M KOH in comparison to the nanoparticles of CoFe2O4 supported over N-rGO (CF/N-rGO). The optimum Zn substitution is found to be narrowing down the difference with the state-of-the-art Pt/C for ORR by 100 and 110 mV in terms of the onset and half-wave potentials, respectively. Most significantly, the homemade catalyst is found to be clearly outperforming the Pt catalyst in terms of the limiting current density and electrochemical durability.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2365-6549			WOS:000411188600015

Unified reaction model of Si thermal oxidation								Bulletin of the Research Institute for Scientific Measurements, Tohoku University				47	1			29	52						1998	1998	The surface dynamics during growth and decomposition of initial Si oxide films were investigated by time-resolved ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and the depth profiles of structural defects in Si oxide films of ~1000 Aring in thickness upon annealing in vacuum and an oxygen atmosphere were investigated by angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Based on the experimental results that oxide decomposition occurs concurrently during oxidation and the decomposed species SiO can be oxidized in oxide films, we propose a unified reaction model of Si thermal oxidation in contrast with the Deal-Grove model in which no decomposition reactions are considered during oxidation. In the unified reaction model, Si self-interstitials and vacancies resulting from the point defect generation at the oxide/Si interface, play a key role in the simultaneous evolution of oxide growth and decomposition. The unified reaction model is successfully applicable to several cases of thermal oxidation phenomena which are difficult to interpret by the Deal-Grove model.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0040-8689			INSPEC:6270706

Here, we report a novel top-down route, which enables the scalable synthesis and deposition of sub-nanometer molybdenum-oxo clusters on electrically conductive mesoporous carbon. The new approach uses a unique redox-cycling process to convert crystalline (MoO2)-O-IV particles into sub-nanometer molecular molybdenum-oxo clusters with a nuclearity of similar to 1-20. The resulting molybdenum-oxo cluster/carbon composite shows outstanding, stable electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction with catalyst characteristics comparable to those of commercial Pt/C. This new material design could give access to a new class of highly reactive polyoxometalate-like metal oxo clusters as high-performance, earth abundant (electro-)catalysts.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000510929600012	34084360

However, the atomically dispersed metal atoms have intrinsically extreme mobility due to their high surface energy. Besides, the harsh reaction conditions of electrocatalysis also challenged the catalytic stability of SACs. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of SACs always degrades under long-term operating conditions. Most previous studies of SACs have focused more on the activity and selectivity of SACs in electrocatalysis, while catalytic stability has received little attention as a more critical factor limiting their large-scale industrial application. In this review, we provide an overview of the recent advances in SACs in terms of selecting the metal and support materials, synthetic strategies, and electrocatalytic applications with a focus on catalytic stability. A deep understanding of the instability behaviors of SACs under different electrocatalytic conditions contributes to the design of effective synthetic strategies to further optimize their catalytic stability, which is particularly discussed. Finally, we present the challenges and prospects for the future development of stable SACs in electrocatalysis.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000739565300001

In this work, graphene sheets were doped with abundant N atoms via radio-frequency N-2 plasma process and used as unique support to load ultrasmall iridium nanoparticles. As-synthesized Ir@N-G-600 shows excellent activity and stability toward HER and OER in both acidic and alkaline media. At much lower precious metal loading, it is superior to commercial Pt/C, RuO2 and Ir/C catalysts in terms of HER and OER activity, respectively. As a bifunctional electrocatalyst, Ir@N-G-600 enables efficient overall water splitting in acid and alkaline solutions. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity of Ir@N-G-600 is found to be tightly associated with the strong coordination between Ir atoms and N dopants, which enriches the electron density of Ir atoms to form an optimal electronic configuration for HER and OER processes.									15	1	0	0	1	0	16			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000644451300005

Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR), ideally in aqueous media, could potentially solve this problem by the storage of energy from renewable sources in the form of chemical energy in fuels or value-added chemicals in a sustainable manner. However, because of the sluggish reaction kinetics of the ECR, efficient, selective, and durable electrocatalysts are required to increase the rate this reaction. Despite considerable progress in using bulk metallic electrodes for catalyzing the ECR, greater efforts are still needed to tackle this grand challenge. In this Review, we highlight recent progress in using nanoengineering strategies to promote the electrocatalysts for the ECR. Through these approaches, considerable improvements in catalytic performance have been achieved. An outlook of future developments in applying and optimizing these strategies is also proposed.									109	8	0	0	5	0	109			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000429530400001	29569672

In this work, interface-rich Au-doped PdBi (PdBiAu) branched one-dimensional (1D) alloyed nanochains assembled by sub-6.5 nm particles have been prepared, exhibiting an ORR mass activity (MA) of 6.40 A.mg(Pd)(-1) and long-term durability of 5,000 cycles in an alkaline medium. The MA of PdBiAu nanochains is 46 times and 80 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C (0.14 A center dot mg(Pt)(-1)) and Pd/C (0.08 A.mg(Pd)(-1)). The MA of binary PdBi nanochains also reaches 5.71 A.mg(Pd)(-1). Notably, the PdBiAu nanochains exhibit high in-situ carbon monoxide poisoning resistance and high methanol tolerance. In actual DMFC device tests, the PdBiAu nanochains enhance power density of 140.1 mW.cm(-2) (in O-2)/112.4 mW.cm(-2) (in air) and durability compared with PdBi nanochains and Pt/C. The analysis of the structure-function relationship indicates that the enhanced performance of PdBiAu nanochains is attributed to integrated functions of surficial defect-rich 1D chain structure, improved charge transfer capability, downshift of the d-band center of Pd, as well as the synergistic effect derived from "Pd-Bi" and/or "Pd-Au" dual active sites.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000784879700001

We study the formation of hydrogen and oxygen as well as the reduction of oxygen on 14 transition metals embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene using density functional theory and find that the stability and the catalytic properties of the metals depend on the nitrogen content of the support. While previous studies focus on metal atoms inside nitrogen-free and fully substituted vacancies, we find that partially nitrogen-substituted single sites are significantly more active for later transition metals (groups 10-11). These sites are also more stable than previously suggested active-site models. Our findings suggest that stability and catalytic activity of late transition metals embedded in graphene could be increased by controlling the nitrogen content of the support to obtain partially substituted vacancy sites. For early transition metals, fully substituted vacancies represent the most active site.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000500028900024

Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of most intermediates and their time evolution suggest that the reductive pathways are important and even predominant under a variety of experimental conditions. This aspect is not only true at the beginning of the process or for the readily reducible structures, but also during the entire degradation process.Each compound of the series is converted to all the others, even though in widely different amounts. In the early part of the photocatalytic process, with nitrosobenzene and with phenylhydroxylamine, even in the presence of oxygen, the nitrogen substituent undergoes simultaneous oxidation and reduction at comparable rates, so that very little change in the mean oxidation state of the system is observed. This suggests that photogenerated electrons have a controlling role, particularly for some compounds in the early steps of the photocatalytic transformation. For 4-nitrosophenol and p-benzoquinone, in the early steps of degradation the reductive pathways represent the main route, even in the presence of oxygen. As a consequence, for some compounds the presence of an excess of oxygen in the reacting atmosphere decreases the degradation rate, instead of promoting it, as is commonly observed in photocatalysis. It is also remarkable that, for some compounds examined, the redox reactions at the nitrogen-containing substituent have a comparable or even more important role than the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring, which was the predominant degradation pathway for most of the other aromatic compounds.									54	0	0	0	16	0	54			0956-5000			WOS:A1997XC28700019

Lithium insertion and reactions with the electrodes during charge and discharge cycling can occur via metastable structures with complex ordering and related non-equilibrium phenomena. Remarkably, these processes remain still poorly understood despite their significance in the operation of lithium battery systems in critical technologies. In this communication, we present the dynamics of lithium insertion into Co3O4 and the evolution of metastable phases as probed by in-situ transmission electron microscopy, in concert with first principles density functional theory calculations. We show that the initial lithium intercalation reaction occurs with the formation of several metastable and intermediate phases, followed by a sequence of conversion reactions that perturb and expand the cubic-close-packed oxygen array, ultimately generating an end-product of finely dispersed cobalt metal clusters within a Li2O matrix. The calculated non-equilibrium lithiation pathways corroborate with the experimental lithiation voltages, and explain the significant hysteresis that occurs during electrochemical cycling. The data provide new insights into the complexity of solid state lithium electrochemistry in metal oxides that are relevant to advancing lithium battery technology.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000419833900003

Herein, a spontaneous construction of carbonyl-containing layer on a Zn anode (Zn@ZCO) is rationally designed as an ion redistributor and functional protective interphase. It has strong zincphilicity and dendrite suppression ability due to the significant interaction of the highly electronegative and highly nucleophilic carbonyl oxygen, favoring ion transport and homogenizing Zn deposition effectively. On the other side, the hydrogen bond formed by the proton acceptor of oxygen atom in ZCO regulates the Zn-ion desolvation process at the interfaces, thus bounding water activity and then mitigating water-induced parasitic reactions. Consequently, the Zn@ZCO anode exhibits an extended cycling lifespan of 5000 h (>208 days) with a dendrite-free surface and negligible by-products. More encouragingly, the effectiveness is also convincing in NH4V4O10-based full-cells with excellent rate performance and cyclic stability. The stabilized Zn anode enabled by the strategy of spontaneous construction of functional solid electrolyte interphase brings forward a facile and instructive approach toward high-performance zinc-storage systems.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000825276200001	35746854

However, the performance of TiN/NC cannot meet the practical application. To solve this problem, the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst can be improved by introducing the second metal element V. In this paper, a high-performance catalyst (TixV1-xN/NC/C) was prepared by supporting titanium-vanadium binary transition metal nitride nanoparticles on nitrogen-doped carbon. The experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the electronic, atomic and microstructure of titanium nitride nanoparticles can be properly tuned by introducing V ions, which is beneficial to tune the adsorption/adsorption of oxygen intermediates on titanium nitride nanoparticles and decreasing the potential of the rate determining step, thereby increasing the catalytic activity. The TixV1-xN/NC/C composite exhibits excellent ORR performance with an onset potential (E-onset) and limiting current density of 0.91 V (vs. RHE) and 4.90 mA.cm(-2), respectively. The Ti0.85V0.15N/NC/C-based Zn-air battery exhibits the power density of 124.78 mW.cm(-2), open circuit voltage of 1.34 V and high specific capacity of 731.38 mAh.g(-1). More importantly, this work has deepened the understanding of the TMN-based catalytic mechanism and paved the way for enhancing the catalytic performance of TMN-based catalysts.

This nanocomposite catalyst consists of the CdS quantum dots (QDs) decorated Ni3S2 nanosheet flowers deposited on the plasma-treated nickel foam (PNF). The NiO formed during the plasma treatment is shown to play an important role for pushing the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) in alkaline media. The enhanced exposure of active sites on the nanopetalages results in superior catalytic performance for promoting HER and OER in alkaline electrolyzers. Specifically, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) can be achieved for the HER with a 121 mV overpotential when the working electrode based on the 1 mM CdS/Ni3S2/PNF catalyst is employed in 1 M KOH. The corresponding Tafel slope is 110 mV/decade. For the OER, the onset potential can be as low as 1.25 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) reference electrode, which is substantially lower than the commercial IrO2 catalyst (similar to 1.47 V). This nanostructured catalyst has excellent long-term stability, and the linear scan voltammetry (LSV) curves of the HER and OER in 1 M KOH solution show negligible decay after undergoing 10(4) cycles of cyclic voltammogram. The nanocomposite material developed in this study is an ideal candidate as a catalyst for splitting water in alkaline media with relatively low overpotentials at reasonably high current densities (>= 100 mA cm(-2)).									63	4	0	0	3	0	63			1944-8244			WOS:000410597500029	28792729

Here, we report a Ni-2(dppm)(2)Cl-3 dinuclear-cluster-derived strategy to a uniform atomically precise Ni-2 site, consisting of two Ni-1-N-4 moieties shared with two nitrogen atoms, anchored on a N-doped carbon. By using operando synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we identify the dynamically catalytic dinuclear Ni-2 structure under electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, revealing an oxygen-bridge adsorption on the Ni-2-N-6 site to form an O-Ni-2-N-6 structure with enhanced Ni-Ni interaction. Theoretical simulations demonstrate that the key O-Ni-2-N-6 structure can significantly lower the energy barrier for CO2 activation. As a result, the dinuclear Ni2 catalyst exhibits >94% Faradaic efficiency for efficient carbon monoxide production. This work provides bottom-up target synthesis approaches and evidences the identity of dinuclear sites active toward catalytic reactions.									45	3	0	0	0	0	45			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000684586600006	34293258

The Gucheng pluton is exposed in the northern part of the North China Craton and forms a composite intrusion, consisting of K-feldspar-bearing clinopyroxenite, clinopyroxene-bearing syenite and alkali-feldspar syenite. Mineral phases in these lithologies include clinopyroxene (Wo(43-48)En(19-35)Fs(18-38)), sanidine (An(0)Ab(3-11)Or(89-97)), and subordinate titanite, andradite and Na-feldspar. These rocks show homogeneous Sr but variable Nd isotopic compositions, and have relatively high zircon in situ oxygen isotopes (delta O-18 = 5.2-6.7). The Gucheng plutonic rocks formed through fractional crystallization and accumulation from ultrapotassic magmas, which were originated from partial melting of metasomatic vein systems in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle of the North China Craton. These vein networks developed as a result of the reactions of fluids derived from subducted pelitic sediments on the downgoing Palaeo-Asian ocean floor with the enriched, subcontinental lithospheric mantle peridotites. Sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) U-Pb zircon dating has revealed a crystallization age of 415 Ma for the timing of the emplacement of the Gucheng pluton that marks the early stages of alkaline magmatism associated with the Andean-type continental margin evolution along the northern edge of the North China Craton facing the Palaeo-Asian Ocean.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			0016-7568	1469-5081		WOS:000604984400011

The reverse reaction, reductive cleavage of the dioxygen O-O bond, is performed at a variety of dicopper and di-iron active sites in enzymes that catalyze important organic oxidations. Both processes can be envisioned to involve the interconversion of dimetal-dioxygen adducts, M(2)(O-2), and isomers having M(2)(mu-O)(2) cores. The viability of this notion has been demonstrated by the identification of an equilibrium between synthetic complexes having [Cu-2(mu-eta(2):eta(2)-O-2)](2+) and [Cu-2(mu-O)(2)](2+) cores through kinetic, spectroscopic, and crystallographic studies.									462	5	0	0	52	0	463			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:A1996TY96100040	8596910

J	Wang, Y; Sridhar, S								Reoxidation on the surface of molten low-carbon aluminum-killed steel								STEEL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL				76	5			355	361		10.1002/srin.200506022				MAY 2005	2005	The unwanted formation of oxide on the surface of molten steel is a process that plagues virtually all grades of steel and often results in unacceptable defect distributions in the finished product. The kinetic rates of the reaction remain largely unknown due to the difficulties in experimental measurements at high temperature involving reactive molten melts. This paper presents recent experimental work and analysis of oxide evolution on the surface of Al-killed steel melts at oxygen partial pressures of PO2= 1-5 x 10(-5)atm, by using a Confocal Scanning Laser Microscope (CSLM) equipped with a gold image furnace. The effects of gas flow rate (170-300 cm(3)/min) and temperature (1580-1630&DEG; C) were investigated. The oxide phase formed on the melt surface was in all cases Al2O3 but not the thermodynamically stable FeAl2O4. It was found, under the range of experimental conditions in this study, that the rate controlling mechanism for oxide nucleation and growth was gas phase mass transfer of oxygen to the melt surface. The morphology of the oxide changed gradually from distinctly dendritic at low gas flow rates to aggregates as the flow rate was increased.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			1611-3683			WOS:000229541900003

Herein, the high density pyridinic-N doped graphene-nanotube complexes with hierarchical networks (denoted NGT(B)) are fabricated based on a facile and efficient two-step control synthetic strategy using urea as the nitrogen source and boric acid (H3BO3) as the splicing agent. These controls and manipulations can significantly enhance the connection between the few-layer graphene and carbon nanotubes and create abundant defects that affect the electronic structure of the carbon matrix and contribute to the oriented synthesis of the desired pyridinic-N species. The derived NGT(B)-900 displays the excellent performance for catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and energy storage. The liquid zinc-air battery (ZAB) using NGT(B)-900 as the cathode catalyst affords a higher open-circuit voltage (1.54 V), power density (149 mW cm(-2)), and specific capacity (873 mAh g(ZN)(-1)), as well as excellent cycling stability over the noble- metal counterparts (Pt/C; Pt/C + IrO2). This work provides an effective strategy for taking advantage of the abundant and low-cost resources to construct the highly efficient multifunction carbon-based materials for promising the large scale development of the renewable energy conversion and storage technologies.									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			2168-0485			WOS:000553241400013		
J	Seitenzahl, I.; Townsley, D.								Nucleosynthesis in thermonuclear supernovae [arXiv]								arXiv								23 pp.	23 pp.						2 April 2017	2017	The explosion energy of thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae is derived from the difference in nuclear binding energy liberated in the explosive fusion of light ldquofuelrdquo nuclei, predominantly carbon and oxygen, into more tightly bound nuclear ldquoashrdquo dominated by iron and silicon group elements. The very same explosive thermonuclear fusion event is also one of the major processes contributing to the nucleosynthesis of the heavy elements, in particular the iron-group elements. For example, most of the iron and manganese in the Sun and its planetary system was produced in thermonuclear supernovae. Here, we review the physics of explosive thermonuclear burning in carbon-oxygen white dwarf material and the methodologies utilized in calculating predicted nucleosynthesis from hydrodynamic explosion models. While the dominant explosion scenario remains unclear, many aspects of the nuclear combustion and nucleosynthesis are common to all models and must occur in some form in order to produce the observed yields. We summarize the predicted nucleosynthetic yields for existing explosions models, placing particular emphasis on characteristic differences in the nucleosynthetic signatures of the different suggested scenarios leading to Type Ia supernovae. Following this, we discuss how these signatures compare with observations of several individual supernovae, remnants, and the composition of material in our Galaxy and galaxy clusters.									0	0	0		0	0	0						INSPEC:16979331

Electrocatalysts are inherently optimized for application towards reactions of interest in renewable energy, such as those involved in water splitting and artificial photosynthesis, owing to its energy efficiency, simple fabrication, and ease of operation. In this view, it is important to secure logical design principles for the synthesis of electrocatalysts for various reactions of interest, and also understand their catalytic mechanisms in the respective reactions for improvements in further iterations. In this review, we introduce several key methods of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) in its applications towards electrocatalysis. A brief history and a handful of seminal works in the SECM field is introduced in advancing the synthetic designs of electrocatalysts and elucidation of the operating mechanism. New developments in nano-sizing of the electrodes in attempts for improved spatial resolution of SECM is also introduced, and the application of nanoelectrodes towards the investigation of formerly inaccessible single catalytic entities is shared.

Although nonprecious catalysts exhibit high electrocatalytic activity at low current density (10-50 mA cm(-2)), it is still challenging to achieve industrially required current density over 500 mA cm(-2) due to inefficient electron transport and competitive adsorption between hydroxyl and water. Herein, the authors design a novel metallic heterostructure based on nickel nitride and monoclinic molybdenum disulfide (Ni3N@2M-MoS2) for extraordinary water electrolysis. The Ni3N@2M-MoS2 composite with heterointerface provides two kinds of separated reaction sites to overcome the steric hindrance of competitive hydroxyl/water adsorption. The kinetically decoupled hydroxyl/water adsorption/dissociation and metallic conductivity of Ni3N@2M-MoS2 enable hydrogen production from Ni3N and oxygen evolution from the heterointerface at large current density. The metallic heterostructure is proved to be imperative for the stabilization and activation of Ni3N@2M-MoS2, which can efficiently regulate the active electronic states of Ni/N atoms around the Fermi-level through the charge transfer between the active atoms of Ni3N and Mo-Mo bonds of 2M-MoS2 to boost overall water splitting. The Ni3N@2M-MoS2 incorporated water electrolyzer requires ultralow cell voltage of 1.644 V@1000 mA cm(-2) with approximate to 100% retention over 300 h, far exceeding the commercial Pt/CRuO2 (2.41 V@1000 mA cm(-2), 100 h, 58.2%).									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000744631900001	34969159

To investigate its electrocatalytic activity for H-2 evolution reaction, a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was modified with Rh-0/CeO2. The modified electrode was found to exhibit a high electrocatalytic activity (turnover frequency (TOF): 1.56 s(-1) at j = 100 mA.cm(-2)) with a small Tafel slope of 34 mV.dec(-1). Moreover, a high exchange current density of 0.527 mA.cm(-2) and low overpotential of 42 mV at j = 10 mA.cm(-2) were also obtained using Rh-0/CeO2-GCE. There is no noticeable change in the Tafel slope and eta(10) values even after 10000 cyclic scans in acidic environment at room temperature, which makes Rh-0/CeO2 on GCE highly durable and long lived electrocatalyst for water splitting.

J	Yoon, S.-C.; Podsiadlowski, Ph.; Rosswog, S.				Rosswog, Stephan/G-6211-2018				Remnant evolution after a carbon-oxygen white dwarf merger								MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY				380	3			933	948		10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12161.x				SEP 21 2007	2007	We systematically explore the evolution of the merger of two carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs. The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 M circle dot + 0.6 M circle dot CO white dwarf merger is followed by a 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation. The calculation uses a state-of the-art equation of state that is coupled to an efficient nuclear reaction network that accurately approximates all stages from helium burning up to nuclear statistical equilibrium. We use an elaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent, unless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than earlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central region of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium, be approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a slowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a centrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that mimics the results of the SPH simulation using a 1D hydrodynamic stellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution, where we include the effects of rotation on the stellar structure and the transport of angular momentum. The influence of the Keplerian disc is implicitly treated by considering mass accretion from the disc on to the hot envelope. The stellar evolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by neutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and that carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective accretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion of cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double CO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Specifically we find that off-centre carbon ignition, which would eventually lead to the collapse of the remnant to a neutron star, can be avoided if the following conditions are satisfied. (1) When the merger remnant reaches quasi-static equilibrium, the local maximum temperature at the interface between the core and the envelope must be lower than the critical limit for carbon ignition. (2) Angular momentum loss from the central merger remnant should not occur on a time-scale shorter than the local neutrino cooling time-scale at the interface. (3) The mass accretion rate from the centrifugally supported disc must be sufficiently low (M less than or similar to 5 x 10(-6) to 10(-5) M circle dot yr(-1)). Our results imply that at least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good candidates for the progenitors of Type la supernovae. In this case, the characteristic time delay between the initial \dynamical merger and the eventual explosion would be similar to 10(5) yr.									203	7	0	0	1	0	204			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000249844900006

The kinetics parameters such the transfer coefficients alpha and beta and the reaction rate constant k(0) were calculated. Oxygen evolution and oxidation of organic compounds were investigated on both BDD and BDD/IrO2 electrodes by voltammetric measurements and preparative electrolysis.

The two phases of the heterojunction can be adjusted simultaneously by doping sulfur and oxygen to achieve a suitable energy band structure. Herein, we demonstrated a Mo(S,O)/Co(O,S) Z-scheme heterojunction catalyst system (abbreviated as MoCoOS) with different Co(O,S) doping amounts by a simple one-step method. Doping of different atoms in the crystal changes the energy band structure which tunes the optical, electrical, and electrochemical properties of MoCoOS. MoCoOS-2 prepared at a Co precursor content of 20 mmol performed the best at a rate of 153.4 mu mol h(-1) in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, and it also showed excellent catalytic activities and good stability in reducing MO, MB, RhB, 4-NP and Cr6+. This efficient MoCoOS-2 catalyst can have practical applications in photocatalytic hydrogen production and catalytic reduction of chemical pollutants.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000754763100001		
J	Du, Xiaoqiang; Wang, Qibin; Zhang, Xiaoshuang								Controllable synthesis of NiO/Ni3S2 hybrid arrays as efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting								NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				42	22			18201	18207		10.1039/c8nj04446e				NOV 21 2018	2018	It is significant to develop economically cheaper, more environmentally friendly bifunctional electrocatalysts for both water reduction reaction (WRR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR). In this paper, a NiO/Ni3S2 core-shell hybrid directly grown on nickel foam is constructed using a simple two-step hydrothermal and sulfuration method. When the NiO/Ni3S2/NF electrode is first tested as a catalyst, it reveals a high catalytic activity and durability for WOR. The smaller overpotential of only 270 mV obtained at 30 mA cm(-2) is better than the benchmark of precious metal RuO2 materials (410 mV @ 30 mA cm(-2)), benefiting from the unique hierarchical structure of NiO/Ni3S2/NF with more active sites and fast electron transfer. Moreover, the NiO/Ni3S2/NF electrode also exhibits a fairly good WRR performance compared with the individual NiO/NF and NF electrodes, showing a smaller overpotential of only 130 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). In addition to this, a very low cell voltage of 1.59 V is obtained at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, when NiO/Ni3S2/NF is also tested as a bifunctional water splitting electrode. The experimental results indicate that the oxide/sulfide-based catalysts could serve as an ideal electrode candidate and bring the superiority of a synergistic strategy into full play, which offers a new idea toward the development of efficient and environmentally friendly water splitting electrochemical electrode materials.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000452672700040

After distinguishing discharge mode by experiments, absolute value of n(Og) under different heating powers/gas pressures were measured. Increasing the heating power in discharges with a total gas pressure of 10, 60 and 80 Pa leads to E -> H transition at 0.5, 1.1 and 1.3 kW, respectively. When pressure increased in 10-80 Pa, 0.1 and 2 kW plasmas maintained in E and H mode respectively, and 1 kW plasmas experienced H -> E transition at 60 Pa n(Og) in H-modes were one order of magnitude larger than E-mode. The power-pressure composed mode transition boundaries were obtained through measuring n(Og). Spatial distribution of n(Og) showed that spatial difference of H-mode was more obvious than E-mode. By 0.1 mm spatial resolution TALIF measurement, density gradients of rear 5 mm region in H-mode are one order of magnitude larger than E-mode. These results provide references for processing parameter selection. High spatial resolution TALIF measurement will contribute key technology for acquiring important parameters of surface reactions.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			0042-207X			WOS:000467510900016

The evolution of BaSnO3 phase with temperature and effect of La doping was investigated. Doping of La increased the lattice parameter from 4.1165 to 4.1208 angstrom, up to solubility limit (x = 0.1); doping further, secondary phase La2Sn2O7 appeared. BaSnO3 phase crystallization initiated at similar to 528 degrees C from the reaction of BaCO3 and SnO2 and was retarded by La doping causing an increment in phase formation temperature from 528.4 to 531.1 degrees C. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy evidence substantial increment in (SnO3)(2-) absorption band with temperature strengthening diffraction responses. An incremental response in the electrical conductivity was observed by La doping with a maximum value of similar to 25 S cm(-1), attributed to the generation of charge carriers by substitution of Ba with La ion and oxygen vacancies. In parallel, generated charge carriers also contributed towards the ionic reduction of Sn4+ to Sn2+ aiding the lattice enhancement. La-doped BaSnO3 ceramics can have a potential application in optoelectronic, thermoelectric devices and humidity sensors.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000482244200087

Combined with pyroxenes falling in the area of subalkaline series in the w(SiO_2)-w(Al_2O_3) diagram and pyroxenes dominantly plotted in the area of tholeiite series in the w(Al_2O_3)-w(Na_2O)-w(TiO_2) diagram, the authors hold that the magma in this area has experienced the evolution trend of tholeiite series. The olivines from phlogopite pyroxenes peridotite display low w(FeO) content ranging from 19.22% to 23.79% and high w(MgO) content ranging from 37.35%~41.30%, as well as variable Fo of 0.74~0.79. The lower w(FeO) content in olivine indicates that it was formed under a higher oxygen fugacity condition; however, the evolution trend of tholeiie series of magma generally occurred under the low oxygen fugacity condition, which suggests that magma underwent a process from low oxygen fugacity to high oxygen fugacity. With the evolution of magma, the relationship between Fo and w(Ni) in olivine changed from negative correlation to positive correlation and then to negative correlation. The negative correlation between Fo and w(Ni) indicates that olivine might have experienced Ni-Fe exchange reaction with intergranular sulfide melt during the magmatic evolution. On the other hand, it can be considered that the magma was rich in sulfur, and the high sulfur feature in the magma seems to be probably one of the reasons why the magnetite from the ore district is pure magnetite (low Ti). In addition, the ore-forming magma had the characteristics of high oxygen fugacity, thus the solid solution separation caused by the oxidation exsolution under the subsolidus condition and the occurrence of iron-phosphorus complex seem to be the reasons that the magnetite in the mining area is relatively pure magnetite (the composition is close to the molecular formula Fe_3O_4). Phlogopite pyroxene peridotites and iron ores both contain phlogopites, indicating that the sources of iron ores and mafic-ultramafic rocks were all volatile-rich. There are four kinds of Fe-Ti oxides in this area, i.e., pure magnetite, titanochrome magnetite, chromite and ilmenite. The composition of the relatively pure magnetite (low Ti) from phlogopite pyroxenes peridotite is similar to that of magnetite from iron ore, indicating that there is a genetic link between them. The analysis of the microscopic characteristics of phlogopite pyroxene peridotite suggests that there was addition of iron- and magnesium-rich magma to the ore-forming magma, which probably provided the main source of iron for the Beizhan iron deposit.			文章对备战铁矿区内的基性-超基性岩、中基性岩脉、矿体围岩和铁矿石中的辉石、橄榄石、金云母、铁钛氧化物进行了电子探针分析与显微特征研究。金云母辉石橄榄岩中辉石的化学成分在w(SiO_2)-w(Al_2O_3)图中均落于亚碱性系列区域,在w(Al_2O_3)-w(Na_2O)-w(TiO_2)图中,辉石主要落在拉斑玄武岩系列区域,表明该区岩浆经历了拉斑玄武岩系列演化。备战金云母辉石橄榄岩中橄榄石的w(FeO)较低,介于19.22%~23.79%,w(MgO)较高,介于37.35%~41.30%,Fo变化介于0.74~0.79,属于贵橄榄石。橄榄石中较低的w(FeO)表明其形成于较高的氧逸度环境,而岩浆的拉斑玄武岩系列演化一般发生于低氧逸度条件,综合分析岩浆经历了从低氧逸度到高氧逸度变化的过程。随着岩浆的演化,橄榄石Fo与w(Ni)由负相关变为正相关又变为负相关关系,其中负相关关系表明在岩浆演化过程中橄榄石与粒间硫化物熔浆发生过Ni-Fe交换反应,从另一方面可以认为岩浆中含有丰富的硫,岩浆中的高硫特征很可能是备战磁铁矿为较纯磁铁矿(低Ti)的原因之一。此外,成矿岩浆具有高氧逸度特征,铁钛氧化物固溶体在亚固相条件下的氧化作用使固溶体发生分离以及铁磷络合物的发育等因素是造成矿区磁铁矿为较纯磁铁矿(成分接近分子式Fe_3O_4)的原因。金云母辉石橄榄岩和铁矿石中均发育金云母,表明铁矿与基性-超基性岩的源区都是富含挥发分的。该区铁钛氧化物主要有4种:较纯磁铁矿、含钛铬磁铁矿、铬铁矿、钛铁矿。金云母辉石橄榄岩中的较纯磁铁矿(低Ti),与铁矿石中磁铁矿成分类似,表明两者具有成因联系。结合金云母辉石橄榄岩的显微特征分析,在岩浆阶段曾有一期富铁镁岩浆的加入,这很可能为备战铁矿的形成提供了主要的铁质来源。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0258-7106			CSCD:6746979

Herein, we report a simple inkjet printing technology for the large-scale synthesis of a series of transition metal phosphide (TMP) nanoparticles encapsulated in N, P co-doped carbon supported on carbon fiber cloth (CF@NPC-TMP, TM = Mo, Co, Ni, Fe) as highly efficient hydrogen evolution cathodes using ionic liquids as phosphorus and carbon sources. The in-situ carbon nanolayers derived from ionic liquids not only expose abundant catalytically active sites and allow rapid electron transport to the catalytically active sites during HER but also effectively prevent the TMP nanoparticles from corroding to enhance their stability. All the as-prepared CF@NPC-TMP electrodes show ideal electrocatalytic performance for HER. Especially, the CF@NPC-MoP electrode only requires overpotentials of 87 and 145 mV to drive cathodic current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 0.5M H2SO4, respectively. In addition, this electrode continuously operates at a constant current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for 20 h with negligible rise in operating potential. The resultant CF@NPC-TMP electrodes also show ideal electrocatalytic activities toward HER in alkaline and neutral media. Hence, the synthesis strategy developed in this study may spark interest in research on TMP-based nanomaterials for various applications.									59	8	0	0	2	0	61			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000440682100025

Structure characterization, including XRD, SEM, IR, and XPS, indicated minimal effect of H2O2 dipping on phase structure and grain size, while revealed a chemical reaction between H2O2 and the surface of CST. Electrical properties of the grain region remained unchanged after treatment, while the grain boundary region was sensitive to H2O2 dipping, due to faster diffusion rate of oxygen vacancies in grain boundary region. In addition to that, the bulk insulating properties was found to be dominated by grain boundaries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000538236300002

The fabricated Au@LDH/RGO composite was well characterized by different analytical instruments like PXRD, FTIR, Raman, XPS, EDX, FESEM, and TEM, suggesting strong interaction between the components of the ternary hybrid. Further, the Au@LDH/RGO catalyst shows the best hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), i.e., 918.76 mu mol/2 h (no. evolved H-2 gas is 4.9903 x 10(15) cm(-2) s(-1)) with an ACE of 10.5% and excellent reusability up to 8 h with little change in activity. Additionally, the ternary nanohybrid depicts robust photocatalytic O-2 reduction reaction performance, i.e., 24.3 mu mol/2 h of H2O2 (SCC = 0.23%), which goes via a superoxide radical mechanism as confirmed through tracing experiments. The observed high photocatalytic activity is attributed to the synergetic effect of both plasmonic Au nanoparticles and conjugated pi-skeleton of RGO, which resulted in high charge carrier density and reduction of the recombination process. This observation is well justified by Mott-Schottky, EIS, PL, and photocurrent measurements. Further, the HER performance was also tested under different hole scavengers to figure out their effect. The SPR effect of Au and conjugated cyclic carbon network of RGO plays a pivotal part in improving the H-2 and H2O2 generation ability of LDH under visible light illumination.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2052-1553			WOS:000739863900001

However, the luminescence efficiency of metal NCs is too low to meet the needs of trace analysis, which limits its application. Herein, Ag NCs served as signal probes and Pd-Cu2O hybrid nanoconcaves served as coreaction promoters, developing a highly efficient peptide-based biosensor for neuron-specific enolase (NSE) detection. Utilizing the reversible cycle of Cu+/Cu2+ and the reduction characteristics of Pd NPs, Pd-Cu2O greatly accelerates the reduction of S2O82-. Meanwhile, Pd-Cu2O has good hydrogen evolution activity, which promotes the generation of oxygen by improving the redox efficiency of the overall reaction, thus increasing the yield of active intermediates (OH center dot) to promote the reduction of S2O82-. Specially, this is an effective attempt to use the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to accelerate the ECL emission of the S2O82- system. In addition, a short peptide ligand (NARKFYKGC, NFC) was developed to implement the targeted immobilization of antibodies, which can specifically bind to the Fc fragment of antibodies, thereby avoiding the occupation of the antigen binding site (Fab fragment). The introduction of NFC not only improves the binding efficiency of antibodies but also protects its bioactivity, thus significantly improving the sensitivity of the biosensor. Based on these strategies, the proposed biosensor provides a new perspective for the applications of metal NCs in ECL systems.									9	0	0	0	2	0	8			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000703526400031	34523922

However, owing to the presence of non-O-2 components in ambient air, the practical performance of Li-air batteries is limited to only a few cycles with low energy efficiency. In particular, when CO2 is incorporated into the battery system, Li2CO3 is formed during discharging, which results in serious climbing of the charge potential and subsequent decomposition of the cell components. Herein, by introducing an appropriate electrolyte into an aggregated contact ion pair (CIP) structure, we demonstrate a Li-O-2/CO2 battery, via formation of stabilized peroxodicarbonate (C2O62-) rather than Li2CO3 in the electrolyte, that operates with a very low charge potential (3.5 V). We anticipate that this discovery will provide a rational design strategy for modifying the reaction pathway of Li-O-2/CO2 battery and accelerating the evolution of Li-O-2 batteries to Li-air batteries.									85	5	0	0	3	0	86			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000432599100008

The results indicate that the corrosion rate in presence of low Cl- deposition is divided into three stages: sharp increase stage, rapid decrease stage and tending to be stable stage. While, the high Cl- deposition process is divided into two stages: sharp increase stage and decrease stage. The increased of Cl- deposition increase the contents of the gamma-FeOOH and beta-FeOOH and decrease the contents of the alpha-FeOOH, and then to reduce the corrosion resistance. For the initial corrosion cycles, the increased of Cl- deposition influence the oxygen supply, resulting in spatial heterogeneity of the potential distribution to promote the corrosion reaction. As the prolonged corrosion cycles, the weathering steel of low Cl- deposition forms a protective rust layer to make the potential distribution become relatively uniform to reduce the corrosion rate, while the weathering steel of high Cl- deposition of the potential distribution is more unevenly distributed with distinct low and high potential zones to promote corrosion reaction.									3	2	0	0	0	0	5				2053-1591		WOS:000632376100001

TiO2, ZnO and other non-carbide systems (ZnS, metallic nanoparticles (NPs), etc.) have been studied thoroughly to enhance their photocatalytic performances through doping and the formation of heterojunctions. But, niobium carbide (NbC) is gaining interest of researchers due to its ability to catalyze electrochemical reactions (hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction) along with excellent thermal and chemical stability. In the present work, NbC has been synthesized using conventional oxide precursor (Nb2O5), Mg metal powder and parthenium hysterophorous (PH; carrot grass, an agricultural hazardous weed) as carbon source at relatively low temperature (800 degrees C) as compared to conventional synthesis temperature (1200 degrees C). For the phase confirmation and morphological studies, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy have been done. It has been observed that the presence of NbCxOy/NbOz inside NbC nanoparticles induced the optical active sites resulting photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye under visible irradiation. With the help of various techniques (UV-visible, PL, XPS, RAMAN spectroscopies and scavenger tests), degradation mechanism has been established for the observed photocatalytic performance of synthesized NbCxOy/NbOz/NbCx/g-C heterostructure under optimized conditions. Further, for the confirmation of photodegradation of MB dye, mass spectrometry and TOC have also been carried out.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			0038-092X			WOS:000467892000037

For the first time, we report the correlation of the catalytic activities in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at low current density (<30 mA cm(-2)) and the zinc-air battery (ZAB) performance at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) with the structures of CoNi/rGO catalysts with different Co : Ni molar ratios and metal loading. A layer of 2-3 nm NiCo2O4 and Co-rich CoxNi1-xO nanoparticles on rGO exhibited a synergistic ORR catalytic effect. In contrast, NiO and big-sized Ni-rich CoxNi1-xO nanoparticles (10-20 nm) exhibited poor ORR and OER performance at low current density. No synergetic effect of Co and Ni oxides were found in the OER at low current density in the electrochemical test. The battery test at high current density revealed the best cycling stability of CoNi/rGO-5/5 with equimolar Co and Ni and medium metal loading. This is due to the synergetic OER performance with the lowest charge voltage at high current density and the best ORR activity with the highest electron transfer numbers of 3.63. This is related to the highest Co : Ni ratio of the small-sized CoxNi1-xO bimetallic oxide and the high amount of spinel NiCo2O4 nanoparticles. Corrosion during charging was found to be the limiting factor of the long-term cycling stability at high current density.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000825020900001

C-120) in pristine fullerite and growth of C120O phase in oxygenated fullerite via [2+2] photoaddition reaction is responsible for it. It has been found from depth distribution data of the hardness that the C120O phase is located in oxygen-contaminated subsurface layer of 0.8-1 mum and appears under illumination at 290-330 K.

Single-phase gamma-Y2Si2O7 powder was synthesized by calcination of SiO2 and Y2O3 powders with the addition of LiYO2 at 1400 degrees C for 4 h. The addition of LiYO2 significantly decreased the synthesis temperature, shortened the calcination time, and enhanced the stability of gamma-Y2Si2O7. The sintering of these powders in air and O-2 was studied by means of thermal mechanical analyzer. It is shown that the gamma-Y2Si2O7 sintered in oxygen had a faster densification rate and a higher density than that sintered in air. Furthermore, single-phase gamma-Y2Si2O7 with a density of 4.0 g/cm(3) (99% of the theoretical density) was obtained by pressureless sintering at 1400 degrees C for 2 h in oxygen.

Little is known about the immunological role of hemoglobin (Hb) in antimicrobial immune responses. Results showed that a 31.2 kDa monodimer Hb (skHbI) and a 57.8 kDa heterotetramer Hb (skHbII) from the blood clam, Scapharca kagoshimensis, had phenoloxidase (PO)-like activities and antimicrobial activities. Both were found capable of oxidizing L-DOPA, catechol and hydroquinone. Their PO-like activities were visibly greatly inhibited by oxidase inhibitors, EDTA, and divalent metal ions, and greatly enhanced by iso-propanol and Fe2+, indicating that they have the properties of a metalloenzyme and a catecholase-type PO as well. They also showed obvious anti-bacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria but not against either gram-negative bacteria nor fungi. The anti-bacterial activities levels were a result of the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of superoxide anions. These results indicate that skHbI and skHbII, not only function as iron-containing oxygen carriers, but also exert anti-bacterial activities and catecholase-type oxidizing activities. The fact that skHbII exerts high level of PO-like activity indicates different roles in the innate immunodefense system. These results may improve understanding of the multiple functions of invertebrate Hbs beyond serving as oxygen carriers and may provide insight into how the fundamental and universal mode of the innate immune system has persisted in respiratory proteins throughout the course of evolution.

Platinum helps the rapid reduction of cobalt oxides in hydrogen at a rather low temperature (38 degrees C). In addition, reversible changes of the oxidation states of cobalt in the Co and CoPt NPs as a function of cycling oxygen pressure (in the range of millitorr to 36 Torr) are quantified and compared. The role of Pt in the process of Co reducing and oxidizing was explored. Our findings permit the prediction of the cobalt oxidation states as the reaction conditions are altered. The experimental results also suggest the presence of tetrahedral structure of Cobalt oxide that differs from the Co3O4 spinel structure.									98	4	0	0	5	0	99			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000287049100091	21247197

Here we introduce a complete chemical network with species containing up to three atoms, with the exception of the oxygen chemistry, where reactions involving H3O+ and its deuterated forms have been added, significantly improving the consistency with comprehensive chemical networks. Deuterium chemistry and spin states of H-2 and H-3(+) isotopologues are included in this primarily gas-phase chemical model. We investigate the dependence of deuterium chemistry on these model parameters: density (n(H)), temperature, cosmic ray ionization rate, and gas-phase depletion factor of heavy elements (f(D)). We also explore the effects of time-dependent freeze-out of gas-phase species and the dynamical evolution of density at various rates relative to free-fall collapse. For a broad range of model parameters, the timescales to reach large values of D-frac(N2H+) greater than or similar to 0.1, observed in some low-and high-mass starless cores, are relatively long compared to the local free-fall timescale. These conclusions are unaffected by introducing time-dependent freeze-out and considering models with evolving density, unless the initial f(D) greater than or similar to 10. For fiducial model parameters, achieving D-frac(N2H+) greater than or similar to 0.1 requires collapse to be proceeding at rates at least several times slower than that of free-fall collapse, perhaps indicating a dynamically important role for magnetic fields in supporting starless cores and thus the regulation of star formation.									49	0	0	0	0	0	49			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000354905000020

However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the cathode, and the high overpotential, poor cycle stability and low rate capacity have severely blocked the development and application of Li-air battery. One of the effective strategies to alleviate these issues is to develop cathode catalysts for Li-air batteries. The design and development of bifunctional cathode catalysts with high activity and efficiency on both ORR and OER is highly desired for Li-air battery.The surface or interface structure has a significant impact on the catalytic performance. In this review, the recent progress in surface/interface modulation and structure-performance relationship of the cathode catalysts for Li-air batteries is summarized. The aspects of crystal plane effect, defect engineering, and surface-interface synergetic design have all been reviewed, which also include the recent results from the authors' group. The new lithium-air battery system based on lithium superoxide with large rate capability and ultra-low overpotential is also presented. In the last, the key issues and future perspectives are also discussed. Although great progress has been made in the research of lithium-air batteries in recent years, the foundamental scientific issues such as catalytic mechanism and electrochemical reaction mechanism are still unclear. The solution of these problems is of great importance in the design and development of high-efficiency catalysts, and in the development of lithium-air batteries. Therefore, the applications of advanced characterization and analysis techniques should be emphasized in the future research, especially in situ electrochemical characterization technology to analyze the reaction mechanism at catalyst surface/interface, as well as the formation and decomposition process of the reaction products. Combined with the electrochemical performance analysis and theoretical calculation, the mechanism of catalyst action and electrochemical reaction will be revealed, which is of great significance to promote the development of lithium-air battery.			锂-空气电池被认为是最具潜力的新一代化学电源体系之一,具有能量密度高、质量轻便、可逆性高、环境污染小等优点.但其电极上缓慢的氧还原(ORR)与氧析出(OER)动力学过程导致了能量效率降低、过电位高、循环性能差等问题,制约了锂-空气电池的发展.双效正极催化剂的设计与开发是解决上述问题的重要途径之一.作者通过总结近几年锂-空气电池正极催化剂的研究进展,并结合其课题组自身的工作,综述了锂-空气电池正极催化剂表界面调控及构效关系研究方面的最新进展,并展望了未来关于锂-空气电池研究的切入点,对设计、开发高效锂-空电池催化剂具有重要指导意义.						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1006-3471			CSCD:6464095		
J	Kato, Shota; Takahashi, Yamato; Fujii, Yuta; Sasaki, Kotoko; Hirano, Satoyuki; Okajima, Koji; Kodama, Yutaka								The photo-thermochemical properties and functions of Marchantia phototropin encoded by an unduplicated gene in land plant evolution								JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY				224						112305	10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2021.112305		SEP 2021		NOV 2021	2021	Phototropin (phot) is a blue light photoreceptor in plants and possesses two photosensory light-oxygen-voltage (LOV1 and LOV2) domains with different photo-thermochemical properties. While liverworts contain a single copy of PHOT (e.g., MpPHOT in Marchantia polymorpha), many land plant species contain multicopy PHOT genes (e.g., AtPHOT1 and 2 in Arabidopsis thaliana) due to evolutionary gene duplication. The LOV domains of duplicated phot proteins have been studied in detail, but those of single-copy phot proteins remain to be characterized. As phot has not been duplicated in liverworts, we hypothesized that Mpphot may retain the ancestral function and photo-thermochemical properties. To learn more about the unduplicated phot proteins, we analyzed chloroplast relocation movement and the photo-thermochemical properties of LOV1 and LOV2 in Mpphot (Mpphot-LOV1 and Mpphot-LOV2, respectively). The function of Mpphot-LOV1, which induced a response to move chloroplasts to weak light (the accumulation response) in the absence of photoactive LOV2, differed from that of LOV1 of the duplicated phot proteins of A. thaliana (e.g., Atphot1-LOV1 preventing the accumulation response). On the other hand, the function of Mpphot-LOV2 was similar to that of LOV2 of the duplicated phots. The photo-thermochemical properties of Mpphot were a hybrid of those of the duplicated phots; the photochemical and thermochemical reactions of Mpphot were similar to those of the phot2- and phot1-type proteins, respectively. Our findings reveal conservation and diversification among LOV domains during phot duplication events in land plant evolution.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1011-1344	1873-2682		WOS:000707637900006	34562831	
J	Backhaus-Ricoult, M								Modelling of the Gibbs adsorption at transition-metal-oxide interfaces: effect of the oxygen chemical potential on interfacial bonding, interfacial energy and equilibrium precipitate shape								PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE A-PHYSICS OF CONDENSED MATTER STRUCTURE DEFECTS AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES				81	7			1759	1787		10.1080/01418610010008460				JUL 2001	2001	Non-reactive ternary metal-oxide interface are thermodynamically stable over extended ranges of oxygen activities and temperatures. At each condition within this range, the interface adopts a different equilibrium structure and chemistry. A continuum model of the Gibbs adsorption-desorption at transition-metal-oxide interfaces is developed, which predicts interfacial chemistry and modifications in the specific free interfacial energy as a function of oxygen activity. Three oxygen activity domains can be distinguished according to this model: the upper part of the metal-oxide coexistence range characterized by an enrichment in interfacial oxygen, established by adsorption of oxygen at structural vacancies in the case of polar interfaces or by desorption of the less noble metal in the case of mixed interfaces; an intermediate-oxygen-activity range with the interface remaining free of adsorption; a lower-oxygen-activity range, where the interface is enriched in less noble metal by adsorption of excess less noble metal at structural vacancies or by desorption of oxygen. Largest excess concentrations are reached at the limits of the coexistence range; absolute values depend on the ability of the transition metal to undergo partial charge transfer. Any charge transfer across the interface imposes a formal charge in the terminating oxide plane and leads tot he formation of a space charge layer in the oxide. In the present work, defect concentration profiles in the space charge layer are calculated for different oxygen activities and their influence on the cohesive energy is evaluated. The general model is applied to the MgO-Cu system. Computed interfacial occupancies are compare with experimental observations of the chemical bonding at polar and mixed topotactical MgO-Cu interfaces at different oxygen activities (electron-energy-loss near-edge structure studies.) The evolution of relative specific free interfacial energy ratios, inferred from the equilibrium shape of MgO precipitates within a copper matrix and of liquid copper inclusions in a MgO matrix, is compared with model predictions of the interfacial energy of different facets and their evolution with oxygen chemical potential. Qualitative and quantitative agreement between model and experimental results is found.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0141-8610			WOS:000170011900006

The density functional level of theory was used to study the molecular mechanism of conceivable elementary steps of the deN(2)O reaction over the most stable (100) surface, including the effect of surface morphology. It is shown that terrace sites are responsible for steady state reactivity, whereas the more basic and reactive sites located on edges and corners are involved only in the initial stages of the reaction because of poisoning. Detailed analysis of the reaction progress in terms of the energy profiles and the evolution of partial charges and bond orders for each step allowed for an in-depth insight at the atomic scale into the nature of the catalytic N2O decomposition over anionic redox active sites constituted by surface O2- ions. The harmonic transition state theory along with the calculated free enthalpies of activation were used to model the reaction progress in pulse (transient) and steady state regimes as well as to predict the kinetic isotopic effects (KIE) for N-15 and (18)(O) labeled reactants. The proposed kinetic scheme was able to reproduce the results of temperature-programmed surface reaction and KIE experiments with high accuracy without fitting of any parameters.									37	1	0	0	3	0	38			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000296685800045

It is found that W, Mo, Cu and Zn lead to amorphous carbons with high specific area while Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni lead to more graphitic carbons with a lower specific area. Metal salts with a high redox potential are fully reduced during pyrolysis while others are only partially reduced. Electrochemical activity toward hydrogen evolution was investigated at pH 1 and pH 13. Hydrogen evolution on these Metal-N-C catalysts is generally more facile at pH 1 than at pH 13, paralleling the trends observed for noble metal surfaces. The Co-, Ni- and Fe-N-C catalysts are the most active at pH 13 while Co-N-C and Cr-N-C are the most active at pH 1. The activity of the latter catalysts stems from metallic cobalt particles encapsulated in carbon and from a chromium carbo-nitride phase, respectively. (C) The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS.

In this study, we developed a facile microwave reduction method to synthesize single Pt atoms anchored on aniline-stacked graphene (Pt SASs/AG) with outstanding HER performance. Pt SASs/AG presents excellent HER activity with = 12 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a mass current density of 22400 Ag-Pt(-1) at = 50 mV, which is 46 times higher than that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. Moreover, the Pt SASs/AG catalyst is highly active and more stable than Pt/C. X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the coordination of atomically isolated Pt with the nitrogen of aniline optimized the electronic structure of Pt and the hydrogen adsorption energy, eventually promoting HER activity. This study provides a new avenue for the development of single-atom Pt electrocatalysts with high activity and stability.									265	20	0	0	12	0	266			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000462661900012

Water splitting-biosynthetic hybrid systems are novel and efficient approaches for CO2 conversion. Intimate coupling of electrocatalysts and biosynthesis requires the catalysts possess both high catalytic performance and excellent biocompatibility, which is a bottleneck of developing such catalysts. Here, a complex of Ni nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon nanotubes (Ni@N-C) is synthesized as a hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalyst and is coupled with a hydrogen oxidizing autotroph, Cupriavidus necator H16, to convert CO2 to poly--hydroxybutyrate. In Ni@N-C, the Ni nanoparticles are encapsulated in N-C nanotubes, which prevents bacteria from direct contact with Ni and inhibits Ni2+ leaching. As a result, Ni@N-C exhibits excellent biocompatibility and stability. This work demonstrates that electrocatalysts and biosynthesis can be intimately coupled through rational catalyst design.									26	3	0	0	9	0	27			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000439757800014	29809320

The only known biological nitrate-forming reaction is nitrite oxidation, but despite its importance, our knowledge of the organisms catalyzing this key process in the marine N-cycle is very limited. The most frequently encountered marine NOB are related to Nitrospina gracilis, an aerobic chemolithoautotrophic bacterium isolated from ocean surface waters. To date, limited physiological and genomic data for this organism were available and its phylogenetic affiliation was uncertain. In this study, the draft genome sequence of N. gracilis strain 3/211 was obtained. Unexpectedly for an aerobic organism, N. gracilis lacks classical reactive oxygen defense mechanisms and uses the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle for carbon fixation. These features indicate microaerophilic ancestry and are consistent with the presence of Nitrospina in marine oxygen minimum zones. Fixed carbon is stored intracellularly as glycogen, but genes for utilizing external organic carbon sources were not identified. N. gracilis also contains a full gene set for oxidative phosphorylation with oxygen as terminal electron acceptor and for reverse electron transport from nitrite to NADH. A novel variation of complex I may catalyze the required reverse electron flow to low-potential ferredoxin. Interestingly, comparative genomics indicated a strong evolutionary link between Nitrospina, the nitrite-oxidizing genus Nitrospira, and anaerobic ammonium oxidizers, apparently including the horizontal transfer of a periplasmically oriented nitrite oxidoreductase and other key genes for nitrite oxidation at an early evolutionary stage. Further, detailed phylogenetic analyses using concatenated marker genes provided evidence that Nitrospina forms a novel bacterial phylum, for which we propose the name Nitrospinae.									157	6	0	0	143	0	164			1664-302X			WOS:000330967700001	23439773

Dynamic oxidative behavior was measured for the conditioned films, where the initial peak associated with the oxidation of NiOx contains 1.3-2.0 times the charge for that measured in subsequent oxidative scans and the corresponding reductive peak. It is shown that charge trapping does not fully account for this excess charge. The magnitude of excess anodic charge is affected by pH, OH- diffusion through the film, and voltammetric scan rates.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000381960300011

It is shown that with the decreasing of the film thickness (hence, with the increasing of the nondiamond carbon content therein) its surface acquired electrochemical activity: the transfer coefficients of reactions in the [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4)- redox system increased, the oxygen anodic evolution overvoltage decreased, the differential capacitance increased; on the whole, the diamond electrode demonstrated increasingly better pronounced metal-like behavior.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1023-1935			WOS:000278122200010

DGDG is the unique digalactolipid in photosynthetic membrane. It is extensively distributed in different domains of photosynthetic membrane. Two biosynthesis pathways of DGDG are present in higher plant chloroplasts, namely the prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathway. The prokaryotic pathway is restricted to the plastid, whereas the eukaryotic pathway involves reactions at the plastid and the endoplasmic reticulum. It is well established that DGDG plays an important role in maintaining oligomer structure of light-harvesting complex of photosystem II (PS II ) and regulating the activity of the oxygen evolution in PS II or PS II core complex.			本文综述了光合膜膜脂双半乳酰基甘油（DGDG）的生物合成和生理功能的研究进展。DGDG是光合膜中惟一的双半乳糖脂类，有光合膜的不膜区均有分布。在高等植物叶绿体中，存在着两条不同的DGDC生物的合成途径，即原核合成途径和真核合途径。原核途径只限于在质体内进行，而真核途径还包括一些在内质网内发生的反应。DGDC有维持光系统II捕光色素蛋白复合体的寡聚体结构、调控光系统II和光系统II核心复合物的放氧活性等方面起着重要作用。						0	1	0		0	0	1			1003-2266			CSCD:1307187

In contrast, prior to ca 2.4 Gyr ago, the ocean had little sulphate to support anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and the ocean should have been an important methane source. As atmospheric 02 and seawater sulphate levels rose on the early Earth, AOM would have increasingly throttled the release of methane. We use a biogeochemical model to simulate the response of early atmospheric 02 and CH4 to changes in marine AOM as sulphate levels increased. Semi-empirical relationships are used to parameterize global AOM rates and the evolution of sulphate levels. Despite broad uncertainties in these relationships, atmospheric 02 concentrations generally rise more rapidly and to higher levels (of order approx. 10(-3) bar versus approx. 10(-4) bar) as a result of including AOM in the model. Methane levels collapse prior to any significant rise in 02, but counter-intuitively, methane re-rises after 02 rises to higher levels when AOM is included. As 02 concentrations increase, shielding of the troposphere by stratospheric ozone slows the effective reaction rate between oxygen and methane. This effect dominates over the decrease in the methane source associated with AOM. Thus, even with the inclusion of AOM, the simulated Late Palaeoproterozoic atmosphere has a climatologically significant level of methane of approximately 50 ppmv.

For unsupported Ir-Ru, HRTEM images showed nanoparticles closer than supported Ir-Ru on anatase TiO2 that tend to agglomerate. The electrocatalysts supported on anatase TiO2 showed higher activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than those supported on rutile TiO2. Overall, Ir-Ru had the highest current per gram of metal than other metal combinations studied and the optimum ratio was 1: 1 Ir:Ru.

Peter								Mechanisms of Cytochrome P450-Catalyzed Oxidations								ACS CATALYSIS				8	12			10964	10976		10.1021/acscatal.8b03401				DEC 2018	2018	Enzymes are complex biological catalysts and are critical to life. Most oxidations of chemicals are catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (P450, CYP) enzymes, which generally utilize mixed-function oxidase stoichiometry, utilizing pyridine nucleotides as electron donors: NAD(P)H + O-2 R -> NAD(P)(+) + RO + H2O (where R is a carbon substrate and RO is an oxidized product). The catalysis of oxidations is largely understood in the context of the heme iron-oxygen complex generally termed Compound I, formally FeO3+, whose basis was in peroxidase chemistry. Many X-ray crystal structures of P450s are now available (>= 822 structures from >= 146 different P450s) and have helped in understanding catalytic specificity. In addition to hydroxylations, P450s catalyze more complex oxidations, including C-C bond formation and cleavage. Enzymes derived from P450s by directed evolution can even catalyze more unusual reactions, e.g., cyclopropanation. Current P450 questions under investigation include the potential role of the intermediate Compound 0 (formally Fe-III-O-2(-)) in catalysis of some reactions, the roles of high- and low-spin forms of Compound I, the mechanism of desaturation, the roles of open and closed structures of P450s in catalysis, the extent of processivity in multistep oxidations, and the role of the accessory protein cytochrome b(5). More global questions include exactly how structure drives function, prediction of catalysis, and roles of multiple protein conformations.									121	4	0	0	58	0	124			2155-5435			WOS:000453491100004	31105987

The combustion processes of the aluminized explosive NPs under oxygen atmosphere at 2500 K were simulated by reactive molecular dynamics. The Al shells underwent a process of melting-diffusion-reaction-aggregation, which began from the initial sur-face shell to the block. O2 rarely directly participated in the initial decomposition of the explosive molecules and mainly reacted with the intermediates and free radicals. A large number of the solid aluminized substances generated during the combustion. The AlmOn clusters are the main component of solid aluminized substances, in which the Al and O atoms at the edge will react with C, the H and N atoms, while the AlmCn and AlmNn clusters distributed sporadically. The AlmOn cluster in the TATB@AlO NP has a block structure, while the others have sphere-shaped structures. This work may provide a theoretical basis for understanding the combustion mecha-nisms of the aluminized explosives.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0927-0256	1879-0801		WOS:000868138900004

Herein, bimetallic nanoparticles encapsulated in the N-doped hollow carbon nanocubes (e.g., FeCo-NPs/NC, FeNi-NPs/NC, and CoNi-NPs/NC) are rationally designed via a general heat-treatment strategy of introducing NH3 pyrolysis of dopamine-coated metal-organic frameworks. Impressively, the resultant FeCo-NPs/NC hybrid exhibits superior bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for ORR/OER, manifesting exceptional discharging performance, outstanding lifespan, and prime flexibility for both Zn/Al-air batteries, superior to those of state-of-the-art Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. X-ray absorption near edge structure and density functional theory indicate that the strong synergy between FeCo alloy and N-doped carbon frameworks has a distinctive activation effect on bimetallic Fe/Co atoms to synchronously modify the electronic structure and afford abundant dual-active Fe/Co-N-x sites, large surface area, high nitrogen doping level, and conductive carbon frameworks to boost the reversible oxygen electrocatalysis. Such N-doped carbon with bimetallic alloy bonds provides new pathways for the rational creation of high-efficiency energy conversion and storage equipment.									25	1	0	0	1	0	25			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000618182500001	33590684

It is still unclear whether the capacity fading observed for this type of material is solely due to the occurrence of anionic redox reactions and consequent material degradation or also due to the side reactions between the cathode material and the carbonate-based electrolyte. In order to address it, this study compares the differences in electrochemical performance of a rock salt Li1.25Fe0.5Nb0.25O2 cathode and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) formation in both lithium metal and lithium ion cells by using a conventional carbonate-based electrolyte and an ionic liquid-based electrolyte. Thereby, the ionic liquid electrolyte promotes capacity retention, whereas the organic carbonate-based electrolyte leads to increased capacity fading and ineffective CEI formation. Severe side reactions between the carbonate-based electrolyte and the cathode material are characterized by poor Coulombic efficiency and result in continuous inner resistance growth, ongoing gas evolution, and the coverage of the cathode surface with electrolyte degradation products like LiF and Li2CO3. This study shows the mismatch of carbonate-based electrolytes with the Li1.25Fe0.5Nb0.25O2 cathode and offers a strategy that can be also applied for the improvement of performance of other disordered rock salt cathode materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000711236300051

Herein, a simple phosphoselenization method was used to prepare Co2P and CoSe2 coupled nanosheet and nanoneedle composite materials on nickel foam (Co2P/CoSe2/NF). Density functional theory calculations showed that Co2P had a higher water adsorption energy compared with CoSe2, indicating that H2O molecules are strongly adsorbed on the active sites of Co2P, which speeds up the kinetic process of water splitting. The Co2P/CoSe2-300 material displayed superior electrocatalytic activity for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an alkaline medium. It's worth noting that the Co2P/CoSe2-300 composite material nanoarrays merely needed an ultralow overpotential of 280 mV to drive a current intensity of 100 mA cm(-2) for OER. In addition, when a two-electrode system was constructed for overall water splitting, the current intensity of 20 mA cm(-2) could be reached while requiring an ultrasmall cell voltage of 1.52 V, which is one of the best catalytic activities reported up to now. Experimental and density functional theory calculations showed that the superior electrocatalytic performance of Co2P/CoSe2-300 could be attributed to its higher electron-transfer rate, higher water adsorption energy, and the synergistic effect of Co2P and CoSe2. Our work provides a novel approach for the one-step construction of composite materials as environmentally friendly and inexpensive water splitting catalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	5			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000644561800001	33908546

Cyclic voltammetry and rotating disc electrode voltammetry suggests that mass transfer of urea to the double layer region due to local convection caused by oxygen evolution reaction does not play a role in the potential oscillation mechanism.									30	0	0	0	0	0	30			1932-7447			WOS:000342396300008

Herein, we report a simple NaF solution treating method to produce fluorinated and alkaline metal intercalated ultrathin GCN with abundant in-plane pores and exposed active edges, and therefore an enhanced number of actives sites. Compared to bulk GCN, NaF treated GCN has a larger specific surface area of 81.2 m(2) g(-1) and a relatively narrow band gap of 2.60 eV, which enables a 6-fold higher photocatalytic rate of hydrogen evolution.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2046-2069		WOS:000445747800002	35539975

Generally, the electrocatalyst at air cathode plays a significant role in various metal-air (O-2) batteries. As a versatile and efficient technique, electrospinning has been considered as a powerful method to fabricate nanofibers, which hold great potential as bifunctional electrocatalysts for such batteries. Although great progresses have been achieved in improving the electrochemical performance of catalysts in recent years, some critical challenges still maintain. In this review, the advanced electrospun carbon nanofiber-based electrocatalysts for flexible metal-air batteries have been summarized. Then, additional discussions have been included focusing on the advantages and characteristics of different nanofibers and some special requirements for various flexible metal-air batteries. Moreover, some current challenges and future prospects in the development of electrospun carbon nanomaterials for flexible metal-air cathode catalysts have been rationally analyzed.

Recombinant human deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (hDOHH) has been reported to have oxygen- and iron-dependent activity, an estimated iron/holoprotein stoichiometry of 2, and a visible band at 630 nm responsible for the blue color of the as-isolated protein. EPR, Mossbauer, and XAS spectroscopic results presented herein provide direct spectroscopic evidence that hDOHH has an antiferromagnetically coupled diiron center with histidines and carboxylates as likely ligands, as suggested by mutagenesis experiments. Resonance Raman experiments show that its blue chromophore arises from a (mu-1,2-peroxo) diiron(III) center that forms in the reaction of the reduced enzyme with O-2, so the peroxo form of hDOHH is unusually stable. Nevertheless we demonstrate that it can carry out the hydroxylation of the deoxyhypusine residue present in the eIF5A substrate. Despite a lack of sequence similarity, hDOHH has a nonheme diiron active site that resembles both in structure and function those found in methane and toluene monooxygenases, bacterial and mammalian ribonucleotide reductases, and stearoyl acyl carrier protein Delta(9)-desaturase from plants, suggesting that the oxygen- activating diiron motif is a solution arrived at by convergent evolution. Notably, hDOHH is the only example thus far of a human hydroxylase with such a diiron active site.									84	0	0	0	51	0	84			0027-8424			WOS:000269481000017	19706422

In this work, we find that NMP electrolyte is reactive with 02 gas in the presence of lithium metal and such 02 consuming reaction (i.e., autoxidation) is a possible cause for the poor performance in Li-O-2 batteries with NMP electrolyte. The autoxidation of NMP is verified by direct measurement of the depletion of 02 gas in the hermetically sealed symmetric Li/Li cells via in-situ gas pressure analysis. In-situ differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS) experiment reveals that the autoxidation resulted in significant 02 consumption upon discharge, very low 02 efficiency upon charge, and eventually fast capacity fading. Lithium nitrate (LiNO3), which provides a protective layer on the surface of lithium metal, is employed to suppress the autoxidation, leading to significantly enhanced oxygen efficiency and cycle life.

Oxygen index results demonstrate that increases in flammability resistance are also possible through inclusion of chlorinated paraffin wax and that combinations of this additive and tin compounds function in a synergistic manner. Thermal analysis techniques and Sn-119m Mossbauer spectroscopy have been applied to investigate chemical changes which occur during thermal degradation and combustion of these compositions. It is apparent that tin acts predominantly in the condensed phase by a char promotion mechanism. However, at high Cl/Sn ratios, particularly when chlorinated paraffin wax is present, extensive volatilisation of tin may occur, resulting in a vapour phase flame-inhibiting reaction.									16	0	0	0	0	0	17			0141-3910			WOS:A1991FL51100003

Although low Pt loadings in PEM electrolyzers have been demonstrated, it's still worthwhile to remove the Pt in the long term. Herein, porous N-doped carbon nanofibers containing encapsulated Co nanoparticles are in situ obtained by electrospinning and subsequent carbonization as efficient electrocatalysts for HER. The optimized catalyst treated at 800 degrees C shows a remarkably high HER activity with an overpotential of only 159 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, which is better than most non-precious metal based and metal free catalysts. The carbonization temperature as well as the concentration of nitrogen precursors have significant effects on the structure and catalytic activity of the composites. This work shows the efficacy of preparing noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for HER using the facile electrospinning method. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

The psbO gene product, the so-called extrinsic 33 kDa protein appears closely associated with this site, although its precise role remains unclear. We have used targeted mutagenesis to investigate whether the psbO protein is essential for PS II activity in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The psbO gene was isolated and the locus was shown to be present as a single copy in the genome by low-stringency Southern hybridisations. Northern analysis detected a major psbO monocistronic transcript of 0.95-1.0 kb. Insertion and deletion psbO - mutant strains (named IC1 and IC2, respectively) were engineered and verified biochemically. The lesions in psbO have been confirmed by readdition of the psbO gene into both mutants using in situ complementation. This technique further indicated that the mutants may not be phenotypically identical. However, both mutants can grow photoautotrophically and exhibit appreciable rates of oxygen evolution. We therefore confirm independently the recently published results of Burnap and Sherman (Burnap, R.L. and Sherman, L.A. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 440-446). We also show that the mutated organism is highly susceptible to photoinhibition. This observation indicates that although the psbO protein is not absolutely required for water-splitting in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 it does play an important role in protecting against donor side photoinhibition.									107	0	0	0	99	0	107			0006-3002			WOS:A1991GL31700001

By optimizing reaction paths and reducing the activation energies of reactions, catalysts appear in more than 90% of chemical production reactions, involving homogeneous catalysis, heterogeneous catalysis, and enzyme catalysis. Because of the 100% efficiency of active atom utilization and the adjustable microenvironment of metal centers, single-atom catalysts (SACs) shine in various catalytic fields for enhancing the rate, conversion, and selectivity of chemical reactions. Nevertheless, a solo active site determines a fixed adsorption mode, and the adsorption energies of intermediates from multistep reactions linking with a solo metal site are related to each other. For a specific multistep reaction, it is almost impossible to optimally adjust the adsorption of every intermediate on the solo site simultaneously. This phenomenon is termed the scaling relationship limit (SRL) and is an unavoidable obstacle in the development of pure SACs.Dual-atom catalysts (DACs), perfectly inheriting the advantages of SACs, can exhibit better catalytic performance than simple SACs and thus have gradually gained researchers' attention. Depending on the dual-metal structure, dual-metal sites (DMSs) in DACs can be divided into two separated heterometal sites, two linked homometal sites, and two linked heterometal sites. Two separated heterometal sites prescribe a distance limit between two metal sites for electron interaction. Currently, the active origins of DACs can be summarized in the following three points: (1) electronic effect, in which only one metal center serves as active site and the other plays an electronic regulatory role; (2) synergistic effect, in which two metal centers separately catalyze different core steps to improve catalytic performance together; (3) adsorption effect, in which offering additional sites changes the adsorption structures to break the SRL based on SACs. Among the three active origins, optimizing the adsorption structure of intermediates upon DMSs is one of the most effective technologies to boost the catalytic property of DACs on the basis of SACs. To date, few contributions have focused on the development of DACs in various heterogeneous catalysis environments, including O-2 reduction reaction, O-2 evolution reaction, H-2 evolution reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, N-2 reduction reaction, and other conversion reactions.In this Account, a summary of recent progress regarding DACs in heterogeneous catalysis will be presented. First, the evolution of DACs from an unpopular discovery to research hot spot is illustrated through a timeline. In the next section, the DACs are divided into three categories, and the potential active origins of DACs are revealed by comparison with SACs. In addition, the techniques for constructing DACs are systematically summarized, including preparation of carbonous, pyrolysis-free, noncarbon-supported, and complex-type DACs. Furthermore, the underlying active origins of DACs in specific energy- and environment-related reactions are introduced in detail with assistance of theoretical calculations. Finally, we affirm the contribution of DACs to catalysis, particularly heterogeneous electrocatalysis, and provide an outlook regarding the development direction for DACs by discussing the major challenges. It is anticipated that this Account can inspire researchers to propel the advance of DACs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2643-6728		WOS:000818536600001

In this work, we for the first time demonstrate a facile strategy for preparing Prussian blue analogous@polyaniline core-shell nanocubes (denoted as PBAs@PANI) as multifunctional electrode materials for lithium storage and overall water splitting. By finely controlling the reaction parameters, PANI was uniformly coated on the surface of PBAs nanocubes and that the thickness of the PANI shell can be adjusted. The as-synthesized PBAs@PANI nanocubes yield improved electrochemical performance due to significantly enhanced charge transport, elastic buffer, and corrosion protection afforded by the PANI coating. More specifically, PBAs@PANI nanocubes show excellent lithium storage behavior with a reversible capacity of 626 mA h g(-1) compared with the uncoated PBAs (203 mA h g(-1)) after 500 cycles at a high current density of 1 A g(-1). Furthermore, PBAs@PANI nanocubes can also efficiently catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and we therefore investigated their applications as bifunctional electrocatalysts (as both the anode and cathode) for overall water splitting. A current density of 10 mA cm(-2) can be gained at a low cell voltage of 1.73 V over a long-term operation in base, representing a combined overpotential of 500 mV for full water splitting. These superior performances manifest that PBAs@PANI nanocubes can serve as high-performance anode for LIBs as well as promising bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									28	0	0	0	2	0	28				2046-2069		WOS:000414405800048

Developing alternatives to precious metals (Pt, Pd and Ir) for hydrogen production from water splitting is central to the area of renewable energy. Two-dimensional metal carbide and nitride (MXenes) materials have shown characteristics of promising catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we performed density functional calculations to predict the stability and electrocatalytic performance of 2D Cr2CO2 with transition metal modification and carbon vacancy engineering. Our results indicated that pure Cr2C and Cr2CO2 MXenes are conductive, which was favorable to the charge transfer during the HER. The Cr2C MXenes tend to be fully terminated by O* under standard conditions [pH = 0, p(H-2) = 1 bar, and U = 0 V vs. standard conditions]. The modification by transition metals could tune the Gibbs free energy of reaction for the adsorption of atomic hydrogen (DGH*) on Cr2CO2 to close to 0 eV (ideal value) at suitable TM coverage. Charge transfer analysis suggested that surface O atoms gain more electrons by the transition metal doping, and therefore weaken the bonding interaction with H atoms to compare with that of pure Cr2CO2. The HER performance of Cr2CO2 can also be improved via carbon vacancy engineering. These results indicated that transition metal surface modification and carbon vacancy engineering are effective ways for achieving promising HER electrocatalysts for water splitting.									51	4	0	0	1	0	51			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451600200040

Herein, a facile one-step ultrasonic spray pyrolysis method is developed for the synthesis of MoO2-MoC composite loaded on porous carbon (MoO2/MoC@C), and the MoO2/MoC@C is found to exhibit prominent catalytic activity in the HER. The overpotential required for a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) is as small as 133 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 203 mV in 1 M KOH for the MoO2/MoC@C, and the value is superiorly comparable to that of reported metal carbides. The MoO2/MoC@C can work stably both in acidic and basic solution over 30 h with 95% faradaic efficiency in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 93% in 1 M KOH. The synergic effect between MoO2 and MoC is suggested by density functional theory calculations.									23	0	0	0	0	0	22			2052-1553			WOS:000425032100020

Onset potential and current density were found to be comparable to platinum, and the resulting crystallite size was on the order of 20 nm. Coordination of the precursor metal ions by citrate was found not to be advantageous. Results from multiple scan linear sweep voltammetry suggest lattice oxide saturation during reduction of oxygen and lattice oxide depletion upon water oxidation. The color of the best-performing composition changes dramatically between 1.2 and -1.15 V versus saturated calomel electrode, so X-ray photoelectron spectra of the fully oxidized and reduced films were compared, demonstrating that cobalt in the film changes oxidation state. Performance of the films as a function of iron-to-cobalt ratio is consistent with what others have reported in the literature, indicating that spray pyrolysis is an efficient method to prepare and evaluate new catalytic materials.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2470-1343			WOS:000418744100024	31457327

Herein, a novel Co1-xS/C-3/N-KB catalyst is prepared by a facile process with cheap raw materials. The electrocatalytic performance of Co1-xS/C-3/N-KB for ORR are investigated systematically. As results, Co1-xS/C-3/N-KB exhibits a half-wave potential of 0.72 V and a limiting current density of 6.0 mA.cm(-2), comparable to the commercial Pt/C. Moreover, by means of Koutecky-Levich and RRDE techniques, the catalyst is confirmed to catalyze ORR at a four-electron pathway. Besides, chronoamperometric studies indicate a better catalytic stability of Co1-xS/C-3/N-KB than that of Pt/C with the current density retention rates of 93.4% and 88.3%, respectively. In addition, during the accelerated durability test, Co1-xS/C-3/N-KB shows only 11.5 mV negative shift of half-wave potential after 5000 cycles, even better than Pt/C (34.6 mV negative shift). When used as cathode catalyst for primary Al-air battery, the Co1-xS/C-3/N-KB catalyst exhibited excellent discharge voltage and better stability than Pt/C. The excellent ORR catalytic activity and stability of Co1-xS/C-3/N-KB can be due to the synergistic effect between the Co1-xS/C active sites and the N-KB support, which is not only beneficial to oxygen adsorption but also promotes efficient electron transfer, thus facilitating the oxygen reduction process. Besides, the coated/doped carbon and doped nitrogen in Co1-xS/C particles also have certain contribution, enhancing the electronic conductivity and catalytic stability, therefore facilitating the electronic transfer inside Co1-xS/C active particles during the oxygen reduction process.

According to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, oxygen vacancies of Co3O4 play a significant role in catalytic activity. Herein, we report a novel structure-induced strategy to develop hollow Co3O4 with rich oxygen vacancies for efficient oxidation of CO. Through a reduction-oxidation pyrolysis process, the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) precursor (i.e., ZIF-67) is transformed into H-Co3O4@H-C, in which hollow Co3O4 (H-Co3O4) nanoparticles (NPs) are embedded in hollow carbon (H-C) shell. The hollow Co3O4 NPs feature rich oxygen vacancies and finish a complete conversion of CO at 130 degrees C, which is much lower than that of solid Co3O4 (the temperature of full CO conversion T-100=220 degrees C). Besides, the hollow carbon shell could also reduce the diffusion resistance during the oxidation process. Benefiting from the unique hollow structures, H-Co3O4@H-C even shows comparable activity to noble metal catalysts under high weight hourly space velocities (WHSVs) up to 240,000 mL h(-1) g(cat.)(-1). Furthermore, the H-Co3O4@H-C catalyst also shows good durability with only a slight decline after the reaction has been operated for 24 h.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000492585500001

After Pt deposition and acid leaching, the remaining Co species on the Pt surface are converted to CoN species by ammonia heat treatment, which are also attached on the Pt surface. The as-synthesized CoN-decorated Pt on the Co-N-functionalized 2D carbon (CoN-Pt/CoNC-2D) displays an excellent ORR activity, better than a commercial Pt/C in half-cell and single-cell tests, and also exhibits remarkable long-term durability with only a similar to 17 mV shift in half-wave potential after 30 000 potential cycles. Such excellent ORR catalytic performance is attributed to strong cooperative synergistic interactions between the CoN-Pt and CoNC-2D in the catalyst. The CoN species formed on the Pt surface not only change the Pt electronic structure by down-shifting the Pt d-band center but also passivate the Pt surface to prevent Pt oxidation and dissolution during the ORR. On the other hand, the thin porous CoNC-2D nanoflake support significantly improves the accessibility of reactants to enhance mass transfer and prevents segregation and agglomeration of CoN-Pt NPs during the ORR through strong metal-support interaction, further enhancing ORR activity and durability of the CoN-Pt/CoNC-2D catalyst.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2574-0962			WOS:000557375200036

The lowest explosion limit of MN decreases with the addition of nitric oxide, nitrous oxide and oxygen. The ternary diagrams of the explosive range for "methyl nitrite/nitrogen/oxide gas" mixtures at 40 degrees C and 100 kPa were acquired. The transient explosion process was characterized by high-speed video image and emission spectrum at 40 degrees C and 40 kPa. The results demonstrate that the decomposing explosion mainly includes dehydrogenation and oxidation of the carbonaceous species, reduction of nitric oxide and conversion of the OH radical, which can be divided into two reaction stages. The first stage is transient and lasts less than 50 ms, basically involving the generation of nitric oxide, methanol and formaldehyde, and most reactions of dehydrogenation and nitric oxide reduction. The second stage lasts more than 300 ms, and develops from the cool flame to the yellow flame, mainly involving the combustion reactions of hydrogen and carbon monoxide with the OH radical. The type and concentration of oxide gases affect the generation of key species HNO and OH radicals which in turn have an important impact on the evolution of the explosion.

Between two Hopf bifurcation points, different simple and complex oscillations and different routes to chaos were observed. In the region of the mixed-mode evolution of the system, the transitions between two successive mixed-mode simple states are realized by period-doubling of the initial state leading to a chaotic window in which the next dynamic state emerges mixed with the initial one. It appears in increasing proportions in concatenated patterns until total domination. Thus, with increasing flow rate the period-doubling route to chaos was obtained, whereas with decreasing flow rate the peak-adding route to chaos was obtained. Moreover, in very narrow regions of flow rates, chaotic mixtures of mixed-mode patterns were observed. This evolution of patterns repeats until the end of the mixed-mode region at high flow rates that corresponds to chaotic mixtures of one large and many small amplitude oscillations. Starting from the reverse Hopf bifurcation point and decreasing the flow rate, simple small amplitude sinusoidal oscillations were encountered and then the period-doubling route to chaos. With a further decreasing flow rate, the mixed-mode oscillations emerge inside the chaotic window.									28	0	3	0	1	2	30			1089-5639			WOS:000239990800028	16928130

ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				467	3			919	923		10.1051/0004-6361:20066925				JUN 2007	2007	Aims. An anomalous effect in the abundances of oxygen isotopes in the most refractory calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) was discovered some thirty years ago. The origin of these oxygen isotopic anomalies has hitherto remained unexplained. The origin is neither nuclear, nor has the recent photochemical self-shielding explanation been proven to be valid. We discuss a possible chemical mechanism to resolve these observed effects.Methods. By uniting the most recent laboratory observations of nanoclusters of silicates in beams and the first principles theoretical studies of their structure and properties with a major dynamical constraint recently described as the surface non-RRKM effect during SiO2 formation on the growing grain, we show that the origin of the anomalous isotopic effect in high-temperature minerals in CAIs is chemical and strictly mass-independent.Results. We report that the surface non-RRKM effect would represent a major process in the formation of our own solar system and observable protoplanetary accretion disks, and the mass-independent isotope effects are directly associated with the formation of primary grains in the high temperature nebular environment. We expect that this chemical reaction mechanistic approach combined with future time-resolved studies on the kinetics of growth of silicates and a precise knowledge of the oxygen isotopic abundances of the sun would provide a very detailed understanding of the origins of formation of our solar system.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1432-0746			WOS:000246610300003

To investigate the role of morphological attributes, we studied polymer-derived, interconnected, N-doped carbon structures with uniformly sized meso or macropores, differing only in the pore size. We found that the carbon dioxide reduction selectivity (versus the hydrogen evolution reaction) increased around three times just by introducing the porosity into the carbon structure (with an optimal pore size of 27 nm). We attribute this change to alterations in the wetting and CO2 adsorption properties of the carbon catalysts. These insights offer a new platform to advance CO2 reduction performance by only morphological engineering of the electrocatalyst.									82	7	0	0	4	0	84			2542-4351			WOS:000476463300014	31417986

However,the chemical activity of Mg is high,resulting in poor corrosion resistance. Especially,Mg alloys are susceptible to pitting corrosion with great destructiveness and hidden danger. To decline the negative effect of pitting corrosion on the safe service of Mg alloy parts,it is necessary to clarify the pitting corrosion mechanism of Mg alloys. The classical pitting corrosion mechanism of other metals is based on the formation of oxygen concentration cell,whereas cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction occurs on Mg alloys. Thus,the pitting corrosion process of Mg alloys needs to be investigated in detail. In this paper the pitting corrosion process of GW93 cast Mg alloy is monitored in-situ using SVET ( scanning vibrating electrode technique) in 3.5% NaCl solution; the corrosion morphologies are observed using SEM ( scanning electron microscopy); and the effect of cathodic and anodic potentials on the pitting corrosion process is compared using electrochemical measurements. The results indicate that the microcathodes locate in the outside of corrosion pits and hydrogen evolution reaction occurs there,while the microanodes locate in the interior of corrosion pits and Mg dissolution reaction occurs. The pitting corrosion process dynamically changes with increasing corrosion time. The synergistic effect of the microgalvanic acceleration resulted from second phases and enrichment of chloride ions in corrosion pits is the driving force for the propagation of corrosion pits towards the interior of Mg substrate.			镁合金作为最轻的金属结构材料有很多优异性能,但镁自身化学性质活泼,耐蚀性差,尤其易发生点蚀,破坏性和隐患性非常大。若想降低点蚀对镁合金部件安全服役性能的影响,就需要对镁合金点蚀机制有清楚的认识。然而,适用于其他金属材料的经典的点蚀机制是以形成氧浓差电池为基础,阴极发生的是氧还原反应,而镁合金阴极发生的是析氢反应,因此镁合金的点蚀形成过程尚需深入研究。采用扫描振动电极技术(SVET)原位监测了铸态GW93镁合金在3.5% NaCl(质量分数)溶液中的点蚀过程,采用SEM观察了腐蚀过程镁合金微观形貌变化,采用电流-时间曲线对比了阴阳极电位对点蚀发展的影响。研究结果表明,点蚀坑外是微阴极,发生析氢反应,点蚀坑内是微阳极,发生镁的溶解反应,随着时间增加,点蚀发展过程是动态变化的。镁合金中第二相所导致的微电偶腐蚀加速效应及氯离子在腐蚀坑内的聚集,两者的协同作用驱动了点蚀不断向基体内部生长。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-3962			CSCD:6690953

Oxidation towards hyper-stoichiometric UO2 - UO2+x - might be encountered at various stages of the nuclear fuel cycle if oxidative conditions are met; the impact of stoichiometry changes upon physical properties should therefore be properly assessed to ensure safe and reliable operations. These physical properties are intimately linked to the arrangement of atomic defects in the crystalline structure. The evolution of the defect concentration with environmental parameters - oxygen partial pressure and temperature - were evaluated by means of a point defect model where the reaction energies are derived from atomic-scale simulations. To this end, various configurations and net charge states of oxygen interstitial clusters in UO2 have been calculated. Various methodologies have been tested to determine the optimum cluster configurations and a rigid lattice approach turned out to be the most useful strategy to optimize defect configuration structures. Ultimately, results from the point defect model were discussed and compared to experimental measurements of stoichiometry dependence on oxygen partial pressure and temperature. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we developed an in-situ deposition approach for depositing NiCo2O4 on the surface of Co9S8, and then the loading amount of NiCo2O4 was controlled by regulating the deposited number of cycles. In addition, the materials were used as catalysts for oxygen production and hydrogen production for the first time. When Co9S8@NiCo2O4-10 cycles, Co9S8@NiCo2O4-70 cycles and Co9S8 is used as a bifunctional catalyst, Co9S8@NiCo2O4-70 cycles // Co9S8@NiCo2O4-10 cycles displays a smaller cell voltage (1.55 V@10 mA cm(-2)) than Co9S8 (1.68 V@10 mA cm(-2)). Density functional theory calculation is used to calculate the water adsorption energy on the surface of the material to further reveal the reaction mechanism of water oxidation process. The work provides a new idea for the development of a relatively low toxicity and environmental friendly bifunctional electrocatalyst for industrial water electrolysis applications.

Thus, it is important to develop highly efficient and cost-effective catalysts for hydrogen generation. Herein, we fabricated a novel NiMoO4 catalyst on Ni foams, followed by NH3-plasma treatment to introduce NH2 functional groups, which were then transformed into -NH3 moieties during the HER process to afford a superb HER activity in alkaline solution, approaching the theoretical limit. The resultant NHx-NiMoO4 HER catalyst was demonstrated to be super-active with a record high HER performance (eta @ 10 mA cm(-2) = 18 mV, Tafel slope = 28.3 mV/decade) and promising for sea-water splitting. The theoretical studies suggest that NH3 moieties suffered from reorganization towards minimizing the energy barriers for both Volmer and Tafel/Heyrovsky steps. The plasma method may be extended to the design of novel catalysts for many other important chemical or electrochemical reactions.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000663442600005

However, detail characterizations of the chemical and electronic features are lacking. In this study, we characterized that by using analytical transmission electron microscopy. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) revealed uniform Na-insertion into a single particle. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis exhibited complete Li -extraction. Energy loss near edge structure (ELNES) of Mn and Ni L-edges indicated that only Ni contributes to the redox reaction as Ni2+ & hArr; Ni4+ during the Li+-Na + substitution. The elemental composition ratio analysis using both EDS and EELS indicated Na0.6Ni0.5Mn1.5O3.8 as a formula of the Na-substituted material. Oxygen desorption was provoked during the Na-insertion process, and oxygen defect formation was found to be essential for the Li+-Na+ substitution mechanism of the LNMO material.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000848661500006

Two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with abundant exposed active sites have great potential as catalyst materials with high electrocatalytic activity. Herein, a sequence of 2D MOF (TMN2O2, TM = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) structures with 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene and 2,3,6,7,10,11triphenylenehexamine were designed and investigated for their catalytic performance in ORR and OER by using density functional theory. Calculation results reveal that TMN2O2 (TM = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) structures have superior thermodynamic and electrochemical stability during the electrocatalytic process. Based on oxygen and water molecule activation and free energy calculations, the CoN2O2 structure exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for ORR and OER with low overpotential values of 0.33 and 0.30 V, respectively. The high bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for OER/ORR can be attributed to the moderate adsorption interaction of CoN2O2 structure with key intermediates. The valence orbital contribution of Co-3dz2 is critical for adjusting the interaction with the *OOH intermediate, resulting in enhancing the electrocatalytic performance for both ORR and OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2639-4979		WOS:000856110500001		
J	Queeney, KT; Friend, CM								Dinitrosyl intermediate for N2O formation from reaction of NO on Mo(110)								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				107	16			6432	6442		10.1063/1.474303				OCT 22 1997	1997	The adsorption and subsequent reaction of nitric oxide (NO) on Mo(110) has been studied by temperature programmed reaction, electron energy loss, and infrared reflectance absorbance spectroscopies. The predominant reaction pathway for a saturated NO overlayer is dissociation to atomic nitrogen and oxygen; in fact, for low NO coverages, dissociation is the only reaction and largely takes place below 300 K. At NO coverages above 65% of theta(sat) evolution of N2O, N-2, and NO is also observed at low temperature. Temperature programmed reaction of isotopically mixed overlayers demonstrates that N2O formation occurs via reaction of two intact NO molecules, suggestive of a dimeric surface intermediate. Electron energy loss and infrared spectroscopies identify three v(NO) features which are assigned to three distinct species; the frequencies of the v(NO) peaks in the infrared spectrum of a saturated (NO)-N-14 overlayer at 100 K are 1860, 1821, and 1720 cm(-1). The 1860 and 1720 cm(-1) features are assigned to monomeric NO. Based on the infrared spectrum of a mixed overlayer of (NO)-N-14 and (NO)-N-15, and on comparison to reference spectra of NO adsorbed on MoO3, the 1821 cm(-1) peak is identified as v(s)(NO) of a surface dinitrosyl complex, i.e., two NO molecules bound to one Mo site. The weakly bound NO with the stretch frequency of 1860 cm(-1) is associated with NO desorption, while the dinitrosyl leads to low-temperature N-2 and N2O formation and some dissociation.

The CoHCF shell as effective co-catalyst increases the reaction kinetics, thus depressing the charge recombination rate, as well as protects SiNWs array photoanode from photocorrosion. It is found that the CoHCF significantly decreases the charge transfer impedance (Rct), which means that the CoHCF facilitates majority transport and collection. These advantages may account for the performance enhancement.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000426059800058	29458624

This parameter allows to eliminate the mass transfer inefficiency and then can be defined as the ability of the anode to promote the electro-oxidation and to reduce the side reaction of oxygen evolution. It has been shown that the normalized current efficiency highly depends on both anode material and organic species. The electrochemical behavior of lead dioxide and synthetic boron-doped diamond thin film electrode (BDD) has been studied in acid media containing 4-chlorophenol by bulk electrolysis under different experimental conditions with the use of normalized current efficiency.

The tunneling structures were realized by direct connection of YBa2Cu3O7-x and normal metal (Pb, Sn, In, Au). X-ray photoemission spectroscopy analyses and time dependence of tunneling resistance confirm strong interaction between electrodes and the existence of oxygen depleted layer in YBa2Cu3O7-x near the tunneling barrier. The differences in the values of energy gap we explain by the existence of this oxygen depleted layer. The differential characteristics dV/dI(V) of YBa2Cu3O7-x/metal junctions were compared with theoretical curves obtained from conventional theory for S-I-N connection. The time evolution of tunneling resistance of our junctions was fitted by theoretical curves describing the diffusion of oxygen through the interface of the junction.					1ST INTERNATIONAL CONF ON POINT-CONTACT SPECTROSCOPY ( PCS 91 )1ST INTERNATIONAL CONF ON POINT-CONTACT SPECTROSCOPY ( PCS 91 )	SEP 04-10, 1991SEP 04-10, 1991		KHARKOV, USSRKHARKOV, USSR	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0132-6414			WOS:A1992JF40300024

Herein, palladium nanoparticles were generated directly on a cathode electrode by bioelectrochemical reduction with Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and then applied to produce hydrogen gas in MECs. The MEC with bioelectrochemically deposited Pd catalysts achieved a hydrogen production rate of 61.8 +/- 2.0 L-H-2 m(-3) d(-1), significantly higher than 38.5 +/- 2.0 L-H-2 m(-3) d(-1) with the Pd catalysts in the absence of microbial reduction. This improvement was related to a higher electrochemical active surface area of 40.5 +/- 3.5 m(2) g(-1) and smaller Pd particle size (10-100 nm) on the cathode with bioelectrochemical deposition, compared to those of electrochemically-generated Pd catalysts (16.8 +/- 2.8 m(2) g(-1) and 200-250 nm, respectively). The superior performance of the bioelectrochemically deposited Pd catalysts was supported by a much smaller charge transfer resistance of 15.4 Omega. Although microorganisms could help generate better Pd catalysts, the lack of strong bond between Pd nanoparticles and carbon cloth resulted in unstable hydrogen production performance. Applying a binding agent - Nafion led to consistent current generation and hydrogen production. The results of this study encourage further exploration of in situ deposition of catalysts via bioelectrochemical reactions for MEC applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the forward hydrogen production reaction is often impeded by backward reactions. In the present study, in a photosystem II-integrated hybrid Z-scheme water splitting system, the backward hydrogen oxidation reaction was significantly suppressed by loading a PtCrOx cocatalyst on a ZrO2/TaON photocatalyst. Due to the weak chemisorption and activation of molecular hydrogen on PtCrOx, where Pt is stabilized in the oxidized forms, POII and Pt-IV, hydrogen oxidation is inhibited. However, it is remarkably well-catalyzed by the metallic Pt cocatalyst, thereby rapidly consuming the produced hydrogen. This work describes an approach to inhibit the backward reaction in the photosystem II-integrated hybrid Z-scheme water splitting system using Fe(CN)(6)(3-)/Fe(CN)(6)(4-) redox couple as an electron shuttle.

Their behavior toward CO reduction, as well as the oxygen-handling properties of the CO-reduced samples, was explored. An appreciable reduction Of the ceria bulk was detected on treatment under CO Lit 473 K. On the basis of the analysis of the evolution of different oxygen-derived species (superoxide, peroxide, O-) on low-temperature (77-300 K) oxygen chemisorption on the CO-reduced samples, a general picture of the redox properties of the samples is presented. Results demonstrate that the presence of copper promotes completion of the redox cycle under CO/O-2 by favoring both ceria reduction and oxidation. This can be relevant to explaining the remarkable oxidation activity and synergetic effects observed for catalysts combining CuO and CeO2. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

J	Yamaguchi, Takuto; Tanaka, Keigo; Hagino, Hideki								Porosity reduction in WC-12Co laser cladding by aluminum addition								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REFRACTORY METALS & HARD MATERIALS				110						106020	10.1016/j.ijrmhm.2022.106020				JAN 2023	2023	Laser cladding of WC-Co cermet materials has been limited by defects such as pores and cracks. Especially, numerous pores with a large size in clad beads are typical defects in laser cladding of WC-Co, in comparison with other cladding materials. Previous studies show that pores in WC-Co laser clad beads are generated from CO gas reaction between oxygen and carbon dissociated from WC. CO gas formation also leads to decarburization of WC-Co, resulting in a brittle phase such as W2C or M6C. In this study, we attempted to add an element with a strong affinity for oxygen to reduce porosity by preventing CO gas formation. We prepared an aluminum-added stainless steel substrate by laser alloying, followed by laser cladding of WC-Co on the laser-alloyed substrate. The addition of aluminum drastically reduced pores in the clad bead. The clad bead on the laser-alloyed substrate contained Al-oxide particles with a sub-micron size. Oxygen elements can be trapped as solid state Al-oxide before CO gas formation, contributing to lower porosity. Preventing CO gas formation also resulted in the microstructure without any W2C.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0263-4368	2213-3917		WOS:000872972200001

Herein, we highlight that an in situ grown nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) nanosheet array catalyst with partially amorphous characteristics, rich native Ni3+ ions and an optimal Ni:Fe ratio can exhibit robust performances on both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Benefitting from the partially amorphous feature, the catalytically active high-valence species are easy to generate and stabilize, thus further realizing enhanced electrooxidation activity with the aid of an internal 2D charge transfer pathway and native Ni3+ ions. As expected, the partially amorphous catalyst exhibits a higher OER current of 284.4 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 500 mV, which shows 2.2-10.0 times enhancement than the counterparts with various Ni:Fe ratios. In addition, the UOR current density of the partially amorphous catalyst at 1.8 V vs. RHE shows 1.6 and 2.4 times increment relative to fully amorphous and highly crystalline catalysts, and 2.7-9.4 fold larger than the catalysts with other Ni:Fe ratios. The optimization strategy of designing the partially amorphous bifunctional catalyst in this work may broaden the way of searching for advanced electrocatalysts for simultaneous waste water treatment and clean energy production.									145	11	0	0	5	0	146			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000443272700019

However, the electrocatalysis of the OER during water splitting is often carried out by using noble metal catalysts, such as RuO2 or IrO2 with high-cost and limited stability. Herein, we reported a successful synthesis of a ternary nickel monophosphosulfide (NiPS) compound via a simple solid-state route and further investigated its electrocatalytic performances for water oxidation. It is found that the NiPS electrocatalyst exhibits good OER performance in 1.0 M KOH solution, i.e., achieving a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 400 mV and a Tafel slope of 126 mV dec(-1), comparable to commercial benchmark RuO2. The ternary NiPS electrocatalyst for the OER is superior to its binary counterparts, i.e., Ni2P and NiS. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with ex situ XPS were performed to obtain further insights into the intrinsic catalytic mechanism of NiPS, and their results clearly revealed that the instability of the NivO intermediate during the OH* -> O* process and the easy oxidation of the (PS)(3-) anion favoring the formation of hydroxyl-based species (i.e., Ni(OH)(2)/ NiOOH) on the surface of the catalyst, which plays a crucial role in facilitating the OER activity. Furthermore, we creatively extended this method to the fabrication of heteroatom substituted catalysts and a new quaternary CoNiP2S2 compound was successfully synthesized for the first time in the same way. The structural properties and electrocatalytic performance towards the OER for CoNiP2S2 (e.g., 20 mA cm(-2) at 376 mV) are also systematically investigated in this work.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000687745500001	34581378

The performance of CeO2-Fe(2)O(3 )composite as a photocatalyst for water splitting reaction was evaluated and CeO2-Fe2O3 mixed oxide in 1:1 proportion was identified as the optimum composition for the photo reaction. 1 g/L composition yields 359.2 mu mol h(-1) hydrogen. Yield of hydrogen production was increased to 583.7 mu mol h(-1), when the reaction was carried out in presence of t-butanol.

Since their discovery in 2010, these enzymes have received extensive attention in both fundamental and applied research due to their remarkable oxidative power and synergistic interplay with hydrolytic enzymes. The harsh and unnatural conditions used in industrial enzymatic saccharification processes and the sensitivity of LPMOs for damage induced by reactive oxygen species call for enzyme engineering to develop LPMOs to become robust industrial biocatalysts. Other engineering targets include improved catalytic activity, adjusted substrate specificity and the introduction of completely new activities. Reaching these targets not only requires appropriate methods for measuring enzyme activity, but also requires in-depth knowledge of the active site and the reaction mechanism, which is yet to be achieved in the LPMO field. Here we describe what has been done in the LPMO engineering field so far. Furthermore, we address the difficulties involved in properly assessing LPMO functionality, which are due to common side reactions taking place in LPMO reactions and which complicate screening methods.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0076-6879		978-0-12-824431-9	WOS:000612553000002	32943141

We report herein the adoption of a hydrothermal reaction combined with a post gas-phase doping strategy to fabricate P-doped NiCo2Se4 hollow nanoneedle arrays on carbon fiber paper (i.e., P-NiCo2Se4/CFP). Notably, the optimal arrays (P-8.71-NiCo2Se4/CFP) can afford an outstanding pH-universal HER performance, with an overpotential as low as 33, 57, and 69 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) and corresponding Tafel slopes down to 52, 61, and 72 mV center dot dec(-1) in acidic, alkaline, and neutral media, respectively, outperforming most state-of-the-art nonprecious catalysts and even the commercial Pt/C catalyst in both neutral and alkaline media at large current densities. Impressively, P-8.71-NiCo2Se4/CFP also displays good durability toward long-time stability testing in harsh acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Experimental and theoretical studies further reveal that the doping of P atoms into NiCo2Se4 can simultaneously optimize its H* adsorption/desorption energy, water adsorption energy, and water dissociation energy by adjusting the local electronic states of various active sites, thus accelerating the rate-determining step of HER in different pH media to endow P-NiCo2Se4 with an outstanding pH-universal HER performance. This work provides atomic-level insights into the roles of active sites in various electrolysis environments, thereby shedding new light on the rational design of highly efficient pH-universal nonprecious catalysts for HER and beyond.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000823385500003

Three electrolytes, including pure 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ionic liquid, 50 mol.% butyl acetate and 50 mol.% water were studied. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to examine discharge performance and the effects of butyl acetate and water additions. Galvanostatic measurements indicate that butyl acetate is an excellent additive, which can significantly improve the battery performance by reducing electrolyte impedance by increasing conductivity. However, while water also improved electrolyte discharge performance, it was consumed by the hydrogen evolution reaction over the 72 h discharge.

The structure remains unchanged during the preparation (controlled hydrolysis), and titania material with a similar rod-shaped structure is created. The decomposition process has been evaluated by TA/MS analysis as a three-step process. The first step was characterized by water and carbon dioxide loss, the second step is represented by the evolution of residual water and ammonia, and the third step is represented by a very sharp exothermic peak due to the phase transition (crystallization of amorphous phase to anatase) together with a small mass loss caused by evolution of oxygen and nitrous oxide. EPR spectra obtained in the temperature range 100-250 K confirmed the presence of Ti(III) ions and oxygen vacancies for the TiO2 precursor annealed up to 550 degrees C in a vacuum. Annealing to 500 degrees C resulted in the generation of paramagnetic Ti(III) centers and nitrogen species (N-b and NO) in anatase lattice.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000383142000009

Herein, the NiFe-LDH nanosheets induced by ZIF-67 (NiFe-LDH/ZIF-67) were prepared via a coupling method of a self-sacrificing template method and a co-precipitation method. Atomic force microscope and field emission transmission electron microscopy analysis indicate that NiFe-LDH/ZIF-67 consist of thin porous nanosheets. X-ray photoelectron spectra analysis show that NiFe-LDH/ZIF-67 contains more oxygen vacancies than pristine NiFe-LDH. The overpotential of NiFe-LDH/ZIF-67 is 222 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, lower than that of ZIF-67, pristine NiFe-LDH, and the commercial RuO2, indicating that its high electrocatalytic activity for OER. The high electrocatalytic activity of NiFe-LDH/ZIF-67 may be attributed to its thin porous nanosheet structure, which is derived from the structural influence of ZIF-67 and the coupling effect of a self-sacrificing template method and a co-precipitation method.

After heating the fibres under vacuum or in argon at 1270, 1470, and 1570 K, their reactivity was determined with molecular oxygen at 1170 K and their surface composition was analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Treatment under a vacuum led to severe degradation of the fibres due to chemical reactions between SiC, SiO2 and carbon. As a result, the silica layer initially present at the surface of the fibre disappeared and an oxygen-deficient silica compound was formed. On the contrary, the formation of silica at the fibre surface was observed during the treatment in argon and the chemical changes were more limited.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0022-2461			WOS:A1996VP57100012

Yet a fundamental understanding of the differences is still lacking. In this work, we carried out a systematic comparative density functional theory (DFT) investigation of the mechanisms and energetics of water oxidation on rutile TiO2 (110), anatase TiO2 (101), and brookite TiO2 (210) model surfaces. Our results indicate that for all three phases, the most facile mechanism of water oxidation proceeds as a two-electron/proton process toward H2O2 formation via surface peroxo O* intermediates. The calculated overall overpotentials toward H2O2 formation are similar to 0.27, 0.51, and 0.62 V on rutile, anatase, and brookite, respectively. The rate-limiting steps toward H2O2 formation are the OH* formation step for all three phases. We studied also the effect of pH. pH alters the binding energies of the reaction intermediates and affects the threshold values for the 1-electron, 2-electron, and 4-electron processes but does not affect the selectivity. Overpotentials for the 4-electron O-2 evolution range from 0.8, 1.04, and similar to 1.15 V on rutile, anatase, and brookite, respectively, with the same rate-determining steps as for the 2-electron process. Under photocatalytic conditions of light irradiation corresponding to the redox potential versus NHE of photogenerated holes in the valence band of the materials (similar to 3.0 V for rutile, similar to 3.2 V for anatase, and similar to 3.3 V for brookite), there is enough energy to drive the 4-electron O-2 evolution spontaneously as well. Under these conditions, product selectivity (H2O2 vs O-2) may require characterizing the reaction kinetics rather than coming out from the thermodynamic overpotentials.									13	0	0	0	4	0	13			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000526319300004

Reported herein is the first example of selenium phosphorus co-doped cobalt oxide nanosheets on highly conductive Co foil collector (CoOSeP@Co foil), fabricated by successively selenylation and phosphorization of a pre-oxidized Co foil, as a novel bifunctional electrode for water electrolysis. Due to the improved intrinsic catalytic activity of cobalt oxide derived from doping and the strong interaction between active CoOSeP nanosheets and highly conductive Co foil collector, the designed CoOSeP@Co foil integrated electrode displays favorable catalytic activities towards both HER and OER in strongly alkaline media, achieving an electrocatalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 155 mV for HER and 347 mV for OER, respectively. Beyond that, the electrode could keep working and maintain its catalytic activity for at least 30 h. Furthermore, an alkaline electrolyzer constructed by employing CoOSeP@Co foil as an integrated bifunctional electrode in both the cathode and anode can generate 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.74 V and shows good long-term stability of more than 30 h. This work not only opens a new avenue to improve the intrinsic catalytic activity of materials by co-doping with heteroatoms, but also brings us a new idea for designing other cost-effective, self-supported, efficient and robust overall water splitting electrodes.

However, identifying a desirable cathodic catalyst for this promising battery system is one of the biggest challenges at present. In this work, a multi-layered Fe2O3/graphene nanosheets (Fe2O3/GNS) composite with sandwich structure was synthesized using an easy thermal casting method, and served as a cathodic catalyst for aprotic Li-O-2 batteries. The aprotic Li-O-2 cell with the Fe2O3/GNS catalyst demonstrated a better reversibility, lower overpotential for oxygen evolution, and a higher Coulombic efficiency (close to 100%) than those of pure GNS. An excellent rate performance and good cycle stability were also confirmed. The results, characterized by ex and in situ methods, revealed that the dominant discharge product Li2O2 was decomposed below 4.35 V. This superior electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the unique sandwich structure of the Fe2O3/GNS catalyst with mesopores, which can provide. substantially more catalytic sites and prevent direct contact between carbon and Li2O2.									19	1	0	0	0	0	20			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000384064400015	27479810

In order to reveal ligands' effects, many descriptors have been proposed, which allow statistical analysis to be implemented in mining the structure-property relationship and providing mechanistic insights. This work combines the steric and electronic effects into a descriptor, %V-bur (min) - 3 center dot HOMO-LUMO gap (eV) where %V-bur (min) is the minimum percent buried volume and the Boltzmann averaged gap is used. Volcano plots were well presented by yields (y-axis) and the descriptor (x-axis) for Ni- and Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. In addition, volcano peaks in these plots can be located to optimize reaction yields for experiments. Our work sheds light on the reaction mechanisms of phosphine ligands and delivers a strategy for choosing ligands in cross-coupling catalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1948-7185			WOS:000743208400001	35005955

Here, we synthesize a nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous flower-like carbon nanosheets decorated with nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots. The hierarchically porosity heteroatom-doped flower-like carbon nanosheets are first synthesized using MgO as hard template, KOH/NaOH as activator, lignin/urea as carbon/heteroatom source, and then lignin-based carbon quantum dots (CQDs) fabricated via microwave hydrothermal are compounded with carbon nanosheets after a one-step hydrothermal treatment. Benefitting from the interconnection of its 3D graphite shell network, abun-dant active sites, high specific surface area, and multi-scale pore structure, the n-HPFN@CQDs exhibits favorable ORR activity and stability in 0.1 mol KOH media. Compared with commercial Pt/C, the assembled Zn-air bat-teries using n-HPFN@CQDs as electrode catalysts exhibit comparable discharge performance. This work syn-thesized a novel and green biomass-based carbon composite materials achieving high-performance for energy conversion applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000842984400001

So far, studies have been conducted primarily with thioredoxin-linked members of the stroma that function in a broad array of biosynthetic and degradatory processes. Consequently, little is known about the role of redox in regulating the growing number of enzymes found to occur in the lumen, the site of oxygen evolution in thylakoid membranes. To help fill this gap, we have studied AtFKBP13, an FKBP-type immunophilin earlier shown to interact with a redoxactive protein of the lumen, and found the enzyme to contain a pair of disulfide bonds in x-ray structural studies. These disulfides, which in protein mutagenesis experiments were shown to be essential for the associated peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity, are unique to chloroplast FKBPs and are absent in animal and yeast counterparts. Both disulfide bonds were redox-active and were reduced by thioredoxin from either chloroplast or bacterial sources in a reaction that led to loss of enzyme activity. The results suggest a previously unrecognized paradigm for redox regulation in chloroplasts in which activation by light is achieved in concert with oxygen evolution by the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups (conversion of SH to S-S). Such a mechanism, occurring in the thylakoid lumen, is in direct contrast to regulation of enzymes in the stroma, where reduction of disulfides targeted by thioredoxin (S-S converted to SH) leads to an increase in activity in the light.									90	3	0	0	83	0	94			0027-8424			WOS:000224069800045	15356344

Here we report our findings in the development of a very active and durable HER electrocatalyst derived from a one-pot synthesis of highly porous molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) nanoparticles uniformly dispersed on nitrogen-doped graphene-like carbon. The nanocomposite catalyst displays excellent HER activity and durability in an acidic electrolyte among all non-noble-metal catalysts ever reported. The remarkable performance is attributed to the unique nanostructure of the Mo2C phase, the conductive nitrogen-doped graphene-like carbon network, the high porosity of the hybrid, and the synergistic effect between the Mo2C and the carbon substrate. Further, the facile and low-cost synthetic strategy for preparation of such nanostructures may open up opportunities for exploiting other high-performance electrocatalysts for various applications.

It is demonstrated herein that introducing physical linear defects (PLDs) upon the basal plane surface of 2D-hBN gives rise to electrochemically useful signatures. The reason for this transformation from insulator to semiconductor (inferred from physicochemical and computational characterisation) is likely due to full hydrogenation and oxygen passivation of the boron and/or nitrogen at edge sites. This results in a decrease in the band gap (from ca. 6.11 to 2.36/2.84 eV; theoretical calculated values, for the fully hydrogenated oxygen passivation at the N or B respectively). The 2D-hBN films are shown to be tailored through the introduction of PLDs, with the electrochemical behaviour dependent upon the surface coverage of edge plane-sites/defects, which is correlated with electrochemical performance towards redox probes (hexaammineruthenium(iii) chloride and Fe2+/3+) and the hydrogen evolution reaction. This manuscript de-convolutes, for the first time, the fundamental electron transfer properties of 2D-hBN, demonstrating that through implementation of PLDs, one can beneficially tailor the electrochemical properties of this nanomaterial.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2516-0230			WOS:000508943100017	36133988

The evolution process of NO2 on the Au surface and its products are still seriously controversial. Here, the molecular evolution of NO2 on a nanostructured Au surface in the atmosphere is studied by time-dependent in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. According to the spectral measurements and density functional theory-based simulations, it has been found that when NO2 contacts the Au surface in the air with enough relative humidity (greater than or similar to 20%), chemisorbed NO2 species would be produced quickly, and after a short induction period (about 1 min), would evolve into NO[Au(NO3)(4)], which subsequently decomposes into O-2 and NO, and/or deliquesce into the adsorbed NO2 and -OH as well as HNO3, depending on the temperature and the relative humidity. Further experiments show that the presence of O-2 and H2O molecules is crucial to such molecular evolution of NO2 on the Au surface in the atmosphere. Finally, a H2O and O-2 -assisted reaction mechanism is proposed and nicely describes the molecular evolution of NO2 on the Au surface. This work provides sufficient spectral evidences for the molecular evolution of NO2 on the Au surface in the atmosphere, and offers a new insight into the interaction between NO2 and the Au surface.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000873956900001

During prolonged electrowinning under galvanostatic conditions, a rise in temperature leads to depolarisation of the reaction on all three anodes. At 45 degreesC, the potential of the Pb-Co3O4 anode is about 40 mV lower than Pb-Sb and about 70 mV lower than the Pb-Ca-Sn anode.Both at 1 and 5 A dm(-2), the potential of the Pb-Co3O4 anode is lower than those on the other anodes under the same conditions. Therefore, the use of a Pb-Co3O4 anode under conditions similar to those used industrially (45 degreesC and 5 A dm(-2)) should cause a decrease in energy consumption.At all temperatures and current densities examined, the corrosion rate of the Pb-Co3O4 anode was the lowest of the three.

Natural photosynthetic systems achieve an analogous feat during water splitting and employ a range of intermediate redox mediators such as quinone derivatives to aid this process. Drawing on this natural example, we show that a low molecular weight quinone derivative is capable of decoupling H-2 evolution from O-2 evolution at scale during electrochemical water splitting. This work could significantly lower the cost of ECPBs, paving the way for their. more widespread adoption in water splitting.									89	4	0	0	7	0	95			0002-7863			WOS:000330163000012	23978004

Kumar, Priyank Vijaya/GLU-4829-2022				The Impact of Functionalization on the Stability, Work Function, and Photoluminescence of Reduced Graphene Oxide								ACS NANO				7	2			1638	1645		10.1021/nn305507p				FEB 2013	2013	Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is a promising material for a variety of thin-film optoelectronic applications. Two main barriers to its widespread use are the lack of (1) fabrication protocols leading to tailored functionalization of the graphene sheet with oxygen-containing chemical groups, and (2) understanding of the impact of such functional groups on the stability and on the optical and electronic properties of rGO. We carry out classical molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations on a large set of realistic rGO structures to decompose the effects of different functional groups on the stability, work function, and photoluminescence. Our calculations indicate the metastable nature of carbonyl-rich rGO and its favorable transformation to hydroxyl-rich rGO at room temperature via carbonyl-to-hydroxyl conversion reactions near carbon vacancies and holes. We demonstrate a significant tunability in the work function of rGO up to 2.5 eV by altering the composition of oxygen-containing functional groups for a fixed oxygen concentration, and of the photoluminescence emission by modulating the fraction of epoxy and carbonyl groups. Taken together, our results guide the application of tailored rGO structures in devices for optoelectronics and renewable energy.									212	5	0	0	13	0	216			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000315618700085	23368710	
J	Iliuta, I; Larachi, F								Biomass accumulation and clogging in trickle-bed bioreactors								AICHE JOURNAL				50	10			2541	2551		10.1002/aic.10201				OCT 2004	2004	Excessive biomass formation in two-phase flow trickle-bed bioreactors induces clogging and leads to the progressive obstruction of the bed that is accompanied with a buildup in pressure drop and flow channeling. Currently, physical models linking the two-phase flow to the space-time evolution of biological clogging are virtually nonexistent. An attempt has been made with this contribution to fill in this gap by developing a unidirectional dynamic multiphase flow model based on the volume-average mass, momentum, and species balance equations. Phenol biodegradation by Pseudomonas putida as the predominant species immobilized on activated carbon was chosen as a case study to illustrate the consequences of formation of excessive amounts of biomass. Furthermore, in developing the transient model, the following basic processes were assumed to occur and have been accounted for in the mathematical model: oxygen transport from gas into liquid bulks, phenol, and oxygen transport from the liquid phase to the biofilm surface, simultaneous diffusion and reaction of phenol and oxygen within biofilm, as well as their simultaneous diffusion and adsorption within the porous supporting particles.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy showed discrete crystalline nanoparticles decorating the surface of the porous carbon support, where the size could be controlled in the range of 2-8 nm and depended on the number of Pd ALD cycles performed. X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Pd K-edge revealed that the carbon supported Pd existed in a mixed phase of metallic palladium and palladium oxide. The conformality of ALD allowed us to uniformly disperse the Pd catalyst onto the carbon support while preserving the initial porous structure. As a result, the charging and discharging performance of the oxygen cathode in a Li-O-2 cell was improved. Our results suggest that ALD is a promising technique for tailoring the surface composition and structure of nanoporous supports in energy storage devices.									168	11	0	0	5	0	171			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000330158900035	23927754

In this work, the ternary nickel-molybdenum-boron (NiMoB) electrocatalyst is systematically studied and the best optimized NiMoB electrode demonstrates better electrochemical water splitting performance over the benchmark elec-trodes of Pt/C parallel to RuO2 at high current density. Along with the systematic fabrication parameter optimization, the ternary NiMoB electrocatalyst with the multi-sphere morphology demonstrates significantly high active surface area, low impedance, and low reaction energy barriers with the improved crystallinity of electrodes and absorption and desorption of intermediates. The incorporation of boron in the transition metal matrix of Ni-Mo significantly boosts up the water splitting capability by lowering the kinetic barriers with the electron enriched metallic sites and improved stability of electrodes. Specifically, the turnover overpotential of 1.61 V is achieved at 50 mA/cm(2) in 1 M KOH with the improved hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics in a 2-electrode system. More importantly, the NiMoB electrocatalyst demonstrates better performances at high current range above 1250 mA/cm(2) in 1 M KOH and 1100 mA/cm(2) in seawater (SW) + 1 M KOH. The NiMoB parallel to NiMoB also demonstrates an equivalent water splitting performance in the real SW + 1 M KOH solution. In addition, a very stable chronoamperometry (CA) operation over 12 h at 500 mA/cm(2) and 1,000-time repetition of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) over 8 h in 6 M KOH at 60 degrees C confirm that the opti-mized electrode can demonstrate stable and repetitive operations in an industrial electrochemical water splitting condition.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2352-9407			WOS:000834599700001

The mutual diffusion process between Ru and Pd is characterized by the high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping, and the synchrotron radiation photoemission spectroscopy measurements. The mesoporous Pd@Ru nanorods exhibit superior catalytic performance and stability for hydrogen evolution reactions (overpotentials of 30 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution and 37 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution).									51	3	0	0	1	0	51			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000447355300041	30211535

The effect on Cu(II) reduction of the PPy-modified film was investigated through potentiostatic and potentiodynamic conditions and compared with that of SS. A higher removal efficiency was achieved on PPy because of its catalytic effect. The current efficiency obtained with the PPy film is much higher than that of SS because PPy inhibits the effect of hydrogen evolution and this is the greatest advantage for using PPy to remove heavy metals. Cyclic voltammetry of PPy-modified electrodes in acidified Cu(II) solutions was conducted and the mechanism of PPy for Cu(II) reduction was discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-6818			WOS:000271957600013

The experimental result indicated that the output current of reactorneutrino irradiated detector was appreciably larger than that of natural environmental one. Usual interaction cross-sections of neutrinos are quite small, so that they do not explain the experimental result at all.Materials and Methods: To understand the experimental data, we propose that some biological products may generate AV-type scalar field B0 , leading to a large interaction cross-section. The output current generation is ascribed to an electrochemical process that may be assisted by weak interaction phenomena. Dissolved oxygen concentrations in the detector solution were measured in this study, for the purpose of understanding the mechanism of the detector output current generation.Results and Discussion: It was found that the time evolution of experimental output current was mostly reproduced in simulation calculation on the basis of the measured dissolved oxygen concentration.Conclusion: We mostly explained the variation of experimental data by using the electrochemical half-cell analysis model based on the DO concentration that is consistent to the experiment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2508-1888			KJD:ART002179674

We use the valued of delta2H and delta18O, combined with concentrations of ions to discuss the changing rule of H and O isotopes throughout the flowback period. The values of delta2H and delta18O for Z2 and Z5 wells show different changing trends. But he values of delta2H and delta18O for Z2 and Z5 wells have similar changing trends. There is no obvious correlation between hydrogen and oxygen isotopes for 3 wells.

The Kinetic Mechanisms of Diffuse Nanosecond Pulsed Discharge in the Degradation of HCHO								2017 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)								1 pp.	1 pp.		10.1109/PLASMA.2017.8496269				2017	2017	Summary form only given. It has been proposed that nanosecond pulsed discharge (NPD) has unique advantages in the degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with optimized ionization efficiency and prevented thermal instability1, 2. Since the complex kinetics processes of physicochemical and chemical reactions in the plasma system, the kinetics mechanisms for VOCs degradation and the control of by-production are still uncertain. In this work, a diffuse nanosecond pulsed dielectric barrier discharge plasma source is developed for the degradation of HCHO using needles array to plate electrode configuration. The fast exposure images, the time evolution for electrical behavior, and the temporal resolved spectra are used to study the instantaneous characteristics of the discharge and understand the mechanisms of plasma processes. On the assist of instantaneous characteristics, the kinetic mechanisms of physiochemical processes for active species conversion and HCHO degradation are described. It is shown that the metastable nitrogen molecules play the important role in the generation of high energy level state excited particles of N2 (C3Piu, C5Piu) in the generation of active species of O, H and OH, and in the degradation of HCHO. The oxygen mole fraction has the obvious influences on variety and number density of active species. Corresponding for the mechanisms of HCHO degradation, the radicals OH and H are the dominate particles at low oxygen mole fraction (< 2%), the atom O becomes the dominate species when the oxygen mole fraction is higher than 5%. And for metastable nitrogen molecules, they still occupy the quotient for about 10%-12% of the HCHO degradation radio when the OMF is 5-21%, although their number densities lower than atom O about 3 orders in magnitude.					2017 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)2017 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)	21-25 May 201721-25 May 2017		Atlantic City, NJ, USAAtlantic City, NJ, USA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-5090-5243-1	INSPEC:18192437

In this work, sub-nanometer sized palladium clusters accommodated into porous ceria were successfully synthesized. The characterizations from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) showed that the synthesized Pd sub-nanoclusters have a size of about 0.5 nm. The Pd clusters confined in CeO2 pores (donated as Pd NCs@CeO2) showed highly efficient electrocatalytic activity and stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The electrochemical results indicated that HER on the Pd clusters presents an onset potential of -0.036 V vs RHE and approximately 100 times higher current density than that from the commercial Pt/C at the low-potential region. Further insights from density functional theory suggest that the active centers are the subunit of Pd clusters rather than CeO2 support based on the free energy of absorption for hydrogen atoms (Delta G(H*)). Meanwhile, compared to the free Pd nanoclusters, the electron transfer between Pd and O atoms in Pd NC@CeO2 can effectively modulate the adsorption state of H* on the subunit of the Pd cluster, and this cojoint effect can effectively promote the HER catalytic activity of the composite system. We hope this work can lay the foundation for the application of precious metal nanocluster-transition metal oxide composites in hydrogen energy and other catalysis fields.									26	4	0	0	0	0	28			2574-0962			WOS:000459948900004		
J	Ghasemi, Z.; Tizpar, A.								Effect of selenium doping on corrosion and electrochemical performance of Pb-Sb-As-Se alloys as positive grids in hybrid lead-acid batteries								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE				3	6			727	745						JUN 2008	2008	The effect of selenium as an alloying additive on the electrochemical behavior, corrosion resistance and microstructure of Pb-Sb-As alloys as positive grids of hybrid lead-acid batteries was studied. This investigation was performed by means of weight-loss measurements, Potentiodynamic Sweeping (PS), cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), hardness measurements and optical microscopy. Studies on Pb-Sb-As-Se alloys (Se= 0.007, 0.0108, 0.0141 and 0.0207 wt%) indicate that with increasing selenium concentration in the alloy composition, corrosion currents and corrosion rates decrease and corrosion potentials shift to negative values and the variations are proportional to selenium contents. In addition, selenium increases hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction overepotentials. So, it decreases the rate of gas evolution reaction in lead acid batteries. The electrochemical impedance of oxide film on the alloy with selenium is much larger than that of the oxide formed on the Pb-Sb-As alloy and it increases with increasing selenium content in the alloy. The a. c. impedance data show that the high content of selenium greatly inhibits the growth of passivation layer and increases the polarization resistance of the alloys. Optical microscopy was used to study the microstructure of Pb-Sb-As alloys with different concentrations of selenium. The results show that, selenium has an important role in reducing the size of the grains and causes to decrease the reduction reaction of PbO2 to PbSO4 that means corrosion resistance of the alloy increases. Also, selenium addition increases the hardness of Pb-Sb-As alloy that it is more considerable in the high selenium contents. The discharge capacities of lead-acid batteries made of these grids by using Pb-Ca grids as negative electrodes were investigated. The results during the first 25 cycles show that selenium has a beneficial effect on discharge capacities during the later cycles.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			1452-3981			WOS:000256384100006		
J	NEDBAL, L; GIBAS, C; WHITMARSH, J					Gibas, Cynthia/0000-0002-1288-9543			LIGHT SATURATION CURVES SHOW COMPETENCE OF THE WATER SPLITTING COMPLEX IN INACTIVE PHOTOSYSTEM-II REACTION CENTERS								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				30	2-3			85	94		10.1007/BF00042006				DEC 1991	1991	Photosystem II complexes of higher plants are structurally and functionally heterogeneous. While the only clearly defined structural difference is that Photosystem II reaction centers are served by two distinct antenna sizes, several types of functional heterogeneity have been demonstrated. Among these is the observation that in dark-adapted leaves of spinach and pea, over 30% of the Photosystem II reaction centers are unable to reduce plastoquinone to plastoquinol at physiologically meaningful rates. Several lines of evidence show that the impaired reaction centers are effectively inactive, because the rate of oxidation of the primary quinone acceptor, Q(A), is 1000 times slower than in normally active reaction centers. However, there are conflicting opinions and data over whether inactive Photosystem II complexes are capable of oxidizing water in the presence of certain artificial electron acceptors. In the present study we investigated whether inactive Photosystem II complexes have a functional water oxidizing system in spinach thylakoid membranes by measuring the flash yield of water oxidation products as a function of flash intensity. At low flash energies (less than 10% saturation), selected to minimize double turnovers of reaction centers, we found that in the presence of the artificial quinone acceptor, dichlorobenzoquinone (DCBQ), the yield of proton release was enhanced 20 +/- 2% over that observed in the presence of dimethylbenzoquinone (DMBQ). We argue that the extra proton release is from the normally inactive Photosystem II reaction centers that have been activated in the presence of DCBQ, demonstrating their capacity to oxidize water in repetitive flashes, as concluded by Graan and Ort (Biochim Biophys Acta (1986) 852:320-330). The light saturation curves indicate that the effective antenna size of inactive reaction centers is 55 +/- 12% the size of active Photosystem II centers. Comparison of the light saturation dependence of steady state oxygen evolution in the presence of DCBQ or DMBQ support the conclusion that inactive Photosystem II complexes have a functional water oxidation system.									18	0	0	0	18	0	18			0166-8595			WOS:A1991HH41400003	24415257

The photocatalytic water-splitting reaction using semiconductor powders has been intensively studied as a promising technology for direct and simple solar energy conversion. However, the evolution of H-2 and O-2 gases in a stoichiometric ratio (H-2/O-2 = 2) is very difficult owing to various issues, such as an unfavorable backward reaction and mismatched band potentials. Two important findings have widened the variety of photocatalysts available for stoichiometric water-splitting, viz. the carbonate anion effect and the Z-scheme photocatalytic reaction using a redox mediator. The bicarbonate anion has been found to act as a redox catalyst via preferential peroxide formation and subsequent decomposition to O-2. As the Z-scheme reaction using a redox mediator mitigates band potential mismatches, it is widely applicable for various visible-light-active photocatalysts. This review describes the development of photocatalytic water-splitting for solar hydrogen production using the carbonate anion effect and the Z-scheme reaction. Moreover, recent developments in photocatalysis-electrolysis hybrid systems, an advanced Z-scheme reaction concept, are also reviewed for practical and economical hydrogen production.									92	3	0	0	4	0	92			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000477771300003

It is based on oxygen and carbon mass balances in the ladle and in the vacuum vessel. Oxygen and carbon eventually introduced during the treatment lair leakage, oxygen blowing metal alloying etc.) are taken into account.Three mechanisms are at the origin of carbon removal from the metal by CO production in the vacuum vessel :spontaneous CO boiling in the metal layer just beneath bath surface where carbon and oxygen contents are in excess with respect to the equilibrium CO partial pressure;decarburization by purging gas in zones where metal and injected gas bubbles are in contact;decarburization of metal drops projected in the vacuum vessel by bubble bursting.Results - DiscussionReliable and precise measurements of reaction rates are deduced from continuous exhaust gas analysis and flow rare measurements in the RH-OB reactor at the Sollac Dunkirk plant.The experimental results indicate that :during most of the treatment, CO boiling is responsible for the largest part of decarburization ;at the end of the treatment, with the decrease of carbon content, the boiling mechanism is progressively going out and decarburization of metal droplets splashed in the vacuum vessel becomes dominating.As a consequence, in the ultra-low carbon range (below 10 ppm), the apparent kinetics constant ak/S becomes independent of carbon content and appears to be proportional to the total gas flow rate crossing the bath surface.This first order kinetics relatively to the carbon content is consistent with a decarburization regime dominated by the metal splashing phenomenonThe validated model is used to :evaluate the effect of operating parameters (initial C and O contents, neutral gas flow rates injected in snorkel and vacuum vessel, grading during vacuum treatment, etc.) ;define standard treatment conditions (treatment time, additions pattern, etc.) for obtaining the desired steel composition,define new required equipment characteristics (vacuum system, etc.) or new operating conditions (oxygen-blowing, etc.).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0035-1563			WOS:000084429600005		
J	Wei, Min; Zhang, Dandan; Deng, Jie; Xiao, Xin; Wang, Lixia; Wang, Xiaopeng; Song, Meirong; Wang, Shun; Zheng, Xianfu; Liu, Xiaobiao								Cu-Doping Effect on the Electrocatalytic Properties of Self-Supported Cu-Doped Ni3S2 Nanosheets for Hydrogen Production via Efficient Urea Oxidation								INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH				61	23			7777	7786		10.1021/acs.iecr.2c00482				JUN 15 2022	2022	The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is considered as a substitutable oxidation process to supplant the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for pure and clean hydrogen generation because of its much lower theoretic thermodynamic onset potential. Preparing heteroatomically doped and self-supported three-dimensional (3D) catalysts has become an efficient pathway to promote the electrochemical performance of catalysts. Recently, Cu-based complexes have been investigated as OER catalysts and exhibited improved catalytic activities. However, Cu-doped composites as UOR catalysts have been rarely reported, and the effect of Cu remains unclear in the UOR process. The present work exhibits a self-supported electrocatalyst of Cu-doped Ni3S2 nanosheets supported on Ni foam (NF) synthesized via a direct one-step hydrothermal sulfuration method and unlocks the effect of Cu on the relationship between the catalyst structure and UOR performance. The doping of the Cu element transformed the morphology of Ni3S2 from nanoparticles to nanosheets, increasing the active surface area. Meanwhile, the Cu dopant regulated the electronic structure of Cu-doped Ni3S2 by promoting electron transport from the Ni atom to the Cu dopant, stimulating the formation of active Ni sites with a high valency during UOR. Moreover, the doping of the Cu element optimized the Gibbs adsorption energies of the pivotal intermediates during urea oxidation. Remarkably, as-prepared Cu-doped Ni3S2/NF required only 1.30 V vs RHE toward UOR and an overpotential of 188 mV toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) with outstanding electrochemical durability. Besides, the overall urea electrolyzer constructed using Cu-doped Ni3S2/NF as the UOR and HER catalyst needed only 1.57 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) with stable durability during a long-term test. The present research offers novel insights into the research for designing and preparing efficient and durable electrodes in urea oxidation applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0888-5885			WOS:000812426700001

Water oxidation using visible-light-responsive LaNbON2 is challenging because the synthesis of the oxynitride has rarely been studied. Herein, we report the synthesis of small LaNbON2 particles and their size effect on photocatalytic water oxidation under visible light illumination. The small scheelite-type LaNbO4, prepared by a polymerized complex method, was transformed into less-defective LaNbON2 during nitridation as compared with that nitrided from LaNbO4 via a solid-state reaction method. The small LaNbON2 particles, capable of absorbing intense visible light 700 nm above, improved the O-2 evolution during 5 h of water oxidation under 300 W Xe light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm). This enhancement was attributed to the size reduction of LaNbON2 particles, leading to increased surface area and encouragement of mild nitridation.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0253-2964	1229-5949		WOS:000607355300001

However, the conductivity of wood is poor, which restricts its application in energy storage. In this research, a novel material with Li-Na metal compounds inserted into porous carbonized lignin free wood (PCLFW) as a bifunctional hybrid is synthesized. This material with a high specific capacitance, high power density and excellent electrocatalytic activity is synthesized. The final product shows a high specific capacitance of 255 F g(-1), high energy density of 31.88 Wh kg(-1) and power density of 3188 W kg(-1). Moreover, after experiencing 5000 cycles, the specific capacitance is maintained at 239 F g(-1) (capacitance retention of 93%). In addition, the hybrid exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities in alkaline solution, with overpotentials of 349 mV (Tafel = 192 mV dec(-1)) and 484 mV (Tafel = 184 mV dec(-1)), respectively. Mean-while, the hybrid also shows a larger initial and half-wave potentials of -0.12 V and -0.22 V, reflecting an outstanding oxidation-reduction reaction (ORR) property. In a word, this work provides a new idea for us to fabricate wood-based hybrid for high-performance energy storage devices and carbon-based catalysts. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

It uses in situ pyrolysis of mixed glucose, dicyandiamide (DCDA), and RuCl3, followed by an acid treatment, and a final heat treatment to introduce in-plane holes of various sizes. A novel transmission method in scanning electron microscopy was successfully implemented to directly visualize the holes with color contrast. A low accelerating voltage of 5 kV enabled prolonged observation without significant electron beam damage. The mechanisms of hole creation were examined in detail using various characterization techniques as well as control experiments. The Ru QDs had significant catalytic activity and resulted in larger in-plane holes through the graphene sheets. The mechanical strain and the chemical reactivity of Ru QDs significantly diminished the activation energy barrier for the oxidation of C=C bonds in the graphene structure. The Ru QD/NHG hybrid material was utilized as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction in Li-O-2 batteries, showing much lower charge overpotentials compared to the bare NHG counterpart. The defect-laden holey graphene counterpart can be highly functionalized for multiple applications, leading to a new method of nanoengineering based on atomic scale defects.									42	2	0	0	3	0	43			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000392413600018

We propose the following sequence of events in the evolution of their oxygen delivery system. First, loss of plasma-accessible carbonic anhydrase (CA) in the gill and venous circulations slowed the Jacobs-Stewart cycle and the transfer of acid between the plasma and the red blood cells (RBCs). This ameliorated the effects of a generalised acidosis (associated with an increased capacity for burst swimming) on haemoglobin (Hb)-O-2 binding. Because RBC pH was uncoupled from plasma pH, the importance of Hb as a buffer was reduced. The decrease in buffering was mediated by a reduction in the number of histidine residues on the Hb molecule and resulted in enhanced coupling of O-2 and CO2 transfer through the RBCs. In the absence of plasma CA, nearly all plasma bicarbonate ultimately dehydrated to CO2 occurred via the RBCs, and chloride/bicarbonate exchange was the rate-limiting step in CO2 excretion. This pattern of CO2 excretion across the gills resulted in disequilibrium states for CO2 hydration/dehydration reactions and thus elevated arterial and venous plasma bicarbonate levels. Plasma-accessible CA embedded in arterial endothelia was retained, which eliminated the localized bicarbonate disequilibrium forming CO2 that then moved into the RBCs. Consequently, RBC pH decreased which, in conjunction with pH-sensitive Bohr/Root Hbs, elevated arterial oxygen tensions and thus enhanced tissue oxygenation. Counter-current arrangement of capillaries (retia) at the eye and later the swim bladder evolved along with the gas gland at the swim bladder. Both arrangements enhanced and magnified CO2 and acid production and, therefore, oxygen secretion to those specialised tissues. The evolution of beta-adrenergically stimulated RBC Na+/H+ exchange protected gill O-2 uptake during stress and further augmented plasma disequilibrium states for CO2 hydration/dehydration. Finally, RBC organophosphates (e.g. NTP) could be reduced during hypoxia to further increase Hb-O-2 affinity without compromising tissue O-2 delivery because high-affinity Hbs could still adequately deliver O-2 to the tissues via Bohr/Root shifts. We suggest that the evolution of this unique mode of tissue O-2 transfer evolved in the Triassic/Jurassic Period, when O-2 levels were low, ultimately giving rise to the most extensive adaptive radiation of extant vertebrates, the teleost fishes.									45	1	0	0	45	0	46			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000334673700006	24744420

During the in situ and confined phosphidation process, very small nickel-cobalt mixed metal phosphide nanocrystallites are uniformly incorporated into the simultaneously produced nitrogen-doped carbon matrix. Due to the unique structure and composition, the resultant Ni2P/NiCoP@NCCs possess high electrocatalytic activity and excellent durability for the HER in both acidic and alkaline solutions.									78	4	0	0	3	0	77			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000407641200007

The compound Ca2NiWO6 was characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV-visible diffuse reflectance, and photoluminescence. The photocatalytic properties of the compound for water splitting were investigated under UV and visible light irradiation. The results showed H-2 evolution was not observed over the compound under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm) with a 300 W xenon arc lamp when using methanol (CH3OH) as electron donor, although the compound was responsive to visible light region. Based on the experimental results, a possible band structure was proposed through theoretical calculation of the electronic structure by using the full potential-linearized augmented plane wave (F-LAPW). The band structure and photocatalytic properties were attributed to the special crystal and electronic structures. Due to the oxygen vacancies in the compound, which worked as electron-hole recombination centers, the photocatalytic activity of the compound was low. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In the past few years, single and few-layer MoS2 nanosheets have attracted a wide range of concerns for HERs. In this paper, single crystalline ZnO nanowires and MoS2 nanosheets are fabricated to form MoS2 nanosheet/ZnO nanowire hybrid nanostructure to enhance the hydrogen photogeneration. The results show that the hybridization of ZnO with moderate MoS2 loading could enhance the PEC activity by producing more electrons and holes and reducing their recombination. The synthesis of MoS2/ZnO composites proposed an effective way to build low cost and highly active HER catalysts. Moreover, the study on MoS2/ZnO composites sheds light to the deep insight into the mechanism of photoelectrocatalytic HERs.									20	1	0	0	0	0	21			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000436943300027

Anchoring of CeO2 onto FeCo LDH produced interfaces between the functionalizing CeO2 and the parent LDH. Comparative electrochemical studies were carried out. Onset potential, overpotential, and Tafel slope point to the superior oxygen-evolving performance of CeO2-FeCo LDH with respect to FeCo LDH, therefore, demonstrating the merits of CeO2 functionalization. The electronic structures of Fe, Co, and Ce were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) from which the increase of Co3+ and the concurrent lowering of Ce4+ were established. With the use of CeO2-FeCo LDH, accelerated formation at a sizably reduced potential of Co-OOH, one of the key intermediates preceding the release of O-2 was observed by in situ Raman spectroscopy. We now have the atomic-level and location-specific evidence, the increase of the active Co3+ across the interface to correlate the enhanced catalytic performance with CeO2 functionalization.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000727155400001

Here, we make the first report of a facile strategy to construct amphiphilic carbon and C-O-C chain linked terminal melem units in functional carbon nitride (COCN) via copolymerizing formaldehyde with melem. By integrating the amphiphilic carrier bridge of carbon and C-O-C chains into the framework, the photogenerated carrier mobility and activated species (superoxide radicals, singlet oxygen) as well as surface interaction are significantly improved. Consequently, the optimal tailoring of C3N4 attains superior photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production (34.9 mu mol h(-1)) and selective oxidation of sulfide to sulfoxide using air (nearly 100% conversion and selectivity after 3 h of illumination), which is about 7 times higher than that of pristine C3N4. This study provides deep insight into and strategies for the atomic tailoring of carrier transfer and surface reaction over organic-based photocatalysts.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000677442000001

For this process, copper is the only metal known to catalyze the CO2RR to hydrocarbons with adequate efficiency, but it suffers from poor selectivity. Copper bimetallic materials have recently shown an improvement in CO2RR selectivity compared with that of copper, such that the secondary metal is likely to play an important role in altering inherent adsorption energetics. This review explores the fundamental role of the secondary metal with a focus on how oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H) affinity affect selectivity in bimetallic electrocatalysts. Here, we identify four metal groups categorized by O and H affinities to determine their CO2RR selectivity trends. By considering experimental and computational studies, we link the effects of extrinsic chemical composition and physical structure to intrinsic intermediate adsorption and reaction pathway selection. After this, we summarize some general trends and propose design strategies for future electrocatalysts.									371	30	0	0	19	0	373			2451-9294			WOS:000441194300009

Herein, we employ spectroelectrochemical techniques to analyse the kinetics of water oxidation on a series of Ni/Fe oxyhydroxide films: FeOOH, FeOOHNiOOH, and Ni(Fe)OOH (5% Fe). The concentrations and reaction rates of the oxidised states accumulated during catalysis are determined. Ni(Fe)OOH is found to exhibit the fastest reaction kinetics but accumulates fewer states, resulting in a similar performance to FeOOHNiOOH. The later catalytic onset in FeOOH is attributed to an anodic shift in the accumulation of oxidised states. Rate law analyses reveal that the rate limiting step for each catalyst involves the accumulation of four oxidised states, Ni-centred for Ni(Fe)OOH but Fe-centred for FeOOH and FeOOHNiOOH. We conclude by highlighting the importance of equilibria between these accumulated species and reactive intermediates in determining the activity of these materials.									65	3	0	0	5	0	66			2041-1723			WOS:000496713300005	31729380

Although this problem has a long history, the question of whether the intermittent irradiation (IMI) grown plants have fully functional reaction centres as well as the oxygen clock, before exposure to continuous irradiation (CI), had not been resolved. To answer this question, as well as to analyze the development of the two photosystems, the following parallel measurements were made: (1) Emission spectra at 77 K; (2) OJIP chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence transient; (3) period 4 oscillation in the flash number dependence of initial fluorescence F-0 (at 50 mu s) and F-J (at 2 ms); and (4) P700. In the 1-ms-flash (FL) grown pea, that has a different biogenesis of the photosynthetic apparatus. delayed light emission (DLE) and Chi a fluorescence transient were measured in parallel. Quantitative analysis of Chl a fluorescence values provided the following conclusions: (1) IMI, not FL, plants have almost fully developed reaction centres and the oxygen clock. (2) Further greening of IMI plants under CI involves two phases: (a) during 3-4 h of CI, the number of PS2 units and connectivity between them increase, and then (b) light-harvesting antenna increases. (3) In FL, 10 min CI activates fully the oxygen clock.									116	7	1	0	102	4	126			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000086891700002

In this work, we synthesize an electrocatalyst through the deposition of platinum nanoparticles on defect-rich nitrogen-doped hollow carbon derived from surface-attached poly(4-vinylpyridine) monolayers. The platinum nanoparticles with an average diameter of about 1.8 nm are well dispersed on the outer surface of the pre-synthesized carbon material and the platinum loading is about 8.6 wt%. The mass activity of the as-synthesized catalyst under an overpotential of 55 mV is about 5.0 A mg(Pt)(-1), about 4.93 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, the synthesized catalyst is also more electrochemically stable than commercial Pt/C catalysts as evidenced by continuous cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometric response measurements.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5				2046-2069		WOS:000507289600035	35494442

In this short overview, recent advances in rechargeable batteries by in situ atomic force microscopy are summarized, providing nanoscale information on the solid product evolution and metal plating/stripping inside working batteries. Besides, the multi-functional imaging of the morphology along with mechanical and electrical properties can be achieved to assist further interfacial design.

In the 1D performance model, electronic and ionic transports through the different cell components are considered together with the electrochemical behavior of the anodic and cathodic catalyst layers. The membrane degradation model describes the oxygen cross-over from the anode to the cathode side, the formation of hydrogen peroxyde at the cathode side together with the subsequent formation of radicals via Fenton reactions involving metal-ion impurities and the membrane degradation. The development of the model is supported by specific single cell experiments to both validate the different modeling assumptions and determine some of the physical parameters involved in the performance and degradation models. The single-cell degradation tests confirm that most of the membrane degradation occurs at the cathode side and also show the strong influence of the temperature on the degradation rate. The effect of the current density on the degradation rate is more complex and presents a maximum at quite low current density. This phenomena, observed in the experiments, is well captured by the model. The model is then used to study the time evolution of the membrane thickness. The coupling between the performance and the chemical degradation models allows to capture the acceleration of membrane thinning. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

In Ca2+-depleted photosystem II the S-3 charge storage state exhibits a split EPR signal attributed to the magnetic interaction between a radical and the Mn-cluster. Further treatment of photosystem II by EGTA modifies the shape of the EPR signal of the Mn-cluster in the S-2 charge storage state. The percentage of centers in which the S-2 modified signal and the split S-3 signal can be observed has been estimated by using pulsed-EPR spectroscopy. On the basis, of one tyrosine D radical per reaction center, the field-swept spin echo spectrum of the modified S-2 state in dark-adapted photosystem II was detected in a large majority of the reaction centers. The derivative of the S-2 field-swept spectrum with respect to the magnetic field resulted in a spectrum similar to that observed by cw-EPR. The additional light-induced split S-3 signal appeared on top of the envelope of the S-2 signal and was detected in the same proportion of centers as that which exhibited the S-2 signal prior to the illumination. In the formal S-3 state, the hyperfine lines of the Mn field-swept echo spectrum were no longer detectable. The storage of PS-II at 77 K after formation of the S(3)Q(A)(-)state by freezing the membranes under continuous illumination resulted in a decrease of the S-3 signal but the pulsed-EPR S-2 manganese signal was conserved.									9	0	0	0	4	0	9			0005-2728			WOS:A1996VX98700008

However, the synergistic effect of defects and interlayered ions and how this works are rarely reported in the field of oxygen electrocatalysis. Moreover, it is difficult to control activity and stability in a defect-rich layered manganese oxide. Herein, we report a defect- and K+-rich layered manganese oxide (K-DMO) and reveal the synergistic effect of defects and K+ ions on enhancing the activity and stability during oxygen reduction/evolution. It is found that the synergistic effect improves the electrochemical performance via optimizing the reaction mechanism and kinetics. K-DMO exhibits superior activity and stability, and its use in a rechargeable zinc-air battery results in excellent rechargeability, with a narrow voltage gap of 0.66 V between the charge and discharge platforms, a high peak power density of 139.9 mW cm(-2), and extremely long-term stability over 1000 cycles at 5 mA cm(-2). In short, the identification of a synergistic effect provides a blueprint for controlling the activity and stability of layered materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1466-8033		WOS:000764207300001		
J	Meng, Wei; Wen, Lina; Song, Zhonghai; Cao, Ning; Qin, Xue								Metal-free boron-doped carbon microspheres as excellent cathode catalyst for rechargeable Li-O-2 battery								JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY				21	3			665	671		10.1007/s10008-016-3412-3				MAR 2017	2017	Rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries are attracting more and more interest due to their high energy density. Meanwhile, the replacement of high-cost and scarce precious-metal catalysts has attracted more and more attention. Currently, many academic researchers have paid attention to find highly efficient metal-free catalysts as air cathode material. Herein, the boron-doped carbon microspheres (B-CMs) were prepared through a novel and facile static calcination method and showed high electrocatalytic activity as a cathode material. The battery with a B-CM cathode delivered a high initial discharge capacity of 13,757.2 mAh g(-1) and outstanding coulombic efficiency of 90.1 % at 100 mA g(-1). In addition, stable cyclability (151 cycles with stable discharge voltage of similar to 2.60 V with a cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1)) has been exhibited. These performances are due to three main points: boron carbide compound changed the surface area of the CMs and formed the mesopore architectures as well as the large surface area of 683.738 m(2) g(-1); the reduce of boron atom can slow down the oxidation of the CMs during the cyclings; and finally, the electron-deficient boron atom introduction greatly facilitated Li+ diffusion and electrolyte immersion and enhanced the oxygen reduction and evolution reaction kinetics.									11	2	0	0	1	0	12			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000394379600005

Release of MoO42- and generation of MoS2-inspired ROS were found to be the key factors answering for the bactericidal property of the nanosheets. What's more, iron-doping in terms of FeMoO4 could boost the antibacterial efficacy further, which stems from quick release of Fe2+ and generation of ROS by Fenton-like reactions. Accordingly, it is believed that the dark antibacterial efficacy of the vertically aligned MoS2 nanosheets is guaranteed by uniting ion release and ROS generation. This study provides new insight into design and application of MoS2 coatings for disinfection of biomedical devices, where light is hard to be served.

A single C vacancy slightly weakens the H adsorption, while the introduction of a M vacancy or coupled M+C vacancies can greatly enhance the H binding. For a MXene with intrinsic too-strong H adsorption, double C vacancies are effective in weakening the binding and promoting the activity. The activity tuning is closely correlated to the electronic structures of the defected MXene, where the highest occupied peak position of the surface O electronic states shows an apparent linear trend with Delta G(H) and can be used to qualitatively predict the activity. The weakened or strengthened H adsorption by a C or M vacancy is attributed to the upshifted or downshifted Fermi level of surface O, respectively. Our results indicate the potential of defect chemistry to tune the catalytic activity of MXene and provide new possibilities to enhance the applications of MXene.									10	1	0	0	0	0	9			1948-7185			WOS:000657347700006	33999629

H.; Han, Y.; Chen, Y.; Du, A.; Jaroniec, M.; Qjao, S. Z. Nat. Commun. 2014, S, 3783]. We demonstrate here through first principle calculations examining various hybrid g-C3N4@MG (M = B, N, O, F, P. and S) electrocatalysts that the N-doped case may be regarded as an example of a more general modulation doping strategy by which either electron donating or electron withdrawing features induced in the substrate can be exploited to promote the HER Despite the intrinsically cathodic nature of the HER, our study reveals that all of the graphene substrates have an increasingly electron withdrawing influence on the g-C3N4 active layer as H atom coverage increases, modulating binding of the H atom intermediates, the overpotential, and the likely operational coverage. In this context, it is not surprising that p-doping of the substrate can further enhance the effect. Our calculations show that B is the most promising doping element for g-C3N4@MG (M = B, N, O, F, P, and S) electrocatalysts due to the predicted overpotential of 0.06 eV at full coverage and a large interfacial adhesion energy of -1.30 eV, offering prospects for significant improvement over the n-dopant systems such as g-C3N4@NG that have appeared in the literature to date. These theoretical results reveal a more general principle for rational design of hybrid electrocatalysts, via manipulation of the Fermi level of the underlying conductive substrate.									51	5	0	0	1	0	52			2155-5435			WOS:000385057900088

To aid in developing a chemical recycling method without the evolution of harmful hydrochloric acid (HCI) and organochlorines, we have proposed a dehydrochlorination process at a low temperature (around 423 K) using zinc(II) oxide (ZnO). ZnO particles dispersed into the polymer matrix were found to be effective for thorough dehydrochlorination because the reaction promoters (zinc chloride [ZnCl2] and water) spontaneously penetrated the polymer via exothermic reactions. As a result, only a small percentage of chlorine atoms remained with a low amount of HCI. The efficiency of dehydrochlorination was a result of increasing the contact area with ZnO particles using a heat-kneading apparatus. The catalyst ZnCl2 was involved in the cross-linking reaction to form C-C single bond. Due to exothermic reaction, the scission or isomerization to polyene and aromatics also proceeded over a short period, leading to a microporous carbonaceous solid with a surface area of 5 x 10(2) m(2)/g.

We proposed six HBLs due to the atomic orientational variations and two of them are found dynamically stable confirmed by phonon dispersion curves. The two stable HBLs, HBL1, and HBL6 also show negative binding energy depicted by the interlayer distance-dependent binding energy curves. Among them, HBL1 has the lowest binding energy, suggesting the exothermic practicability of the material. Electronically both materials show a visible ranged indirect bandgap of similar to 2.65 (2.69) eV for HBL 1 (HBL6), lowered by similar to 2 times compared to their intrinsic constituents (2D PtO2, 2D GaN). The bandgaps also have type-II band orientation, which is highly required for efficient spatial carrier separation in photocatalytic water splitting (PWS) applications. The optical properties of the HBLs were also calculated, and it's found that the HBLs have similar to 2 x 10(5) cm(-1) of perovskite material-like absorption coefficient in the visible spectrum, a key requirement for efficient photocatalysis. Reflectivity is as low as similar to 7 % in the visible spectrum, suggesting the low-loss nature of the materials. Photocatalytic band-edges with type-II band alignments show sufficient kinetic overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in both HBLs, suggesting effective water-splitting capacity. Moreover, we have explored the biaxial strain-induced tunability of the electronic bandgap, absorption coefficients, and photocatalytic band edges. They all found responsive due to homogeneous biaxial strain and show bandgap-lowering, absorption coefficient visible shifting, and band-edges tuning from compressive to tensile strains in the 6 % to +6% range. These studies suggest that the novel PtO2/GaN vdW layered material can be a probable efficient material for visible-light-driven photocatalytic water-splitting technology.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2169-3536			WOS:000683978800001

Here, we report a SnO2-x overlayer coated BiVO4 photoanode, which demonstrates the great ability to near-completely suppress O-2 evolution for photoelectrochemical (PEC) H2O oxidative H2O2 evolution. Based on the surface hole accumulation measured by surface photovoltage, downward quasi-hole Fermi energy at the photoanode/electrolyte interface and thermodynamic Gibbs free energy between 2-electron and 4-electron competitive reactions, we are able to consider the photoinduced holes of BiVO4 that migrate to the SnO2-x overlayer kinetically favor H2O2 evolution with great selectivity by reduced band bending. The formation of H2O2 may be mediated by the formation of hydroxyl radicals (OH center dot), from 1-electron water oxidation reactions, as evidenced by spin-trapping electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies conducted herein. In addition to the H2O oxidative H2O, evolution from PEC water splitting, the SnO2-x/BiVO4 photoanode can also inhibit H2O2 decomposition into O-2 under either electrocatalysis or photocatalysis conditions for continuous H2O2 accumulation. Overall, the SnO2-x/BiVO4 photoanode achieves a Faraday efficiency (FE) of over 86% for H2O2 generation in a wide potential region (0.6-2.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and an H2O2 evolution rate averaging 0.825 mu mol/min/ cm(2) at 1.23 V vs RHE under AM 1.5 illumination, corresponding to a solar to H2O2 efficiency of similar to 5.6%; this performance surpasses almost all previous solar energy-assisted H2O2 evolution performances. Because of the simultaneous production of H2O2 and H-2 by solar water splitting in the PEC cells, our results highlight a potentially greener and more cost-effective approach for "solar-to-fuel" conversion.									80	5	0	0	7	0	80			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000535252100018	32160742

However, the binding between metal sulfides and carbon nanomaterials, which plays a key role in determining their interaction, has not been clearly elucidated. Herein, we reported the sulfur bridges between sulfur-doped carbon nanotubes (S-CNTs) and Co9S8 nanoparticles and their significant effect on the practical electrochemical performance. Compared to the physically mixed composites, the one with sulfur bridges between CNTs and Co9S8 shows much better performance in terms of oxygen evolution (overpotential of 0.331 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) and oxygen reduction (half-wave potential of 0.810 V). Demonstrating that the sulfur bridges facilitate fast electron hopping from conductive support to active species, thus contributing to the outstanding electrochemical performance. Moreover, a rechargeable Zn-Air battery based on our electrocatalyst with strong sulfur bridges delivers an outstanding performance in terms of ORR and OER bifunctional performances. The clear understanding of the sulfur bridges between CNTs and Co9S8 is believed to shed substantial light on the development of other high-performance electrocatalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Catalyst development has largely focused on lowering the overpotential and eliminating reliance on precious metals, revealing stark differences in alkaline and acidic OER. In alkaline electrolyte, precious metal-free catalysts have approached the limiting overpotential from established free energy scaling relationships, and our survey of complex metal oxides shows that this limit can be approached with a broad range of catalysts. In acidic electrolyte, electrochemical instabilities create a dual challenge of a dearth of nonprecious metal OER catalysts with overpotential below 0.5 V and a high dissolved metals concentration for most precious metal-free catalysts. On device-relevant time scales, the high dissolved metals concentrations compromise device stability, for example, through a decrease of performance and due to metal exchange between anode and cathode catalysts due to finite permeability of ion exchange membranes. These considerations motivate a substantial increase in monitoring and reporting of dissolved metals concentrations in OER experiments. To facilitate durability-based screening in continued catalyst discovery campaigns, we introduce a durability descriptor based on the d-electron count of each metal element compared to that of its Pourbaix-stable oxidation state, which enables rapid down-selection of candidate metal oxide catalysts. We discuss the importance of a codesign approach to catalyst development, where a device architecture can set specific requirements for dissolved metals concentrations and/or cathode and anode catalysts can be designed to tolerate cross-contamination. This device-level guidance of basic science will facilitate deployment of new catalysts to meet the societal needs for accelerated sustainable technology development.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000763584500002

Electrolytic hydrogen generation from saline water, particularly from salt-contained hazardous wastewater, is significant to both environment and energy concerns but still challenging due to the high energy cost, severe corrosion, and the absence of competent electrocatalysts. Herein, a novel strategy is proposed for energy-efficient hydrogen production coupled with electro-oxidation removal of ethanolamine pollutant in saline water. To achieve this, an active and durable heterostructured electrocatalyst is developed by in situ growing Ni@Ni3S2 core@shell nanoparticles in cross-linked 3D carbon nanotubes' (CNTs) network, achieving high dispersibility and metallic property, low packing density, and enriched exposed active sites to facilitate fast electron/mass diffusion. The unique Ni@Ni3S2/CNTs nano-heterostructures are competent for long-term stably electro-oxidizing environmental-unfriendly ethanolamine at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in saline water, which not only suppresses oxygen and chloride evolution reactions but also decreases the energy consumption to boost hydrogen production. Associated with experimental results, density functional theory studies indicate that the collaborative adsorption of electrolyte ions and ethanolamine molecules can synergistically modulate the adsorption/desorption properties of catalytic active centers on Ni@Ni3S2/CNTs surface, leading to long-term stabilized electrocatalysis for efficient ethanolamine oxidation removal and less-energy hydrogen simultaneous production in saline water.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2366-9608			WOS:000731412800001	35312226

Across various applications, MIECs exhibit ionic (e.g., insertion) and/or electronic (e.g., electrocatalytic) charge transfer reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Bulk storage and transport of charge carriers also couple with these interfacial reactions. Here, we build a generalized, physics-based impedance model for MIECs with an ion-blocking current collector and explore how bulk and interfacial resistance, chemical capacitance, and DC polarization affect the impedance response. Using transition metal hydroxides as a case study, we provide guidance on extracting reaction kinetics or bulk resistance from the Nyquist plots in interface- or bulk-controlled conditions, respectively. Generalizing our EIS analysis enables a robust analysis of MIEC kinetics for a diverse set of systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000790538900001

In this study, electrically conducting nanocomposites, including graphene/SnO2 (G/SnO2) and graphene/Sb-SnO2 (G/Sb-SnO2) were successfully synthesized and characterized using nitrogen adsorption, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Thereafter, the adsorption and electrochemical regeneration performance of the nanocomposites were tested using methylene blue as a model contaminant. Compared to bare graphene, the adsorption capacity of the new composites was <= 40% higher, with similar isotherm behavior. The adsorption capacity of G/SnO2 and G/Sb-SnO2 were effectively regenerated in both NaCl and Na2SO4 electrolytes, requiring as little charge as 21 C mg(-1) of adsorbate for complete regeneration, compared to >35 C mg(-1) for bare graphene. Consecutive loading and anodic electrochemical regeneration cycles of the nanocomposites were carried out in both NaCl and Na2SO4 electrolytes without loss of the nanocomposite, attaining high regeneration efficiencies (ca. 100%).									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2073-4344		WOS:000519998900121

Here we report a novel ex-situ method to codope TiO2 with tungsten and carbon (W, C) by sequentially annealing W-precursor-coated TiO2 nanowires in flame and carbon monoxide gas. The unique advantages of flame annealing are that the high temperature (>1,000 degrees C) and fast heating rate of flame enable rapid diffusion of W into TiO2 without damaging the nanowire morphology and crystallinity. This is the first experimental demonstration that codoped TiO2:(W, C) nanowires outperform monodoped TiO2:W and TiO2:C and double the saturation photocurrent of undoped TiO2 for photoelectrochemical water splitting. Such significant performance enhancement originates from a greatly improved electrical conductivity and activity for oxygen-evolution reaction due to the synergistic effects of codoping.									228	7	0	0	10	0	230			2041-1723			WOS:000318872100080	23591890

The -ONa group strongly destabilizes the phenolates. The thermal stability of phenolates is largely in parallel with bond strengths of Ar substituents. De-substituents and the removal of aromatic hydrogens are dominant reactions in the main degradation step. CO is formed only at a very late stage. This degradation pattern is completely di ff erent from that of phenol. To account for this distinctive decomposition; a mechanism involving an unprecedented formation of an aromatic carbon radical anion generated from the homolytic cleavage of Ar substituent (or Ar-H) in keto forms has been proposed. The homolytic cleavage of Ar substituent (or Ar-H) is facilitated by the strong electron-donating ability of the oxygen anion. A set of free-radical reactions involved in the alkali-catalyzed aromatization have been established.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2073-4360		WOS:000480539500036	31269629

These high oxidation states will be strongly influenced by the local geometric and electronic structures of the metal ion, which are difficult to study due to spectroscopically active and complex backgrounds, short lifetimes, and limited concentrations. Here, we use a wide range of complementary Xray spectroscopies coupled to DFT calculations to study Co(III)(4)O-4 cubanes and their first oxidized derivatives, which provide insight into the high-valent Co(IV) centers responsible for the activity of molecular and heterogeneous OER catalysts. The combination of X-ray absorption and 1s3p resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (K beta RIXS) allows Co(IV) to be isolated and studied against a spectroscopically active Co(III) background. Co K- and L-edge X-ray absorption data allow for a detailed characterization of the 3d-manifold of effectively localized Co(IV) centers and provide a direct handle on the tag-based redox-active molecular orbital. K beta RIXS is also shown to provide a powerful probe of Co(IV), and specific spectral features are sensitive to the degree of oxo-mediated metal metal coupling across Co4O4. Guided by the data, calculations show that electron hole delocalization can actually oppose Co(IV) formation. Computational extension of Co4O4 to CoM3O4 structures (M = redox-inactive metal) defines electronic structure contributions to Co(IV) formation. Redox activity is shown to be linearly related to covalency, and M(III) oxo inductive effects on Co(IV) oxo bonding can tune the covalency of high-valent sites over a large range and thereby tune E-0 over hundreds of millivolts. Additionally, redox-inactive metal substitution can also switch the ground state and modify metal metal and antibonding interactions across the cluster.									75	2	0	0	14	0	75			0002-7863			WOS:000382513300053	27515121

The most common oxidation methods use transition metals as catalysts and perchlorines or iodates as oxidants, and thus a large amount of inorganic waste is produced. In the present work, iron tetrasulfophthalocyanine (FePcS), a cheap iron complex is used as a catalyst, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an oxidant, resulting in a waste free method for starch oxidation. The oxidation is performed in a semibatch mode, constantly feeding H2O2 into the reactor and the pH is kept constant by adding NaOH. Gas evolution was monitored by measuring gas flow in the outlet and performing mass spectrometric analysis. The samples were taken during experiments, and the carboxyl (COOH), carbonyl (CO) contents as well as hydrogen peroxide concentration, were analyzed resulting in kinetic data. At neutral pH (7), the catalyst is not well activated leading to accumulation of H2O2, whereas under alkaline reaction conditions (pH 10), the H2O2 was rapidly decomposed resulting in a COOH value of 1.6/100 AGU and CO value of 3.0/100 AGU, but with an extensive loss of the solid starch (yield= 67 wt.%) due to depolymerization and decomposition. Respectively, no carbon dioxide but only oxygen was detected in the formed outlet gas when using FePcS under alkaline solutions, whereas with FeSO4 in acidic solutions only CO2 was detected without any oxygen.

However, the lubrication mechanisms of these groups in solid GO lubricants have not been well revealed yet. Herein, we report a new strategy to prepare hydroxylcarboxyl-terminated GO, hydroxyl-terminated GO, less-hydroxyl-terminated GO, and reduced GO (rGO), and then employ them as a frictional research model to address this concern. The results reveal that a little amount of water confined in GO layers dominates the interlayer shearing resistance by confining hydrogen-bond interaction. The strongest confinement effect to hydrogen-bond is achieved in hydroxyl-terminated GO, leading to the lowest shearing resistance between GO layers and then the enhanced friction performances. This finding first reveals the synergistic lubrication mechanism of oxygen functional groups and confined interlayer water molecules, providing us a new design view to fabricate superior graphene-based solid lubrication materials.									12	3	0	0	0	0	14			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000472183900009

But the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is quite limited for improving the efficiency of solar conversion. In this study, a core-shell nanostructure film of WCoFe oxyhydroxide coated BiVO4 (WCoFe/BiVO4) was constructed by solvothermal method, which exhibits better photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties compared with the bare BiVO4. A high quality-interface is formed between WCoFe oxyhydroxide and BiVO4 junctions, which further facilitates the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers. Notably, WCoFe/BiVO4 photoanode shows a low onset potential of 0.28 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a significant enhancement of photocurrent density, reaching 4.35 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE, which is mainly attributed to the improved OER kinetics. In addition, the charge injection efficiency of WCoFe/BiVO4 photoanode also increases to 84.75%, more than twice as much as that of bare BiVO4 photoanode. Photoelectrochemical measurements and optical studies have demonstrated that the high PEC performance can be contributed to the reduced OER barriers and charge recombination, as well as the excellent optical transparency of WCoFe oxyhydroxide.									25	1	0	0	3	0	25			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000504405000151		
J	IMAMOTO, T								SYNTHESIS AND REACTIONS OF NEW PHOSPHINE BORANES								PURE AND APPLIED CHEMISTRY				65	4			655	660		10.1351/pac199365040655				APR 1993	1993	Synthesis and reactions of new phosphine-boranes have been studied. Diastereomerically pure menthyloxyphenylphosphine-boranes were prepared from dichlorophenylphosphine. These secondary phosphine-boranes underwent stereospecific alkylation and arylation reactions. It is noted that the stereochemistry of palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions was largely affected by the solvent and the base used. Thus, the reaction in acetonitrile proceeded with net retention of configuration. In sharp contrast, the reaction in THF in the presence of K2CO3 occurred with inversion of configuration with high degree of stereospecificity.The phosphorus-oxygen bond of the resulting phosphine-boranes was reductively cleaved at -78-degrees-C by lithium naphthalenide or lithium in liquid ammonia in almost quantitative yields with an excellent degree of stereospecificity. On the other hand, the reactions at elevated temperatures provided the products with almost complete racemization. This racemization was proved to occur via pyramidal inversion of the anionic tricoordinate phosphorus species. Based on these results, we developed new methods for the synthesis of bidentate phosphine ligands with homochiral phosphine centers. Optically pure bisphosphinoethanes and bisphosphinobutanes possessing phenyl, t-butyl, cyclohexyl, o-methoxyphenyl, methyl, or 2-methoxyethyl group were prepared via phosphine-boranes.Functionalizations of the boranato group of phosphine-boranes have been investigated. Trimethylphosphine-borane reacted with methanesulfonic acid with evolution of hydrogen. The resulting trimethylphosphine-methylsulfonyloxyborane was subjected to nucleophilic substitution reaction on the boron atom with arenthiols or secondary phosphine-boranes. A new phosphine-borane having a P-B-P-B-P-B-P-B bond linkage was synthesized. Novel boron anion species were generated by the reaction of phosphine-monoiodoboranes with lithium 4,4'-di-t-butylbiphenylide.									106	0	0	0	3	0	106			0033-4545			WOS:A1993KV40100010

Layered bismuth oxyhalides are a new class of photocatalytic materials with a strong light response to boost solar energy conversion due to their appealing energy band structure and unique layered structure. This critical review summarizes recent progress in designing and tuning new bismuth oxyhalide materials to boost solar energy conversion. We start with methods to prepare and tune bismuth oxyhalides to enhance photocatalysis: structural engineering via control of the bismuth-rich state, elemental doping, defect control, interface engineering, solid solutions, inner coupling, and heterojunction construction. Then advancements in versatile photocatalytic applications of bismuth oxyhalide-based photocatalysts in the areas of oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction, nitrogen fixation, organic syntheses, disinfection, and pollutant removal are discussed. Finally, the major challenges and opportunities regarding the future exploration of bismuth oxyhalide-based materials in photocatalysis are presented. The present review will deepen understanding regarding bismuth oxyhalides and open new directions in designing and optimizing advanced bismuth oxyhalide-based materials for energy and environmental applications.									291	22	0	0	41	0	300			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000415302600019

However, the practical application of Li-O-2 batteries is significantly impeded by the sluggish electrocatalytic kinetics of oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction that occur on the air-cathode electrode during the discharge and charge processes. Herein, a three-dimensional Co and N co-doped biochar derived from wood in the molten salt medium was developed as cathode for Li-O-2 batteries. A three-dimensional self-supporting electrode co-doped with Co and N is obtained, which can be directly used as the positive electrode of a lithium-air battery, exhibiting high specific capacity (under the condition of current density of 0.05 mA cm(-2), the discharge specific capacity is 9.44 mAh cm(-2)) and excellent cycle stability (under the limited capacity of 0.5 mAh cm(-2), it can be cycled 113 times).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000819945800002

The synergistic effect of the carbon substrate with highly ordered structure and the Co-N-x active sites realized the "Point discharge effect". The pi-pi interactions from the CTP aromatic ring sheets and Co-N-x promoted the adsorption and dissociation of oxygen molecules, respectively. The increased diffusion coefficient (D-0) indicated the mass transfer of oxygen molecules in the boundary layer was enhanced during the ORR process. Thanks to excellent structural characteristics, ACTP(5)@Co,N-800 exhibited better ORR performance than commercial Pt/C catalyst under alkaline conditions, and the OER activity was improved simultaneously. This work demonstrated a simple and practical strategy for the development of advanced carbon-based electrocatalysts, and also provided novel insights from kinetics perspectives for improving electrocatalytic efficiency.

Available measurement strategies rely on chromatography and mass spectrometry, which are expensive and labor intensive. We have developed a general method to determine the metabolic stability of virtually any compound by quantifying cofactors in the mechanism of cytochrome P450 enzymes using fluorescence intensity measurements. While many previous studies have shown that simple measurements of cofactor depletion do not correlate with substrate conversion (i.e., metabolic stability) in P450 systems, the present work employs a reaction engineering approach to simplify the overall rate equation, thus allowing the accurate and quantitative determination of substrate depletion from simultaneous measurements of NADPH and oxygen depletion. This method combines the accuracy and generality of chromatography with the ease, throughput, and real-time capabilities of fluorescence.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			0002-7863			WOS:000295148100003	21766815

Since oxygen dissolution under oenological conditions is not fully understood, these additions are carried out empirically, resulting in unpredictable concentrations and heterogeneous oxygen distributions within the fermentation tank. In this research, we develop a model to predict the evolution of the oxygen dissolution rate in the must during alcoholic fermentations. The model includes two partial differential equations that describe oxygen spatial distribution during the fermentation in both liquid and gaseous phases. These equations incorporate the effects of recirculation and mixing. Also, a set of ordinary differential equations describing the kinetics of relevant fermentation variables is included. The model is validated by fermenting a Sauvignon blanc must in a bubble column with five micro bubblers for oxygen injection. Additions are made every ten points of decrease in the fermenting musts' density. Model simulations and experimental results confirm that CO2 is responsible for the observed reduction in the oxygen dissolution rate during the exponential growth phase, and that viable yeast cells significantly reduce this rate compared with an abiotic bubbling CO2 system. The model developed will help to design more effective oxygen addition systems through micro-bubbling for wine fermentation tanks.

The electrolyses have been performed in a single-compartment flow cell in galvanostatic conditions. The influence of applied current (0.5-2 A), BQ concentration (1-2 g dm(-3)), temperature (20-45 A degrees C) and flow rate (100-300 dm(3) h(-1)) has been studied. BQ decay kinetic, the evolution of its oxidation intermediates and the mineralization of the aqueous solutions were monitored during the electrolysis by high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) measurements. The results obtained show that the use of diamond anode leads to total mineralization of BQ in any experimental conditions due to the production of oxidant hydroxyl radicals electrogenerated from water discharge. The decay kinetics of BQ removal follows a pseudo-first-order reaction, and the rate constant increases with rising current density. The COD removal rate was favoured by increasing of applied current, recirculating flow rate and it is almost unaffected by solution temperature.									16	0	0	0	4	0	16			0944-1344	1614-7499		WOS:000338452000011	24710725

Herein, we have developed a general host-guest strategy to construct amorphous hetero-atom doped cobalt phosphates; in the first step, we fast synthesized large-scale 2D Co-based phosphate precursors with different organic amine guest molecules by a hydrothermal method, afterwards, we calcined these precursors at different annealing temperatures, leading to the decomposition of organic guest molecules, and consequently, we obtained amorphous C,N co-doped mesoporous Co-based phosphates during this decomposition process. Moreover, the optimal C4NCPO-450 shows bi-functional activity for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) and supercapacitor applications. Which has a low overpotential of 292 mV and a Tafel slope of 67.45 mV dec(-1) for the OER, and when used as an electrode material for supercapacitors, it reveals a large specific capacitance of 326 F g(-1)@1 A g(-1), accompanied by a stability of 2200 charge and discharge cycles. We suppose that this method can be used to prepare other hetero-atom doped mesoporous electrode materials, which should be promising candidates in the electrochemical energy storage and conversion field.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000706391100001

Herein, we demonstrate the N -doped carbon nanotube (NCNT)-grafted N-doped carbon (NC) framework embedding CoP nanoparticles (CoP@NC/NCNT) as hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER) catalysts for water splitting. As a result, the CoP@NC/NCNT electrode requires the overpotentials of 106 and 177 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH solutions for HER, respectively. Moreover, an overpotential of 324 mV for OER can drive 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 KOH. The CoP@NC/NCNT-based electrolyzer derives a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low voltage of 1.72 V in 1.0 M KOH and remains stable for 10 h. The outstanding elec-trocatalytic performance is mainly attributed to the hierarchical structure with rich branches and highlyactive component of CoP. The intimate contacts between hierarchical porous NC frameworks by cross -linked NCNTs create a 3D conductive network, which facilitates electron or mass transfer and activates CoP. This work offers a novel route for preparing hierarchical carbon framework encapsulated metal phosphide particles for potential applications in energy conversion field. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, as a proof-of-concept experiment, one effective protocol is first identified to drive the positive evolution of surface contents on nanoporous Cu-In by electrochemical training in KHCO3 electrolyte. Interestingly, superior performances including high selectivity for CO production and robust reliability are realized. Thus, Faradaic efficiency can approach the maximum of 91% at -0.95 V (vs. RHE), and an excellent durability can be simultaneously testified by no detectable performance decay for 7 h in operation. More importantly, current investigation paves a new road for designing bimetallic electrocatalysts with high selectivity and long-term durability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

On the basis of the limited knowledge that is currently available, the present inferences can be made as follows: (1) Warming can cause enhanced leaching of ionic solutes from the catchments to surface waters, including cations and more biologically labile anions such as sulphate. Preferential sulphate biodegradation followed by removal as organic sulphides in sediment could increase alkalinity, favouring the generation of the carbonate radical, CO3 (center dot-). However, this phenomenon would be easily offset by fluctuations of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which is strongly anticorrelated with CO3 (center dot-). Therefore, obtaining insight into DOC evolution is a key issue in understanding the link between photochemistry and climate. (2) Climate change could exacerbate water scarcity in the dry season in some regions. Fluctuations in the water column could deeply alter photochemistry that is usually favoured in shallower waters. However, the way water is lost would strongly affect the prevailing photoinduced processes. Water outflow without important changes in solute concentration would mostly favour reactions induced by the hydroxyl and carbonate radicals (center dot OH and CO3 (center dot-)). In contrast, evaporative concentration would enhance reactions mediated by singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) and by the triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter ((CDOM)-C-3*). (3) In a warmer climate, the summer stratification period of lakes would last longer, thereby enhancing photochemical reactions in the epilimnion but at the same time keeping the hypolimnion water in the dark for longer periods.					14th EuCheMS International Conference on Chemistry and the Environment (ICCE)14th EuCheMS International Conference on Chemistry and the Environment (ICCE)	JUN 25-28, 2013JUN 25-28, 2013	EuCheMSEuCheMS	Barcelona, SPAINBarcelona, SPAIN	12	1	0	0	10	0	14			0944-1344	1614-7499		WOS:000342453100014	24310903

While covalent linkage (though considered more stable) necessitates functional groups introduced by means of often cumbersome synthetic procedures, non-covalent assemblies require sufficient propensity of the molecular unit for surface adsorption, thus set less rigorous pre-requisites. Herein, we report efficient electrodeposition (ED) of two Fe(III) complexes prepared with closely related NN'N pincer ligands yielding stable and active ad-layers for the electrocatalysis of the oxygen-evolving reaction (OER). The ED method is based on the utilization of a chloride precursor complex [(FeCl2)-Cl-III(NN'N)], which is dissolved in an organic electrolyte undergoes chloride/aqua ligand exchange upon addition of water. ED provides patchy distribution of a chloride-depleted catalyst layer on indium tin oxide (ITO) and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) surfaces, which can be applied for long periods as OER electrocatalysts. Compared to drop-casting or layering of [(FeCl2)-Cl-III(NN'N)] with Nafion (a commonly used support for molecular electrocatalysts), the surface modification by ED is a material saving and efficient method to immobilize catalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2073-4344		WOS:000653557000001
