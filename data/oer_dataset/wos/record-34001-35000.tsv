Herein, we demonstrate the surface tuning of nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) with awaruite (Ni3Fe). The NiFe2O4 grows in the form of a crystalline monolayer encompassing bimetallic Ni3Fe nanocrystals embedded within a polyaniline (PANI) matrix. This is achieved by a simple and highly reproducible chemical approach. Benzyl alcohol (BA) and PANI steer the growth of metallic Ni3Fe covered with a monolayer of NiFe2O4 under mild solvothermal conditions. PANI presumably renders anchoring sites and guides the formation of fine and monodisperse nanocrystals of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe, while BA acts as a reducing agent and controls the nucleation and the growth of NiFe2O4. In the absence of PANI, the formation of large and agglomerated NiFe2O4 nanoparticles is observed. The fine interface created between the NiFe2O4 monolayer and Ni3Fe imparts unique and superior surface attributes; Ni3Fe renders a high electroactive surface area and faster charge transport, while the NiFe2O4 monolayer affords high catalytic ability. As a result, the NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI electrode efficiently catalyzes the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and requires a substantially lower overpotential than those of NiO/PANI, NiFe2O4, and Fe2O3/PANI. The Tafel values suggest that the kinetics of the half-reaction at the catalytic interface of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI is much faster (52.3 mV dec(-1)) than that of NiO/PANI (82.5 mV dec(-1)), NiFe2O4 (86.0 mV dec(-1)) and Fe2O3/PANI (108.3 mV dec(-1)). The turnover frequency of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI is 0.27 s(-1), 5.4 fold higher than that of NiFe2O4 (0.05 s(-1)). Moreover, the electrochemically active surface area, electrochemical impedance, surface charge transport properties, and active sites of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI and NiFe2O4 are estimated, compared and correlated to the OER performance. In addition, density functional theory calculations show a decrease in the barrier of the potential-determining step from *O to *OOH, indicating a favorable electronic modulation at the interface of NiFe2O4 and Ni3Fe, which reduces the overpotential requirement.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000644938300001		
J	Kavinkumar, Veerappan; Verma, Atul; Uma, Kasimayan; Moscow, Subramanian; Jothivenkatachalam, Kandasamy; Fu, Yen-Pei								Plasmonic metallic silver induced Bi2WO6/TiO2 ternary junction towards the photocatalytic, electrochemical OER/HER, antibacterial and sensing applications								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				569						150918	10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.150918		AUG 2021		DEC 15 2021	2021	The plasmonic metal-induced Bi2WO6/TiO2 ternary composite with unique electronic and structural properties was synthesized via a hydrothermal and chemical reduction route for sustainable energy and environmental remediation. The obtained Bi2WO6/TiO2-Ag (BWTA) exhibited a tremendous catalytic activity for Rhodamine B photodegradation (0.947 x 10(-2) min(-1)) than those of sole TiO2 and Bi2WO6 specimens. The radical trapping experiment discloses that superoxide O-center dot(2)- and holes (h(+)) are the cardinal active species in the photocatalytic system. Further, recycling experiment was conducted to elucidate the stability of the photocatalyst. BWTA(2.0) was able to produce 2.1330 mA/cm(2) of current density for oxygen evolution reaction and -1.5003 mA/cm(2) for hydrogen evolution reaction, which is much higher than those of other specimens. Besides, electrochemical detection of dopamine (DA) was performed through cyclic voltammetry; results showed that the ternary composite had better electrocatalytic activity for DA detection owing to the synergistic effects of noble metal incorporation into the semiconductor. Also, the antibacterial potential of the specimens was explored against Escherichia coli through the well-diffusion method. In terms of experimental results, a possible mechanism of ternary composite is thoroughly elucidated. Thus, this work validates that, plasmonic induced ternary composite has a great prospect for photocatalytic, electrochemical, sensing, and antibacterial applications.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000724530300003

The evolution of the nature and the size of the nickel active phase (different in both catalysts) as well as distribution of potassium is disclosed. The promoter does not protect the catalyst against formation of carbonaceous deposit and does not improve its stability in the SRE. More important is high dispersion of nickel. Smaller nickel crystallites in Ni/CeO2 ensure its better stability. In both catalysts, fragments of nickel (devoid of potassium in the case of KNi/CeO2) are pushed from ceria by carbonaceous fibres formed. Their nature is different in both catalysts. On the Ni/CeO2 amorphous (disordered) long and thick as well as short and thin graphitic fibres are formed. The ICNi/CeO2 produces very large amount of only graphitic fibres, longer and thicker than those in unpromoted catalyst. Much intensive production of graphitic fibres, which with time-of-stream can encapsulate greater number of nickel crystallites, is considered as responsible for faster deactivation of KNi/CeO2 catalyst in the SRE.									41	1	0	0	0	0	42			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000414109700050

The electrodes were characterized by cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy in a potential range, purportedly selected to exclude the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions as well as any other faradaic reaction involving the massive reduction of SnO2. Parallel particle characterization was performed by BET and electrophoretic mobility. A synergistic enhancement of the descriptive capability of each investigation technique is obtained. In particular, the semiconducting properties of the Ti/SnO2 electrodes are obtained and discussed in term of emptying/filling of the electronic traps within the band gap that is in terms of oxide resistance and electron trapping capacitance. In addition the voltammetric total, outer and inner charge quantities, Q(tot), Q(out) and Q(in), are determined and interpreted in terms of "electrochemical" porosity of the oxide layer. The outcomes are in total agreement with the BET investigations of the powder. The electric surface characteristics are parallelly investigated by the pH dependence of the oxide/solution capacitance of the electrodes and by the electrophoretic mobility of the particles. The results jointly point to a substantial reduction of charge accumulation capability at pH > 5-6, where a net negative charge is observed on the surface. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we grow vertically aligned interlaced mesh -network NiP2 nanosheets on deeply polished Ti foil (NiP2 NS/Ti) by the gas-phase phosphidation of Ni(OH)(2). The produced interconnected nanosheets provide abundant electron transfer pathways and facilitate electron transfer, as confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements and the presence of numerous voids that allow for fast gas release and ion migration. In view of the above advantages, the NiP2 NS/Ti shows high electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction in both alkaline and acidic solutions, wherein overpotentials of only 134 and 140 mV are required to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. In addition, the above electrode also features a small Tafel slope (60.5 mV dec(-1) in alkaline and 49.5 mV dec(-1) in acidic solutions) and long-term stability, and can therefore be employed as an efficient and cheap three-dimensional cathode for electrochemical water splitting.

J	Scarpa, Davide; Sarno, Maria					sarno, maria/0000-0001-5663-3040			Single-Atom Catalysts for the Electro-Reduction of CO2 to Syngas with a Tunable CO/H-2 Ratio: A Review								CATALYSTS				12	3					275	10.3390/catal12030275				MAR 2022	2022	Nowadays, transition towards green chemistry is becoming imperative. In this scenario, an attractive perspective consists in the generation of CO through the electrochemical reduction of CO2 under ambient conditions. This approach allows storage of the electrical energy from intermittent renewable sources in the form of chemical bonds, and simultaneously reduces greenhouse gas emissions, giving carbon a second chance of life. However, most catalysts adopted for this process, i.e., noble metal-based nanoparticles, still have several issues (high costs, low current densities, high overpotentials), and in the view of generating syngas through co-electrolysis of H2O and CO2, do not enable a widely tunable CO/H-2 ratio. Single-atom catalysts with N-doped carbon supports have been recently introduced to face these challenges. The following review aims to answer the demand for an extended and exhaustive analysis of the metal single-atom catalysts thus far explored for the electro-reduction of CO2 in aqueous electrolyte solution. Moreover, focus will be placed on the objective of generating a syngas with a tunable CO/H-2 ratio. Eventually, the advantages of single-atom catalysts over their noble metal-based nano-sized counterparts will be identified along with future perspectives, also in the view of a rapid and feasible scaling-up.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2073-4344		WOS:000777001800001

However, their limited photocatalytic activity, induced by a low relative permittivity with high recombination energy, poses significant challenges. Herein, a highly efficient bifunctional photocatalytic hybrid multilayer electrode is designed by a versatile layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of nanoscale graphene oxide (nGO) and a ruthenium-terpyridine coordination complex (TPY2Ru). We exploited a synergistic effect between two active components, namely, the generation of photoinduced excitons by TPY2Ru and the facilitation of electron transfer by reducing the recombination rate of the generated electrons by nGO in hybrid electrodes. This photocatalytic electrode exhibits bifunctional activities for water splitting in neutral condition with the highest photoanodic current density of 4.28 mu A/cm(2) at 1.23 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a photocathodic current density of 28.42 mu A/cm(2) at 0 V versus RHE. Furthermore, the unique combination of hybrid materials enables the development of flexible photocatalytic electrodes with remarkable current density retention after a 1000-cycle durability test. Because of the highly tunable properties of the LbL-assembled multilayer electrodes, we anticipate that this strategy can offer insights into the nanoscale-architecture-controlled engineering of efficient photoelectrodes for future solar-fuel energy devices.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000557375200120

Herein, one-dimensional (1D) Cd0.85Zn0.15S solid solution nanorods (CZS NRs) are selected as the substrate photocatalyst. Then, a uniform molybdate solid solution (Cd0.85Zn0.15MoO4, CZMO) nanoshell is successfully constructed on the surface of 1D CZS NRs for photocatalytic H-2 evolution (PHE) using a convenient in situ photoinduced ion-exchange method with (NH4)(6)Mo7O24 center dot 4H(2)O as a precursor. Compared with the CZS, the coated CZMO solid solution shell is more stable and can effectively protect the sulfide photocatalyst from photocorrosion. Meanwhile, as the reaction active sites, the CZMO shell also shows excellent affinity for water, and thus significantly promotes the adsorption and reaction of H2O molecules on the photocatalyst surface. More importantly, it is found that the in situ-constructed CZMO shell can form an intimate type-H heterojunction with the CZS core to further realize the efficient spatial separation of photogenerated carriers. The as-prepared core-shell CZS@CZMO solid solution heterostructure exhibits an enhanced and stable visible-light-driven PHE performance (similar to 8.S mmol g(-1) h(-1)) within 15 h of photocatalytic water splitting. On this basis, a preliminary mechanism model has been proposed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000773651500009

PCC 6803								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				286	27			24007	24014		10.1074/jbc.M111.223289				JUL 8 2011	2011	Flavodiiron (Flv) proteins are involved in detoxification of O-2 and NO in anaerobic bacteria and archaea. Cyanobacterial Flv proteins, on the contrary, function in oxygenic environment and possess an extra NAD(P) H: flavin oxidoreductase module. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has four genes (sll1521, sll0219, sll0550, and sll0217) encoding Flv proteins (Flv1, Flv2, Flv3, and Flv4). Previous in vitro studies with recombinant Flv3 protein from Synechocystis provided evidence that it functions as a NAD(P) H: oxygen oxidoreductase, and subsequent in vivo studies with Synechocystis confirmed the role of Flv1 and Flv3 proteins in the Mehler reaction (photoreduction of O-2 to H2O). Interestingly, homologous proteins to Flv1 and Flv3 can be found also in green algae, mosses, and Selaginella. Here, we addressed the function of Flv1 and Flv3 in Synechocystis using the Delta flv1, Delta flv3, and Delta flv1/Delta flv3 mutants and applying inorganic carbon (C-i)-deprivation conditions. We propose that only the Flv1/Flv3 heterodimer form is functional in the Mehler reaction in vivo. O-18(2) labeling was used to discriminate between O-2 evolution in photosynthetic water splitting and O-2 consumption. In wild type, similar to 20% of electrons originated from water was targeted to O-2 under air level CO2 conditions but increased up to 60% in severe limitation of C-i. Gas exchange experiments with Delta flv1, Delta flv3, and Delta flv1/Delta flv3 mutants demonstrated that a considerable amount of electrons in these mutants is directed to photorespiration under C-i deprivation. This assumption is in line with increased transcript abundance of photorespiratory genes and accumulation of photorespiratory intermediates in the WT and to a higher extent in mutant cells under C-i deprivation.									91	4	0	0	87	0	94				1083-351X		WOS:000292294900043	21602273

The catalysts prepared by the impregnation technique were investigated by ex situ and in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and temperature-programmed reduction by H-2. The main part of nickel was established to exist on the support surface as bulk NiO and Ni-0 nanoparticles in asprepared and reduced under reaction conditions catalysts, respectively. The metal-support interaction with incorporation of Ni2+ ions into the Ce1-xZrxO2 crystal lattice was also revealed. In situ XRD and XPS studies allowed one to monitor the structural evolution of the Ni/Ce1-xZrxO2 catalysts during their heating under H-2 atmosphere in the temperature range of 25-450 degrees C. The formation of Ni-0 nanoparticles was shown to favor reduction of Ce1-xZrxO2 oxide via hydrogen spillover. In situ XRD results revealed reversible expansion and contraction of the Ce1-xZrxO2 crystal lattice in reductive and oxidative atmospheres, which are associated with Ce4+ <-> Ce3+ transitions and redistributions of oxygen vacancies. The elucidated metal-support interaction and synergism of redox properties of the Ni/Ce1-xZrxO2 catalysts are relevant for high activity in the CO2 and CO methanation reactions.									9	0	0	0	0	0	8			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000702017100039

The Ni-Co based catalyst (NiCo2S4) contains the redox couples of Co3+/Co2+ and Ni3+/Ni2+ which are effective active centers for HER and OER, however, the high overpotential, delayed dynamics and inferior stability suppress their whole water splitting activity and stability application. Herein, N-doped carbon layer coated NiCo2S4 hollow nanotubes (NCT-NiCo2S4) were prepared by simple solvothermal method using polyacrylonitrite (PAN) as template. The carbon layer coated hollow nanotube structure not only maximized the catalytic active sites, facilitated mass transfer rate but also protected from electrolyte corrosion to improve the activity and stability. The optimized catalyst presented low overpotentials of 295 and 330 mV to drive the 100mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively, meanwhile maintaining the remarkable stability. The small Tafel slope also reflects the high electrocatalytic reaction kinetic for HER and OER. When assembled in an electrolyzer as catalyst for water splitting, it only needs a cell voltage of 1.6 V at current density of 10 mAcm(-2). This work sheds some light on the rational design of functional materials for energy chemistry. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Extension related features include a tectonitic fabric, several types of veins and retrograde growth of chlorite in the ultramafic protolith followed by ocean floor hydrothermal calcite veins and tectonosedimentary brecciation.The predominant reaction observed in the rocks is diopside + dolomite + water = antigorite + calcite + CO2 and probably took place under conditions of approximately 500-degrees-C and 0.8 to 1.2 GPa. The reaction was driven by infiltration of an external fluid and was accompanied by extensive veining under moderate NW-directed shear stress. A younger steeply dipping NE-SW striking ductile deformation zone was probably formed at 480-490-degrees-C and 0.35 to 0.4 GPa.Several Alpine vein types indicate further deformation and various events of fluid-rock interaction. Oxygen isotopes show distinct values for different vein systems and the rock, indicating fluid-channeling and a lack of large scale isotopic equilibration. The carbon isotopic composition of all calcite samples lies in the marine range.									20	1	0	0	0	0	21			0036-7699			WOS:A1993KX66900006

Herein, we report highly active ruthenium (Ru) clusters supported on iron oxide (Ru/Fe3O4) and Fe3O4/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Ru/Fe3O4/MWCNTs) by simple electrochemical deposition in a neutral aqueous medium. The supported catalyst exhibits good hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in an acidic environment. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of potassium ferrocyanide (K-4[Fe(CN)(6)]) confirm that MWCNTs enhance the electron transfer process by decreasing the redox formal potential. The overpotentials of Ru/Fe3O4/MWCNTs and Ru/Fe3O4 electrocatalysts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) were found to be 101 mV and 306 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). As prepared, the catalyst displays good stability and retain its HER activity even after 1000 cycles. Furthermore, the stability of Ru/Fe3O4/MWCNTs was studied using the chronopotentiometric (CP) technique for 12 h and found negligible loss in the catalytic activity towards the HER. To explore the role of Ru and underneath MWCNTs in improving the catalytic performance of Fe3O4, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out. DFT calculations indicate that the octahedral site of Ru/Fe3O4 favors the HER with a low overpotential. However, Ru/Fe3O4/MWCNTs are more efficient towards the HER, which could be due to the availability of both octahedral and tetrahedral catalytic sites.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000772138800001

Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals driven by solar energy is conceivable for solving the above problem. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a class of organic-inorganic hybrid materials have considerable prospect for carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) photocatalysis. Nevertheless, most MOFs in the CO2RR still have limited photocatalytic performance as well as selectivity caused by having a single metal and face the challenge of instability. Herein, 10 Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) as heterogeneous catalysts were directly employed for the photocatalytic CO2RR, which exhibit good photocatalytic performance for CO production. A mass evolution rate of 140 mmol g(-1) h(-1), an apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) of about 0.7%, and a selectivity of about 96.8% for CO were obtained over Ni-Co PBA. Notably, the CO2RR activities of (MCo)-Co-II PBAs are better than those of M-II-Fe PBAs, but the former's selectivities for CO are lower than those of the latter. The divergence of activity is dependent on their electron transfer rates, which is confirmed by the electrochemical experiments and spectral characterization. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) as well as H-2 adsorption and desorption experiments of the PBAs reveal the difference in selectivity.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000731589300001

Three-dimensional structures from x-ray crystallography have been used extensively to model these processes. However, the crystal structures are not necessarily identical to those of the solubilised complexes. Here we compared picosecond fluorescence of solubilised and crystallised PSII core particles isolated from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus. The fluorescence of the crystals is sensitive to the presence of artificial electron acceptors (K3Fe(CN)(3)) and electron transport inhibitors (DCMU). In PSII with reaction centres in the open state, the picosecond fluorescence of PSII crystals and solubilised PSII is indistinguishable. Additionally we compared picosecond fluorescence of native PSII with PSII in which Ca-2 in the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) is biosynthetically replaced by Sr2+. With the Sr2+ replaced OEC the average fluorescence decay slows down slightly (81 ps to 85 ps), and reaction centres are less readily closed, indicating that both energy transfer/trapping and electron transfer are affected by the replacement.

However, the hetero-phase interface composed of the same species as advanced electrocatalysts is seldom reported. Herein, a novel hetero-phase structure strategy involving amorphous and crystalline phases is developed to construct Ru nanoclusters on nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets via ion adsorption and subsequent heat treatment, which contain abundant interfaces formed by a crystalline phase and an amorphous phase (Ru/nitrogen-doped graphene(N-G)). Significantly, the as-prepared Ru/N-G-500 shows excellent activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.847 V. Furthermore, Ru/N-G-500 also exhibits a low onset potential of about 0 mV and an overpotential of 20.1 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in HER. The catalytic performance of Ru/N-G-500 is optimal compared with the corresponding reference samples Ru/N-G-300 (mainly exists in amorphous states) and Ru/N-G-700 (exists in crystalline states). The excellent catalytic performance can be attributed to the presence of a high density of the crystalline and amorphous phase interface on the highly dispersed Ru nanoclusters, which optimizes the intermediate adsorption and promotes electron transport. This work provides a novel strategy to design and develop efficient electrocatalysts by phase interface engineering.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2052-1537		WOS:000680886100001

The difference in SCC behavior was characterized in detail by morphology observation via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and corrosion product analysis via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersion spectrum (EDS) techniques. The results indicate that the HSLA bainite steel is very sensitive to SCC in the simulated tropical marine atmosphere, mainly due to the thin and uneven electrolyte film, which is characterized by a fast oxygen transportation rate on the steel surface. The rust layer also plays an important role in determining SCC behavior in the simulated marine atmosphere, as it restrains the electrochemically anodic process and promotes the cathodic process, particularly the hydrogen evolution reaction, resulting in the nucleation and transgranular-mode propagation of SCC microcracks at the bottoms of pits. As a result, both localized anodic dissolution (AD) and hydrogen embrittlement (HE) effects are promoted, contributing to the significant increase in the susceptibility of HSLA bainite steel to SCC.

However, the synergistic effect of plasmon-related hot electrons and holes for water splitting in the plasmon-hybrid photocatalyst is rarely considered. Herein, we construct a plasmon-based Au/LaFeO3 composite photocatalyst to investigate the complex roles of hot electrons and holes for solar water splitting. Benefiting from the formation of Schottky junction and surface plasmon resonance effect of the Au nanoparticles, the synthesized photocatalyst exhibits an excellent photocatalytic activity for each half-reaction of water splitting, and the rates for H-2 and O-2 generation are obtained as high as 202 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) and 23 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), respectively. Moreover, an in-depth investigation reveals that the improved hydrogen evolution is caused by the hot electron injection from Au to LaFeO3, and the hot holes in Au induced by the separation of hot charges can initiate the water oxidation directly on the surface of gold. Thus, this work provides a new insight into the synergistic effect of plasmon-related hot electrons and holes for boosting the photocatalytic reactions. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

J	MAYFIELD, SP								OVER-EXPRESSION OF THE OXYGEN-EVOLVING ENHANCER 1-PROTEIN AND ITS CONSEQUENCES ON PHOTOSYSTEM-II ACCUMULATION								PLANTA				185	1			105	110						1991	1991	By transformation with a cloned wild-type oee1 gene, which codes for the oxygen-evolving enhancer 1 (OEE1)protein, we have constructed a strain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii containing multiple copies of this gene. A transformant (R1-K-50) containing four to five copies of the oee1 gene accumulated oee1 mRNA in approximately threefold excess of the wild type. The OEE1 protein accumulated in proportion to the oee1-mRNA levels in these cells. These data indicate that no apparent feedback mechanism is operating to reduce either transcription or translation of the introduced oee1 genes as a means to regulate OEE1-protein accumulation. The OEE1 protein in R1-K-50 was all of mature size, indicating that the transit peptide had been completely removed, and that all of the protein was located within the thylakoid lumen. Photosystem II reaction-center proteins D1 and D2 accumulated to wild-type levels, but not greater, in these cells, while there was no effect on accumulation of any of the PSII peripheral proteins such as OEE2 or LHCII. The OEE1 protein which accumulated in excess of wild-type levels was not bound to the thylakoid membranes, indicating that a limited number of binding sites for OEE1 exist on the thylakoid membranes. No difference in photosynthetic oxygen evolution was observed between wild-type and R1-K-50 strains. These data show that whatever mechanisms are used to determine stoichiometry within the PSII complex they are not perturbed by overexpression of the OEE1 protein.									17	1	0	0	14	0	18			0032-0935			WOS:A1991GA88000015	24186286

However, in this process, water decomposition becomes an increasingly significant issue that has to be tackled in order to attain a reliable aqueous supercapacitor. In order to avoid possible water decomposition at a wide potential, benign interaction between electrolyte and electrode during the cell operation has to be considered. In this work, a water-in-bisalt electrolyte consisting of 21 M lithium bis(trifluoromethane)-sulfonamide and 1 M lithium sulfate was proposed. To complement the electrolyte, Li+ inserted MnO2 and carbon were selected as electrode materials due to their low oxygen evolution reaction/hydrogen evolution reaction activities. The resultant aqueous supercapacitor was able to operate at 2.8 V which, to the best of our knowledge, is one of the widest potential windows reported for an aqueous supercapacitor system. The cell was able to deliver an energy density of 55.7 Wh kg(-1) at power density of 1 kW kg(-1), while attaining a good cyclic stability of 84.6% retention after 10000 cycles at a current density of 30 A g(-1). Such a strategy may be effective in the design of wide potential aqueous supercapacitors, which is crucial toward future supercapacitor development.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			2574-0962			WOS:000458706000011

Niobium (Nb) is a promising promoter due to its complex chemical properties and the ability to react with many elements to form abundant compounds. Taking Co4N as the research case, this work incorporates Nb atoms to tune the d orbital of metallic Co4N nanowires. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations show that due to the adjustment of Nb atoms, the d-band center of Co4N moves down, which helps facilitate the desorption of H-2. At the same time, abundant Co3+ active sites are generated on the surface of NbeCo(4)N, which is crucial for the formation of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates (*OOH). Nb-regulated Co4N nanosheets on the three-dimensional Ni foam (Nb -Co4N/NF) drives the current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 90 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction and 273 mV for OER, respectively. This work inspires a novel idea for the rational design and synthesis of highly efficient electrocatalysts composed of novel less used elements for overall water splitting. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

PRXs are also involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS)- and redox-dependent signaling by performing redox interactions with other proteins and modify their redox status. At present, PRX family identification, evolution and regulation research has been conducted in some plants; however, systematic research about this family is lacking in cotton. In this study, a total of 44 PRXs were identified in the cotton genome. Phylogenetic and conserved active site analyses showed that the PRXs were divided into six subfamilies according to the conserved site (PxxxTxxC...S...W/F) and conserved cysteinyl residues positions. Segmental duplication and polyploid events were the main methods for PRX family expansion, and the PRXs of diploid G. arboreum were the donors of PRXs in the D subgenomes of allotetraploid G. hirsutum and G. barbadense during the evolution of the PRX family. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that cis-acting elements play important roles in regulating the expression of PRXs. Alternative splicing events occurred in GhPRX14-D that can increased the complexity of transcripts in G. hirsutum. Subcellular localization showed that most PRX members were located in chloroplasts, the cytoplasmic membrane and the nucleus. Our results provide systematic support for a better understanding of PRXs in cotton and a starting point for further studies of the specific functions of PRXs in cotton.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			2167-8359			WOS:000608394400003	33552724

This work aims to investigate the origin of activity and stability enhancement for Ag3PO4 photocatalyst after calcination based on the systematical analyses of the structures, morphologies, chemical states of elements, oxygen defects, optical absorption properties, separation and transfer of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and active species. The results indicate that oxygen vacancies (VO center dot center dot) are created and metallic silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) are formed by the reaction of partial Ag+ in Ag3PO4 semiconductor with the thermally excited electrons from Ag3PO4 and then deposited on the surface of Ag3PO4 microspheres during the calcination process. Among the calcined Ag3PO4 samples, the Ag3PO4-200 sample exhibits the best photocatalytic activity and greatly enhanced photocatalytic stability for photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) solution under visible light irradiation. Oxygen vacancies play a significantly positive role in the enhancement of photocatalytic activity, while metallic Ag has a very important effect on improving the photocatalytic stability. Overall, the present work provides some powerful evidences and a deep understanding on the origin of activity and stability enhancement for the Ag3PO4 photocatalyst after calcination.									38	0	0	0	4	0	38			1996-1944			WOS:000390953400014

These reactive species participate in redox reactions leading to oxidative modifications in biomolecules, among which proteins and lipids are preferential targets. Despite a broad array of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant systems inmammalian cells andmicrobes, excess oxidant formation causes accumulation of new products that may compromise cell function and structure leading to cell degeneration and death. Oxidative events are associated with pathological conditions and the process of normal aging. Notably, physiological levels of oxidants also modulate cellular functions via homeostatic redox-sensitive cell signalingcascades. On the other hand, nitric oxide ((NO)-N-center dot), a free radical and weak oxidant, represents a master physiological regulator via reversible interactions with heme proteins. The bioavailability and actions of (NO)-N-center dot are modulated by its fast reaction with superoxide radical (O-2(center dot-)), which yields an unusual and reactive peroxide, peroxynitrite, representing themerging of the oxygen radicals and (NO)-N-center dot pathways. In this Inaugural Article, I summarize early and remarkable developments in free radical biochemistry and the later evolution of the field toward molecularmedicine; this transition includes our contributions disclosing the relationship of (NO)-N-center dot with redox intermediates andmetabolism. The biochemical characterization, identification, and quantitation of peroxynitrite and its role in disease processes have concentratedmuch of our attention. Being amediator of protein oxidation and nitration, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death, peroxynitrite represents both a pathophysiologically relevant endogenous cytotoxin and a cytotoxic effector against invading pathogens.									412	5	2	0	271	1	423			0027-8424	1091-6490		WOS:000434114900030	29802228

The current manuscript deals with the formation of oxygen substituted nickel selenide nanostructures and their use as active electrode material for supercapacitor, expecting an enhanced performance owing to their sheet-like geometry, high specific surface area and porous assembly. In this context, Ni(OH)(2) (nickel hydroxide) nanostructures were synthesized employing one-pot hydrothermal method and the ion-exchange reaction of Ni(OH)(2) nanostructures with selenium resulted in cubic-NiSe2 (nickel selenide) nanostructures. Further, annealing NiSe2 nanostructures at intermediate pressure (10<^>-3 Torr) has realized the partial oxygen substitution in place of selenium, resulting in NiSe/NiO nanostructures along with phase change from cubic-NiSe2 to hexagonal-NiSe. Supercapacitor electrodes fabricated using NiSe/NiO nanostructures delivered the specific capacitance of 83.5 F g(-1) at the scan rate of 2 mV s(-1), which is surprisingly more than a double as compared with pristine NiSe2 electrodes (37.4 F g(-1)). Annealing at intermediate pressure and high temperature significantly enhanced the specific capacitances of the nanostructured electrodes and also accompanied with the good capacitance retention of 94% for 5000 CV cycles.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2053-1591			WOS:000443156500001

Further, the electrocatalyst must require low overpotential above the standard potential (> 1.23 V) of water splitting to produce hydrogen. This study presents the facile co-precipitation derived rare earth dysprosium (Dy) doped cupric oxide nanoparticles (Cu1-xDyxO) as a non-noble transition metal oxide nanoparticle. The 3 % Dy doped CuO (3 % Dy/CuO) and 1 % Dy doped CuO (1 % Dy/CuO) electrocatalysts showed excellent Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) at 1.55 V vs RHE and Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) at -0.036 V vs RHE in aqueous 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte to attain the benchmark current density (10 mA cm(-2)). The stability of the driven electrocatalyst in a bi-functional electrocatalytic setup was monitored for 24 h and was found to be exhibiting a cell voltage of about 2.1 V at 30 mA cm(-2) constant current density. Further, the retention capability of the electrode was observed to be 99 % with a very minimal loss.

The introduction of a single transition metal atom (TM) at the surface is a good way to improve the HER performance of MXenes. However, the effect of TM on MXenes in previous theoretical studies focused on pure functional groups, and ignored the hybrid-functionalized ones, which are mostly observed in experiments. Herein, the HER performance of four O/F ratios stable hybrids MXenes, Ti2CTx (T = -O, -F), is explored. Ti2CO1.33F0.67 exhibits superior HER catalytic activity, comparable to that of platinum metals. Further combinatorial screening of approximate to 200 TMs based on Ti2CTx structures suggests that Rh, Ti, Ir, and Pt are optimal TM candidates that enhance the sensitivity to strain modulation and reduce the activation barrier for hydrogen generation. A descriptor psi is used to quantify HER performance and reveals the role of the electron filling of TM to the antibonding orbitals. These findings propose feasible candidates with high HER performance through single-atom modification for hybrid-functional MXenes, and a useful descriptor to screen for MXenes with desirable catalytic properties.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000681278200001		
J	Tagore, Ranitendranath; Crabtree, Robert H.; Brudvig, Gary W.								Oxygen evolution catalysis by a dimanganese complex and its relation to photosynthetic water oxidation								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				47	6			1815	1823		10.1021/ic062218d				MAR 17 2008	2008	[Mn-2(III/IV)(mu-O)(2)(terpy)(2)(OH2)(2)](NO3)(3) (1, where terpy = 2,2':6'2"-terpyridine) acts as a water-oxidation catalyst with HSO5- as the primary oxidant in aqueous solution and, thus, provides a model system for the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II (Limburg, J.; et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 423-430). The majority of the starting [Mn-2(III/IV)(mu-O)(2)](3+)complex is converted to the[Mn-2(IV/IV)(mu-O)(2)](4+) form (2) during this reaction (Chen, H.; et al. Inorg. Chem. 2007, 46, 34-43). Here, we have used stopped-flow UV-visible spectroscopy to monitor UV-visible absorbance changes accompanying the conversion of I to 2 by HSO5-. With excess HSO5-, the rate of absorbance change was found to be first-order in [1] and nearly zero-order in [HSO5-]. At relatively low [HSO5-], the change of absorbance with time is distinctly biphasic. The observed concentration dependences are interpreted in terms of a model involving the two-electron oxidation of 1 by HSO5-, followed by the rapid reaction of the two-electron-oxidized intermediate with another molecule of 1 to give two molecules of 2. In order to rationalize biphasic behavior at low [HSO5-], we propose a difference in reactivity of the [Mn-2(III/IV)(mu-O)(2)](3+) complex upon binding of HSO5- to the MnIII site as compared to the reactivity upon binding HSO5- to the Mn-IV site. The kinetic distinctness of the Mn-III and Mn-IV sites allows us to estimate upper limits for the rates of intramolecular electron transfer and terminal ligand exchange between these sites. The proposed, mechanism leads to insights on the optimization of 1 as a water-oxidation catalyst. The rates of terminal ligand exchange and electron transfer between oxo-bridged Mn atoms in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II are discussed in light of these results.									138	2	1	0	27	0	140			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000253918000010	18330972

Redox-Induced Conformational Switching in Photosystem-II-Inspired Biomimetic Peptides: A UV Resonance Raman Study								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				116	35			10590	10599		10.1021/jp303607b				SEP 6 2012	2012	Long-distance electron transfer (ET) plays a critical role in solar energy conversion, DNA synthesis, and mitochondrial respiration. Tyrosine (Y) side chains can function as intermediates in these reactions. The oxidized form of tyrosine deprotonates to form a neutral tyrosyl radical, Y*, a powerful oxidant. In photosystem II (PSII) and ribonucleotide reductase, redox-active tyrosines are involved in the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions, which are key in catalysis. In these proteins, redox-linked structural dynamics may play a role in controlling the radical's extraordinary oxidizing power. To define these dynamics in a structurally tractable system, we have constructed biomimetic peptide maquettes, which are inspired by PSII. UV resonance Raman studies were conducted of ET and PCET reactions in these beta-hairpins, which contain a single tyrosine residue. At pH 11, UV photolysis induces ET from the deprotonated phenolate side chain to solvent. At pH 8.5, interstrand proton transfer to a pi-stacked histidine accompanies the Y oxidation reaction. The UV resonance Raman difference spectrum, associated with Y oxidation, was obtained from the peptide maquettes in D2O buffers. The difference spectra exhibited bands at 1441 and 1472 cm(-1), which are assigned to the amide II' (CN) vibration of the beta-hairpin This amide II' spectral change was attributed to substantial alterations in amide hydrogen bonding, which are coupled with the Y/Y* redox reaction and are reversible. These experiments show that ET and PCET reactions can create new minima in the protein conformational landscape. This work suggests that charge-coupled conformational changes can occur in complex proteins that contain redox-active tyrosines. These redox-linked dynamics could play an important role in control of PCET in biological oxygen evolution, respiration, and DNA synthesis.									16	0	0	0	6	0	16			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000308339400019	22860514

We are facing the problem by means of a rational approach aimed at understanding how catalytic performance may be optimized by the knowledge of the reaction mechanism of water oxidation and the fate of the catalytic site under the inevitably harsh oxidative conditions. For the purposes of our study we selected iridium water oxidation catalysts, exhibiting remarkable performance (TOF > 5 s(-1) and TON > 20000). In particular, we recently focused our attention on [Cp*Ir(N,O)X] (N,O = 2-pyridincarboxylate; X = Cl or NO3) and [IrCl(Hedta)]Na water oxidation catalysts. The former exhibited a remarkable TOF whereas the latter showed a very high TON. Furthermore, [IrCl(Hedta)] Na was heterogenized onto TiO2 taking advantage of the presence of a dandling -COOH functionality. The heterogenized catalyst maintained approximately the same catalytic activity of the homogeneous analogous with the advantage that could be reused many times. Mechanistic studies were performed in order to shed some light on the rate-determining step and the transformation of catalysts when exposed to "oxidative stress". It was found that the last oxidative step, preceding oxygen liberation, is the rate-determining step when a small excess of sacrificial oxidant is used. In addition, several intermediates of the oxidative transformation of the catalyst were intercepted and characterized by NMR, X-Ray diffractometry and ESI-MS.

Using exogenous phosphorus as dopant, the prepared catalyst (PA-SS 900) favorably possessed a high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity regarding half-wave potential (0.82 V) and limiting current (4.47 mA cm(-2)), which approached those of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. For practical application in microbial fuel cell (MFC), the N, P co-doped PA-SS 900 achieved a maximum power density (MPD) of 802 mW m(-2) and an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 653 my, which also were close to that (892 mW m(-2) and 752 mV) based on 20% Pt/C as cathode catalyst. Remarkably, the synthetic catalyst had a better long-term stability than that of 20% Pt/C in alkaline medium. These results demonstrated that N, P co-doped PA-SS 900 was an accessible and efficient ORR catalyst in air-cathode MFC for relatively desirable energy generation and wastewater treatment. Further, the direct utilization of waste shrimp shells replacing chitin or chitosan in energy conversion is worthy of in-depth study due to the advantages of simple process, environmental friendliness and availability.									42	1	0	0	4	0	43			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000503098200012

Typically, the hydrolysis of most hydrogen-rich boron hydrides (e.g. NaBH4, NH3BH3 and Me2NHBH3) catalyzed by nanomateriak generates H-2 with only one H atom supplied by water and the other one by a hydrogen-rich boron hydride. Interestingly, both H atoms of produced H-2 are provided by water upon hydrolysis of B-2(OH)(4). Herein, the catalytic mechanisms of H-2 evolution upon water splitting at the expense of B-2(OH)(4) in its hydrolysis reactions catalyzed by acid, base or metal nanoparticles have been investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By computational studies, the mechanisms of catalysis by base and metal nanoparticles are basically the same as those speculated from our previous experiments. The previously proposed acid catalytic mechanism has been overturned, however. This study not only provides important insights into the catalytic mechanism for water splitting at the expense of B-2(OH)(4), but also opens up an exciting opportunity to use water to store H-2.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000773580700001	35343980

Results showed that oil fraction yields from co-pyrolysis of bamboo wastes and microalgae decreased largely with biochar addition, but still maintained at 35-37 wt.%, while gas yields were enhanced greatly. As catalytic co-pyrolysis promoted the decomposition of long-chain fatty acids and 0-species, and the formation of aromatics and phenols, therefore most oxygen in bio-oil vapor transformed to CO, CO2 and H20, and only 7-9 wt.% oxygen retained in oil fraction. It indicated that biochar catalytic co-pyrolysis could not only efficiently remove oxygen (over 90 wt.%), but also keep oil fraction yields. Moreover, the active 0-containing groups and specific surface area of biochar catalyst decreased largely after catalytic co-pyrolysis. The possible reaction pathways of catalytic co-pyrolysis with biochar catalyst were proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we rationally designed an isolated single-atom Ru-modified FeP as a model catalyst with enhanced HER performance, which displayed an overpotential of 62 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1). Importantly, through operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements together with density functional theory calculations, a synergistic effect was discovered between the monodispersed metal atoms and the phosphide substrate. We found that the bond-length-extended isolated Ru(+3)-P-4-Fe species under catalytic conditions serve as the boosted active sites during the HER, leading to charge redistribution at the atomic interface of the catalyst, meanwhile improving the H adsorption and H-2 desorption behavior, and further promoting the HER kinetics. This work gives new viewpoints for the exploration of highly active transition-metal-phosphide-based HER catalysts by refinement of the atomic and electronic structure.									15	1	0	0	1	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000589418400010

The main purpose of the research is to investigate the transformations of sulfur-bearing minerals and the reaction processes of sulfur fixation in different atmospheres and temperature ranges so as to provide new data for research in sulfur fixation mechanism. As a part of this research, the radial distribution of sulfur fixation products in the combustion process of single coal briquette was studied. It is found that CaSO4 and CaS as sulfur fixation products were formed. CaSO4 distributed in outer layer of coal briquette ash ball, and CaS was in inner layer of ash ball. The results indicated that combustion atmosphere can considerably affect the formation of sulfur fixation products. Furthermore, the main sulfur-containing mineral pyrite (FeS2) in coal and CaO were selected to explain the mechanism of sulfur fixation in different atmospheres. The transformations and thermal behaviors of FeS2 and mixture of FeS2 and CaO in oxygen-containing atmosphere and inert atmosphere were studied by means of X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. In oxygen-containing atmosphere, FeS2 was decomposed to F1-xS and S-2(g) above 390.34 degrees C, F1-xS was further oxidized to Fe2O3 and SO2, and then SO2 reacted with CaO and O-2 to form CaSO4. In oxygen-free atmosphere, FeS2 was decomposed to Fe1-xS and S-2(g) above 408.75 degrees C, CaO reacted with Fe1-xS to form CaS above 847.48 degrees C. It can be concluded that atmosphere condition affected the sulfur fixation processes, the evolution of sulfur was FeS2 -> Fe1-xS -> SO2 -> CaSO4 in oxygen atmosphere, FeS2 -> Fe1-xS -> CaS in argon atmosphere in the processes of sulfur fixation.

The developed strategy is based on spray drying of an aqueous solution mixture of ammonium heptamolybdate, ammonium carbonate, and thiourea in the presence of suspended GO followed by calcination under H-2 environment. The composite exhibit remarkable interaction between rGO and MoS2. The MoS2 contain majority of 1T phase, high density exposed active edge sites as well as strained sulfur vacancies and oxygen incorporated basal plane. In this process, ammonium carbonate takes crucial role and facilitate the formation of smaller sheets with enhanced inter layer spacing and promote the formation 1T phase. The MoS2-rGO composite exhibit excellent electrocatalytic HER activity and showed a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at 168 mV, a Tafel slope as small as 62 mV/dec, > 98% activity retention after 1000 cycles, which are quite high or comparable to that of similar compositions prepare with complicated methods.

The XRD patterns have ascertained the formation of nickel metal with different planes in face centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal closed pack (hcp) form. SEM and TEM images have confirmed the nickel nano-particles with diameter of 10-50 nm inside the 0.2 mu m sized hollow carbon spheres. The BET surface area values gradually decreased with greater encapsulation of nickel; although the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) values have been calculated as quite higher. It confirms the well dispersion of nickel in the materials and induces their electrocatalytic performance through the active surface sites. The cyclic voltammetric studies have evaluated hydrogen desorption peaks as five times more intense in nickel encapsulated materials, in comparison to the pure hollow carbon spheres. The anodic peak current density value has reached the highest level of 1.9 A cm(-2) for HCSNi10, which gradually decreases with lesser amount of nickel in the electrocatalysts. These electrocatalysts have been proved electrochemically stable during their usage for 48 h long duration under potentiostatic condition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

II. Modeling								PHYSICS OF PLASMAS				23	12					123513	10.1063/1.4971803				DEC 2016	2016	One of the distinguishable features of plasma jets compared with the traditional streamers is their repeatable propagation. As an initial objective, the effect of seed electrons on the repeatability of plasma plume propagation is investigated numerically. Besides residual electrons left from previous pulses, the electrons detached from O-2(-) ions could also be a significant source of the seed electrons to affect the repeatability of plasma plume propagation when an electronegative gas admixture is presented. In this investigation, a global plasma chemical kinetics model is developed to investigate the temporal evolution of the electron and O-2(-) ions in the afterglow of a plasma plume driven by microsecond pulse direct current voltages, at a total gas pressure of 2 x 10(4) Pa or 4 x 10(3) Pa in helium or helium-oxygen mixtures with an air impurity of 0.025%. In addition, a Monte Carlo technique has been applied to calculate the O-2(-) detachment rate coefficient. Accordingly, the seed electron density due to detachment from O-2(-) ions for different percentages of oxygen is obtained. Finally, the minimum seed electron density required for the plasma bullets to propagate in a repeatable mode is obtained according to the critical frequency from the experiments. It is found that the order of minimum seed electron number density required for repeatable propagation mode is independent of oxygen concentrations in the helium-oxygen mixture. It is 108 cm(-3) for 20 kPa and 107 cm(-3) for 4 kPa. Furthermore, for the helium with an air impurity of 0.025%, the residual electrons left over from previous discharges are the main source of seed electrons. On the other hand, when 0.5% of O-2 is added, the detachment of O-2(-) is the main source of the seed electrons.

Utilizing a high resolution transmission electron spectroscopy, the morphology and nanostructures of soot sampled from spatial locations at different heights in IDFs were analyzed. The graphitization and the oxidation reactivity of soot were tested by an X-ray diffraction and a thermogravimetric analyzer, respectively. Results demonstrated that the magnetic force on paramagnetic species, such as oxygen molecules, can modify the soot formation and oxidation. More incipient soot particles with larger diameters appeared in chains or branches or tufted forms on the flame wing region and the higher position than that on the flame centerline region and the lower position. With magnetic fields, greater amounts of clustered soot particles displayed more crowded distribution and larger diameters. Soot particles with typical structures of the core-shell were promoted to own more orderly bordered lamellae with longer fringe length and smaller fringe tortuosity by the magnetic force acting on oxygen at the same sample position. These modifications resulted in relatively larger diffraction angle of the peak, higher graphitization degree and slightly lower oxidation reactivity of soot.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1003-2169	1993-033X		WOS:000530821200024

In the present paper, a leaf-like zinc and cobalt-based bimetallic metal-organic framework is used to prepare the nitrogen-doped porous carbon sheet (ZnCo-NC). The introduction of Zn in the metal organic framework precursors ensures the uniform and dense distribution of cobalt nanoparticles in the final carbon structure, which reserves the prime active sites, nitrogen-coordinated cobalt (Co-N-x) and active metallic cobalt species embedded in the N-doped carbon layers (Co@NC), in the catalysts. The Co-N-x and Co@NC sites are found to be enriched in the ZnCo-NC, and the larger surface area and abundant pores on it further accelerate the mass transfer process, which are beneficial for enhancing HER performance of catalysts in acidic and alkaline media.

Herein, the effects of phosphorus-doping and two-dimensional (2D) porous structures on the transition among singlet excitons, triplet excitons, and carriers and consequently the regulation mechanism of reactive oxygen species have been intensively studied. The calculations of the density functional theory and experimental results confirmed that P-doping could induce a dual built-in electric field to provide a driving force (up to 0.3 eV) for exciton dissociation. The light response capability, exciton dissociation, and carrier migration efficiency were significantly enhanced by the synergistic effect of the dual electric field and 2D porous structure. The optimal sample exhibited excellent H2 evolution rate and tetracycline degradation rate under visible-light irradiation which were approximately 25 and 7.1 times higher than those of bulk g-C3N4, respectively. The improved photocatalytic activity can also be demonstrated by a 2.9-fold and 3.2-fold increase in center dot O2- and H2O2 production, respectively. This work provides a new perspective and approach to improve the performance of polymer photocatalysts and the targeted regulation of active species using exciton engineering.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000735302400002

Though noble metal free catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are being developed to make water splitting more efficient, the search of highly efficient cost effective catalyst for HER still remains a challenge. Carbon coated molybdenum carbide composites (beta-Mo2C@C), a noble metal free electrocatalyst is being highly studied substance as potential electrocatalyst for water splitting where presence of graphitic carbon plays important role. Our study indicate that nature of carbon coating on Mo2C surface plays vital role (amorphous/graphitic). In our systematic experiments beta-Mo2C@C was synthesized in an autoclave. The synthesis parameters were varied to get amorphous as well as graphitic coating on Mo2C. The amorphous surface carbon shows better stability of electrocatalyst in acidic medium compared to graphitic coating. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance (EDLC) measurements suggest beta-Mo2C@C as suitable candidate for energy storage applications.									59	0	0	0	5	0	59			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000434467000102

To investigate the effect of the interaction between sulfur in sulfur-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (SOMC) and palladium (Pd) on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, a catalyst was prepared with low Pd content supported on SOMC (Pd/SOMC). Sulfur was expected to serve as an anchor for Pd to form smaller nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the Pd particle size in Pd/SOMC was smaller than that of Pd supported on pristine ordered mesoporous carbon (Pd/OMC), indicating the improvement of Pd dispersion by the anchoring of sulfur to Pd. HER activity of these catalysts was analyzed from 0.1 V to -0.3 V with a scan rate of 1 mV/s in N-2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte. Despite the smaller Pd particle size in Pd/SOMC, Pd/OMC showed better HER activity (7.38 mA/cm(2) at -0.15 V) than Pd/SOMC (2.71 mA/cm(2)). Moreover, overpotential at -10 mA/cm 2 for Pd/OMC was 90 mV lower than that for Pd/SOMC. Density functional theory calculations proved that the increase in the binding energy of hydrogen on the Pd in the Pd/SOMC is related to the decrease in HER activity.

When the cells are cultivated under high light conditions the following results were found: (i) The O-2 evolution activity decreases faster in WT*1 cells than in WT*3 cells both in the absence and in the presence of lincomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor; (ii) In WT*1 cells, the rate constant for the decrease of the O-2 evolution activity is comparable in the presence and in the absence of lincomycin; (iii) The D1 content revealed by western blot analysis decays similarly in both WT*1 and WT*3 cells and much slowly than O-2 evolution; (iv) The faster decrease in O-2 evolution in WT*1 than in WT*3 cells correlates with a much faster inhibition of the S-2-state formation: (v) The shape of the WT*1 cells is altered. All these results are in agreement with a photo-inhibition process resulting in the loss of the O-2 activity much faster than the D1 turnover in PsbA1-PSII and likely to a greater production of reactive oxygen species under high light conditions in WT*1 than in WT*3. This latter result is discussed in view of the known effects of the PsbA1 to PsbA3 substitution on the redox properties of the Photosystem II cofactors. The observation that under low light conditions WT*3 cells are able to express the psbA(3) gene, whereas under similar conditions wild type cells are expressing mainly the psbA(1) gene is also discussed.

The structure and energetics of reactants, prereaction complex, transition state structure and radical product have been optimized and vibrational frequencies have been calculated at the HF, MP2. B88, and B3LYP level using 6-31G* and 6-31G** basis sets. The energetics of the reaction is characterized within the MP2, DFT, G2, CBS, and BAC approaches. The evolution of the barrier height and reaction enthalpy has been systematically investigated with respect to the methodological approach employed. The best agreement with experimental results for the barrier heights is found at the BAC-G2 and BAC-G2(MP2) levels. A reaction enthalpy of -28.4 +/- 1.2 kcal/mol is determined in clear accord with direct experimental data. The performance of the different theoretical methods and the reliability of DFT approach to describe this radical reaction is discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The as-obtained p-FeP/NCF/CP composite exhibits a higher specific surface area and larger porosity in comparison to FeP/CP composite due to the rich porous structure and 3D network of the N-doped carbon fiber matrix (NCF). Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that p-FeP/NCF/CP composite exhibits an excellent electrocatalytic activity for HER with small overpotentials of 63 mV and 96 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. The p-FeP/NCF/CP material also exhibits a small Tafel slope and charge transfer resistance as well as good stability and durability in pH 7 and pH 14.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2398-4902			WOS:000744084500001

Here, a procedure of metallic Fe-family nanoparticles (NPs), such as nitrides (Co5.47N, Fe4N and Ni3N) and zero-valence metals (Co and Ni) NPs encapsulated into three-dimensional porous nitrogen-doped carbon (NCC) has been successfully demonstrated by the combination of sol-gel processing and subsequent nitridation process. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) valence band experiments, and the electrochemical measurements suggest that the ORR activities of encased Fe-family metallic NPs evidently increase as the d-band centre values move away from the Fermi level as the following order: Ni3N < Ni < Co < Fe4N < Co5.47N, showing that the d-band centre value can be a good criterion to screen and evaluate the electrocatalysts. The optimized Co5.47N phase leads to an exceptional ORR activity with a nearly close 4e-reaction pathway (half-wave potential (E-1/(2)): -176 mV vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE), n: 3.8-4.0, HO2- yields: 7.3-8.1%), comparable to those of the state-of-the-art Pt/C in alkaline medium. Moreover, the Co5.47N/NCC also has a superior long-term stability and tolerance to MeOH crossover effect to commercial Pt/C.									25	1	0	0	0	0	25			2405-8297			WOS:000436924800022

The innovation of water oxidation freed photosynthesis to invade new environments and visibly changed the face of the Earth. We offer a new hypothesis for how this process evolved, which identifies two critical roles for carbon dioxide in the Archean period. First, we present a thermodynamic analysis showing that bicarbonate (formed by dissolution of CO2) is a more efficient alternative substrate than water for O-2 production by oxygenic phototrophs. This analysis clarifies the origin of the long debated "bicarbonate effect" on photosynthetic O-2 production. We propose that bicarbonate was the thermodynamically preferred reductant before water in the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. Second, we have examined the speciation of manganese(II) and bicarbonate in water, and find that they form Mn-bicarbonate clusters as the major species under conditions that model the chemistry of the Archean sea. These clusters have been found to be highly efficient precursors for the assembly of the tetramanganese-oxide core of the water-oxidizing enzyme during biogenesis. We show that these clusters can be oxidized at electrochemical potentials that are accessible to anoxygenic phototrophs and thus the most likely building blocks for assembly of the first O-2 evolving photoreaction center, most likely originating from green nonsulfur bacteria before the evolution of cyanobacteria.									232	4	3	0	177	3	250			0027-8424			WOS:000167258900015	11226211

The oxygen was found to significantly accelerate crystallization from mechanically induced defects for the (GeS2)(0.1)(Sb2S3)(0.9) composition and to sustain the intensity of crystal formation in case of the (GeS2)(0.2)(Sb2S3)as and (GeS2)(0.3)(Sb2S3)(0.7) compositions. On the other hand, presence of oxygen influenced neither the morphology of the crystallites, nor the actual crystallization model-free and model-based kinetics. Direct microscopic observation confirmed strict surface crystallization for all studied composition. Compositional evolutions of the viscosity data and microscopically determined crystal growth rate curves have shown that it is the exceptionally high crystal growth rate and crystallization tendency (compared to the minor-to-moderate contribution of viscosity itself) that are responsible for the significant influenceability of the (GeS2)(0.1)(Sb2S3)(0.9) crystallization by the presence of oxygen.

The influence of reaction temperature, number of ALD cycles, type of substrate, 2nd reagent and type of ALD method on Pt nanoparticle deposition are comprehensively studied and discussed in this work. Varying the reaction temperature and number of cycles across the three different ALD methods affects Pt particle size, density, and loading. Surface termination of STO-NCs substrate will change deposited Pt nanoparticle growth orientation and thermodynamic shape. The B reagent besides platinum precursor can lead to different ligand decomposition mechanism when Pt precursors are exposed: oxygen allows more effective ligand combustion compared to water, however, the Pt particles are more oxidized according to XPS studies. We expect this work provides a way for tailoring nanoparticles with desired size, dispersion, exposed surfaces and chemical state etc, which helps controlling and optimizing their performance when applied as catalysts or nanosensors.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000410762300001

The comparison of the calculated excitation functions with exact quantum results and experimental data showed that the present quantum dynamics approach is a very useful tool for the study of the selected and related systems, in a quite wide collision energy interval (approximately 0.0-1.1 eV), involving a much lower computational cost than the quantum exact methods and without a significant loss of accuracy in the cross sections.									33	5	0	0	0	0	34			0021-9606			WOS:000241722000017	17092071

A previously unappreciated role of steric factors in the Root effect was revealed by a comparison of pH effects on oxygenation and oxidation processes in human Hb relative to Spot (Leiostomus xanthurus) and Carp (Cyprinodon carpio) Hbs. The Root effect confers five-fold increased pH sensitivity to oxygenation of Spot and Carp Hbs relative to Hb A(0) in the absence of anionic effectors, and even larger relative elevations of pH sensitivity of oxygenation in the presence of 0.2 M phosphate. Remarkably, the Root effect was not evident in the oxidation of the Root effect Hbs. This finding rules out pH-dependent alterations in the thermodynamic properties of the heme iron, measured in the anaerobic oxidation reaction, as the basis of the Root effect. The alternative explanation supported by these results is that the elevated pH sensitivity of oxygenation of Root effect Hbs is attributable to globin-dependent steric effects that alter oxygen affinity by constraining conformational fluidity, but which have little influence on electron exchange via the heme edge. This elegant mode of allosteric control can regulate oxygen affinity within a given quaternary state, in addition to modifying the T-R equilibrium. Evolution of Hb sequences that result in proton-linked steric barriers to heme oxygenation could provide a general mechanism to account for the appearance of the Root effect in the structurally diverse Hbs of many species.

While it makes much progress so far, the development of an environmental-friendly and cost-effective method to upgrade earth-abundant biomass into high value-added products still remains a major challenge. Thermal pyrolysis method which requires high pyrolysis temperature and long synthesis period is considered as a general method for preparation of carbon-based electrocatalysts. In view of this, ruthenium, nitrogen co-doped porous carbon (Ru@CN) is synthesized by laser conversion method at room temperature using cheap and renewable biomass honey as green carbon source. By controlling the loading of Ru and laser power, the electrocatalytic activities of as-prepared electrocatalysts can be adjusted effectively. Because of the advantage of rich Ru0 and Ru-N sites, the synthesized 0.04-Ru@CN-6 with Ru loading amount of 2.66 wt% exhibits a preferable electrocatalytic activity toward HER under all-pH conditions. Especially in alkaline solution, the optimal 0.04-Ru@CN-6 exhibits a small overpotential (11 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) current density, which is even much better than commercial 20 wt % Pt/C (37 mV). This strategy reported here may be a feasible and unique approach to synthesis and design of high-performance as well as cost-effective all-pH HER electrocatalyst. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

However, the solid-state reactions of M/C/N-containing precursors at high temperature was rather complicated, making the engineering of carbonization processes of M-N-C catalysts challenging and less explored. Herein, we report a way to modulate the pyrolysis processes of M-N-C by pre-organization of the molecular precursors via a simple solvation, in which, the simultaneous hydrogen bonding and coordination interactions played an important roles. It was revealed that the supramolecular precursors from different solvents had the same chemical compositions but quite different crystal structures. Accordingly, the pyrolysis processes were greatly altered, making the as-prepared Co-N-C exhibit distinct morphologies ranging from worm-nanotubes to bamboo-nanotubes and to porous nanosheets. The optimized Co-N-C showed competitive bifunctional electrocatalytic ORR and OER activities, which were further successfully applied to advance the rechargeable Zn-air batteries with excellent cycling stability over 600 h at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) and voltage gap (0.76 V). This work highlights the great potential of the pre-organization for the designing and selecting of precursors to engineer pyrolyzed M-N-C with higher electrocatalytic activities.

Two different mechanisms are discussed for desorption of electronically excited O(D-1) atoms from the ice surface. One is unimolecular dissociation of H2O to H-2+O(D-1) as a primary photoprocess. The other is the surface recombination reaction of hot OH radicals that are produced from photodissociation of hydrogen peroxide as a secondary photoprocess.

DFT was used to calculate the hydrogen adsorption energy on a series of single-element, bimetallic, and trimetallic (Au, Pt, Ni, and Cu) substrates to provide leads that could be synthesized in the form of alloy or phase-separated particles via SPBCL. PtAuCu (18 nm, similar to 1:1:1 stoichiometry) has been identified as a homogeneous alloy phase that behaves as an effective hydrogen evolution catalyst in acidic aqueous media, even when it is made in bulk form via solution phase methods. Significantly, the bulk-prepared PtAuCu/C nanocatalyst discovered via this process exhibits an activity seven times higher than that of the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst (based upon Pt content). The advantage of using SPBCL in the discovery process is that one can uniformly make particles, each consisting of a uniform phase combination (e.g., all alloy or all phase-segregated species) at a fixed elemental ratio, an important consideration when working with polyelemental species where multiple phases may exist.									35	2	0	0	1	0	35			0027-8424			WOS:000429540300042	29572429

However, the uses of CTAB were mainly considered as template or capping agents to form controllable shape and protect the product from agglomeration. Here it was discovered that CATB could serve as a very mild reductant to reduce gold salt precursors preparing gold nanoparticles (GNPs) at base environment. CTAB acted as the reducing agent suffering a partial degradation and forming CTA macro radicals. FTIR proved the formation of C-Cl and/or C-Br bond after CTAB degraded. The characterization of synthesized GNPs was examined by UV-Vis spectra, TEM and XRD. Several factors affecting the process of reaction, such as the amount of NaOH, the molar ratio of CTAB and HAuCl4, the reaction temperature, the effect of light and oxygen, and stirring were discussed.

Herein, a promising coral-like N,S-codoped hierarchical porous carbon with supported cobaltous sulfide nanoparticles (CoxSy/NS-HPC) with different molar ratio of S:Co was successfully fabricated via an economic method. The role of thiourea in the preparation process was found to be triplex. It is not only as a sulfur source, but also as sulfur-nitrogen dopant, and most importantly it participates in the formation of the hierarchical porous carbon which will reduce the diffusion resistance of the reactants and expose more active sites. Benefited from the carbon support, the hybrid architecture CoS1.097/NS-HPC (S:Co = 3:1) possesses high specific surface area (549m(2)/g) and more active sites, as result it was developed as decent ORR electrocatalyst for fuel cell. Surprisingly, we found that CoS1.097/NS-HPC provides a more positive onset potential, higher cathodic current density and half-wave potential in alkaline media than CoS1.097 NPs and CoS1.097 supported on conventional mesoporous carbon (CoS1.097/MC). More importantly, compared with commercial Pt/C, CoS1.097/NS-HPC manifests higher current density, better durability, and more excellent methanol tolerance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The catalyst exhibits high activity and pronounced long-term stability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in both acidic and alkaline media. We find that co-doping with Zr can greatly enhance the catalyst's performance, whereas doping with only Zr results in no improvement. For our optimal sample ZFNC-3-800, its current density at 0.9 V (vs. RHE) could be reach 0.64 mA/cm(2), which is 1.7 times that o f FNC-800. Through TEM, XRD and XPS analyses, we find that co-doping with Zr can change the microstructure of the catalyst, immobilize its iron and nitrogen components and modify the distribution of N species in the final catalyst. Importantly, co-doping with Zr leads to the creation of Zr2FeOx species, contributing to the possible structure of N4-x-Fe-O-x in our ZFNC-3-800 catalyst and enhance its performance. Fe atoms are much more electron-deficient in this structure than in FeNx species and thus favor the adsorption and activation of oxygen molecules. This work is the first to explore co-doping with early transition metals and to reveal their important role in a specific catalyst. (c) The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.

Plasma membrane NADPH oxidases (NOXs) are key producers of ROS, and play important roles in the regulation of plant-pathogen interactions. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the NOX gene family in the soybean genome (Glycine max) and 17 NOX (GmNOX) genes were identified. Structural analysis revealed that the GmNOX proteins in soybean were as conserved as those in other plants. 8 duplicated gene pairs were formed by a Glycine-specific whole-genome duplication (WGD) event approximately 13 million years ago (Mya). The Ka/Ks ratios of GmNOX genes ranged from 0.04 to 0.28, suggesting that the GmNOX family had undergone purifying selection in soybean. Gene expression patterns showed different expression of these duplicate genes, suggesting that the GmNOXs were retained by substantial subfunctionalization during the soybean evolutionary processes. Subsequently, the expression of GmNOXs in response to drought and phytohormones were characterized via qPCR. Importantly, four GmNOXs showed strong expression in nodules, pointing to their probable involvement in nodulation. Thus, our results shed light on the evolutionary history of this family in soybean and contribute to the functional characterization of GmNOX genes in soybean.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			0888-7543	1089-8646		WOS:000475294900012	29621573

(Biochemistry 50:10658-10665, 2011). The present work describes a second pathway of the photoproduction of organic peroxides on the donor side of PS2. It was shown that illumination of CaCl2-treated PS2 membranes (deprived of the PS2 extrinsic proteins without removal of the Mn-containing water-oxidizing complex) (CaCl2-PS2) led to the photoproduction of highly lipophilic organic hydroperoxides (LP-OOH) (in amount corresponding to 1.5 LP-OOH per one reaction center of PS2) which significantly increased upon the addition of exogenous electron acceptor potassium ferricyanide (to 4.2 LP-OOH per one reaction center). Addition of catalase (200 U/ml) before illumination inhibited ferricyanide-induced photoproduction of hydroperoxides while no effect was obtained by adding catalase after illumination or by adding inactivated catalase before illumination. The hydroperoxide photoproduction was inhibited by the addition of exogenous electron donor for PS2, diphenylcarbazide or diuron (inhibitor of the electron transfer in PS2). The addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide to the CaCl2-PS2 led to the production of highly lipophilic organic hydroperoxides in the dark (3.2 LP-OOH per one reaction center). We suggest that the photoproduction of highly lipophilic organic hydroperoxides in CaCl2-PS2 preparations occurs via redox activity of H2O2 produced on the donor side of PS2.

Their practical application is, however, still hindered by the high charging overvoltages and detrimental side reactions. Recently, the use of redox mediators dissolved in the electrolyte emerged as a promising tool to enable charging at moderate voltages. The presented work advances this concept and distinctly improves capacity and cycling stability of Li-O-2 batteries by combining high redox mediator concentrations with a solid electrolyte (SE). The use of high redox mediator concentrations significantly increases the discharge capacity by including the oxidation and reduction of the redox mediator into charge cycling. Highly efficient cycling is achieved by protecting the lithium anode with a solid electrolyte, which completely inhibits unfavored deactivation of oxidized species at the anode. Surprisingly, the SE also suppresses detrimental side reactions at the carbon electrode to a large extent and enables stable charging completely below 4.0 V over a prolonged period. It is demonstrated that anode and cathode communicate deleteriously via the liquid electrolyte, which induces degradation reactions at the carbon electrode. The separation of cathode and anode with a SE is therefore considered as a key step toward stable Li-O-2 batteries, in conjunction with a concentrated redox mediator electrolyte.									120	7	0	0	7	0	121			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000373519500017	26942895

Herein, we demonstrate a novel strategy to embed metallic cobalt in S and N co-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that are uniformly grown onto hollow-mesoporous carbon spheres (HMCS) (denoted as Co@SNHC). The HMCS are used as an appropriate substrate to disperse CNTs around the outer surface when subjected to an in situ polymerization process followed by subsequent pyrolysis. Developing suitable contact between the HMCS and CNTs results in the formation of well-structured Co@SNHC electrocatalysts that exhibit good ORR performance with a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.831 V (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode) in a 0.1 M KOH medium and a E-1/2 of 0.682 V in a 0.1 M HClO4 medium. Most importantly, the Co@SNHC electrocatalysts exhibit remarkable stability and improved methanol tolerance with no observed changes to the cyclic voltammograms in both alkaline and acidic media. Therefore, the in situ growth of CNTs onto HMCS combines the active material and the electrically conductive carbon additive with stable electrical contact. Additionally, Co@SNHC as a cathode electrocatalyst in Zn-air cells possesses good power density, specific capacity and long cycle life, demonstrating great potential in practical applications for rechargeable energy devices.									24	3	0	0	0	0	24			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472566400045

By SEM and TEM, it could be observed that the rGO aerogel is a porous structure with particles of metal uniformly distributed on carbon sheets, and the sizes of nanoparticles were approximately 20-100 nm. The Raman results indicated that the GO was successfully reduced by ethylene glycol in the hydrothermal process. XPS results showed that nitrogen was introduced to rGO nanosheets, and Ni-Fe-NrGO possessed the higher contents of pyridinic N and graphitic N. XRD results suggested the Ni3Fe phase exists in the Ni-Fe-NrGO, which was consistent with EDX results. The electro-catalyzed oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) properties were evaluated by a rotating disk electrode (RDE). The Ni-Fe-NrGO sample showed synergistic effect with a relatively higher onset potential and diffusion-limiting current density of approximately 4.01 mA cm(-2), with an electron transfer number close to 4, and exhibited an excellent ORR performance compared with the commercial Pt/C electro-catalyst.

This method enables us to control the structure of the polymer constituent by the proper selection of the second eutectic component. In this respect, alkali metal chlorides and zinc chloride give rise to poly(triazine imides), while tin(II) chloride delivers melon-based polymers. The crystallinity of the carbon nitride polymer phase can be influenced by varying the concentration of the precursor in the melt. On the other hand, cobalt oxide loading in the final products can be increased by decreasing the precursor concentration in the melt. The products are highly active photocatalysts for Rhodamine B degradation as exemplified by SnCl2/CoCl2-derived solids, and the water oxidation reaction (WOR). The activity of the products in the WOR is comparable with that of the bench composite photocatalyst prepared by using the three-step procedure that includes the synthesis of Co3O4 nanoparticles as a separate step, thus illustrating the advantages of the developed salt melt assisted approach.									31	0	0	0	4	0	31			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000363163200047

Oxidative etching of S-vacancy defective MoS2 monolayer upon reaction with O-2								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				23	17			10225	10235		10.1039/d0cp06502a		APR 2021		MAY 7 2021	2021	The reactions of O-2 with S vacancy sites within a MoS2 monolayer were investigated using density functional theory calculations. We considered the following defects: single S vacancy, double S vacancy, two adjacent S vacancies and two S vacancies separated by a sulphur atom. We found that the surface distribution of S vacancy sites plays a key role in determining the surface reactivity towards O-2. We observed the desorption of SO2 only for the last vacancy distribution. For the other cases, the surface becomes passivated with very stable structures having O atoms on the original vacancy sites and in some cases an SO group in an adjacent position. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulations showed that the impingement of the O-2 molecule on an S vacancy site produces a stable chemisorbed O-2 molecule with an upright configuration. The surface reactions initiate after the O-2 molecule switches to the lying-down configuration which favours the breakage of the O-O bond and the concurrent formation of S-O bonds. In the most reactive vacancy site configuration, the dissociation of the first O-2 molecule produces an SO intermediate which finally leads to desorption of SO2 after oxygen abstraction from the other adjacent O-2 molecule. The formation of a MoO3 moiety within the monolayer was also observed in the molecular dynamic simulations at higher oxidation levels.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000641732400001	33881024

Surface lattice disorder of TiO2/WO3 arises at hydrogen annealing temperature of 200 and 300 degrees C, while critical phase transition from TiO2/WO3 to TiO2/WO2.9 occurs at 400 degrees C, both of which can introduce oxygen vacancies. The hydrogenated TiO2/WO3 with rich surface-oxygen-vacancies exhibits much higher photocatalytic activity for decomposition of gaseous toluene than pristine TiO2/WO3 under visible-light illumination (lambda>420 nm). The photoelectrochemical analysis shows that the improved electronic properties of oxygen-deficient TiO2/WO3 enable dramatically efficient promotion of photoinduced charge transfer and separation, which is the key factor for the improved photocatalytic activity. It is hoped that the present work could boost ongoing interest for preparing various hydrogenated coupled semiconductors with enhanced activity for diverse photocatalytic applications.

However, they are highly inefficient in separating charges, which limits their photocatalytic activity. Here, we prepared porous, rod-shaped carbon nitrides doped with oxygen by calcinating the precursors prepared from melamine and formic acid. The porous O-doped g-C3N4 nanorods have a large surface area of 81.4 m(2) g(-1). In particular, the oxygen doped into the catalyst enables it to have high efficiency in utilizing light in a range of 420-600 nm, and significantly improves its ability to separate photogenerated carriers. Under light irradiation (lambda >= 420 nm), the prepared catalyst exhibits high photocatalytic activity with a hydrogen production rate of 12,766 mu mol g(-1)h(-1), which is 18.3 times that of pure carbon nitride. This research provides a novel way of preparing highly active non-metallic photocatalysts. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, trace Ru-substituted metal-organic framework (MOF) Ru/Cu-BTC (0.44 wt%) was utilized in a photocatalytic water-splitting reaction for H-2 production, in which the uniformly dispersed metal nodes with high atom-utilization efficiency could act as a cost-effective cocatalyst. Interestingly, Ru/Cu-BTC not only improved the stability in water, but also exhibited about 50% enhanced photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity (15.815 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) compared with the original Cu-BTC (10.514 mmol g(-1) h(-1)). Meanwhile, the photoluminescence (PL) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) demonstrated that the main function of Ru3+ substitution for some uniformly dispersed Cu nodes in Cu-BTC is to improve the transfer efficiency of photogenerated carriers, so as to enhance the photocatalytic activity. Therefore, the decoration of uniformly dispersed metal nodes with heteroatom dopants in original MOFs could be an available strategy to adjust the partial structure of the metal cluster in MOFs, resulting in the more stable and cost-effective cocatalysts for photocatalytic H-2 evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000714672700001

The relation between PCET when it is a concerted electron proton transfer (ETPT) process and hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) reactions is discussed. Signatures expected for HAT reactions in terms of the size of the kinetic isotope effect and overall magnitude of the rate constant are discussed in the context of PSII/OEC. The formal similarity of ETPT to proton transfer and translocation is used to introduce a combined quantum mechanical (for the transferring protons) and molecular dynamics for the heavy-atom degrees of freedom approach. The method is used to examine double proton transfer in cytochrome c oxidase where two waters and a glutamate (Glu286) that is implicated in the proton translocation mechanism form a cyclic hydrogen bonded structure. Protonation of the glutamate is found to occur in a agreement with experimental results. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It was found that the BaTiO3 can be re-oxidized at an oxygen partial pressure of similar to 50 mTorr and substrate temperature of 350 degrees C without forming a NiOx interface layer between the film and base metal foil. The dielectric permittivity of re-oxidized films was >1000 with loss tangent values <2% at 100 Hz, 30 mV(rms) excitation signal. Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy indicated that BaTiO3 thin films can be re-oxidized to an oxygen stoichiometry close to similar to 3 (e.g., stoichiometric). High resolution cross sectional transmission electron microscopy showed no evidence of NiOx formation between the BaTiO3 and the Ni foil upon excimer laser re-oxidation. Spectroscopic ellipsometry studies on laser re-oxidized [001](C) and [111](C) BaTiO3 single crystals indicate that the re-oxidation of BaTiO3 single crystals is augmented by photo-excitation of the ozone, as well as laser pulse induced temperature and local stress gradients.

Given a recent finding on a highly active Ru(OH) xCly cocatalyst for IO3- reduction on the TaON photocatalyst, here we systematically investigate Rh, Co, and Ir-based cocatalysts for enhancing water oxidation thereby improving the total efficiency of O-2 evolution on TaON with the help of the Ru(OH) xCly cocatalyst. The calcination temperature of metal cation (i.e., Rh, Co or Ir) species on TaON, which is coloaded by Ru(OH)(x)Cl-y species at a fixed temperature of 200 degrees C, significantly affected the rate of O-2 evolution from aqueous solution containing IO3- under visible light irradiation. The rate of O-2 evolution basically increased with increasing temperature at the cocatalyst loading up to 400 degrees C (for Ir) and 500 degrees C (for Rh and Co), while calcination at 600 degrees C drastically lowered the activity due to the detrimental effect on the TaON itself. The highest O-2 evolution rate was obtained by the loading of Rh species at 500 degrees C, followed by co-loading of Ru(OH) xCly at 200 degrees C, on TaON. The results of both photocatalytic reactions and electrochemical measurements revealed that the Rh species loaded at 500 degrees C, which mainly consist of Rh oxides, promote water oxidation more effectively than conventional CoOx or IrOx species. The rates of H-2 and O-2 evolution in overall water splitting via the Z-scheme mechanism were significantly increased by the use of the TaON photocatalyst co-loaded with Rh and Ru species as the O-2-evolving photocatalyst, in place of the TaON loaded with only conventional RuO2 species or previously reported TaON co-loaded with Ru(OH) xCly and Co-based species. These results indicate the effectiveness of coloading of cocatalysts that are independently optimized for water oxidation and IO3- reduction for improving the efficiency of Z-scheme water splitting.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2398-4902			WOS:000469258600012

Addition of dissolved V2O5 was found to result ill reactivation or the nickel cathode and formation of a vanadium-bearing deposit. Tafel measurements at different electrode states indicated no change in the Tafel parameters for the fresh or initial) and vanadium-modified . Furthermore, vanadium addition did not appear to enhance the electrocatalytic activity beyond that for fresh nickel. A rotating ring-disk electrode Was used for detection Of Solution intermediates of the hydrogen evolution reaction in KOH with and without dissolved V,V2O5,. Based oil cyclic voltammograms for the ring (with a hydrogen-evolving Ni disk), no Solution intermediates were detected before or after vanadium addition. The action of vanadium was through a solid Surface species as opposed to a homogeneous species in solution. A mercury electrode was then used to shift hydrogen evolution cathodically , revealing the potential region masked by large hydrogen currents oil a nickel electrode. Cyclic voltammetry on mercury in KOH with dissolved V2O5, showed a cathodic peak that was absent in voltammograms for blank KOH. Therefore, formation of the deposit occurred at a potential coincident with that of hydrogen evolution Oil nickel. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Herein, a simple and efficient synthesis strategy has been successfully developed to in-situ synthesize unique catalysts via embed a graphene oxide (GO) shell membrane in the core of NiS2 employing an ionic liquid-like NiCl2-malonic acid (IL Ni-MA). The elaborately designed IL Ni-MA liquid favors the in-situ growth of breathing GO shell membrane on the surface of NiS2 along with the formation of gas channel. The moderate breathing GO shell membrane and tightly coupled interface gain the optimum electrocatalysis hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution performance in 1.0 M KOH. It just demands 57 and 294 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) toward HER and OER, respectively. Moreover, the optimum NiS2@GO catalysts can be applied for superior bifunctional catalyst for overall splitting of H2O. A cell voltage of 1.52 V and a stable operation for more than 48 h can be gained. The synthetic route may find application in the surface/interfaces engineering of other embedded catalysts toward new energy and environment applications.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000514902000087

The original KCa2Nb3O10 showed negligibly low activity for photocatalytic water oxidation to O-2 in the presence of IO3- as an electron acceptor, since the anionic IO3- cannot penetrate into the interlayer spaces owing to the strong electrostatic repulsion between IO3- and the negatively charged niobate layers. The rate of O-2 evolution was significantly increased after the exfoliation-restack process of KCa2Nb3O10, certainly due to much facilitated access of IO3- to the opened reduction sites of nanosheet surfaces. The loading of RuOx or PtOx cocatalysts on the samples significantly increased the rate of O-2 evolution. The electrochemical analysis indicated that these cocatalysts effectively decreased the overpotential of IO3- reduction, which occurs through the 6-electron process. On the other hand, the original layered structure was effective for the photocatalytic O-2 evolution in the presence of Fe3+ electron acceptor even without any cocatalysts, suggesting that the interlayer spaces of the layered niobate can work as effective reduction sites for cationic Fe3+. Finally, simultaneous evolution of H-2 and O-2 was attempted by using these KCa2Nb3O10-based materials as O-2-evolving photocatalysts, combined with an appropriate H-2-evolving photocatalyst. By employing the appropriate combination of KCa2Nb3O10-based materials and the redox couple, which was suggested by the result of half O-2-evolution reactions, simultaneous evolution of H-2 and O-2 stably proceeded with higher rates.									42	2	0	0	0	0	42			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000353641800012

Due to the very strong correlation between nuclear burning and mixing processes it is very important to reduce the uncertainty on the cross sections of the nuclear reactions that are involved. In this paper we focus our attention on the reaction O-18(p, gamma)F-19. While the O-18(p, alpha)N-15 channel is thought to be dominant, the (p, gamma) channel can still be an important component in stellar burning in giants, depending on the low energy cross section. So far only extrapolations from higher-energy measurements exist and recent estimates vary by orders of magnitude. These large uncertainties call for an experimental reinvestigation of this reaction. We present a direct measurement of the O-18(p, gamma)F-19 cross section using a high-efficiency 4 pi BGO summing detector at the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA). The reaction cross section has been directly determined for the first time from 140 keV down to 85 keV and the different cross section components have been obtained individually. The previously highly uncertain strength of the 90 keV resonance was found to be 0.53 +/- 0.07 neV, three orders of magnitude lower than an indirect estimate based on nuclear properties of the resonant state and a factor of 20 lower than a recently established upper limit, excluding the possibility that the 90 keV resonance can contribute significantly to the stellar reaction rate.

However, under SOFC operating conditions this material suffers from performance degradation. This loss of electrochemical activity has been extensively studied in the past and an accumulation of strontium at the LSC surface has been shown to be responsible for most of the degradation effects. The present study sheds further light onto LSC surface changes also occurring under SOFC operating conditions. In-situ near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were conducted at temperatures between 400 and 790 degrees C. Simultaneously, electrochemical impedance measurements were performed to characterise the catalytic activity of the LSC electrode surface for O-2 reduction. This combination allowed a correlation of the loss in electro-catalytic activity with the appearance of an additional La-containing Sr-oxide species at the LSC surface. This additional Sr-oxide species preferentially covers electrochemically active Co sites at the surface, and thus very effectively decreases the oxygen exchange performance of LSC. Formation of precipitates, in contrast, was found to play a less important role for the electrochemical degradation of LSC.									40	0	0	0	0	0	40			1022-5528	1572-9028		WOS:000451652600010	30930590

Metal nanomaterials and graphene materials have many excellent properties and have been perfectly combined into metal/graphene nanocomposite materials. These offer the high catalytic activity of metal nanomaterials and the high specific surface area and favorable electrical conductivity of graphene. The unique advantages can produce synergistic effects and can significantly improve the overall performance of the composite materials. This gives the metal/graphene nanocomposite materials excellent application prospects for hydrogen evolution. Here, we report the preparation of yttrium-doped palladium/iron on graphene (Pd/YFeO3/C-G) using a simple and efficient method. The catalytic performance of the Pd/YFeO3/C-G nanocomposites for water electrolysis and hydrogen production was evaluated. The results show that the overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction at -10 mA cm(-2) is only 15 mV, which is competitive with Pt/C catalysts. The Pd/YFeO3/C-G is highly active for hydrogen evolution with an onset potential of -8 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution and a Tafel slope of 37 mV dec(-1) with a Pd loading of only 20 g(Pd) cm(-2). These results clearly demonstrated that Pd/YFeO3/C-G is an excellent catalyst for hydrogen evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2046-2069			WOS:000453551800044	35557934

The oxygen content delta in the Cu(1) layer of these oxidized samples is significantly lower than 1, which results from the Al coordination disturbing the ordering in the chain-oxygen sublattice. Neutron-diffraction data show that upon reduction at 1044 K the oxygen content delta within the Cu(1) layer remains at 0.25 due to pinning of excess oxygen by the aluminum at x = 0.19. Crystals annealed in reducing atmospheres at temperatures above 973 K develop orthorhombic long-range order after reoxidation at 673 K, probably due to short-range clustering of the AlOn defects. The obtained orthorhombicity of the reoxidized material decreases with decreasing temperature of the reduction treatment, No change in the structural state is obtained when the reducing treatment is performed below 950 K; the reoxidized samples remain macroscopically tetragonal.

Two-dimensional (2D) high-entropy metal phosphorus trichalcogenides (MPCh(3)) have the advantages of both near-continuous adsorption energies of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) and large specific surface area of 2D materials, which are excellent catalytic platforms. As a typical 2D high-entropy catalyst, Co-0.6(VMnNiZn)(0.4)APS(3) nanosheets with high-concentration active sites are success fully demonstrated to show enhanced HER performance: an overpotential of 65.9 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 653 mV dec(-1). Decent spectroscopy characterizations are combined with density function theory analyses to show the scenario for the enhancement mechanism by a high-entropy strategy. The optimized S sites on the edge and P sites on the basal plane provide more active sites for hydrogen adsorption, and the introduced Mn sites boost water dissociation during the Volmer step. Two-dimensional high-entropy MPCh(3) provides an avenue for the combination of HEAs and 2D materials to enhance the HER performance, which also provides an alternative materials platform to explore and design superior catalysts for various electrochemical systems.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000780214300013	35212217

In this context, intensive research efforts are being dedicated to develop materials that can effectively reduce CO2 levels in the atmosphere and convert CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels, thus contributing to sustainable energy and meeting the increase in energy demand. The development of clean energy by conversion technologies is of high priority to circumvent these challenges. Among the various methods that include photoelectrochemical, high-temperature conversion, electrocatalytic, biocatalytic, and organocatalytic reactions, photocatalytic CO2 reduction has received great attention because of its potential to efficiently reduce the level of CO2 in the atmosphere by converting it into fuels and value-added chemicals. Among the reported CO2 conversion catalysts, perovskite oxides catalyze redox reactions and exhibit high catalytic activity, stability, long charge diffusion lengths, compositional flexibility, and tunable band gap and band edge. This review focuses on recent advances and future prospects in the design and performance of perovskites for CO2 conversion, particularly emphasizing on the structure of the catalysts, defect engineering and interface tuning at the nanoscale, and conversion technologies and rational approaches for enhancing CO2 transformation to value-added chemicals and chemical feedstocks.									15	2	0	0	1	0	15				2073-4344		WOS:000516825000095

In this paper, a hydrogenation treatment method was used to fabricate defect-rich heterophase junctions. Experimental characterization indicated that the generation of oxygen vacancies not only influenced the electronic structure of TiO2 nanofibers, but also facilitated the phase transformation from anatase/rutile to anatase/brookite junctions. For improved interfacial charge separation, a novel urea-assisted strategy was further developed to achieve the subsequent rearrangement of oxygen vacancy defects. As a result, ESR and XPS measurements evidenced the diminishment of bulk defects and the preservation of surface oxygen vacancies. Anatase/brookite heterophase junctions with surface oxygen vacancies exhibited an unprecedented hydrogen production rate of 1.6 mmol h(-1), which was more than 12 times higher than that of pristine TiO2 nanofibers. Our work revealed the significant impact of oxygen vacancies on the phase and electronic structures of heterophase junctions. It also provided an effective strategy to develop highly active TiO2-based photocatalysts through integrating defect modulation and junction design.									61	4	0	0	6	0	63			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000417063200051

Herein, we demonstrated the nitrogen plasma treatment for simultaneously achieving oxygen vacancies and N-doping on TiO2 nanotube arrays. More importantly, the oxygen vacancies and N-doping could effectively promote the selective construction of MnO2 cocatalyst anchored with Mn-O/N bonds on TiO2 nanotube arrays, which could efficiently narrow charge depletion layer and promote the holes transfer from TiO2 to MnO2. As expected, this photoanode achieves a remarkably increased PEC performance (1.95 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE), up to 3.4 times higher than that of pristine TiO2 (0.57 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE), and excellent stability for water splitting. These demonstrations may provide a new insight for designing highly efficient TiO2-based photoanodes for solar energy conversion.									32	4	0	0	2	0	34			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000518865300041

A dynamical theoretical formulation for vibronically nonadiabatic PCET reactions has been developed. This theory enables the calculation of rates and kinetic isotope effects, as well as the pH and temperature dependences, of PCET reactions. Methods for calculating the vibronic couplings for PCET systems have also been developed and implemented. These theoretical approaches have been applied to a wide range of PCET reactions, including tyrosyl radical generation in a tyrosine-bound rhenium polypyridyl complex, phenoxyl/phenol and benzyl/toluene self-exchange reactions, and hydrogen abstraction catalyzed by the enzyme lipoxygenase. These applications have elucidated some of the key underlying physical principles of PCET reactions. The tools and concepts derived from these theoretical studies provide the foundation for future theoretical studies of PCET in more complex bioenergetic systems such as Photosystem II.

Herein, nickel-copper (NiCu) alloy nanoparticles are encapsulated into graphitic shells via an ambient-pressure chemical vapor deposition process. The resulting carbon-encapsulated NiCu (denoted as NiCu@C) composite possesses a well-defined core-shell structure with tunable thicknesses of the shells and is examined as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic, neutral, and alkaline solutions. Electrochemical measurements indicate that the activity of the NiCu@C highly depends on the thickness of the shell. Single-layered graphene encapsulated NiCu nanoparticles show remarkable HER activity and durability. To obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), overpotentials of 48, 164, and 74 mV are needed in electrolyte solutions with pH = 0, 7, and 14, respectively. Such low overpotentials render the composite as one of the most active nonprecious electrocatalysts. Accelerated durability tests demonstrate that the NiCu@C catalysts exhibit excellent stability. Density function theory calculations are conducted to investigate the electronic structures of the NiCu@C. It is found that the representative Ni43Cu12@C-240 model shows an ideal adsorption energy of hydrogen (-0.03 eV), manifesting its high HER activity.									166	10	0	0	5	0	167			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000419864800013

Variation in the synthesis conditions tuned the composition of monoclinic and orthorhombic phases of Ni3Bi2S2. The electrochemical hydrogen evolution activity of the catalyst with highest percentage of monoclinic phase demonstrated a negligible onset potential of only 24 mV close to that of state-of-the-art Pt/C with an overpotential as low as 88 mV. Density functional theory calculations predicted the monoclinic phase exhibit the lowest adsorption free energy corresponding to hydrogen adsorption (Delta GadsH*) and, therefore, the highest hydrogen evolution activity amongst the considered phases. The quasi-2D structure of monoclinic phase facilitated an increased charge-transfer between Ni and Bi, favoring the downward shift of the d-band center to enhance the catalytic activity.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000664467400001	34038021

The experiments were run at T = 740-990 degrees C, P = 0.7 GPa, oxygen fugacity (fO(2)) ranging from that of the Ni-NiO buffer (NNO) to 2.3 log units higher (NNO + 2.3 and dissolved water in variable concentrations (under-saturated to saturated conditions). Fixed metal activities were imposed by using Au97Cu3 and Au92Cu8 alloy capsules, which allowed simultaneously determination of Cu solubility. Our data demonstrate that Cu solubilities in both the silicate melt and amphibole decrease with decreasing temperature. The solubility of Cu decreases by a factor of 6 from 990 to 740 degrees C in equilibrium with andesitic to rhyolitic melt compositions. The average amphibole/silicate melt partition coefficient of Cu [D-cu, (amph/melt)] is 0.066 +/- 0.006, and is essentially constant without showing any correlation with silicate melt composition, dissolved water concentration, temperature or fO(2).The low D-cu' (amph/melt) value suggests that amphibole crystallizing at any stage of calc-alkaline magma evolution is unable to scavenge a significant fraction of the initially available Cu from the melt. However, D-cu (amph/ melt) is high enough to yield precisely measurable Cu concentrations in natural amphiboles. As D-cu (amph/melt) results constant along the liquid line of descent of calc-alkaline magmas, amphibole compositions may thus be used as a proxy to monitor the evolution of the Cu concentration in the silicate melt (not the bulk magma if sulfide is present). This may be useful for understanding the metallogenic evolution of intrusive rocks, in which silicate melt inclusions in minerals are generally absent. As most porphyry-type Cu ore deposits are associated with upper crustal intrusions, in-situ microanalysis of inclusion-free amphiboles in such rocks may help understand ore genesis and might also be used in mineral exploration to assess the fertility of prospective magmatic systems.

Rubisco activities and oxygen evolution at saturating CO2 showed that photosynthetic capacity in the mutant was at least as high as in wild-type (WT) leaves. Despite this, steady-state photosynthesis in the mutant was reduced by 20% to 30% at atmospheric CO2 levels. The inhibition of photosynthesis was alleviated by high CO2 or low O-2. The mutant showed a prolonged induction of photosynthesis, which was exacerbated in conditions favoring photorespiration and which was accompanied by increased extractable NADP-malate dehydrogenase activity. Feeding experiments with leaf discs demonstrated that CMSII had a lower capacity than the WT for glycine (Gly) oxidation in the dark. Analysis of the postillumination burst in CO2 evolution showed that this was not because of insufficient Gly decarboxylase capacity. Despite the lower rate of Gly metabolism in CMSII leaves in the dark, the Gly to Ser ratio in the light displayed a similar dependence on photosynthesis to the WT. It is concluded that: (a) Mitochondrial complex I is required for optimal photosynthetic performance, despite the operation of alternative dehydrogenases in CMSII; and (b) complex I is necessary to avoid redox disruption of photosynthesis in conditions where leaf mitochondria must oxidize both respiratory and photorespiratory substrates simultaneously.									217	8	0	0	205	3	222			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000180589500029	12529534

In this work, iron cobaltite (FeCo2O4) nanoparticles were prepared by the coprecipitation method, and we present the effect of heat treatment (250, 350, 450, 650 and 900 degrees C) on the catalytic properties. Catalytic activity tests of FeCo2O4 nanocatalysts were performed in the presence of ammonium cerium(IV) nitrate (CAN), and the formation of oxygen was followed using a Clark-type oxygen electrode. The samples were characterized by infrared (IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and their surface areas were determined by the Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) method. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) data confirm a metal-oxygen bond at the octahedral and tetrahedral sites. XRDs data were characteristic of spinel-like cubic materials. The XPS results confirmed the presence of trivalent and divalent cobalt and iron ions in the samples and showed that the non-heated sample has a greater amount of cobalt on the nanoparticles' surface than those heated to 900 degrees C. The surface area decreased from 92.00 m(2) g-1 for the material that was unannealed to 2.00 m(2) g(-1) for the sample annealed at 900 degrees C. The unannealed nanomaterials showed an oxygen production of 790 mmol s(-1) g(-1). This was 790 times greater than the oxygen production from nanomaterials heated to 900 degrees C. Although the surface structure of nanomaterials is unclear, the amount of surface cobalt appears to have implications for catalytic activity. Optimization of superficial cobalt content may be key to improving catalytic activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0103-5053	1678-4790		WOS:000760463200001

In oxyfuel combustion, H2O gasification has an important effect on the overall reaction process. This paper used Chinese Shenhua coal as raw material to decouple the effect of H2O on the whole process of raw coal-H2O gasification reaction. At 800 degrees C in 15 vol.% H2O, the changes of gas-liquidsolid phase product concentration and the development of char structure in the coal-H2O gasification were investigated. The MFBRA was used to analyze the rapid coal-H2O gasification reaction, while the slow-heating-rate gasification of coal was analyzed by TG-FTIR-MS. The results show that in the rapid single-particle reaction at 800 degrees C, H2O promotes the whole devolatilization of coal, with a certain inhibitory effect on the secondary gasphase reaction, especially for the H-2 release. H2O increases the oxygen-containing functional groups on the char surface and increases the structural defects in char. H2O would increase the -COO- groups, and promotes the consumption of C=C on the surface. H2O has an obvious etching effect on the char surface. For slow-heating-rate gasification of coal, the reaction has obvious secondary weightlessness, and H2O promotes initial devolatilization, but has an inhibitory effect on the secondary one. At > 700 degrees C, the H2O gasification is more pronounced than that of a single-particle rapid reaction. H2O reduces the activation energy of the initial stage and increases the reaction activation energy of the secondary one during devolatilization. H2O can promote the consumption of aromatic liquid-phase products such as toluene and phenol during devolatilization of pulverized coal under the slow-heating condition.									17	0	0	0	3	0	17			0165-2370	1873-250X		WOS:000513949400019

Transition metal carbides (TMCs)/carbon composites are considered as prospective electrocatalysts due to their high catalytic activities and structural stability. In this work, we report the simple synthesis of TMCs/N-doping carbon aerogels (TMCs/NCAs, including Fe3C/NCA, Mo3C2/NCA, and Fe3C-Mo2C/NCA) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) using protonated chitosan/metal complex anion-chelated aerogels. Among them, the Fe3C/NCA composite possesses efficient ORR activity (similar to Pt/C), and the Fe3C/NCA-assembled Zn-air battery exhibits high power densities of about 250 mW cm(-2). The density functional theory calculation reveals that the presence of graphite-N, pyridine-N, and carbon defects in the carbon framework effectively reduces the free energy of ORR occurring in Fe3C. This work provides a simple and extensible strategy for the preparation of TMCs from chitosan, which is expected to be extended to other metal carbides.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000821347900001	35507679

A sequence of P-doped CoS(2)electrocatalysts were obatined by using different NaH(2)PO(4)contents. The as-synthesized samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, HR-TEM, element mapping, and XPS analyses. It is found that these P-doped CoS(2)materials composed of high purity nanoparticles and stacked in a block structure. The electrochemical performance has been investigated in 0.5-M H(2)SO(4)electrolyte. The results indicate that the doping of phosphorus can significantly increase the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of CoS(2.)Among the different samples, the P-doped CoS(2)attained with 5 mmol of NaH(2)PO(4)contents offers the highest HER performance with a minimum overpotential of 109 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), the smallest Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1), and an excellent long-term durability over 1,000 cycles. The analysis results illustrate that the doped phosphorus may change the internal properties of CoS2, which promotes the ability of charge transfer and electrochemical active sites, resulting in the significantly increased HER activity compared with bare CoS2. Therefore, this work demonstrates that a proper doping of phosphorus is a suitable approach to improve the catalytic ability of metal sulfides for HER application.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000569294500001

The FeOOH QDs exhibited an average diameter of 3.5 nm with well crystallinity. Furthermore, the as-prepared FeOOH QDs were deposited on ZnO nanorods film as a co-catalyst for water oxidation. The crystal phase, microstructures, and optical properties of the synthesized films were established through X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis). Applied as a photoanode for solar water splitting, the FeOOH QDs/ZnO nanorods film exhibited a photocurrent density of 0.44 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs RHE, which is 2.1 times higher than that of pure ZnO film. After the loading of FeOOH QDs, the ZnO photoanode showed higher surface charge injection efficiency (by a factor of similar to 2) and better long-term stability. The analysis of electrochemical measurements displayed that, as a co-catalyst of the oxygen evolution reaction, FeOOH QDs resulted in a noticeable cathodic shift of photocurrent onset potential for water oxidation and a remarkable improvement of surface charge injection efficiency. In addition, the metal-solating method can be applied to preparing the other metal oxides QDs, such as WO3 and ZnO QDs.									27	4	0	0	2	0	29			2168-0485			WOS:000434491600066

Nevertheless, most of the currently reported HER catalysts only exhibited good activity in a narrow pH range (e. g. in acid electrolyte). Thence, developing high-performance electrocatalysts for HER at all pH values is significant and imperative. Herein, we report an active electrocatalyst of RhxRu100-x@UiO-66-NH2 (x denotes the initial atomic percentage of Rh in RhRu alloys) by in-situ confining RhRu binary alloys within metal-organic framework (MOF) of UiO-66-NH2. Among the RhxRu100-x@UiO-66-NH2 samples, Rh50Ru50@UiO-66-NH2 exhibited the most outstanding HER performance at all pH values, as well as comparable activity and outperformed stability to the commercial Ru/C and Pt/C catalysts. In HER tests, Rh50Ru50 @UiO-66-NH2 displayed an overpotential of 77 mV, 114 mV and 177 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 (pH = 0.53), 1 M PBS (pH = 7) and 1 M KOH (pH = 14) solutions, respectively. The strategy for confining metal nanoparticles within the cavities of MOFs can enrich the toolbox for design and construction of low cost, efficient, and environment-friendly catalysts for hydrogen production toward clean energy applications.

An efficient electrocatalysts structure having logical design which holds a paramount significance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) but rarely noble metal Pt-like activity achieved by the transition metal oxides electrocatalysts based on oxides matured and cooperative with coupling metal oxides could be considered as a desired substitute electrocatalysts to change Pt/C based nano composite materials. Herein, un-noble the metal oxides of hetero structure consisting of Co3O4/MoS2 basedelectrocatalysts nanocomposite material. The desirable out-comes show that Co3O4/MoS2 composite material providing extraordinary efficient HER kinetics activity in different experimental designs. The Co3O4/MoS2 based electro-catalyst increases the best activity of HER kinetics performance especially measured in 1 M KOH solution condition and offers an influential interfacing engineering strategy at very minute over potential of 348 mV evaluated and small Tafel slopes 46 mV/dec for HER performance. This work elucidates interest for efficient electrocatalysts for a broader range of scalable applications in the development of renewable energies, the functional materials such as solar cells, lithium sulphurbatteries and energy chemistry advancing.

Herein, we present the synthesis of coumarin through Pechmann reaction by using zirconia-based heterogeneous catalysts (ZrO2-TiO2, ZrO2-ZnO, and ZrO2/cellulose) in a solvent-free condition at room temperature. ZrO2-TiO2, ZrO2-ZnO, and ZrO2/cellulose were identified through spectroscopic techniques such as FESEM, X-ray, EDS, XPS, and FT-IR. ZrO2-TiO2 showed the best catalytic performance while ZrO2/cellulose was inactive. The kinetic parameters were observed in a solvent-free condition as well as in toluene and ethanol. The temperature effect was extensively studied which revealed that increasing the temperature will increase the rate of reaction. The rate of reaction in a solvent-free condition, ethanol, and toluene were 1.7 x 10(-3), 1.7 x 10(-2), and 5.6 x 10(-3) g mol(-1) min(-1), respectively.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			1556-276X			WOS:000381084000001	27460593

Herein, a facile hydrothermal strategy and subsequent phosphorization process are utilized to synthesize urchin-like CoNiP integrated by nanowires. The synthesized urchin-like CoNiP can be applied as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline, neutral, and acidic media. In particular, the optimal urchin-like CoNiP exhibits superior HER activity in alkaline electrolytes, with small overpotentials (157, 317, and 437 mV) at the current density 10, 100, and 200 mA cm(-2), respectively, and a small Tafel slope (49.6 mV dec(-1)) in 1 M KOH, which is comparable to that of Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, when urchin-like CoNiP is employed as both the cathode and anode in 1 M KOH, a low cell overpotential of 490 mV is required to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), suggesting the efficient electrocatalyst toward overall water splitting. The superior performance of urchin-like CoNiP can be associated with the sharp-tip enhancement effect since the hierarchical structure composed of nanowires with high curvature tips benefits the accumulation of electrons on the tip of the nanowires to serve as effectively active sites for reactions and the mass transfer, as well as the fast electron transfer due to the good electrical conductivity of the bimetallic phosphide. This work opens up a promising approach to rationally construct low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000666892400001

The use of type Ia supernovae as distance indicators for cosmology has initiated a search for theoretical arguments supporting the empirical calibration methods applied. As a first step, a sound understanding of the origin of the observed diversity in type Ia supernova properties is needed.Aims. Here we present a systematic study of effects resulting from changing some physical parameters of three-dimensional deflagration models of thermonuclear supernovae.Methods. The high computational costs of such models restricted this survey to simple setups which are known to result in weak explosions and therefore we point out trends rather then setting the absolute scale of the variance. In our study we vary the progenitor's carbon-to-oxygen ratio and its central density prior to ignition because both properties are not well determined by stellar evolution theory and they may change from supernova to supernova. Next we compute for these explosion models the nucleosynthesis yields in a post-processing step. This, in addition, allows us to study variations in the progenitor's metallicity by means of different Ne-22 mass fractions in the initial composition.Results. We find that the progenitor's carbon-to-oxygen ratio and its central density affect the energy release of the models and thus the expansion velocity of the supernova. Moreover, we find that changing the metallicity and the central density changes the production of radioactive Ni-56 and thus affects the luminosity. In contrast, the carbon-to-oxygen ratio has little effect on the Ni-56 production.Conclusions. Implications of the variations of the explosion energy and the produced Ni-56 mass for type Ia supernova diversity are discussed.									90	4	0	0	0	0	90			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000238187700025

Herein, we report a rapid, simple, and cost-effective fabrication of an Ni-Co-S cathode for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is directly usable for an anion exchange membrane water electrolyser (AEMWE). The Ni-Co-S electrocatalysts are prepared on a carbon paper (CP) substrate by a one-step electrodeposition method by controlling deposition parameters such as the deposition potential, time, and electrolyte composition. The optimized Ni-Co-S/CP electrode demonstrates a high HER activity with an overpotential of 91 mV at -10 mA/cm(2)in 1.0 M KOH. An AEMWE single cell employing the Ni-Co-S/CP cathode coupled with a commercial IrO2/CP anode exhibits a current density of 1.7 A/cm(2)at 2.4 V-cell, which is higher than that of an AEMWE single cell with a commercial Pt/C/CP cathode; this is attributable to the enhancement of the electron and reactant/product transfer via appropriate cathode design.									11	0	0	0	0	0	10			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000566757000001

In the present work, nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped hierarchically porous carbon with trapped Mn species (MnNSC-950) was fabricated, which integrates the modulation of the electronic structure for boosted intrinsic activity with the engineering of hierarchical porosity for enriched active sites. The MnNSC-950 shows a positive onset potential of 0.95 V and a large limiting current density of 5.4 mA cm(-2), which can rival that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst in 0.1 M KOH, together with a robust long-term stability. Moreover, the MnNSC-950 as ORR catalyst in Zn-air battery achieves a high power density of 107 mW cm(-2) and robust cycling performance over 150 h, exceeding that driven by Pt/C cathode. The excellent electrochemical performance is also shown in both neutral and acidic media.

J	Guo, Weifu; Zhou, Chen								Triple oxygen isotope fractionation in the DIC-H2O-CO2 system: A numerical framework and its implications								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				246				541	564		10.1016/j.gca.2018.11.018				FEB 1 2019	2019	Triple oxygen isotope composition of carbonate minerals reflects the isotope composition of the water from which carbonates precipitate, and is emerging as a promising proxy for constraining past changes in Earth hydroclimate and surface environment. However, quantitative interpretation of this proxy is not straightforward when carbonate minerals do not form under isotope equilibrium with water. For these carbonates, isotope composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the precipitating solution usually exerts the dominant control on their isotope composition. Here we examine the systematics of triple oxygen isotope fractionation in the DIC-H2O-CO2 system by deriving the fundamental equilibrium and kinetic triple oxygen isotope fractionation factors in this system and simulating the evolution of triple oxygen isotope composition of DIC during three common isotope fractionation processes, i.e., DIC-H2O isotope exchange, CO2 degassing and CO2 absorption. We show that under thermodynamic equilibrium dissolved HCO3- and CO32- both exhibit similar Delta'O-17 as calcite and aragonite (within 10 per meg at 25 degrees C), with temperature dependences around 0.61 per meg/degrees C. However, kinetic isotope fractionations associated with CO2 hydration and hydroxylation and their reverse reactions can produce a range of disequilibrium triple oxygen isotope effects in DIC during all three processes we simulated. The magnitudes of these disequilibrium effects vary with both time and the physicochemical conditions of the solution, e.g., temperature, pH and initial composition. Particularly, we predict correlated enrichments in Delta'O-17 and delta O-18 of DIC during CO2 degassing but depletions during CO2 absorption. The slopes of these correlations vary mainly as a function of solution pH but not temperature, DIC concentration or air pCO(2), yielding values of 8.8 and 12.0 per meg/parts per thousand at pH = 8 and 9, respectively, at 25 degrees C. Such disequilibrium isotope effects in DIC are expected to be inherited by carbonate minerals that form from these solutions (e.g., speleothem, coral skeleton, and high pH travertine) and, if not accounted for, could lead to inaccurate estimates of the triple oxygen isotope compositions of the parent water and carbonate formation temperatures. Our numerical model provides a quantitative framework for interpreting triple oxygen isotope composition of DIC and for correcting disequilibrium triple oxygen isotope effects in natural carbonates.

Cationic screening of surface charges determines the morphology of thylakoid membrane stacks. We show that it also influences directly the light-driven reactions in the interior of photosystem II (PSII). After laser-flash excitation of PSII membrane particles from spinach, time courses of the delayed recombination fluorescence (10 mu s-10 ms) and the variable chlorophyll-fluorescence yield (100 mu s-1 s) were recorded in the presence of chloride salts. At low salt-concentrations, a stimulating effect was observed for the S-state transition efficiency, the time constant of O-2-formation at the Mn4Ca-complex of PSII, and the halftime of re-oxidation of the primary quinone acceptor (Q(a)) by the secondary quinone acceptor (Q(b)). The cation valence determined the half-effect concentrations of the stimulating salt effect, which were around 6 mu M, 200 mu M and 10 mM for trivalent (LaCl3), bivalent (MgCl2, CaCl2), and monovalent cations (NaCl, KCl), respectively. A depressing high-salt effect also depended strongly on the cation valence (onset concentrations around 2 mM, 50 mM, and 500 mM). These salt effects are proposed to originate from electrostatic screening of negatively charged carboxylate sidechains, which are found in the form of carboxylate clusters at the solvent-exposed protein surface. We conclude that the influence of electrostatic screening by solvent cations manifests a functionally relevant long-distance interaction between protein surface and electron-transfer reactions in the protein interior. A relation to regulation and adaptation in response to environmental changes is conceivable. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The reactions of the catalytic cycle of the dimeric quinone reductase Lot6p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were studied in anaerobic stopped-flow experiments at 4 degrees C. Both NADH and NADPH reacted similarly, reducing the FMN prosthetic group rapidly at saturation but binding with very low affinity. The enzyme stereospecifically transferred the proS-hydride of NADPH with an isotope effect of 3.6, indicating that hydride transfer, and not an enzyme conformational change, is rate-determining in the reductive half-reaction. No intermediates such as charge-transfer complexes were detected. In the oxidative half-reaction, reduced enzyme reacted in a single phase with the six quinone substrates tested. The observed rate constants increased linearly with quinone concentration up to the limits allowed by solubility, indicating either a bimolecular reaction or very weak binding. The logarithm of the bimolecular rate constant increases linearly with the reduction potential of the quinone, consistent with the notion that quinone reductases strongly disfavor radical intermediates. Interestingly, both half-reactions of the catalytic cycle strongly resemble bioorganic model reactions; the reduction of Lot6p by NAD(P)H is moderately faster than nonenzymatic models, while the oxidation of Lot6p by quinones is actually slower than nonenzymatic reactions. This curious situation is consistent with the structure of Lot6p, which has a crease we propose to be the binding site for pyridine nucleotides and a space, but no obvious catalytic residues, near the flavin allowing the quinone to react. The decidedly suboptimized catalytic cycle suggests that selective pressures other than maximizing quinone consumption shaped the evolution of Lot6p. This may reflect the importance of suppressing other potentially deleterious side reactions, such as oxygen reduction, or it may indicate that the role Lot6p plays as a redox sensor in controlling the proteasome is more important than its role as a detoxifying enzyme.									26	0	0	0	18	0	26			0006-2960			WOS:000269485500016	19618916

The effects of pulse current density on the morphology and structure of lead dioxide electrodes were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. The SEM and XRD results show that the increase of pulse current density can make the morphology more fine, and the crystal size of lead dioxide decreases with the increase of pulse current density. The anodic polarization curves demonstrate that the oxygen evolution overpotentials of lead dioxide electrodes also enhance with the increase of pulse current density. The stability of lead dioxide electrodes enhances with the increase of pulse current density until 15 mA cm(-2), then the stability decreases. The electrocatalytic property of lead dioxide electrodes was examined for the electrochemical oxidation of rhodamine B (RhB). The results show that the RhB removal efficiency on the lead dioxide electrodes increases with the increase of pulse current density, which can be attributed to the increase of oxygen evolution overpotential.									2	1	0	0	0	0	3			1023-1935	1608-3342		WOS:000373232100008

In this work, we report HER properties of acid treated pyrolyzed vitamin B12 supported on reduced graphene oxide (B12/G800A) that shows an extraordinarily enhanced catalytic activity with low overpotential (115 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2)), which is better than that of most traditional nonprecious metal catalysts in acidic media. Stability tests through long-term potential cycles and at a constant current density confirm the exceptional durability of the catalyst. Notably, the B12/G800A catalyst exhibits extremely high turnover frequencies per cobalt site in acid, for example, 0.85 and 11.46 s(-1) at overpotentials of 100 and 200 mV, respectively, which are higher than those reported for other scalable non-precious metal HER catalysts. Moreover, it has been conjectured that the covalency of Co-C and Co-N bonds affects HER activities by comparing the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of the B12/G800A. High-temperature treatment can modify the Co-corrin structure of B12 to form Co-C bonds along with Co-N, which broadens the band of cobalt, essentially lowering the d-band center from its Fermi level. The lower d-band center leads to a moderate hydrogen binding energy, which is favorable for hydrogen adsorption and desorption.									30	1	0	0	0	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463814800058

Herein, efficient solar-driven H2O2 production through dioxygen reduction is achieved by employing polymeric carbon nitride framework with sodium cyanaminate moiety, affording a H2O2 production rate of 18.7 mu mol h (-1) mg(-1) and an apparent quantum yield of 27.6% at 380nm. The overall photocatalytic transformation process is systematically analyzed, and some previously unknown structural features and interactions are substantiated via experimental and theoretical methods. The structural features of cyanamino group and pyridinic nitrogen-coordinated soidum in the framework promote photon absorption, alter the energy landscape of the framework and improve charge separation efficiency, enhance surface adsorption of dioxygen, and create selective 2e(-) oxygen reduction reaction surface-active sites. Particularly, an electronic coupling interaction between O-2 and surface, which boosts the population and prolongs the lifetime of the active shallow-trapped electrons, is experimentally substantiated. Solar-driven H2O2 production presents a renewable approach to chemical synthesis. Here, authors perform a mechanistic analysis on the contribution of the sodium cyanaminate moiety to the 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction performance of polymeric carbon nitride frameworks.									50	1	0	0	10	0	50			2041-1723			WOS:000665032700023	34140505

Emerging approaches using highly concentrated salts (21-55 m (mol kg(-1))) create artificial solid-electrode interfaces and improve water stability; however, these approaches raise concerns about cost and toxicity. Molecular crowding is a common phenomenon in living cells where water activity is substantially suppressed by molecular crowding agents through altering the hydrogen-bonding structure. Here we demonstrate a 'molecular crowding' electrolyte using the water-miscible polymer poly(ethylene glycol) as the crowding agent to decrease water activity, thereby achieving a wide electrolyte operation window (3.2 V) with low salt concentration (2 m). Aqueous Li4Ti5O12/LiMn2O4 full cells with stable specific energies between 75 and 110 W h kg(-1) were demonstrated over 300 cycles. Online electrochemical mass spectroscopy revealed that common side reactions in aqueous Li-ion batteries (hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions) are virtually eliminated. This work provides a path for designing high-voltage aqueous electrolytes for low-cost and sustainable energy storage.Developing cheap and sustainable aqueous electrolytes with a wide voltage window is key to achieving safe and high-energy Li-ion batteries. An electrolyte using the polymer poly(ethylene glycol) as a crowding agent to decrease water activity achieves a wide operation window at low salt concentration.									211	9	0	0	11	0	214			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000527464300001	32313263

Herein, the different approaches of synthesis procedure of Pt- and Pt,N-TiO2 films were used to investigate their effect on the platinum oxidation states. The resulting different species of Pt led to the changes in the electronic structure of TiO2, with consequent bandgap narrowing, anodic shift of the flat band potential, and cathodic shift of the valence band The quantum yield efficiency was correlated with Pt-0 atomic content and the relative atomic content of Ptn+-O-Ti fragments, whereas its decrease for some samples can be caused by the presence of N and Ptn+. The highest response for N2O photocatalytic decomposition was observed over Pt,N-TiO2 films. The presence of metal and non-metal species in TiO2 structure resulted in synergistic effect including (1) inhibition of recombination of the electrons and holes and (2) narrowing of the bandgap. Electrocatalytic properties in hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions were improved by Pt doping. The formed Pt2+-O-Ti bonds rather than Pt nanoparticles are suggested to be responsible for the highest electrocatalytic activity. The additional UV exposure of the electrodes led to Pt NPs aggregation as a result of photodeposition of Pt ions. The mechanism of the Pt2+ photoreduction in TiO2 structure is proposed.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2190-5509	2190-5517		WOS:000616042300001		
J	Li, Zhen; Kong, Chao; Lu, Gongxuan								Visible Photocatalytic Water Splitting and Photocatalytic Two-Electron Oxygen Formation over Cu- and Fe-Doped g-C3N4								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				120	1			56	63		10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b09469				JAN 14 2016	2016	Water splitting via two two-electron processes (the H2O first photocatalytically converted to H-2 and H2O2 under visible light irradiation and then the H2O2 disproportionation to H2O and O2 by a thermal catalytic process) has attracted extensive attention recently.1,2 Contrary to these reports, we found that not only the photocatalytic H-2 generation could be driven by visible light but also the two-electron H2O2 disproportionation to form H2O and O-2 could also be photocatalyzed by visible light over g-C3N4 catalysts. Photocatalytic H-2, O-2 generation, and simultaneous H2O2 formation in Cu/C3N4 and Fe/C3N4 dispersions were confirmed, about 2.1 and 1.4 mu mol of H-2 and 0.8 and 0.5 mu mol of O2 evolved over Cu/C3N4 and Fe/C3N4 in 12 h, respectively. To prove the photocatalytic process of H2O2 disproportionation, the H2O2 was added as a reagent in g-C3N4, Cu/C3N4, and Fe/C3N4 dispersions. The results showed that the activity of H-2 evolution decreased with the increase of H2O2 concentration; the corresponding AQEs of oxygen formation were 16.1%, 42.6%, and 78.5% at 400 nm, respectively. The remarkable increase of anodic photocurrents over Fe/C3N4/ITO and Cu/C3N4/ITO electrodes indicated that the two-electron H2O2 disproportionation was catalyzed via surface photocatalytic mechanism. The ESR results implied reaction occurred by O-2- radical path over g-C3N4 under irradiation.									221	11	0	0	22	0	226			1932-7447			WOS:000368562200008

Part 1: Copper-Catalyzed Oxidation								JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY				64	20			4095	4104		10.1021/acs.jafc.6b00641				MAY 25 2016	2016	Sulfidic off-odors as a result of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and low-molecular-weight thiols are commonly encountered in wine production. These odors are usually removed by the process of Cu(II) fining, a process that remains poorly understood. The present study aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which Cu(II) interacts with H2S and thiol compounds (RSH) under wine-like conditions. Copper complex formation was monitored along with H2S, thiol, oxygen, and acetaldehyde concentrations after the addition of Cu(II) (50 or 100 mu M) to air-saturated model wine solutions containing H2S, cysteine, 6-sulfanylhexan-1-ol, or 3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (300 mu M each). The presence of H2S and thiols in excess to Cu(II) led to the rapid formation of similar to 1.4:1 H2S/Cu and similar to 2:1 thiol/Cu complexes, resulting in the oxidation of H2S and thiols and reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), which reacted with oxygen. H2S was observed to initially oxidize rather than form insoluble copper sulfide. The proposed reaction mechanisms provide insight into the extent to which H2S can be selectively removed in the presence of thiols in wine.									52	2	0	0	40	1	54			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000376825600019	27133282

Herein, a type-II heterojunction CdIn2S4/BiVO4 is designed to improve the photocurrent density from 1.22 (pristine BiVO4) to 2.68 mA cm-2 at 1.23 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), accelerating the bulk separation of photogenerated carriers by the built-in field from the matched energy band. With the introduction of CQDs, CQDs/CdIn2S4/BiVO4 increases the photocurrent density to 4.84 mA cm-2, enhancing the light absorption and cathodically shifting its onset potential, due to the synergetic effect of the heterojunction and CQDs. Compared with BiVO4, CQDs/CdIn2S4/BiVO4 promotes the bulk separation efficiency to 94.6% and the surface injection efficiency to 72.2%. Additionally, spin-coating of FeOOH on CQDs/CdIn2S4/BiVO4 could further improve the PEC performance and keep a long stability for water splitting. The density function theory (DFT) calculations illustrated that the type-II heterojunction CdIn2S4/BiVO4 could decrease the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential and accelerate bulk charge separation for the built-in field of the aligned band structure.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000866383100001	36179059

The secondary B-doping of broadly used M-doped hematite photoanodes not only suppresses the number of M+ ions, which inevitably cause electron-hole pair (EHP) recombination, but also generates an internal electric field for easy hole extraction. Taking advantage of these effects, the maximum length (500-600 nm) of hematite, which has the reported highest PEC performance, was increased to up to 900 nm in M:B-Fe2O, which in turn increased the active area of the photoanode. The M:B-Fe2O3 with a film thickness of 900 nm and a diameter of 122 nm converted the incident photons to EHPs with substantially reduced recombination and exhibited a photocurrent density of 1.92 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 VRHE. After loading inexpensive oxygen evolution reaction catalysts (FeOOH) on the surface of M:B-Fe2O3, the photocurrent density of FeOOH/M:B-Fe2O3 reached 2.35 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 VRHE. The cost-effective strategy of B-doping into M-doped hematite provides a straightforward way to address the M-doping-related negative effects, such as a high electron-hole recombination rate on the surface of hematite, and thus the critical length limitation of an ideal hematite photoanode, to potentially improve the performance of PEC devices.									57	2	0	0	4	0	57			2155-5435			WOS:000453491100096

Herein, we review various aspects of this technology including chemical reactions, physiochemical conditions and photocatalyst types such as metal oxides, sulfides, nitrides, nanocomposites, and doped materials followed by recent advances in computational modeling of photoactive materials. As the best-known catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution, TiO2 is discussed in a separate section, along with its challenges such as the wide band gap, large overpotential for hydrogen evolution, and rapid recombination of produced electron-hole pairs. Various approaches are addressed to overcome these shortcomings, such as doping with different elements, heterojunction catalysts, noble metal deposition, and surface modification. Development of a photocatalytic corrosion resistant, visible light absorbing, defect-tuned material with small particle size is the key to complete the sunlight to hydrogen cycle efficiently. Computational studies have opened new avenues to understand and predict the electronic density of states and band structure of advanced materials and could pave the way for the rational design of efficient photocatalysts for water splitting. Future directions are focused on developing innovative junction architectures, novel synthesis methods and optimizing the existing active materials to enhance charge transfer, visible light absorption, reducing the gas evolution overpotential and maintaining chemical and physical stability.									354	7	0	0	23	0	355				1420-3049		WOS:000381509700084	27409596

To evaluate their use for charge storage or anodic oxidation, in this paper, thin-film electrodes coated with ruthenium (RuOx) and copper oxide (CuOx) are fabricated by thermal decomposition of organic solutions containing the precursors by drop-casting on titanium (Ti) foils. The coating consisted of four layers of metal oxide. To investigate the effect of copper (Cu) on electrochemical performances, different approaches are adopted by varying the ratios of precursors' concentration and including a RuOx interlayer. A comparison with samples obtained by only RuOx has been also performed. The electrodes are characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic (CV) and linear sweep (LSV) voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and corrosion tests. The addition of Cu enhances the capacitive response of the materials and promotes electron transfer reversibility. The coatings obtained by the highest Ru:Cu ratio (95:5) exhibit a more uniform surface distribution and increased corrosion resistance. The interlayer is beneficial to further reduce the corrosion susceptibility and to promote the oxygen evolution but detrimental in the charge storage power. The results suggest the possibility to enhance the electrochemical performance of expensive RuOx through a combination with a low amount of cheaper and more abundant CuOx.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2075-4701		WOS:000764552800001

The formation of a discrete S-3 state is evident from the shift of the first maximum of oxygen evolution from the 3rd flash through the 5th flash to the 7th flash during a 90 min incubation of dark-adapted thylakoids with 10 mM hydrazine sulfate at pH 6.8 on ice. A distinct period four oscillation with further maxima on the 11th and 15th flashes is still observed at this stage of the incubation. The data analysis within the framework of an extended Kok model reveals that a S-3 state population of almost 50% can be achieved by this treatment. A prolonged incubation of the S-3 sample with 10 mM hydrazine (and even 100 mM) does not lead to a further shift of the first maximum toward the 9th flash that could reflect the formation of the S-5 state. Instead, a slow oxidation of S-3 to S-2 takes place by an as yet unidentified electron acceptor. A consistent simulation of all the measured oxygen oscillation patterns of this study could, however, only be achieved by including the formal redox states S-4 and S-5 in the fits (S-4 + S-5 up to 35%). The implications of these findings for the oxidation states of the manganese in the tetranuclear cluster of the water oxidase are discussed.									74	1	0	0	54	0	74			0006-2960			WOS:A1997XD80500002	9188681

The role of the physical environment in this biological revolution, such as changes to oxygen levels and nutrient availability, has been the focus of longstanding debate. Seemingly contradictory data from geochemical redox proxies help to fuel this controversy. As an essential nutrient, nitrogen can help to resolve this impasse by establishing linkages between nutrient supply, ocean redox, and biological changes. Here we present a comprehensive Nisotope dataset from the Yangtze Basin that reveals remarkable coupling between delta N-15, delta C-13, and evolutionary events from circa 551 to 515 Ma. The results indicate that increased fixed nitrogen supply may have facilitated episodic animal radiations by reinforcing ocean oxygenation, and restricting anoxia to near, or even at the sediment- water interface. Conversely, sporadic ocean anoxic events interrupted ocean oxygenation, and may have led to extinctions of the Ediacaran biota and small shelly animals.									57	7	0	0	14	0	62			2041-1723			WOS:000437101700005	29968714

The obtained results were compared with previous studies on the oxo exchange of uranyl hydroxide, as well as with experiments. It is found that the stable T-shaped [NpO3(OH)(3)](3-) intermediate is a key species for oxo exchange in the proton transfer in mononuclear Path I and binuclear Path IV, similar to the case of uranyl(VI) hydroxide. Path I is thought to be the preferred oxo exchange mechanism for neptunyl(VI) hydroxide in our calculations, due to the lower activation energy (22.7 and 13.1 kcal mol(-1) for Delta H-double dagger and Delta H-double dagger, respectively) of the overall reaction. Path II via a cis-neptunyl structure assisted by a water molecule might be a competitive channel against Path I with a mononuclear mechanism, owing to a rapid dynamical process occurring in Path II. In Path IV with the binuclear mechanism, oxo exchange is accomplished via the interaction between [NpO2(OH)(4)](2-) and T-shaped [NpO3(OH)(3)](3-) with a low activation energy for the rate-determining step, however, the overall energy required to fulfill the reaction is slightly higher than that in mononuclear Path I, suggesting a possible binuclear process in the higher energy region. The chemical bonding evolution along the reaction pathways was discussed by using topological methodologies of the electron localization function (ELF).									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000351436400046	25706188

The primary path producing the bulk of the carbon in our Universe proceeds via the triple-alpha process He-4(2 alpha,gamma)C-12. This process takes place in helium-burning of red giant stars. We show that outside a narrow window of about 0.5 % of the strength or range of the strong force, the stellar production of carbon or oxygen through the triple-alpha process is reduced by factors of 30 to 1000. Outside this small window the creation of carbon or oxygen and therefore also carbon-based life in the universe is strongly disfavored. The anthropically allowed strengths of the strong force also give severe constraints for the sum of the light quark masses as well as the Higgs vacuum expectation value and mass parameter at the 1% level.

The physicochemical characterizations including FESEM, XRD, XPS and ICP show the Ni-Rh/Ni foam electrode owns highly porous structure and uniform unalloyed Ni-Rh dispersions, and loads minute amount of Rh (0.467 mg cm(-2)). By modulating the Rh electrodeposition time to 50 min, the Ni-Rh/Ni foam electrode exhibits the highest catalytic current density for urea electrooxidation and the most delayed oxygen evolution reaction. From the quadrant position of the Nyquist plots, the Rh component in Ni-Rh/Ni foam is found to exert no apparent effect on the anti-poisoning of intermediate (adsorbed CO2). Instead, Rh facilitates the formation of Ni(OH)(2), which contributes to the boost in the catalytic activity of Ni-Rh/Ni foam over Ni/Ni foam. This work suggests the Ni-Rh/Ni foam electrode is a promising anode catalyst for the urea electrooxidation-assisted hydrogen production and the simultaneous urea-containing sewage disposal.

Photosynthesis-irradiance (PI) curves indicated adaptations to low irradiances in all species analysed, essentially characterized by occurrence of photoinhibition, low values of the saturation parameter (I-k < 225 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and compensation irradiance (I-c < 20 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and relatively high values of the effective quantum yield of photosystem II (Delta F/F'(m) >= 45). These characteristics have been reported in freshwater red algae and were confirmed from data based on the two techniques, indicating they are typically shade-adapted plants. On the other hand, some species (e.g. Batrachospermum delicatulum) can tolerate high irradiances (up to 2400 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), suggesting they have mechanisms that enable them to avoid photodarnage of the photosynthetic apparatus. One of these mechanisms is the increase in dissipation of excessive energy captured by reaction centres after exposure to continuous irradiance, as reflected by the non-photochemical quenching fluorescence parameter in dark/light induction curves. Photo-inhibition occurred in all algae tested by both techniques. Light acclimation was evident particularly in field populations, as revealed by lower values of the saturation parameter (Ik) and the compensation irradiance (I-c) and higher values of Delta F/F'(m) in algae under low irradiances (shaded or heavily shaded stream segments), and vice-versa. Forms living within the boundary layer (e.g. crusts), in a region of reduced current velocity, tended to be more shade-adapted than semi-erect plants (e.g. non-mucilaginous or mucilaginous filaments), as indicated by highest values of photosynthetic efficiency (alpha = 0.31) and effective quantum yield (Delta F/F'(m) = 0.88) under natural conditions. Higher photo- synthetic rates (P-max) for the same species or population were observed under culture than field conditions when measured with the oxygen evolution technique, whereas the opposite trend was observed using chlorophyll fluorescence.

However, precise manipulation of their molecular geometries and electronic structures to control the properties of macroscopic materials still remains a fundamental challenge. Herein, a photoresponsive covalent organic framework (o-COF) with the square lattice was fabricated from the dynamic covalent chemistry reaction of ring-open dithienylethene-dialdehyde with 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin (H(2)TAPP). UV irradiation of the dithienylethene-based units in o-COF afforded its reversible photoisomer (c-COF) in the ring-closed form. In addition to a range of diffraction, microscopic, and gas physical sorption characterizations, spectroscopic investigations with the help of theoretical simulations revealed different photocatalytic activities toward the evolution of singlet oxygen and corresponding photocatalytic oxidation of amines due to the different energy transfer pathways from the porphyrin unit to BBTP photoisomers in these two COFs. Most interestingly, such different photocatalytic behaviors for two COFs could be easily tuned in a reversible manner by adjusting the ring-closed/open form of dithienylethene units by means of UV and visible light.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000812174200001

An excellent combination of a low tafel slope of 31 mV/dec with a negligible overpotential was measured for our Pt/PtO2 NPs, due to PtO2 resulting in electron rich Pt island, showing activity higher than that of common Pt. Additionally, the paper proves that it is possible to improve platinum/platinum oxide activity through control of NPs size and reduce platinum loading through its junction and interaction with a further metal oxide. Very high hydrogen production rate of 3.35 mL cm(-2) h(-1) at -0.024 V, obtained by means of an on-line mass spectrometry analysis, to corroborate the results with a realistic hydrogen production estimation, was measured for Pt/PtO2 electrode. Moreover, Pt/PtO2 was stable in corrosive acidic solution during electrolysis under high current density. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We fabricate thin films of "pyrolytic carbon" (pyC) by decomposition of benzene at 1000 degrees C and examine the physical and electrochemical properties of the native pyC film, as well as variants after heteroatom doping, plasma oxidation, and metal nanoparticle modification. The pyC films are optically reflective at the macroscale, relatively planar (1-3 nm RMS roughness by atomic force microscopy) and disordered (via Raman scattering). Thiophenyl-doped pyC films (0.6-1.7 atom % sulfur) suitably mimic the disorder, chemical state (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), and work function (Kelvin probe) of a workhorse carbon black, Vulcan XC-72. Using ferri/ferrocyanide as a redox probe, we find that oxygen functionalities enhance the heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constant up to 3x, while high levels of sulfur dopants decrease the rate 2x. We also explore thiophenyl-directed adsorption of Au nanoparticles and show that hydrogen evolution at 0.1 mA cm(-2) occurs similar to 95 mV more positive at <1 % Au@pyC similar to S than at pyC similar to S.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000507435300001

The properly staggered band arrangement with a built-in electric field in C4N@TiO2NR induces an S-type charge migration path to ensure superior redox ability of photogenerated carriers with efficient spatial separation. This coupled with the structural merits of 3D hierarchical arrays enables remarkable photocurrent response and facilitates oxygen evolution kinetics upon irradiation. Paring this heterojunction photoelectrode with an alkaline Zn electrode and an acidic air electrode produces a light and CNE dual-assisted cell with two switchable modes of light-assisted acid-base/air battery (LABAB) and acid-base battery (LAB). By capturing light during charge and CNE during discharge, LABAB breaks the limit of the equilibrium potential (1.65 V) of conventional Zn-air batteries (ZABs) to deliver impressive charge/discharge voltages of 0.43/2.02 and 0.87/1.86 V at 0.1 and 10 mA cm(-2), superior to all reported ZABs. respectively. When LABAB is switched to LAB, it can harvest light and CNE simultaneously to afford markedly increased output voltage relative to common acid-base batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000830348700001

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the surface morphology and crystal structure of the electrodes. In contrast with PbO2, Bi-PbO2, and CNT-PbO2 electrodes, the CNT-Bi-PbO2 electrode had smaller crystal particles and more compact structure. The linear voltammetry was utilized to determine the oxygen evolution overpotential of electrodes. The electro-catalytic activity of electrodes was investigated by cyclic voltammetry. The yield of center dot OH and electro-catalytic oxidation degradation of p-nitrophenol (p-NP) at four kinds of electrodes were tested. Besides, the stability of electrodes was also determined by accelerated service life tests. The results show that the prepared CNT-Bi-PbO2 electrode had higher oxygen evolution overpotential and more excellent electrochemical oxidation performance than other three kinds of electrodes. The reaction rate constant of p-NP on the CNT-Bi-PbO2 electrode was 1.69 times and the mineralization current efficiency at 180 min on CNT-Bi-PbO2 electrode was 1.36 times that on PbO2 electrode. Moreover, the service lifetime of CNT-Bi-PbO2 electrode was 4.16 times as much as that of PbO2 electrode. (C) 2014 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Ryan, Will H.					Ryan, Will/0000-0002-4294-5454			Temperature-Dependent Growth and Fission Rate Plasticity Drive Seasonal and Geographic Changes in Body Size in a Clonal Sea Anemone								AMERICAN NATURALIST				191	2			210	219		10.1086/695496				FEB 2018	2018	The temperature-size rule is a commonly observed pattern where adult body size is negatively correlated with developmental temperature. In part, this may occur as a consequence of allometric scaling, where changes in the ratio of surface area to mass limit oxygen diffusion as body size increases. As oxygen demand increases with temperature, a smaller body should be favored as temperature increases. For clonal animals, small changes in growth and/or fission rate can rapidly alter the average body size of clonal descendants. Here I test the hypothesis that the clonal sea anemone Diadumene lineata is able to track an optimal body size through seasonal temperature changes using fission rate plasticity. Individuals from three regions (Florida, Georgia, and Massachusetts) across the species' latitudinal range were grown in a year-long reciprocal common garden experiment mimicking seasonal temperature changes at three sites. Average body size was found to be smaller and fission rates higher in warmer conditions, consistent with the temperature-size rule pattern. However, seasonal size and fission patterns reflect a complex interaction between region-specific thermal reaction norms and the local temperature regime. These details provide insight into both the range of conditions required for oxygen limitation to contribute to a negative correlation between body size and temperature and the role that fission rate plasticity can play in tracking a rapidly changing optimal phenotype.									10	1	0	0	10	0	10			0003-0147	1537-5323		WOS:000422944300007	29351015

PANI can not only be used as a "binder", grow MOF on its surface and cover the carbon paper, but also improve the conductivity and stability of the material by forming nitrogen-doped carbon after pyrolysis. And its unique 3D nano-array structure not only greatly increases the surface area, but also provides more attachment sites for CoFe2O4, thereby accelerating electron transport and improving OER performance. High specific surface area, high utilization of the catalyst, enhanced electron transport characteristics and retention characteristics of the original carbon paper characteristics ensure excellent OER activity. The final sample exhibits outstanding activity for OER in alkaline solution, accompanied by a low onset potential about 1.52 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), and the small Tafel slope of 70 mV dec(-1). In particular, after 21600s, the current drop is negligible, which is means that the NC-CoFe2O4/C@CP catalyst has the high stability. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation reveals the main surface adsorbent of CoFe2O4 is OH*, and the surface Co atoms are the main active sites.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0025-5408	1873-4227		WOS:000641141700034

Water first adsorbs on the surface in a dissociative state and then in a molecular state, as water coverage increases. The geometric properties of all adsorption structures suggest that the dissociative water molecules can induce stress release of the (001) surface at low coverage, reducing reactivity of the surface and thus leading to molecular adsorption of water on the surface at high coverage. The adsorption energy (or the surface energy) monotonously increases (or decreases) with the increase of the coverage, which further confirms that water, irrespective of its dissociative or molecular state, can improve the stability of the (001) surface and reduce its activity. We deeply investigated the mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the water-covered (001) surface. A new water-assisted OER pathway is identified on the (001) surface, which includes the sequential transfer of protons from molecular water and surface hydroxyls, and O-O coupling processes. During the OER pathway, the O-O coupling step exhibits the largest thermodynamic energy and highest energy barrier, clarifying that it is the rate-determining step in the whole pathway. Our findings provide new insights into the strong dependence of water adsorption modes on coverage for the anatase TiO2(001) surface and may explain the high oxidation activity of the TiO2(001) surface in aqueous environments typical of TiO2 photocatalysis.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000509371400043	31854404

Compositions rich in Ni are reported to show superior activity, but the establishment of competitive OER activity with lower cost, Fe-rich analogues is more desirable for metal-air batteries and other devices that will see large-scale production. Herein, we demonstrate that by controlling pore-solid architecture and the degree of crystallinity, we achieve a single-phase, Fe-rich NiFe(2)Ox catalyst that matches the OER performance metrics previously demonstrated for compositions with higher Ni-to-Fe ratios. We also show that OER activity linearly tracks increases in the catalyst surface area, whereas the degree of exsitu surface hydroxylation does not play a significant role. To prepare the pore-solid structured forms, NiFe(2)Ox gels were synthesized by using an epoxide-initiated sol-gel method and subsequently processed to aerogels or xerogels. The activities of these two sol-gel-derived nanostructures were compared with a nanoparticulate analogue with lower specific surface area, prepared by using conventional precipitation methods. The higher surface area and larger pore volume expressed by the NiFe(2)Ox formed as an aerogel result in a performance-competitive OER overpotential of 356mV at a current density of 10mAcm(-2), with an approximately 140mV improvement relative to the low-surface-area, precipitated analogue.									14	0	0	0	0	0	16			2196-0216			WOS:000383623400012

The Ni-Al and Ni-Fe materials with different Ni/Fe ratio were obtained by coprecipitation method at variable pH. The LDH structure was verified by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, and Raman specroscopy. No secondary extra phases were observed for any material. The electronic properties were evaluated by UV-vis spectroscopy, while the magnetic ones were followed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The results suggested that sample H/Ni-Fe2 (Ni/Fe = 2) has a ferrimagnetic behavior as a result of the combined action of Ni-II-OH-Ni-II, Fe-III-OH-Ni-II, and Fe-III-OH-Fe-III pairs across the layers and ferromagnetic interactions operating between layers. Furthermore, the material H/Ni-Fe1 (Ni/Fe = 1.5) showed a combination of paramagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions which favors a superexchange interaction among metal centers through the OH bridges across the cationic sheets; the superexchange interaction enhances the electrocatalytic activity on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. On the other hand, XPS experiments showed that the H/Ni-Fe1 did not exhibit structural changes after electrochemical processes. The activity toward the OER was in the order H/Ni-Fe1 > H/Ni-Fe2 > H/Ni-Al, as was confirmed using in situ linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) coupled with mass spectrometry (differential electrochemical mass spectrometry).									152	8	0	0	15	0	154			1932-7447			WOS:000342652000005

TREE GENETICS & GENOMES				13	2					42	10.1007/s11295-017-1127-y				APR 2017	2017	Populus euphratica Oliv. is a poplar species that is distributed mainly in deserts, making it an interesting model in which to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying different stress responses. Here, we used molecular population genetic methods to detect potential selection in candidate genes belonging to the P. euphratica glutathione (GSH) peroxidase (Gpx) family, which are associated with an enzymatic mechanism that combats oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells; earlier studies have shown that Gpx proteins play important roles in coping with increased ROS levels during biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. We analyzed the nucleotide diversity and divergence patterns of five loci encoding Gpx genes, and 16 reference loci used as controls, in order to detect departures from the neutral expectation. Gpx1 has an excess of mid-frequency alleles; high intraspecific nucleotide diversity, distributed in the upper tail of the simulated neutral model; and extensive LD, showing strong evidence of balancing selection/local adaptation. The Gpx3.2 gene exhibits very low nucleotide diversity and divergence, suggesting that it has evolved under strong purifying selection. We failed to detect any evidence for natural selection at the other loci (Gpx2, Gpx4, and Gpx5) compared with the reference loci. The results show that nucleotide diversity and/or divergence differ greatly between members of the Gpx gene family, resulting from differential selective pressure acting on genes, and that adaptive evolution influenced the distribution of P. euphratica in desert regions.									3	1	0	0	3	0	4			1614-2942	1614-2950		WOS:000400497600012

The exfoliation efficiency in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was enhanced by the synergetic effect of easier intercalation of polar solvent and higher repulsive force of the treated bulk MoS2. The exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets were assembled alternately with H3Mo12O40P (PMo12) into a multilayer heterostructure by the layer-by-layer (LBL) method, in which PMo12 with high electron mobility bridges the adjacent catalytically active MoS2 layers. Based on the heterostructure, the electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution was substantially enhanced over multilayer MoS2 nanosheets alone. Moreover, it was found that the electrocatalytic performance was influenced by the layer number, indicating that an optimum balance between the mass transfer (MoS2 layer) and electron conductivity (PMo12 layer) was needed for the construction of efficient electrocatalysts. In addition, the electrocatalytic performance of the multilayers (MoS2) and (PMo12/MoS2)(n) could be improved by oxygen plasma treatment, which might be ascribed to the increased number of edges and defects in MoS2 nanosheets. This work not only provides a facile method to exfoliate MoS2 with higher efficiency, but also offers a feasible strategy to build up high-performance electrocatalysts by rationally assembling nanosheets and polyoxometalate species at the nanoscale level.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			2168-0485			WOS:000429285800088

The oxide layer surface morphology, microstructure, and composition were investigated prior to and after accelerated life test through energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and scanning electron microscopy. EDS analyses following total deactivation of the electrode showed a relatively large content of Ru in the coating. X-ray diffraction results showed the formation of a solid solution between RuO2 and Ta2O5 Cyclic voltammograms of this system were registered in acidic solutions (H2SO4 0.5 mol dm(-3)) and they presented a well-defined peak attributed to the Ru(III)/Ru(IV) solid-state redox transition. The electrocatalytic activity shows a strong dependence on the RuO2 content in the film. The stability of the electrodes toward oxygen evolution reaction was evaluated at 0.5 mol dm(-3) H2SO4, using a current density of 750 mA cm(-2) and a temperature of 80degreesC. A direct dependence between the electrode lifetime (LT) and RuO2 present in the coating was observed. Upon changing TiO2 for TA(2)O(5) (Ru = 50 atom %) a considerable improvement (average of 54%) in the LT values of these oxides was obtained. This result is a good indication that the Ru/Ta system might be a promising coating to operate under severe conditions.

Compositional manipulation via heteroatom-doping and nanoarchitectural design of Earth-abundant electrocatalysts are extensively established as valid strategies to effectively optimize the electrocatalytic performance due to the electronic modulation and geometric effect. Herein, we demonstrate a self-sacrificial template strategy for the synthesis of Ni-doped Co3S4 (denoted as Ni-Co3S4 hereafter) hollow and porous nanospheres through a straightforward hydrothermal sulfuration treatment. The optimization of Ni incorporation into Co3S4 could dramatically regulate the electronic state, promote electrical conductivity, and enrich the catalytically active sites, thereby facilitating the OER performance. Furthermore, the hollow spherical nanostructures with permeable walls also allow the increase of the surface-area-to-volume ratio and the electrode-electrolyte contact area. Accordingly, the optimized Ni-Co3S4 hollow and porous nanospheres with an appropriate Ni content exhibit superior OER properties in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, as reflected by an overpotential of 298 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 90.5 mV dec(-1), and a long-term durability of 11 h, making them potential economical electrocatalysts for a myriad of OER-involved energy devices. It is believable that this proposed cation-doping strategy and self-templated synthesis strategy for hollow nanospheres would bring new inspirations for the future rational design of high-efficiency electrocatalysts from both aspects of electronic modulation and nanostructure engineering.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2052-1553			WOS:000815217700001

The results show that using alpha-PbO2 as the intermediate layer will benefit the crystallization of beta-PbO2 and ss-PbO2 is more suitable as the surface layer than alpha-PbO2. CeO2 dopants change the crystallite size and crystal structure, enhance the catalytic activity, and even change the deposition mechanism of PbO2. The doping of CeO2 in the PbO2 electrodes can enhance the electro-catalytic activity, which is helpful for oxygen evolution, and therefore reduce the cell voltage.									1	0	0		0	0	1			1003-6326			INSPEC:14123466

It was shown from the TG analysis that the char residues Of pure PF resin were 62.9 and 60.5% after being pyrolyzed at 700 and 1000 degrees C. respectively. The degradation and failure of the resin matrix were mainly resulted from the release of volatiles. The phenol and its methyl derivates took a large proportion in the amount of volatiles. In comparison with the pure PF resin, the char residues of B4C modified PF resin were obviously higher, with the values of 71.9 and 68.4% at 700 and 1000 degrees C, respectively. Due to the oxidation-reduction reactions between B4C additive and oxygen-containing volatiles including CO and H2O, partial carbon and oxygen elements in the volatiles remained in the resin matrix in the forms of amorphous carbon and B2O3, respectively. The results of SEM and FT-IR characterization demonstrated the occurrence of the modification, and the amorphous carbon existed in the form of reticular substance. In addition, the amount of the released phenol and its methyl derivates was also decreased drastically due to the formation of borate. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Exciting progress has been made in the search for anode materials with high capacity, low toxicity, and high conductivity; yet, most of the anode materials, because of their low equilibrium voltages, facilitate hydrogen evolution. Here, we show the application of olivine FePO4 and amorphous FePO4 center dot 2H(2)O as anode materials for aqueous lithium-ion batteries. Their capacities reached 163 and 82 mA h/g at a current rate of 0.2 C, respectively. The full cell with an amorphous FePO4 center dot 2H(2)O anode maintained 92% capacity after SOO cycles at a current rate of 0.2 C. The acidic aqueous electrolyte in the full cells prevented cathodic oxygen evolution, while the higher equilibrium voltage of FePO4 avoided hydrogen evolution as well, making them highly stable. A combination of in situ X-ray diffraction analyses and computational studies revealed that olivine FePO4 still has the biphase reaction in the aqueous electrolyte and that the intercalation pathways in FePO4 center dot 2H(2)O form a 2-D mesh. The low cost, high safety, and outstanding electrochemical performance make the full cells with olivine or amorphous hydrated FePO4 anodes commercially viable configurations for aqueous lithium-ion batteries.									22	2	0	0	1	0	24			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000426618000031	29400442

One crucial challenge remains the elucidation of the factors that determine the selectivity of water oxidation by the desired 4e(-)/4H(+) pathway that leads to O-2 rather than by 2e(-)/2H(+) to H2O2. We now show that water oxidation with the cobalt-corrole CoBr8 as electrocatalyst affords H2O2 as the main product in homogeneous solutions, while heterogeneous water oxidation by the same catalyst leads exclusively to oxygen. Experimental and computation-based investigations of the species formed during the process uncover the formation of a Co(III)-superoxide intermediate and its preceding high-valent Co-oxyl complex. The competition between the base-catalyzed hydrolysis of Co(III)-hydroperoxide [Co(III)-OOH](-) to release H2O2 and the electrochemical oxidation of the same to release O-2 via [Co(III)-O-2 center dot](-) T is identified as the key step determining the selectivity of water oxidation.									22	2	0	0	2	0	22			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000600204900018	33259190

Despite extensive study over more than a century, however, many outstanding questions remain surrounding both the structure and the activity of NiOx. Further compounding this ambiguity is the recent finding that much of the previous experimental work on NiOx may have been influenced by incidental doping. Here, we report a computational study of the two simplest members of the NiOx family: beta-Ni(OH)(2) and beta-NiOOH. Using DFT+U calculations, we first identify a beta-NiOOH structure with a staggered arrangement of intercalated protons that is more consistent with experimental crystal structures of beta-NiOOH than previously proposed geometries. Next, by conducting a thorough study of various initial spin configurations of this beta-NiOOH structure, we found that a low-spin d(7) Ni3+ configuration is always favored, which suggests a Jahn-Teller distortion, rather than disproportionation, explains the different Ni-O bond distances found in experiment. G(0)W(0) calculations performed on beta-Ni(OH)(2) and beta-NiOOH reveal electronic structures consistent with previous experimental results. Lastly, calculations of various low-index surface energies of both beta-Ni(OH)(2) and beta-NiOOH demonstrate that the (001) surface is the most thermodynamically stable surface, in keeping with numerous experimental results but in contrast to recent computational models.									108	1	0	0	7	0	108			1932-7447			WOS:000363994500012

We introduce a general approach to identify order parameters for order-disorder reactions and to calculate first-principles free-energy surfaces as a function of these order parameters. The symmetry of the disordered phase is used to formulate order parameters as linear combinations of sublattice compositions of a reference supercell. The order parameters can distinguish the disordered phase from the symmetrically equivalent variants of a particular ordered phase. A thermodynamic formalism is then developed to rigorously define a coarse-grained free energy as a function of order parameters. Bias potentials are added to the potential energy to enable sampling of the unstable regions within the order parameter domain. Monte Carlo sampling in the biased ensemble is combined with free-energy integration to calculate high-temperature free energies. We illustrate the approach by analyzing the free energies of order-disorder transitions on a two-dimensional triangular lattice and in the technologically important Ni-Al alloy.									23	1	0	0	0	0	24			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000413442800001

(1996) PEES Lett. 375, 223-226) suggests that the coordination sphere of Mn in PSII is also suitable for iron. A comparison is performed between the primary amino acid sequences of D1 and D2 and diiron-oxo enzymes with the function of oxygen activation. All conservative motifs (EXXH) and residues binding and stabilizing the diiron cluster in diiron-oxo enzymes have been found in the C-terminal domains of DI and D2 polypeptides. On the basis of these sequence similarities we suggest a structural model for the manganese cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex.									13	0	2	0	11	0	16			0014-5793			WOS:A1997WD58700001	9009209

In situ thermo-Raman spectra in the range from 200 to 1400 cm(-1) were recorded at every degree interval from 25 to 800 degrees C. Thermo-Raman spectroscopic studies reveal that, although the onset of formation is around 600 degrees C, the bulk NiAl2O4 forms at temperatures above 800 degrees C. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the reaction mixtures were recorded at regular temperature intervals of 100 degrees C, in the temperature range from 400 to 1000 degrees C, which could provide information on structural and morphological evolution of NiO-Al2O3. Slow controlled heating of the sample enabled better control over morphology and particle size distribution (similar to 20-30 nm diameter). The observed results were supported by complementary characterizations using TGA, XRD, SEM, transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, what glycer-AGE structure could evoke tubular cell damage remains unknown. We first examined if deleterious effects of glycer-AGEs on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in proximal tubular cells were blocked by DNA-aptamer that could bind to glyceraldehyde-derived pyridinium (GLAP) (GLAP-aptamer), and then investigated whether and how GLAP caused proximal tubular cell injury. GLAP-aptamer and AGE-aptamer raised against glycer-AGEs were prepared using a systemic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment. The binding affinity of GLAP-aptamer to glycer-AGEs was measured with a bio-layer interferometry. ROS generation was evaluated using fluorescent probes. Gene expression was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). GLAP-aptamer bound to glycer-AGEs with a dissociation constant of 7.7 x 10(-5) M. GLAP-aptamer, glycer-AGE-aptamer, or antibodies directed against receptor for glycer-AGEs (RAGE) completely prevented glycer-AGE- or GLAP-induced increase in ROS generation, MCP-1, PAI-1, or RAGE gene expression in tubular cells. Our present results suggest that GLAP is one of the structurally distinct glycer-AGEs, which may mediate oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions in glycer-AGE-exposed tubular cells. Blockade of the interaction of GLAP-RAGE by GLAP-aptamer may be a therapeutic target for proximal tubulopathy in diabetic nephropathy.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4				1422-0067		WOS:000535574200346	32283652

Here we report a simple adsorption method for rapid synthesis (similar to 90 s) of structure optimized Pd alloy supported on nitrogen-doped carbon without the use of surfactants or extra reducing, agents. The material shows much,lower overpotential than 30 wt % Pd/C and 40 wt % Pt/C catalysts while exhibiting excellent durability (80 h). Moreover, unveiled by the density functional theory (DFT) calculation results, the underlying reason for the outstanding performance is that the PdMnCo alloy/pyridinic nitrogen-doped carbon interfaces weaken the hydrogen-adsorption energy on the catalyst and thus optimize the Gibbs free energy of the intermediate state (Delta G(H*), leading to a remarkable electrocatalytic activity. This work also opens up an avenue for quick synthesis of a highly efficient structure-optimized Pd-based catalyst.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000415140800029	29039914

Herein, an ultrafast room-temperature method is demonstrated for converting bimetallic CoNi metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) into high-performance OER catalysts consisting of Fe incorporating CoNi hydroxides and MOFs (denoted as Fe-CoNi MOFs). This straightforward approach not only introduces OER-favoring Fe into the catalyst to ameliorate the electronic conductivity for rapid charge transfer, but also engineers the CoNi MOFs into hierarchical micro-nano-architectures with a high density of active sites and rich boundary defects. Consequently, the Fe-CoNi MOFs catalyst exhibits excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a high turnover frequency of 2.75 s(-1) at an overpotential of 340 mV, along with superior durability over 100 h of operation in 1 M KOH. Further analysis reveals that the in situ formed metal oxyhydroxides on the catalyst surface are the real OER active species, and the incorporated Fe effectively regulates the local electronic configurations of the neighboring Co site for more favorable adsorption of the *OH intermediate to reduce the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. This ultrafast Fe incorporation method is also successfully applied to boost the OER performance of many other MOFs as well as to synthesize large-size electrodes. With good universality and scalability, this work opens up a cost-effective route to transform MOF-based materials into advanced nanoarchitectures for energy conversion applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000840542200001

The organic hydride of the toluene/methylcyclohexane system is one of the best energy carriers. In order to improve the energy conversion efficiency of the hydrogenation of toluene using electric power, a membrane electrolyzer, which consists of a carbon-supported precious metal-coated porous carbon cathode, perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) membrane separator, and DSEA (R) anode for the oxygen evolution reaction, has been designed and evaluated. The activity of the PtRu/C catalyst layer for the electrohydrogenation of toluene was higher than that of Pt/C. Hydrophilization of the anode side of the PFSA effectively discharged oxygen gas from the anode compartment. The electrohydrogenation of toluene without hydrogen evolution has been successfully up to a 450 mA cm(-2) current density with 100 % toluene feed at ca. 2 V cell voltage. In order to evaluate the conversion ratio for the hydrogenation, the current efficiency as a function of the current density was evaluated at various concentrations of toluene. Significant hydrogen was generated above 100 mA cm(-2) of current density for 10 times the stoichiometry of a 5 % toluene feed. During the electrolysis, by-products were hardly detected except for hydrogen. Although the improvement of the mass transport in the catalyst layer occurred, more than 95 % of the toluene conversion with a high energy efficiency should be feasible based on these experiments.									34	0	0	0	1	0	34			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000371526600003		
J	Shutilova, N. I.								Oxygen-Evolving Complex of Chloroplast Membranes								BIOLOGICHESKIE MEMBRANY				27	2			147	155						MAR-APR 2010	2010	The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of plants is the main energy-transforming structure of chloroplast membranes, in which the light energy is used to photosynthetically oxidize the intracellular water and to form oxygen. The conducted investigations resulted in isolating the OEC of higher plants in the functionally active state and exploring its molecular composition, photochemical properties, and structural organization. It was ascertained that OEC represents a dimer of pigment-lipoprotein complexes of photosystem 2 (PLPC PS-2) associated in a chloroplast membrane according to the mirror symmetry into an integrate structure based on hydrophobic bonds. The model was developed for the dimer structure of the complex of PS-2 that had the function of oxygen formation. This model was confirmed by the X-ray analysis of crystals of the dimer complex of PS-2 in subsequent works of a number of authors. The concept of the formation of a "hydrophobic boiler" in the area of adhesion of the reaction centers of monomeric PLPC PS-2 that determines the formation of the water-oxidizing center of the OEC was put forward based on studies of changes in the OEC functional activity under the action of stress factors. The new scheme was advanced for the two-anode organization of the water-oxidizing center as a main condition for realizing the process of the molecular oxygen formation. The mechanism of the process of photosynthetic water oxidation and molecular oxygen formation was developed on the basis of the experimental data on the structural organization of the OEC and its water-oxidizing center. The quantum-chemical modeling of the process showed its correspondence to the mechanism suggested.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0233-4755			WOS:000278135900001

The utilization of specific nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios underlies elaborated cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction studies carried out on (Al,Cr)N-(Al,Cr)(2)O-3-(Al,Cr)N gradient coatings. Based on dynamical differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis up to 1500 degrees C, in combination with subsequent X-ray powder diffraction, we can conclude, that the thermal stability of (AlxCr1-x)(delta)(O1-yNy)(xi) oxynitrides increase with increasing O content, up to similar to 81 at.% of the non-metallic sublattice. Especially, the high O-containing coatings are prone for the formation of volatile Cr-oxides. However, the typically observed two-step dissociation process of Cr-N bonds towards Cr (via the formation of Cr2N and N-2-release), is delayed to a one-step process (up to 1500 degrees C) for N-contents below 10 at.% of the non-metallic sublattice.Consequently, by knowledge-driven fine-tuning of the nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio, the thermal stability of (AlxCr1-x)(delta)(O1-yNy)(xi) oxynitrides can be designed for their application-based specific needs.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0257-8972			WOS:000449131100008

In the investigated composition range, two photoactive regions, (Cu53Fe7V40)O-x and (Cu45Fe21V34)O-x, were identified, exhibiting 103 mu A/cm(2) and 108 mu A/cm(2) photocurrent density for the oxygen evolution reaction at 1.63 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively. The highest photoactive region (Cu45Fe21V34)O-x comprises the dominant alpha-Cu3Fe4V6O24 phase and minor FeVO4 phase. This photoactive region corresponds to having an indirect bandgap of 1.87 eV and a direct bandgap of 2.58 eV with an incident photon-to-current efficiency of 30% at a wavelength of 310 nm.

KRuO4 was used as the precursor for the RuO2 dopant. However, for IrO2 doping, IrO nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized from IrCl3 as an intermediate species to avoid damage to the NTs by chloride ions during doping. hat-generated from the IrO. NPs through selective dissolution in the electrolyte was simultaneously doped into the positively biased TiO2 NTs along with RuO2. The structural features, NT length, and amount of catalyst doping were controlled by the concentration of HF in the electrolyte and the anodizing time. The binary-catalyst-doped TiO2 NTs exhibited an outstanding onset potential of 0.84 V for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In addition, the amount of O-2 gas evolved during the OER at 2.0 V was measured to be 230 mu mol cm(-2) min(-1) by gas chromatography, which corresponds to a faradaic efficiency of 99%. The major oxidation states of the metals in the catalysts were found to be Ru4+ and Ir4+ by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy selected area electron diffraction analysis, indicating the presence of RuO2 and IrO2 in the TiO2 NTs.

However, the detailed explosion scenario and stellar evolutionary origin scenario - or scenarios - which lead to observed supernovae are still quite uncertain. One of the principal tests of proposed scenarios is comparison with the explosion products inferred, for example, from the spectrum of the supernovae. Making this comparison requires computation of the combustion dynamics and products through simulation of proposed scenarios. Here we discuss two specific proposed explosion scenarios, the deflagration-detonation transition and the helium shell double detonation, With these two examples in mind, we proceed to discuss challenges to computational modeling of the combustion taking place in these explosions. Both subsonically and supersonically propagating reaction fronts are discussed, called deflagrations and detonations respectively. Several major stages of the combustion occur on length and time scales that are many orders of magnitude smaller than those accessible in simulations of the explosion. Models which attempt to capture this sub-grid behavior and the verification of those models is briefly discussed.					13th International Conference on Numerical Modeling of Space Plasma Flows (ASTRONUM)13th International Conference on Numerical Modeling of Space Plasma Flows (ASTRONUM)	JUN 25-29, 2018JUN 25-29, 2018	Univ Alabama Huntsville, Ctr Space Plasma & Aeron Res; French Alternat Energies & Atom Energy Commiss, Maison Simulat; Natl Ctr Sci Res; Univ Paris Sud; Univ VersaillesUniv Alabama Huntsville, Ctr Space Plasma & Aeron Res; French Alternat Energies & Atom Energy Commiss, Maison Simulat; Natl Ctr Sci Res; Univ Paris Sud; Univ Versailles	Panama City Beach, FLPanama City Beach, FL	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-6588	1742-6596	*****************	WOS:000478669600004		
J	Butt, DAE								Formation of phenols from the low-temperature fast pyrolysis of Radiata pine (Pinus radiata) - Part I. Influence of molecular oxygen								JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS				76	1-2			38	47		10.1016/j.jaap.2005.07.003				JUN 2006	2006	The pyrolysis of lignocellulose is very complex, due primarily to the inherent complexity of the substrate, which changes continuously both chemically and structurally, throughout the decomposition process. Furthermore, the actual pyrolysis reactions and subsequent secondary decomposition processes are critically influenced by the interaction of mass and heat transport phenomena which are in turn influenced by dimensional, morphological and hydrological substrate parameters as well as the actual design and operational parameters of the pyrolysis reactor system. Consequently, pyrolysis products tend to be highly complex and are of limited commercial value without modification, or "upgrading". Relatively little research has focused on the influence of molecular oxygen on the thermal decomposition of lignocellulose under fast pyrolysis conditions. In this study, the influence of molecular oxygen on the formation of low molecular weight phenols from the low-temperature fast pyrolysis of Radiata pine (Pinus radiata) was evaluated. Experimentation was performed on a bench scale fluidised bed reactor operated at 290-295 degrees C with the oxygen concentration in the fluidising gas being 0, 10 or 20% (v/v). The fluidised bed mass was 135 or 200 g and was composed of river sand (310-500 mu m, quartz/orthoclase mixture) which had been pre-ignited at 600 degrees C. The Radiata pine substrate (150-250 mu m) was oven-dried or oven-dried and ethanol extracted. Product analysis was performed using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. The phenolic product was dominated by a relatively small number compounds such more than 75% was accounted for by seven compounds. The concentration of phenols in the liquid product was strongly dependent on the concentration of oxygen in the carrier gas and ranged from 0.09% (m/m), when no oxygen was present, to 11.98% (m/m) when the oxygen concentration was 20%. This equated to an absolute yield of 0.02-0.64%, respectively based on oven-dried mass of substrate. The removal of extractives did not influence the process with respect to phenols yield under all conditions evaluated. However, a significant reduction in overall oil yield occurred with extractives removal when pyrolysis was performed using the larger bed mass with the highest carrier gas oxygen concentration.

However, they are water-soluble and often used homogeneously rather than heterogeneously. Herein, a water-soluble octanudear Cu(II) duster was heterogenized by binding it with alpha-undecatungstosilicate [alpha-SiW11O39](8-) via the electrostatic effect. Octanudear duster [Cu-8(dpk center dot OH)(8)(OAc)(4)](4+) (dpk center dot OH = monoanion of the hydrated, gem-diol form of di-2-pyridyl ketone) was transformed into insoluble [Cu-8(dpk center dot OH)(8)(OAc)(4)](2)@[alpha-SiW11O39] (1) composite. This composite catalyzes water electro-oxidation efficiently with an onset potential of only 370 mV and attains a catalytic current density of 1 mA cm(-2) at a Low overpotential of 580 mV with a Tafel slope value of 62 mV per decade at near-neutral pH. Electrochemical measurements and spectroscopy characterization indicate that this composite remains stable and active after prolonged electrolysis experiments. This work reveals that the electrostatic interaction between transition metal complexes and polyoxoanions is a feasible and convenient method to synthesize efficient heterogenized homogeneous water oxidation catalysts (WOCs).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000726851400001

There is, however, a robustness of photosystem II, which depends partly on the highly dynamic compositional and structural heterogeneity of the cycle between functional and non-functional photosystem II complexes in response to light level. This coordinated regulation involves photon usage (energy utilization in photochemistry) and excess energy dissipation as heat, photoprotection by many molecular strategies, photoinactivation followed by photon damage and ultimately the D1 protein dynamics involved in the photosystem II repair cycle. Compelling, though indirect evidence suggests that the radical pair P(680)(+)Pheo(-) in functional PSII should be protected from oxygen. By analogy to the tentative oxygen channel of cytochrome c oxidase, oxygen may be liberated from the two water molecules bound to the catalytic site of the Mn cluster, via a specific pathway to the membrane surface. The function of the proposed oxygen pathway is to prevent O-2 from having direct access to P(680)(+)Pheo(-) and prevent the generation of singlet oxygen via the triplet-P-680 state in functional photosytem IIs. Only when the, as yet unidentified, potential trigger with a fateful first oxidative step destroys oxygen evolution, will the ensuing cascade of structural perturbations of photosystem II destroy the proposed oxygen, water and proton pathways. Then oxygen has direct access to P(680)(+)Pheo(-), singlet oxygen will be produced and may successively oxidize specific amino acids of the phosphorylated D1 protein of photosystem II dimers that are confined to appressed granal domains, thereby targeting D1 protein for eventual degradation and replacement in non-appressed thylakoid domains.

Here, a new framework {(Me2NH2)[Bi(L)]center dot 4DMF center dot 2H(2)O}(n) (V12) was constructed and structurally characterized (L = 5,50-(1,3,6,8-tetraoxo-1,3,6,8-tetrahydrobenzo[lmn][3,8] phenanthroline-2,7-diyl) dibenzene-1,3-dicarboxylic acid; DMF = N,N-dimethylformamide). V12 possesses large one-dimensional channels with the size of 1.5 x 0.7 nm and exhibits good stability in common solvents. After V12 was modified on electrode via electrodeposition, as-synthesized sample exhibits impressive catalytic performance for the transformation of CO2 into formate with Faraday efficiency of 93.2% and current density of 11.78 mA cm(-2) at -0.9 V (vs. RHE). Control experiments revealed that the MOFs electrodeposition strategy significantly improves the charge transfer rate and introduces more structural defects, which promotes the reaction activity. Moreover, tetrahydroisoquinoline is added as an accelerant in the anode to achieve the simultaneous generation of formate and dihydroisoquinoline. More importantly, the cell voltage is reduced from 2.79 to 2.52 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in a two-electrode system due to more positive reaction kinetics. This work provides an enlightening strategy for using MOFs to establish an effective system to achieve CO2 reduction while obtaining high value-added oxidation products.

Despite great progress that has been achieved, controllable synthesis of cationic-doped CoPS nanostructures or related superstructures arrays remains challenging, and their electrocatalytic applications toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are not explored. Herein, the self-supported Mn-doped CoPS nanowire-based gold-silk-chrysanthemum-like superstructures arrays on carbon cloth (CC) with variable Mn-content (Mn-CoPS-x%/CC) are fabricated by thermal conversion of MnCo-layered-double-hydroxides-x%/CC precursors under PxSy vapor/Ar atmosphere. Compared with pure CoPS/CC, all the Mn-CoPS-x%/CC show greatly enhanced electrocatalytic OER activity. Due to the suited Mn-doping content and unique microstructure-induced superhydrophilic and superaerophobic surface that can optimize electronic structure, offer more available active sites, and foster desorption of O-2 product, the Mn-CoPS-5%/CC manifests the best OER activity with a low overpotential (270 mV) to reach 20 mA cm(-2) current density and high turnover frequency (0.13 s(-1)), outperforming its counterparts, IrO2/CC and most of recently reported OER catalysts. Moreover, such Mn-CoPS-5%/CC exhibits good catalytic stability. This work offers an efficient avenue for optimizing MPS nanostructures toward OER by combining doping and structure engineering strategies, and may promote their applications in water-splitting or other clean energy options.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-7350			WOS:000793256100001

This process was slower compared to the decline of the PSII primary charge separation activity, and much slower than the photoinactivation of oxygen evolution. All three processes were slowed down in the presence of diuron. The results indicate that when the PSII repair was blocked, the inactivation of charge separation activity and the release of CP43 preceded the degradation of the D1 protein. In contrast, a much faster degradation of D1 connected to its rapid exchange was triggered by inactivation of oxygen evolution, and no disassembly of PSII was needed. We propose the existence of two different mechanisms of D1 degradation in the cells of the thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus.									40	1	0	0	36	0	41			0014-2956			WOS:A1995TB20700037	7588816

Here, facet effect of model spinel Co3O4 on water oxidation driven by visible-light is investigated in a well-established [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) -(SO82-)-O-2 (bpy = 2,2-bipyridine) biomimetic system to unveil the internal water oxidation mechanism for the first time. Spinel Co3O4 catalysts in the morphologies of nanocube, nanorod and nanosheet are synthesized successfully by bottom-up nanotechnologies, and they predominantly expose the well-defined crystal planes of {100}, {110} and {112}, respectively. Using time-resolved laser flash photolysis approach, the dynamically electronic transfer in photocatalytic courses of three Co3O4 catalysts are distinguished in the nanosecond scale. The three model catalysts show a facet-dependent activity rule that the water oxidation performance of {112} is similar with that of {110} and much better than that of {100}. The Co2+-Co2+ active sites with an ionic distance of 3.495 angstrom for catalyzing water oxidation only appear in {112} and {110} planes except for {100}, which is possibly responsible for the unique activity order of three Co3O4 catalysts. Furthermore, the Co2+ ions in the tetrahedral sites of spinel Co3O4 are confirmed to be more active than the Co3+ ions in the octahedral sites under visible-light driven water oxidation. The new insights shed a light on developing advanced nanocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction.									72	4	0	0	3	0	74			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000442973700010

In the synthesis procedures, the attachment of uric acid to graphene oxide surfaces and the oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes via hydrogen bonding and electrostatic forces in the solution leads to a lamellar nanostructure during thermal annealing by the proper insertion of carbon nanotubes in graphene layers with nitrogen doping. The resultant composite has good atomic percentage of N (11.2 at. %) and shows superior electrochemical energy storage and conversion properties compared with nitrogen-doped graphene only and physically mixed nitrogen-doped graphene and nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube samples. The composite exhibits high gravimetric and volumetric capacitance (324 F CI at a current density of 1 A CI) as electrode in solid-state supercapacitors, superior capacitive deionization (440 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1)) in M sodium chloride solution, and as high-performance anode in lithium-ion batteries (1150 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1)) with longterm cycling stability.

This reaction involves photo-generated holes that oxidize water via charge transfer at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. However, a certain fraction of the holes that reach the surface recombine with electrons from the conduction band, giving rise to the surface recombination loss. The charge transfer efficiency, eta(t), defined as the ratio between the flux of holes that contribute to the water oxidation reaction and the total flux of holes that reach the surface, is an important parameter that helps to distinguish between bulk and surface recombination losses. However, accurate determination of eta(t) by conventional voltammetry measurements is complicated because only the total current is measured and it is difficult to discern between different contributions to the current. Chopped light measurement (CLM) and hole scavenger measurement (HSM) techniques are widely employed to determine eta(t), but they often lead to errors resulting from instrumental as well as fundamental limitations. Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) is better suited for accurate determination of eta(t) because it provides direct information on both the total photocurrent and the surface recombination current. However, careful analysis of IMPS measurements at different light intensities is required to account for nonlinear effects. This work compares the eta(t) values obtained by these methods using heteroepitaxial thin-film hematite photoanodes as a case study. We show that a wide spread of eta(t) values is obtained by different analysis methods, and even within the same method different values may be obtained depending on instrumental and experimental conditions such as the light source and light intensity. Statistical analysis of the results obtained for our model hematite photoanode show good correlation between different methods for measurements carried out with the same light source, light intensity and potential. However, there is a considerable spread in the results obtained by different methods. For accurate determination of eta(t), we recommend IMPS measurements in operando with a bias light intensity such that the irradiance is as close as possible to the AM1.5 Global solar spectrum.									39	1	0	0	3	0	39			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000407763700007	28721404

Aiming to systematically study the performance of two-dimensional (2D) catalysts, we designed and synthesized a series of nanosheets, including NiMn LDH and Ni-birnessite and their morphology-retained annealing products NiMnOx-L and NiMnOx-B, respectively. We comprehensively compared the OER performance of these 2D electrocatalysts in conjunction with the information on their crystalline phases, electronic conductivity, electrochemical surface area and oxidation states of their transition metal ions. It was found that the annealing-converted NiMnOx exhibited 3- and 5-times higher concentrations of catalytically active Mn(III) than the corresponding NiMn LDH and Ni-birnessite precursors. Moreover, the layered atomic structure was beneficial for the charge transfer, leading to faster reaction kinetics. Among the nanosheets tested, NiMnOx-B showed the best alkaline OER performance with the lowest overpotential and the smallest Tafel slope because it not only retained the layered atomic structure and the 2D nanosheet morphology of the Ni-birnessite precursor, but also benefitted from the decreased interlayer distance and more Mn(III) species. This work sheds light on the design of effective non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts towards water oxidation for hydrogen production.									11	1	0	0	0	0	12			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000517839900025	31915783

Amorphous iron-based oxide(hydroxides) prepared by photochemical metal organic decomposition (PMOD) are proven OER catalysts, but their atomistic structures have been elusive. Here, a combination of powder diffraction and pair distribution function (PDF) analyses enables the formulation of a set of structural characteristics that capture the salient features of amorphous iron oxide(hydroxide) (a-FeOx), a model compound for this class of materials. a-FeOx contains only octahedrally coordinated iron atoms, which form clusters of both edge- and corner-sharing octahedra. A degree of eutaxy with predominantly ABC-type anion stacking persists at length scales beyond the dimensions of cluster domainsconsistent with thermally induced crystallization into the defect spinel gamma-Fe2O3. Evidence for considerable octahedral irregularities suggests the presence of a large number of bridging and terminal hydroxyl or water ligands, which would provide a high concentration of potential active sites. The structural features of a-FeOx are reminiscent of other first-row transition metal oxyhydroxide OER catalysts that comprise layers of edge-sharing octahedral ions capable of electron transfer and ligand association/dissociation. In keeping with ABC anion stacking, however, the title compound more closely resembles a highly defective spinel lattice rather than a layered hydroxide.									26	1	0	0	3	0	26			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000354578600037

It has been shown earlier [Krieger, A. and Weis, E. (1992) Photosynthetica 27, 89-98] that depletion of calcium ions results in a 150-mV up-shift of the midpoint redox potential (Em) of Q(A)/Q(A)(-) (the protein-bound plastoquinone which acts as an electron acceptor). Here it is shown that chloride depletion has no effect on the Em of Q(A)/Q(A)(-). It is also demonstrated that chloride-depleted PSII is more susceptible than Ca2+-depleted PSII to damage by light. This extra susceptibility to light in Cl--depleted PSII is eliminated when the artificial electron acceptor DCPIP is present during illumination. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the up-shifted Em of Q(A)/Q(A)(-) in Ca2+-depleted PSII results in a protection of the reaction centre from damage by light by changing the dominant charge recombination pathway to one which does not involve formation of the P680(+)Ph(-) radical pair, the P680 triplet and singlet oxygen [Johnson, G.N., Rutherford, A.W. and Krieger, A.

However, most synthesis technologies for M@C reported up to now are relatively complicated and time consuming (multiple steps for at least a few hours). Herein, a rapid one-step process (4 min only), plasma electrolytic deposition, was developed to fabricate CoMo/CoMoOx@C with a Janus metal/oxide core in a carbon shell, which realized a significantly enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). More interestingly, this synthesis method is extendable to many other metals. The resulting material can be easily optimized by tuning the metal/oxide core and/or the carbon shell through a wide range of parameters. NiCoMo/NiCoMoOx@C was better than commercial Pt/C in HER catalysis, and NiFeMo/NiFeMoOx was among the best overall water splitting catalysts reported very recently. This work presents a fast and general technique for the design of electrocatalysts with intriguing properties.									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000635284900023

For practical applications, an economical and facile method of producing catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is essential. Here, we report ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles uniformly deposited on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as an efficient HER catalyst. The catalyst exhibits the small overpotentials of 13 and 17 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5M aq. H2SO4 and 1.0M aq. KOH, respectively, surpassing the commercial Pt/C (16 mV and 33 mV). Moreover, the catalyst has excellent stability in both media, showing almost "zeroloss" during cycling. In a real device, the catalyst produces 15.4% more hydrogen per power consumed, and shows a higher Faradaic efficiency (92.28%) than the benchmark Pt/C (85.97%). Density functional theory calculations suggest that Ru-C bonding is the most plausible active site for the HER.									179	8	0	0	12	0	179			2041-1723			WOS:000549165900003	32152312

This has meant that many important features, including free energy barriers and the atomistic structure of intermediates, remain unknown. To tackle these issues, we construct and utilize a high-dimensional neural network (HDNN) potential for the simulation of hydrogen evolution at the HCl(aq)/Pt(111) interface, taking into consideration the influence of adsorbate-adsorbate, adsorbate-solvent interactions, and ion solvation explicitly. Long time scale MD simulations reveal coadsorbed H-ad/H2Oad on the surface. The free energy profiles for the Tafel and Heyrovsky type hydrogen coupling are extracted using umbrella sampling. It is found that the preferential mechanism can change depending on the surface coverage, highlighting the dual mechanistic nature for HER on Pt(111). Our work demonstrates the importance of controlling the solvent-substrate interactions in developing catalysts beyond Pt.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1948-7185			WOS:000716456200022	34704763

Herein, a simple one-step simultaneous electro-reduction of graphene oxide, ruthenium chloride, and gold chloride precursors without involving any pre-/or post- mechanical, hydrothermal, or carbonization step, is reported to prepare homogeneously anchored ruthenium (Ru) and gold (Au) nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as an efficient electrocatalyst for HER. The highly dispersed RuAu bimetallic nanoparticles on RGO sheets induce faster reaction kinetics with high turnover frequency, associating with strong electronic coupling interaction between RGO, Ru, and Au nanoparticles which improve the intrinsic HER activity of the catalyst as revealed by combined experimental and theoretical results. The as prepared RuAu-RGO catalyst demonstrates excellent HER activity with an overpotential of 56 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) outperforming the monometallic Ru-RGO and Au-RGO catalysts in 1 M KOH solution. The RuAu-RGO catalyst exhibits utmost stability in the practical water splitting, far surpassing the benchmark Pt/C-IrO2 system. Furthermore, the catalyst was employed as a cathode coupling with zinc (Zn) anode in an aqueous Zn-CO2 system to generate hydrogen, it demonstrated positive shift in the onset potential of HER by 0.24 V than for HER in typical three-electrode testing configuration broadening its applicability.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664180000003

So far, Pt nanocrystals are still the most active electrocatalysts for the HER in acidic media, although a tremendous search for alternatives has been done in the past decade. In this work, we synthesize polyethyleneimine (PEI) functionalized Pt superstructures (Pt-SSs@PEI) with tetragonal, hierarchical, and branched morphologies with a facile wet chemical reduction method. A series of physical characterizations are conducted to investigate the morphology, electronic structure, surface composition, and formation mechanism of Pt-SSs@PEI. Impressively, the as-prepared PtSSs@PEI show an unprecedented onset reduction potential (+64.6 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) for the HER in strong acidic media due to the protonation of -NH2 groups in the PEI adlayers on the Pt surface, and they outperform all currently reported HER electrocatalysts. The work highlights a highly effective interface-engineering strategy for improving the electrocatalytic performance of Pt nanocrystals for the HER.									103	5	0	0	3	0	103			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000415877000062	29619188

The slow heat-up and long-time isothermal simulations were performed using the GPU-enabled ReaxFF MD code of GMD-Reax and reaction analysis code of VARxMD. The simulated pyrolyzate evolution trends and pyrolysis stages proposed based on lumped pyrolyzates agree fairly with literature. Major reaction pathways for early generation of CO2, H2O, CH4 and H-2 in the activation and primary pyrolysis stages are found closely associated with carboxyl and methoxyl groups, indicating the significant role of oxygen-containing groups in the initialization of Fugu coal pyrolysis. Compared with reported experiments, the coal tar yield is over-predicted, while the gas yield is slightly under-estimated. To shorten the simulation time from 2 ns to 250 ps, an increase of 400 K in average on the basis of temperature range of 1200-2200 K is needed that will result in the over-prediction for the yields of gas and tar, as well as under prediction for the non-volatile yield. This work suggests that ReaxFF MD simulation is useful for revealing the overall scenario and detailed reactions in coal pyrolysis but cautions should be taken for proper elevated temperatures.									56	9	0	0	3	0	61			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000442977200022

Their evolution during metamorphism largely controls the fate of carbon, regulating its fluxes between shallow and deep reservoirs. Recent estimates predict that almost all subducted carbon is transferred into the crust and lithospheric mantle during subduction metamorphism via decarbonation and dissolution reactions at high-pressure conditions. Here we report the occurrence of eclogite-facies marbles associated with metasomatic systems in Alpine Corsica (France). The occurrence of these marbles along major fluid conduits as well as textural, geochemical and isotopic data indicating fluid-mineral reactions are compelling evidence for the precipitation of these carbonate-rich assemblages from carbonic fluids during metamorphism. The discovery of metasomatic marbles brings new insights into the fate of carbonic fluids formed in subducting slabs. We infer that rock carbonation can occur at high-pressure conditions by either vein-injection or chemical replacement mechanisms. This indicates that carbonic fluids produced by decarbonation reactions and carbonate dissolution may not be directly transferred to the mantle wedge, but can interact with slab and mantle-forming rocks. Rock-carbonation by fluid-rock interactions may have an important impact on the residence time of carbon and oxygen in subduction zones and lithospheric mantle reservoirs as well as carbonate isotopic signatures in subduction zones. Furthermore, carbonation may modulate the emission of CO2 at volcanic arcs over geological time scales. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, a series of atom-pair catalysts (APCs) for an NRR were fabricated using transition-metal (TM) atoms (TM = Sc-Zn) doped into g-CN monolayers. The electrochemical mechanism of APCs for an NRR has been reported by well-defined density functional theory calculations. The calculated limiting potentials were -0.47 and -0.78 V for the Fe-2@CN and Co-2@CN catalysts, respectively. Owing to its high suppression of hydrogen evolution reactions, Co-2@CN is a superior electrocatalytic material for a N-2 fixation. Stable Fe-2@CN may be a strongly attractive material for an NRR with a relatively low overpotential after an improvement in the selectivity. The two-way charge transfer affirmed the donation-acceptance procedure between N-2 and Fe-2@CN or Co-2@CN, which play a crucial role in the activation of inert N=N bonds. This study provides an in-depth investigation into atom-pair catalysts and will open up new avenues for highly efficient g-CN-based nanostructures for an NRR.

In this study, steam reforming of guaiacol, a model compounds in the volatiles in gasification of biomass, over Ni/SiO2 modified with Na, Mg or La was investigated. The results showed that the strong alkalinity induced by Na or Mg addition to Ni/SiO2 led to remarkably decreased catalytic activity. The high alkalinity also promoted formation and accumulation of the oxygen-containing species such as CO*, C-O-C aliphatic structure and carbonyl functionalities, which were precursors of the polymeric products with big pi-conjugated structures and coke. La addition increased the alkalinity to a mild extent and promoted the nickel dispersion, enhancing the catalytic activity and the resistivity towards coking. The formation of the thermally stable amorphous coke in the Na or Mg modified catalyst wrapped nickel sites and led to rapid catalyst deactivation. Both amorphous form and in carbon nanotube form of coke defective structures were formed over LaNi/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts, resulting from the distinct reaction intermediates formed during the steam reforming of guaiacol.									31	0	0	0	2	0	31			0196-8904	1879-2227		WOS:000515440100001

The substrate was exposed in-situ stepwise to gas phase water up to 10 L at liquid N-2 temperature and analyzed via X-ray and UV photoelectron spectroscopy in the so called frozen electrolyte approach. Photoemission of the pristine NiOx layer shows the presence of stoichiometric NiO and Ni2O3 as well as of non-stoichiometric phases. In the monolayer range, molecular and dissociative adsorption is detected assigned to the NiO respective Ni2O3 phase. Initially, the emission of the molecular adsorbed water species interacting with NiO is found at 0.8 eV lower binding energies as compared to water related emission for higher coverages with binding energies commonly assigned to H2O-H2O interaction. In addition to the chemical analysis, the electronic structure of the n-Si/SiOx/NiOx /H2O photoanode is measured and discussed. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

Diel variations, evolution within the one-month periods and seasonal differences have been observed. Taking into consideration the multiple physical, biological and chemical reactions regulating manganese speciation in aquatic systems, it has been demonstrated that manganese speciation is probably controlled by the competition of two antagonist reactions: the photoreduction of manganese oxides (in broad sense and represented thereafter by MnOx) and the biotic oxidation of Mn(II). Depending on the season, the biological activity in the river and the amount of luminosity reaching the MnOx, either the production of reduced labile Mn(II) or the precipitation of MnOx can become the dominant process. Other punctual events such as the drop of oxygen concentration due to large inputs of biodegradable organic matter and eutrophication phenomena, rainy events and high luminosity periods can also affect the behaviour of dissolved Mn(II) in the Marque River and so, of other contaminants.

Unfortunately, it also exhibited shortcomings such as high energy consumption and instability. Herein, Cu doping TiO2/SnO2-Sb electrode was prepared by sol-gel and anodic oxidation. The addition of TiO2 could reduce the internal passivation of the electrode and the charge transfer resistance (R-ct) from 158 Omega to 86.42 Omega, reinforce its stability and oxidation efficiency. Cu was used to limit the growth of crack morphology and provide more effective active sites which increasing the adsorbed oxygen from 49.67% to 55.00%. They accelerated electronic transfer and reduced the surface potential of SnO2 respectively, improve the oxygen evolution potential (OEP) from 2.0 V to 2.7 V and increase the response current peak from 25.86 mA to 48.66 mA, which enhanced the oxidative degradation ability of the electrode. The degradation efficiency of ceftazidime by Ti/TiO2/SnO2-Sb-Cu was 97.65% and 81.87% after 20 consecutive cycles of use, which was much higher than 51.58% of Ti/SnO2-Sb. The experiment also optimized parameters such as current density, supporting electrolyte concentration, electrode spacing and pH. Finally, the possible degradation pathways and intermediates of ceftazidime were inferred by LC-MS.									13	0	0	0	4	0	13			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000482532200058		
J	Dehcheshmeh, Mohammad Mohammadi; Shervedani, Reza Karimi; Torabi, Mostafa								Nanocomposites formed by combination of urchin like NiS with Ni-nanoparticles/N-doped nanoporous carbon, derived from nickel organic framework, and decorated with RuO2 nanoparticles: Construction and kinetics for hydrogen evolution reaction								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				355						136710	10.1016/j.electacta.2020.136710				SEP 20 2020	2020	Fabrication of active, stable, and cost effective electrocatalysts, as alternative cathodes to Pt or Pt-based materials for catalytic hydrogen production, is important for different industrial purposes, such as hydrogen therapy in medicine, syntheses in pharmaceutical and nutrient, and clean carbon-free energy carrier in industry.Herein, construction, characterization and examination of an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media is reported. The catalyst system is based on nanocomposites formed of urchin-like nickel sulfide incorporated with nickel nanoparticles and nitrogen doped-nanoporous carbon, and decorated electrochemically with ruthenium (IV) oxide on the glassy carbon electrodes, leading to GCE-NiS/Ni/NNPC/RuO2 system.Physicochemical characteristics of the prepared composite systems are studied by several surface, solution and electrochemical methods, from which the system is characterized.Then, electrocatalytic activity of the GCE modified with the composite, is studied for the HER by means of the steady-state linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), polarization curves (Tafel plots), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The obtained data are analyzed by using appropriate equivalent circuit models, from which the HER kinetics are quantitatively determined.The results revealed that the electrode modified with the prepared composite, GCE-NiS/Ni/NNPC/RuO2, is an efficient electrocatalyst for the HER in alkaline solution, where an overpotential of -82.54 mV at the current density of 20 mA cm(-2) (eta(20) = - 82.54 mV) with Tafel slope of 49.88 mV dec(-1) is observed. These activities are very close to those obtained on Pt-based electrode materials. The origin of the enhancement in the HER activity can be attributed to (i) the high surface area of the urchin-like structure along with nanoporous carbon , and (ii) the synergistic chemical coupling effects between the NiS, Ni/NNPC and RuO2 nanoparticles.

However, it is still a challenge to achieve a high NH(3)yield rate at low overpotential. Herein, we report RuO(2)nanoparticles with different degrees of surface selenation, which show excellent NRR performance at low overpotential. The NH(3)yield rate and FE of RuO2-Se-0.18/C reach 12.97 mu g h(-1)cm(-2)and 26.01% at -0.1 Vvs.RHE, respectively, which is the highest NH(3)yield rate reported at low overpotential. The RuO2-Se-0.18/C catalyst also shows excellent stability. The related NH(3)yield rate stays pretty constant after 50 h of electrolysis. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations show multiple promoted-synergism of surface selenation on the RuO(2)catalyst. First, optimized surface selenization could drive the adsorption of N(2)on RuO(2)sites. Second, surface hydrogenation promoted by surface selenization can suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, competitive reaction), enabling high NRR performance at low potential. Third, optimizing the surface selenization on RuO(2)can promote N(2)activation (*N-2 -> *NNH). Fourth, surface selenization can promote NH(3)desorption (the rate-limiting step).									10	1	0	0	1	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000578872600007

For the first time, processes occurring on timescales of seconds (such as changing temperature, moderator availability and power) are coupled in a single simulation with processes occurring over timescales of thousands of years (such as changing enrichment, reactor geometry and isotopic composition). This simulation reproduces key features of the Oklo reactors found in the literature (the cyclic boiling and flow of water in and out of the reactor; the characteristic three-hour cycle time; the total energy released by the reaction), gives greater insight into their development and evolution, and demonstrates a non-cyclic, non-boiling regime of behaviour in the later stages of reactor operation that has not previously been described.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0149-1970			WOS:000504505200022

To make this reaction energy-efficient, development of highly active and durable catalytic materials in an alkaline environment is required. Herein we report the synthesis of carbon-coated cobalt-tungsten carbide nanoparticles that have proven to be efficient noble metal-free electrocatalysts for alkaline HER. The catalyst affords a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 73 mV, which is close to that (33 mV) required by Pt/C to obtain the same current density. In addition, this catalyst operates stably at large current densities (> 30 mA cm(-1)) for as long as 18 h, and gives nearly 100% Faradaic yield during alkaline HER. The excellent catalytic performance (activity and stability) of this nanocomposite material is attributed to the cooperative effect between nanosized bimetallic carbide and the carbon protection layer outside the metal carbide. The results presented herein offer the exciting possibility of using carbon-armoured metal carbides for an efficient alkaline HER, although pristine metal carbides are not, generally, chemically stable enough under such strong alkaline conditions.									113	6	0	0	6	0	114			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000349473200038	25611887

The design of hybrid electrocatalysts can be guided by the synergetic interface for outstanding performance. Herein, the CoFeO-CoPi@NF hybrid is prepared from cobalt ion Prussian blue analogues (CoFe-PBA) in situ grown on the Co-3(PO4)(2)center dot 4H(2)O nanograss. The annealed CoFeO-CoPi@ NF exhibits favorable anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and significant stability. The isolated CoFe2O4 nanocubes on CoPi easily transform into ultrathin CoFe2O4 nanosheets covering CoPi uniformly, forming strong coupling interfaces. The electrons transfer from CoFe2O4 to CoPi because of the matched band structures and Fermi levels. The resultant increased content of Co2+ and the red shift of the valence band maximum could facilitate the surface reconstruction to improve the OER performance. This paves the way to optimize the electronic structure and make the surface reconstruction prone in advanced OER.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2168-0485			WOS:000526592900009

However, there are still some issues, such as capacity degradation, that impede their practical applications. In-depth understanding of the structure and mechanisms in cation-disordered Li-rich oxides is favorable for their further performance optimization. Herein, taking the new designed high capacity (similar to 280 mA h/g) disordered Li1.2Ti0.35Ni0.35Nb0.1O1.8F0.2 as a model compound, we meticulously study its structure evolution and electrochemical reaction mechanisms upon cycling by combination of first principles calculation, synchrony X-ray diffraction (SXRD), X-ray pair distribution function (XPDF), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ XRD, and Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) et al. The excellent structure stability and robust anions framework of cation-disordered Li-rich oxides are experimentally demonstrated. Meanwhile, the high capacity mechanisms rely on the simultaneous cations and anions redox reactions and the capacity degradation mechanism induced by oxygen loss upon cycling are also proposed. Based on these revelations, the optimization strategy and potential applications of cation-disordered Li-rich oxides are further proposed.									65	7	0	0	0	0	67			2405-8297			WOS:000451571200032

For the first application, the catalysts were assessed in a hydrodesulfurization reactor using two model sulfur molecules, dibenzothiophene and 4,6-dimethyl dibenzothiophene, as well as feeding a heavy oil fraction. The results indicated that the spheres obtained by Pluronic P-123 allowed a greater dispersion degree of MoS2 slabs than US, indicating that the size and hierarchically porous structure of alumina spheres played a principal role as a booster of the HDS catalytic efficiency of DBT, 4,6 DMDBT and diesel fuel. Then, these catalysts were used for the electrocatalysis of the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER), which take place in rechargeable Zn-air batteries. For the ORR, the CoMoS catalyst on PS in the presence of a conductive support (N-doped carbon nanotubes + graphene) displayed an overpotential of only 90 mV in comparison with Pt/C. Importantly, the chalcogenide enabled an increase in the stability, maintaining almost two times higher current retention than Pt/C for the ORR and IrO2/C for the OER. These results suggest that expended chalcogenides from the hydrodesulfurization industry can have a second life as co-catalysts for renewable energy storage systems, enabling a circular economy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000846962900001

The idea involved is to combine the functions of low-crystalline NiS for catalyzing I-3(-) to I- and BiOCl nanosheets for offering fluent charge transport pathway. Especially, in-situ hybridization leads to close assembly and strong interaction between NiS nanoparticles and BiOCl nanosheets, further enabling the synergetic electronic coupling between the two phases. As a result, the hybrid NiS/BiOCl film can catalyze the reduction of I-3(-) at an extremely low charge transfer resistance of 0.21 omega cm(2), versus 1.63 omega cm(2) for Pt. When used as counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells, device using NiS/BiOCl film as counter electrode produces a high power conversion efficiency of 7.88%, versus 7.35% for Pt under the same conditions. Furthermore, low-crystalline NiS/BiOCl film can also catalyze oxygen evolution reaction with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.61 V vs. RHE and a Tafel slope of 113 mV dec(-1), which is potentially useful for many operational clean energy devices. Our study thus provides new opportunities for the development of highly efficient hybrid electrocatalyst in a facile and energy-saving strategy.									3	1	0	0	1	0	4			2365-6549			WOS:000450365000003

The electrodeposition of lead dioxide was achieved in the presence of PVP on Pt and Ti substrates under constant current density from solutions containing Pb(NO3)(2) and NaF in HClO4. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the morphology and particle size of PbO2 are strongly affected by the concentrations of Pb(NO3)(2), PVP and HClO4. It seemed that PVP can control both the morphology and particle size of lead dioxide and increases the overpotential for oxygen evolution during the electrodeposition of lead dioxide. The resulting lead dioxide was composed of nano-metric globular particles aligned in rice shaped structure with diameter in the range of 30-50 nm. It was suggested that the growth of PbO2 crystals is affected by the aqueous network of self-assembled surfactant formed on the electrode surface during the electrodeposition process. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to investigate the interfacial behavior of deposited lead dioxide in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The EIS results revealed a typically porous electrode behavior consisted of a straight line, at high frequency region, turning to a potential dependent semicircle, at low frequency region, the diameter of which being decreased with increasing potential increments. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns show that samples were composed of beta-PbO2. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									53	10	0	0	7	1	60			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000251480900027

However, pure single-phase TMPs still possess some disadvantages, such as the limited number of active sites and difficulty in greatly accelerating mass/charge transfer. Elemental doping is a practical way to manipulate the intrinsic electronic structures of TMPs and optimize the adsorption and desorption process of intermediates during the water splitting reaction. Rational construction of heterostructure electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and excellent durability shows great potential for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we developed a nickel foam (NF)-supported NixCoyP/Co2P heterostructure anchoring on N-doped carbon (NixCoyP/Co2P@NF) via the phosphating of the organic frameworks (ZIF-67) with Mo species added. The as-synthesized NixCoyP/Co2P@NF catalyst shows a unique three-dimensional (3D) nano-network morphology with a large specific surface area and abundant channels for mass exchange. Mo doping alters the valence electronic states of the constituent elements in the initial phase (NixCoyP), thus optimizing the proton transfer from P sites to metal sites, while Co species in the secondary phase (Co2P) is conducive to the water decomposition. Moreover, the heterogeneous interface between initial and secondary phases accelerates electron conduction and further enhances the electrocatalytic efficiency. The NixCoyP/Co2P@NF catalyst shows overpotentials of 170 mV for HER and 352 mV for OER at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. The current density can reach 100 mA cm(-2) by applying a voltage of 1.75 V for overall water splitting in an alkaline water electrolyzer with NixCoyP/Co2P@NF acting as the anodic and cathodic electrodes. This work has achieved a heterostructure catalyst via the heteroatom-dopant induced phase transition and offered an interfacial engineering strategy for further improving the activity of bifunctional TMP catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2214-9937			WOS:000829335800001

By performing density functional theory calculations corrected by on-site Coulomb interactions, we systematically studied the physicochemical properties of the Pd-doped CeO2(111) surface and the catalytic methanol to formaldehyde reaction on the surface. Two different configurations were located for the Pd dopant, and the calculated results showed that doping of Pd will make the surface more active with lower oxygen vacancy formation energies than the pristine CeO2(111). Moreover, two different pathways for the dehydrogenation of CH3OH to HCHO on the Pd-doped CeO2(111) were determined, one of which is the conventional two-step process (stepwise pathway) with the O-H bond of CH3OH being broken first followed by the C-H bond cleavage, while the other is a novel one-step process (concerted pathway) involving the two H being dissociated from CH3OH simultaneously even with a lower energy barrier than the stepwise one. With electronic and structural analyses, we showed that the direct reduction of Pd4+ to Pd2+ through the transfer of two electrons can outperform the separated Ce4+ to Ce3+ processes with the help of configurational evolution at the Pd site, which is responsible for the existence of such one-step dehydrogenation process. This novel mechanism may provide an inspiration for constructing ceria-based SAC with unique ODH activities.

The singlet energy surfaces allow its evolution towards H2O2 and an imine species. Whereas N-H cleavage appears to be a radical process, C-H rupture results in a carbocation intermediate stabilized by an adjacent N atom and an electrostatic interaction with the [(CuOOH)-O-I] metal core. Upon injection of an additional electron, the latter species straightforwardly forms a hydroxylated product. Based on these computational results, a new mechanistic description of the reactivity of copper monooxygenases is proposed.									36	0	0	0	5	0	36			0947-6539			WOS:000258092400020	18512825

Herein, we propose a cost-effective and facile strategy to prepare a Fe/C heterostructured composite (Fe/Fe3C-F@CNT) via ultra-fast pyrolysis of ferrocene based on the induction and microwave thermal effect of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Fe/Fe3C-F@CNT exhibits a novel heterostructure where carbon-encapsulated Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the surface of CNTs and small iron-based nano-clusters exist on the surface of carbon layer, thus improving the electrical conductivity and dispersion of active sites. Fe/Fe3C-F@CNT shows superior OER catalytic performance, which is better than that of many Co- and Ni-based catalysts and even superior to that of RuO2. Furthermore, the catalytic performance further improved by loading Fe/Fe3C-F@CNT on the commercial foam iron. The resultant composite required a low overpotential (286 mV) to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The durable catalytic stability, exhibiting no significant degradation at 100 mA cm(-2) after 320 h, makes Fe/Fe3C-F@CNT a promising efficient, low-cost and environmentally-friendly OER catalyst for application in water electrolysis and metal-air batteries. More importantly, this study greatly shortens the preparation time required to fabricate uniform Fe/C heterostructures. This study brings a new inspiration for fabricating various materials for application as green energy sources.									30	2	0	0	0	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000449701900037

The present review focuses on recent work on robust earth-abundant heterogeneous catalysts based on pristine MOFs for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and overall water splitting. These catalysts have been extensively studied as alternatives for noble metal-based ones, demonstrating 'hydrogen economy" development prospects. In addition, novel strategies to enhance the conductivity, chemical stability and efficiency of MOF-based electrocatalysts are discussed. The best electrocatalysts even surpass the achievements of the platinum group of metals and MOF-derived catalysts in catalytic performance. The electrolytic cells with MOF-modified electrodes demonstrated excellent catalytic activity and can deliver a high current density at a voltage lower than that using the precious metal-based Pt/C cathodes and IrO2 anodes. In this review article, current approaches to design such MOF and MOF-modified electrode materials are summarized and analyzed.									25	0	0	0	2	0	25			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000571979900039	32756705

However, syntheses of noble metal-based allomorphic nanomaterials are extremely difficult, and only a few successful examples have been found. Herein, we report the discovery of hexagonal close-packed Pt-Ni alloy, despite the fact that Pt-Ni alloys are typically crystallized in face-centred cubic structures. The hexagonal close-packed Pt-Ni alloy nano-multipods are synthesized via a facile one-pot solvothermal route, where the branches of nano-multipods take the shape of excavated hexagonal prisms assembled by six nanosheets of 2.5 nm thickness. The hexagonal close-packed Pt-Ni excavated nano-multipods exhibit superior catalytic property towards the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte. The overpotential is only 65mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the mass current density reaches 3.03 mA mu gPt(-1) at -70 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which outperforms currently reported catalysts to the best of our knowledge.									272	19	0	0	4	0	274			2041-1723			WOS:000400113300001	28436494

In particular, the correlation between the particle structure and the photocatalytic activity is not established yet, although it was observed that the activity is sensitive to the particle size and shape. This work, by investigating a series of TiO(2) anatase nanoparticles with different size and shape as the photocatalyst for water oxidation, correlates quantitatively the particle size and shape with the photocatalytic activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with the periodic continuum solvation model have been utilized to compute the electronic structure of nanoparticles in aqueous solution and provide the reaction energetics for the key elementary reaction. We demonstrate that the equilibrium shape of nanoparticle is sensitive to its size from I to 30 nm, and the sharp-crystals possess much higher activity than the flat crystals in OER, which in combination lead to the morphology dependence of photocatalytic activity. The conventionally regarded quantum size effect is excluded as the major cause. The physical origin for the shape activity relationship is identified to be the unique spatial separation/localization of the frontier orbitals in the sharp nanoparticles, which benefits the adsorption of the key reaction intermediate (i.e., OH) in OER on the exposed five-coordinated Ti of {101} facet. The theoretical results here provide a firm basis for maximizing photocatalytic activity via nanostructure engineering and are also of significance for understanding photocatalysis on nanomaterials in general.									237	13	0	0	29	0	242			0002-7863			WOS:000295911500079	21879719

The Co-Mo bimetallic carbides (CoxMoyC) are proposed to be used as non-precious metal electrocatalysts for alkaline HOR to boost the catalytic activity by tuning the electronic structures and maintaining the optimal adsorption of Hads and OHads at the same time. In this report, we design and fabricate three configurations of Co-Mo bimetallic carbides to investigate the relationship between their catalytic performance and lattice expanding degree. Among them, Co3Mo3C nanorods supported on cobalt foam (Co3Mo3C NR/CF) exhibit a current density of 5.6 mA cm-2 at 0.10 V vs. RHE toward HOR and exchange current density (j0) of 1.84 mA cm-2. Besides, Co3Mo3C NR/CF electrocatalysts can maintain the catalytic current density over 2.2 mA cm-2 at 0.05 V vs. RHE for over 12 h. Furthermore, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the boosting catalytic activities on Co3Mo3C originate from the suitable tuning electronic structures.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000722923500002		
J	Ologunagba, Damilola; Kattel, Shyam								Pt- and Pd-modified transition metal nitride catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				24	20			12149	12157		10.1039/d2cp00792d		APR 2022		MAY 25 2022	2022	Hydrogen production via electrochemical splitting of water using renewable electricity represents a promising strategy. Currently, platinum group metals (PGMs) are the best performing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts. Thus, the design of non-PGM catalysts or low-loading PGM catalysts is essential for the commercial development of hydrogen generation technologies via electrochemical splitting of water. Here, we employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore Pt and Pd modified transition metal nitrides (TMNs) as low-cost HER catalysts. Our calculations show that Pt/Pd binds strongly with TMs on TMN(111) surfaces, leading to the formation of stable Pt and Pd-monolayer (ML)-TMN(111) structures. Furthermore, our calculated hydrogen binding energy (HBE) demonstrates that Pt/MnN, Pt/TiN, Pt/FeN, Pt/VN, Pt/HfN, Pd/FeN, Pd/TaN, Pd/NbN, Pd/TiN, Pd/HfN, Pd/MnN, Pd/ScN, Pd/VN, and Pd/ZrN are promising candidates for the HER with a low value of limiting potential (U-L) similar to that calculated on Pt(111).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000786432900001	35437533

Despite demonstration of simulating the pyrolysis process of dry lignocellulose, MD investigation of this process assisted by water is yet to be performed. This is important considering that hydrothermal liquefaction could be promising to concentrate the energy of biocrude yielded from lignocellulose biomass. In this paper, roles of water on the pyrolysis process of the lignocellulose were investigated by ReaxFF MD simulation. In the simulation, both dry cellulose and lignin systems as well as their systems containing 33% and 66% water by weight were studied at a temperature range of 1250-2000 K at a time scale of 6 ns. Products were characterized by studying their phases, H/C, O/C ratios, and their higher heating values (HHV) that are used to evaluate their value as fuels. Time evolutions of water and other chemical products were investigated to determine the role of water in the reactions and to reveal the reaction mechanism. Compared with dry systems, pyrolysis of the cellulose in presence of water shows several interesting trends, including enhanced breakdown of the cellulose polymer, increased oxygenation of the products, and shift of the final products from char to oil. In contrast, lignin remains largely unaffected by water, and simulation has reproduced experimental results of lignin char formation at elevated temperature in liquefaction. Moreover, it is found that the temperature plays an important role in the reactions. As temperature increases the water's oxygenating effects in the cellulose is decreased. These theoretical results provide solid evidence for unveiling the reaction mechanism of biomass pyrolysis, offering useful guidance for processing wet biomass to liquid fuels.									30	1	0	0	4	0	31			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000425863300089

It has been found that the maximum trans-conductance of a developed OECT shifts to higher gate voltages with the increase of light irradiation at the polythiophene gate electrode. This gatematerial chosen for the OECT plays an important role in the light-enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is subsequently responsible for the doping/de-doping of the channel material upon light illumination, thus making the OECT an efficient light sensing device. Additionally, the connection of these devices allowed the creation of organic opto-logic gates. This very first low voltage organic optical-to-electronic interface can potentially find applications in modern electronics and photonics. The development process includes geometry optimization and optimization of the channel and gate materials.									13	0	0	0	3	0	13			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000419151900011

Isothermal experiments were conducted to investigate the thermal decomposition kinetics of siderite lump in a weakly oxidising atmosphere at 500-850degC. The results reveal that siderite has self-magnetisation characteristics under controlled conditions, and the phase evolution process and final products of decomposition depend temperature and atmosphere. The phase transformation process in weak oxidising atmosphere follows the steps as: FeCO3 rarr Fe3O4 rarr gamma-Fe2O3 at 550degC, and FeCO3 rarr FeO + Fe3O4 rarr Fe3O4 rarr gamma-Fe2O3 rarr alpha-Fe2O3 at 800degC. In inert atmosphere, the decomposition pathway is FeCO3 rarr Fe3O4 below 733degC and FeCO3 rarr FeO + Fe3O4 above 733degC. The molar ratio of FeO/Fe3O4 increases with temperature. The decomposition kinetics of siderite lump in oxygen-deficient atmosphere is consistent with chemical reaction control in the temperature range 500-700degC and nucleation and growth mechanism in the 750-850degC. The corresponding activation energies are 53.73 and 38.15 KJ mol-1, respectively.									26	1	1	0	0	0	26			0371-9553			INSPEC:16276151

This technique is based on mass spectrometry detection using a semipermeable membrane for the inlet of gases dissolved in liquid solutions. MIMS is applied to the study of gas evolving reactions taking place at electrodes made from platinum nanoparticles supported on carbon (Pt/C), and immersed in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Potentiodynamic experiments under MIMS detection show the formation of carbon oxidation products like CO2, CO and HCOOH. The oxidation of carbon is accelerated in the presence of Pt eletrocatalyst. Instability of a Pt/C electrode starts at 0.35 V-NHE, close to the C/CO2 thermodynamic potential, reflected by the detection of CO2 evolution. Partial oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide produces carbon corrosion at even lower potentials due to chemical reactivity. The corrosion rate is in the order of 10(-9) A cm(C)(-2) (related to total carbon area) at room temperature. The results are of interest for stability studies on proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) electrodes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, electrochemically inert g-C3N4 (GCN) is successfully demonstrated to significantly enhance water oxidation by constructing a superhydrophilic catalyst surface and promoting substantial exposure of active sites. As a proof-of-concept application, superhydrophilic GCN/Ni(OH)(2) (GCNN) hybrids with monodispersed Ni(OH)(2) nanoplates strongly anchored on GCN are synthesized for enhanced water oxidation catalysis. Owing to the superhydrophilicity of functionalized GCN, the surface wettability of GCNN (contact angle 0 degrees) is substantially improved as compared with bare Ni(OH)(2) (contact angle 21 degrees). Besides, GCN nanosheets can effectively suppress Ni(OH)(2) aggregation to help expose more active sites. Benefiting from the well-defined catalyst surface, the optimal GCNN hybrid shows significantly enhanced electrochemical performance over bare Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets, although GCN is electrochemically inert. In addition, similar catalytic performance promotion resulting from wettability improvement induced by incorporation of hydrophilic GCN is also successfully demonstrated on Co(OH)(2). The present results demonstrate that, in addition to developing new catalysts, building efficient surface chemistry is also vital to achieve extraordinary water oxidation performance.									61	3	0	0	6	0	61			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000423512300017

The crystal structure and morphology of as-acquired nanostructures were examined by powder X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Magnetic measurements indicate that the as-synthesized Fe3O4 nanostructures are ferromagnetic at room temperature. The synthesized nanostructures have a high-specific surface area of 268 m(2)/g, which affects the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode materials. The purity of the as-synthesized nanostructures was affirmed by Raman and X-ray Photoelectron studies. The electrochemical activity of the magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MIONPs) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and supercapacitors were investigated in alkaline medium (0.5 M KOH) versus Ag/AgCl at room temperature. The electrocatalysts show low onset potential (similar to 0.18 V) and Tafel slope (similar to 440 mV/dec) for HER.

The pi-pi interaction between self-assembled PDI and O-CN could lead to the electron delocalization effect to facilitate the electron migration. Self-assembled PDI could broaden the visible response range of O-CN to produce more photogenerated carries. Moreover, the interlaced band structures of O-CN and self-assembled PDI could result in a built-in electric field to promote the interfacial charge separation. Besides, many active species (h(+), O-center dot(2-) and O-1(2) ) could be accumulated to improve the oxidation ability of PDI/O-CN. Therefore, PDI/O-CN exhibited enhanced visible photocatalytic oxidation activities towards disinfection, degradation and oxygen evolution. The optimum PDI/O-CN inactivated 96.6% of Staphylococcus aureus cells within 3 h, while O-CN only killed 62.2%. Additionally, the phenol degradation rate and evolved oxygen amount in 2 h of PDI/O-CN-40% were 3.6 and 1.8 times as high as those of O-CN, respectively.									95	4	0	0	18	0	95			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000532681500017

Incorporation of Pd into Au(111): enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				12	46			15225	15230		10.1039/c0cp00780c				DEC 2010	2010	While monolayer formation by under potential deposition of palladium from 0.1 M H2SO4 + 0.2 mM PdSO4 onto Au(111) commences around 0.6 V vs. SCE (saturated calomel electrode), there is evidence for slow incorporation of Pd-0 into Au(111) under the same experimental conditions at 0.8 V, already. The presence of chloride traces suppresses such incorporation by forming stable complexes like [PdCl4](2-), which are strongly adsorbed on the surface. Less than 1% of a Pd monolayer are incorporated after immersion of Au(111) at 0.8 V into 0.1 M H2SO4 vertical bar 0.2 mM PdSO4 for 30 minutes. It is supposed that incorporated Pd preferentially occupies subsurface sites near Au steps, which is supported by theoretical calculations. Despite the low Pd coverage, the electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.1 M H2SO4 is enormously high. The immersion time is crucial for the HER electrocatalytic activity.									34	0	0	0	1	0	34			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000284313600011	20877870

The obtained CuPt alloy showed improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, with a 30 mV positive shift in the half-wave potential value, as compared to the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst in a 0.1 M KOH solution. The CuPt alloy with the trigonal bipyramidal morphology possesses porous type inter-connected sides, which help to achieve improved mass transport of oxygen during the ORR. The exposure of the (111) plane of the CuPt alloy further improved the catalytic activity towards the dioxygen reduction in alkaline media. The ORR activity of the NGr-supported CuPt alloy was found to be dependent on the reaction time, and improved activity was obtained on the material derived at a reaction time of 90 min (CuPt-TBTC/NGr-90). The material synthesized at a lower or higher reaction time than 90 min resulted in a partially formed trigonal bipyramidal morphology with more truncated cubes or agglomerated trigonal bipyramidal and truncated cubes with closed type structures, respectively. Along with the high intrinsic ORR activity, CuPt-TBTC/NGr-90 displayed excellent electrochemical stability. Even after repeated 1000 potential cycling in a window ranging from 0.10 to 1.0 V (vs. RHE), the system clearly outperformed the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst with 15 and 60 mV positive shifts in the onset and half-wave potentials, respectively. CuPt-TBTC/NGr-90 also exhibited 2.1 times higher mass activity and 2.2 times higher specific activity, compared to Pt/C at 0.90 V (vs. RHE). Finally, a zinc-air battery fabricated with the alloy catalyst as the air electrode displayed a peak power density of 300 mW cm(-2), which is much higher than the peak power density of 253 mW cm(-2) obtained for the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst as the air electrode.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000411293800014	28639678

The cation exchange and host-guest strategies respectively resulted in two different combination modes between Ru precursor and ZIF-8 anchored on graphene. Following pyrolysis of the above precursors, Ru single-atom sites (SASs) with and without Ru nanoparticles (NPs) were formed selectively on NG (denoted as Ru SASs+NPs/NG and Ru SASs/NG, respectively). Ru SASs+NPs/NG exhibited excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in alkaline solutions (eta(10)=12 mV, 12.57 A mg(Ru)(-1) at 100 mV), which is much better than Ru SASs/NG. The experimental and theoretical study revealed that Ru SASs could adsorb hydrogen with optimal adsorption strength, while Ru NPs could lower the barrier of water molecule dissociation, and thus Ru SASs and Ru NPs could synergistically promote the catalytic performance of HER in alkaline solutions.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000747634000001

Phase evolution in the powder mixtures as a function of composition and milling time was followed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) finding out that after 18 h, every mixture consist of a single phase. Mechanically activated chemical reaction takes place after an intial step of particle size refinement and polymorphic transformation of C-Gd2O3. We have performed Impedance Spectroscopy measurements to investigate oxygen ion dynamics in the series and conclude that Zr Substitution for Sri hardly modifies the importance of ion-ion correlations in the oxygen diffusion process. We also estimate from conductivity measurements the value of the microscopic activation energy needed for independent ion hopping, which is found to be 0.56 +/- 0.06eV, independent of Zr content.

We used niobium diselenide (NbSe2) as a representative TMD, and prepared single-layer NbSe2 porous nanosheets (PNS) by a double-sonication liquid-phase exfoliation, with H2O2 as a pore-forming agent. The single-layer NbSe2 PNS were drop-cast on carbon foam (CF) to fabricate a three-dimensional robust NbSe2 PNS/CF electrode. The NbSe2 PNS/CF electrode exhibits a high current density of -50 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential of 148 mV and a Tafel slope of 75.8 eV dec(-1) for the HER process. Little deactivation is detected in continuous CV testing up to 20,000 cycles, which suggests that this novel NbSe2 PNS/CF is a promising catalytic electrode in the HER application. The porous structure of single-layer NbSe2 nanosheets can enhance the electrochemical performance compared with that of pore-free NbSe2 nanosheets. These findings illustrate that the single-layer NbSe2 PNS is a potential electrocatalytic material for HER. More importantly, the electrochemical performance of the NbSe2 PNS/CF expands the use of two-dimensional TMDs in electrocatalysis-related fields.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8				2079-4991		WOS:000479007900093	31100855

This is a redox intermediate in steady state oxygen evolution and transfers electrons from the water splitting CaMn4 cluster to the central chlorophyll radical P-680(+). This Perspective discusses the functional principles of Tyrosine(Z) as a proton-coupled redox active link, as well as mechanistic studies of synthetic model systems and implications for artificial photosynthesis. Experimental studies of temperature dependence and kinetic isotope effects are important tools to understand these reactions. We emphasize the importance of proton transfer distance and hydrogen bond dynamics that are responsible for variation in the rate of PCET by several orders of magnitude. The mechanistic principles discussed and their functional significance are not limited to tyrosine and biological systems, but are important to take into account when constructing artificial photosynthetic systems. Of particular importance is the role of proton transfer management in water splitting and solar fuel catalysis.									125	0	0	0	34	0	125			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000292205100005

Precious Pt/C catalyst is known to demonstrate high efficiency in the electrochemical HER and suffers from commercialization issues. Therefore, precious-metal-free and organic-based catalysts are of importance for a future perspective. In this work, cobalt tetra[4-[2-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl) phenoxy]]-phthalocyanine (CoTBImPc) is synthesized for the first time and characterized by physicochemical and electrochemical techniques. H-1 NMR and mass spectral data reveal the successful formation of the ligand and complex, whereas the thermogravimetry (TG) study confirms the thermal stability of the complex up to 400 degrees C. The electroactivity of CoTBImPc is compared with the hybrid composite of a carbon nanotube (CNT-CoTBImPc) and benchmark Pt/C catalyst for the HER. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) shows that an onset potential for the HER for CoTBImPc-CNT/GCE is shifted to a higher potential than that of CoTBImPc/GCE, suggesting that the HER is more feasible at the surface of CoTBImPc-CNT. Higher activity for CoTBImPc-CNT/GCE in comparison with that of CoTBImPc/GCE in 0.5 M H2SO4 (pH = 0.3) may be ascribed to the enhanced conductivity, a greater number of active sites, and a larger surface area. The hybrid composite yields a current density of -10 mA.cm(-2) and demonstrates HER activity at a lower overpotential (63 mV). The benchmark Pt/C catalyst and the as-synthesized pristine phthalocyanine molecule exhibit the HER at overpotentials of 3 and 160 mV, respectively, at a current density of -10 mA.cm(-2). A lower Tafel slope value of 43.2 mV.dec(-1) and a higher double-layer capacitance value of 44 mF.cm(-2) confirm that the hybrid composite is one of the superior catalyst candidates for the HER compared to the bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and pristine metal phthalocyanine. Further, CoTBImPc-CNT/GCE also exhibits an excellent stability during the HER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000711236300042

In this study, we built an inorganic/organic hybrid photo-anode to improve the PEC performance of BVO by covering a multifunctional film. The film contains modified chlorophyll (Chl) organic compounds and Co and Si ions with a gradient distribution. The Co ions present at the interface between BVO and Chl promote the transport of photogenerated holes, and the Si ions on the surface of the photoanode enhance the hydrophilicity of PEC cells. This modified Chl film not only reduces the OER barrier and promotes carrier transfer but also inhibits loss of vanadium and increases the stability of the BVO photoanode. Finally, the modified BVO photoanode exhibits a photocurrent density of 5.1 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE (RHE: reversible hydrogen electrode), and the onset potential moves 350 mV negatively in 0.5 mol L-1 Na2SO4. This article provides a general and simple surface hybrid inorganic/organic solution to improve the catalytic ability of photoanodes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000757760000001

Nevertheless, the serious charge recombination and sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the main factors limiting its PEC performance. In this contribution, copper incorporated nanostructured BiVO4 photoanodes (nanoCu:BiVO4) were prepared by converting the electrodeposited BiOI nanosheets in the presence of copper and vanadium sources and subsequent thermal treatment. nanoCu:BiVO4 prepared with a suitable amount of copper consists of well-interconnected BiVO4 nanoparticles coated with p-type Cu(I) vanadate. The well-interconnected structure improved the kinetics of the charge transport, whereas n-p heterojunction formed between BiVO4 and Cu(I) vanadate remarkably improved the efficiencies of charge separation and interfacial charge transfer. Further improvement in OER kinetics and photostability of nanoCu:BiVO4 was demonstrated by interfacing nanoCu:BiVO4 with nickel-iron oxyhydroxide based OER catalyst.

Herein, a metal-organic framework-assisted pyrolysis-replacement-reorganization approach is developed to obtain ultrafine PtCo alloy nanoparticles (sub-10 nm) attached on the inner and outer shells of porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) with closed ends. During the thermal reorganization, the migration of Pt-Co nano-alloys to both surfaces ensures the maximized exposure of active sites while maintaining the robust attachment to the porous carbon matrix. Density functional theory calculations suggest a nearly thermodynamically-neutral free energy of adsorption for hydrogen intermediates and diversified active sites induced by alloying, thus resulting in a great promotion in intrinsic activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Benefiting from the delicate structural design and compositional modulation, the optimized Pt3Co@NCNTelectrocatalyst manifests outstanding HER activity and superior stability in both acidic and alkaline media.									55	0	0	0	2	0	54			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000677767300001	34137497

Although the incorporation of pendant bases into molecular catalysts for hydrogen production and utilization has led to enhanced turnover frequencies, the analogous incorporation of pendant bases into molecular catalysts for water oxidation has received little attention. Herein, the syntheses, structures, and catalytic activities of new iron complexes with pendant bases are reported. Of these new complexes, [Fe(L-1)](2+) {L-1 = N,N-dimethyl-N,N-bis(pyridazin-3-ylmethyl)ethane-1,2-diamine} is the most active catalyst. Initial turnover frequencies of 141 and 24 h(-1) were measured by using ceric ammonium nitrate at pH 0.7 and sodium periodate at pH 4.7, respectively. These results suggest that the incorporation of pendant bases into molecular catalysts for water oxidation might be an effective strategy that can be considered in the development of new catalysts for the OER, but will require the careful balance of many factors.									61	3	0	0	5	0	62			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000329199900014

JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				126	17			3257	3268		10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c00749				MAY 5 2022	2022	All contemporary oxygenic phototrophs-from primitive cyanobacteria to complex multicellular plants-split water using a single invariant cluster comprising Mn4CaO5 (the water oxidation catalyst) as the catalyst within photosystem II, the universal oxygenic reaction center of natural photosynthesis. This cluster is unstable outside of PSII and can be reconstituted, both in vivo and in vitro, using elemental aqueous ions and light, via photoassembly. Here, we demonstrate the first functional substitution of manganese in any oxygenic reaction center by in vitro photoassembly. Following complete removal of inorganic cofactors from cyanobacterial photosystem II microcrystal (PSIIX), photoassembly with free cobalt (Co2+), calcium (Ca2+), and water (OH-) restores O-2 evolution activity. Photoassembly occurs at least threefold faster using Co2+ versus Mn2+ due to a higher quantum yield for PSIIX-mediated charge separation (P*): Co2+ -> P* -> Co3+ Q(A)(-). However, this kinetic preference for Co2+ over native Mn2+ during photoassembly is offset by significantly poorer catalytic activity (similar to 2S% of the activity with Mn-2(+)) and similar to 3- to 30-fold faster photoinactivation rate. The resulting reconstituted Co-PSIIX oxidizes water by the standard four-flash photocycle, although they produce 4-fold less O-2 per PSII, suggested to arise from faster charge recombination (Co(3+)Q(A) <- Co(4+)QA(-)) in the catalytic cycle. The faster photoinactivation of reconstituted Co-PSIIX occurs under anaerobic conditions during the catalytic cycle, suggesting direct photodamage without the involvement of O-2. Manganese offers two advantages for oxygenic phototrophs, which may explain its exclusive retention throughout Darwinian evolution: significantly slower charge recombination (Mn(3+)Q(A) <- Mn(4+)Q(A)(-)) permits more water oxidation at low and fluctuating solar irradiation (greater net energy conversion) and much greater tolerance to photodamage at high light intensities (Mn-4(+) is less oxidizing than Co4+). Future work to identify the chemical nature of the intermediates will be needed for further interpretation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000808555400005	35446582

In this paper we describe an electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-modified Ni electrode, which could be used as a pre-eminent candidate for such a system. The experimentally determined characteristics of this electrode showing superior electrocatalytic activity were complemented by density functional theory calculations. Thermodynamic considerations led to the conclusion that H atoms, formed upon H2O discharge on Ni, spill onto the RGO, which serves as an H adatom acceptor, enabling continuous cleaning of Ni-active sites and an alternative pathway for H-2 production. This mode of action is rendered by the unique reactivity of RGO, which arises due to the presence of O surface groups within the graphene structure. The significant electrocatalytic activity and life time (435 days) of the RGO towards the HER under conditions of alkaline water electrolysis are demonstrated.									70	1	0	0	5	0	70			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000362679300043	26399740

Herein, nanorod hematite arrays are prepared by adjusted-hydrothermal method with a diameter of 30 nm. Phosphate group and cobalt ions are deposited on the surface of hematite by chemical immersion process to improve its photoelectrochemical performance and speed up the oxygen evolution reaction in water splitting. The CoPi-modified alpha-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays (NAs) show a greatly enhanced electrochemical and photoelectrochemical property with a photocurrent density 270 mu A cm(-2) at 1.23 V (vs. RHE) for FeCoPi-4 compared with 20 mu A cm(-2) for untreated alpha-Fe2O3 NAs. The effect of phosphate groups and cobalt ions on the alpha-Fe2O3 NAs are both investigated. The Co (II) ion is connected closely with the alpha-Fe2O3 surface through phosphate groups by XPS detection. The phosphate enhances the transport of electron from alpha-Fe2O3 to Co ion. The high performance demonstrated in photoelectrochemical test indicates that CoPi-modified alpha-Fe2O3 NAs is a potential photoelectrocatalyst for water splitting. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

From the results it can be stated that the extent and kinetics of sorption are decisively dependent upon the pH of the solution. At open-circuit potential the accumulation process is associated with the formation of hydrolysis products of cobalt. It is shown that the presence of borate species suppresses the cobalt uptake on the gold electrode.The mechanisms of cobalt accumulation during cathodic and anodic polarization in NaClO4 and borate buffer solutions are different. It has been found that (i) oxide layers containing Go-species are formed on gold at potentials more positive than 1.050 V; (ii) the composition of oxide films is influenced by the nature of the supporting electrolyte used; (iii) peculiarities appear in the formation and decomposition of surface oxides that are most likely due to not only Co(OH)(2) but Co2+ species.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0013-4686			WOS:A1995RL82700005		
J	Kanzaki, Yoshiki; Murakami, Takashi				Murakami, Takashi/G-5049-2014	Kanzaki, Yoshiki/0000-0003-1400-1736			Rate law of Fe(II) oxidation under low O-2 conditions								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				123				338	350		10.1016/j.gca.2013.06.014				DEC 15 2013	2013	Despite intensive studies on Fe(II) oxidation kinetics, the oxidation rate law has not been established under low O-2 conditions. The importance of Fe(II) oxidation under low O-2 conditions has been recently recognized; for instance, the Fe(II)/Fe(III) compositions of paleosols, ancient soils formed by weathering, can produce a quantitative pattern of the atmospheric oxygen increase during the Paleoproterozoic. The effects of partial pressure of atmospheric oxygen (Po-2) on the Fe(II) oxidation rate were investigated to establish the Fe(II) oxidation rate - Po2 relationships under low O-2 conditions. All oxidation experiments were carried out in a glove box by introducing Ar gas at similar to 10(-5)-similar to 10(-4) atm of Po-2, pH 7.57-8.09 and 22 degrees C. Luminol chemiluminescence was adopted to measure low Fe(II) concentrations (down to similar to 2 nM). Combining previous data under higher Po-2 conditions (10(-3) -0.2 atm) with the present data, the rate law for Fe(II) oxidation over a wide range of Po-2 (10(-5) -0.2 atm) was found to be written as:d[Fe(II)]/dt = -k{Fe(II)][O-2](x)[OH-](2)where the exponent of [O-2], x, and the rate constant, k, change from x = 0.98 (perpendicular to 0.04) and log k = 15.46 (perpendicular to 0.06) at similar to 6 x 10(-3) -0.2 atm of Po-2 to x - 0.58 (+/-0.02) and log k = 13.41 (perpendicular to 0.03) at 10(-5) -similar to 6 x 10(-3) atm of Po-2. The most plausible mechanism that explains the change in x under low O-2 conditions is that, instead of O-2, oxygen-derived oxidants, H2O2 and to some extent, O-2, dominate the oxidation reactions at <similar to 10(-3) atm of Po-2. The rate law found in the present study requires us to reconsider distributions of Fe redox species at low Po-2 in natural environments, especially in paleoweathering profiles, and may provide a deeper understanding of the evolution of atmospheric oxygen in the Precambrian.

These comparisons provide useful insight into the kinds of stellar environments responsible for r- and s-process nucleosynthesis. The growth of r-process material appears to be associated with the ejection rate of material from massive stars. Low-mass Type II supernovae are slightly favored if the r-process is primary. The growth of s-process material is consistent with production in intermediate-mass stars. The yields for both the s- and the r-process, however, appear to require a neutron source which does not depend upon initial metallicity.									163	6	0	0	0	0	166			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:A1992HV51200027

A number of materials have been synthesized for successful electrosplitting of water. Yet, the simultaneous production of hydrogen and oxygen with the help of efficient and stable bi-functional electrocatalyst is still challenging. Correspondingly, the precious metal based catalysts are gaining much interest for the efficient inexpensive and ecofriendlier practical application in energy materials among researchers. Herein, we report new combination of nitrogen doped carbon dots modified copper cobalt (NDCDs-CuCo) alloy nanoparticles as potential electrocatalyst for water splitting. These catalysts were synthesized at different temperatures. The NDCDs-CuCo alloy nanopartides exhibit excellent catalytic performances and stability in alkaline medium for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) through synergistic effect between nitrogen doped carbon dots and bimetallic CuCo alloy nanoparticles at optimized conditions of onset over potentials and current densities. NDCDs-CuCo alloy nanopartides possess electrocatalytic properties in strong alkaline medium with current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 038 V. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In the current study, we seek to explore an advanced and facile method for the preparation of IrO_2 deposited on Sb-doped SnO_2 (ATO) nanoparticles. The IrO_2/ATO particulates were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD and XPS. The electrochemical properties were examined via cyclic voltammetry(CV), steady state polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy(EIS) and chronoamperometry(CA) measurements. In fact, it was found that the IrO_2/ATO synthesized with the novel method maintained an enhanced electrocatalytic activity and got a current density of 105 mA·cm~(-2) at 1.6 V. Its stability toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media was tested at 1.5 V, and the current density decaying rate was 1.687*10~(-2) (mA·cm~(-2))·h~(-1). To improve the loading of the catalysts, the current density toward OER was enhanced significantly, even if the current density of unit mass of Ir will decrease.			固态聚合物电解质(SPE)水电解是前景光明的氢能技术,但尚缺乏性能稳定的析氧电催化剂。研究了以氧化锡锑(ATO)为载体的IrO_2催化剂高效制备新方法。采用SEM、TEM、XRD以及XPS等手段表征和分析了所得催化剂的表面形貌、晶体结构以及表面元素组成。运用循环伏安、准稳态极化曲线、电化学交流阻抗谱以及计时电流法等电化学方法研究了催化剂材料的电化学催化析氧性能以及催化剂载量的影响。结果表明,新制备方法得到的IrO_2/ATO催化剂材料1.6 V时的析氧电流密度为105 mA·cm~(-2)。并且在酸性介质和1.5 V下催化剂的析氧电流密度衰减速率为1.687*10~(-2) (mA·cm~(-2))·h~(-1)。提高催化剂的载量使电极析氧反应表观电流密度显著增加,尽管单位质量Ir产生的电流会有所降低。						1	1	0	0	0	0	2			1004-9533			CSCD:5535234

Among the different alternatives, Ni single atoms supported on carbonaceous materials are an appealing catalytic solution due to the low cost and versatility of the support and the optimal usage of Ni and its predicted selectivity and efficiency (ca. 100% towards CO). Herein, we have used noble carbonaceous support derived from cytosine to load Ni subnanometric sites. The large heteroatom content of the support allows the stabilization of up to 11 wt% of Ni without the formation of nanoparticles through a simple impregnation plus calcination approach, where nickel promotes the stabilization of C3NOx frameworks and the oxidative support promotes a high oxidation state of nickel. EXAFS analysis points at nickel single atoms or subnanometric clusters coordinated by oxygen in the material surface. Unlike the wellknown N-coordinated Ni single sites selectivity towards CO2 reduction, O-coordinated-Ni single sites (ca. 7 wt% of Ni) reduced CO2 to CO, but subnanometric clusters (11 wt% of Ni) foster the unprecedented formation of HCOOH with 27% Faradaic efficiency at - 1.4 V. Larger Ni amounts ended up on the formation of NiO nanoparticles and almost 100% selectivity towards hydrogen evolution.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000793667600003

The carbon cycle and associated redox processes through time								PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				361	1470			931	950		10.1098/rstb.2006.1840				JUN 29 2006	2006	Earth's biogeochemical cycle of carbon delivers both limestones and organic materials to the crust. In numerous, biologically catalysed redox reactions, hydrogen, sulphur, iron, and oxygen serve prominently as electron donors and acceptors. The progress of these reactions can be reconstructed from records of variations in the abundance of C-13 in sedimentary carbonate minerals and organic materials. Because the crust is always receiving new CO2 from the mantle and a portion of it is being reduced by photoautotrophs, the carbon cycle has continuously released oxidizing power. Most of it is represented by Fe3+ that has accumulated in the crust or been returned to the mantle via subduction. Less than 3% of the estimated, integrated production of oxidizing power since 3.8 Gyr ago is represented by O-2 in the atmosphere and dissolved in seawater. The balance is represented by sulphate. The accumulation of oxidizing power can be estimated from budgets summarizing inputs of mantle carbon and rates of organic-carbon burial, but levels of O-2 are only weakly and indirectly coupled to those phenomena and thus to carbon-isotopic records. Elevated abundances of C-13 in carbonate minerals ca 2.3 Gyr old, in particular, are here interpreted as indicating the importance of methanogenic bacteria in sediments rather than increased burial of organic carbon.

In this work, a simple room-temperature sulfurization strategy is proposed to activate the inert Co-N/C sites on CNs for efficiently catalyzing the dye-sensitized photocatalytic HER. By simply immersing cobalt-doped CNs (Co-CNs) into aqueous solution with high-concentration S2-, the coordinated O atoms at Co-N/C sites are partially replaced by S atoms at room temperature, generating ample highly active S-coordinated Co-N/C sites with excellent dispersion preservation. The as-prepared S-Co-CNs catalysts exhibit enhanced activity in catalyzing the HER in an Erythrosin B-triethanolamine (ErB-TEOA) system under visible light irradiation, while both the pristine CNs and Co-CNs show negligible activity under the same reaction conditions. The most efficient S-Co-CNs catalyst achieves a H-2 evolution rate of 6.38 mmol h(-1) g(-1) and a quantum efficiency (QE) of 13.02% at 520 nm, and this S-Co-CNs catalyst shows excellent HER stability when sensitized with a more stable fluorescein (FL) dye. The enhanced catalytic performance originates from the favorable electronic structure of the active sites adjusted by S modulation, leading to reduced H-2 evolution overpotential while maintaining the favorable electron transfer kinetics. This work provides an effective strategy to activate inert sites embedded in CNs for high-performance photocatalytic water splitting, organic transformation, and CO2 reduction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000723358300001

Two dimenstional Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-67 (the following is abbreviated as 2D-ZIF 67) nanosheets were grown on the surface of silver nanowires using a bottom-up concentration-controlled method. Due to the inductive effect of the solvent, the nanosheets grow in the direction favorable for the OER catalytic reaction, so the material exhibits an overpotential of 250 mV in both alkaline aqueous solution and alkaline simulated seawater at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), not subject to CER competition. After in-situ electrochemical activation in alkaline simulated seawater, oxygen vacancies and reactive sites were generated on the surface of the composites by the synergistic effect of current and electrolyte. Under the same effect, AgCl@Co(OH)(2) heterogeneous interface were formed between the Ag nanowires and 2D-ZIF67 nanosheets. As a result, the OER catalytic performance was further improved, and the overpotential was only 222 mV in alkaline simulated seawater.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2365-6549			WOS:000808246600001

TaO(x)coat has been demonstrated to be amorphous and inhomogeneous. Nonetheless, an electrochemical test conducted showed that the amorphous TaOx/Ti coat has good catalytic performance for HER, the current reach to 0.1 mA/cm(2) with the over-potential at -0.245 V as compared to that for reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). X-ray near edge structure (XANES) plots revealed that the chemical state of Ta was between Ta(IV) and Ta(V). The coordination number of Ta-O was calculated by fitting the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) curves, whose results revealed distortion of the Ta-O structure in TaOx/Ti. Additionally, TaO8 was found in the prepared TaOx/Ti electrode. Calculation by density functional theory (DFT) ascribed such TaO8 presence in the Ta2O5 crystal structure after the doping of oxygen vacancy, which was consistent with the EXAFS fitting results.

The effect of rutile TiO2 on ozonation of sulfosalicylic acid was investigated. The results showed that rutile TiO2 had no negligible impact on the ozonation of sulfosalicylic acid but could improve the mineralization of ozonation. The rutile TiO2 catalytic ozonation had higher COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) removal rate by 15.6% than ozonation alone did after a treatment of 20 min. The evolution of oxalic acid concentration indicated that adding rutile TiO2 could improve the removals of oxalic acid-like compounds, thus enhancing the removal rate of COD. The result shows a practical significance for the ozonation of the acidic wastewater which contains aromatic compounds.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1006-4303			INSPEC:16325749

The phenomenon occurred in the steady-state time region of fluorescence induction kinetics under mild acidic conditions, and was eliminated by bicarbonate. Shortly after expression of low-waves, the photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate decreased and the non-photochemical chlorophyll fluorescence quenching component increased. The enhancement of the non-photochemical chlorophyll fluorescence quenching component was nigericin-sensitive indicating its dependence on the transthylakoid proton gradient. On the other hand, the formation of low-waves was not removed by the uncoupler. Only when bicarbonate was applied additionally, the reversible short-term decrease in fluorescence yield following each saturating light flash was abolished. Dimethyl-4-nitroso-aniline as an artificial electron acceptor of Photosystem I did not limit the brief drops in fluorescence. However, formate as a competitive inhibitor of bicarbonate binding in Photosystem II induced low-wave formation. Therefore, our results suggest that low-waves in chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics indicate deprivation of bicarbonate in the reaction centre of Photosystem II.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000177588000004	16228524

Herein, BiOBrxI1-x solid solutions having tunable band structures with multiple defects of oxygen vacancies (OVs), Bi5+ and Bi(3-x)+ have been successfully synthesized by varying the Br/I molar ratios via a simple method at room temperature. Based on the results of the XPS analysis, Bi5+, Bi(3-x)+ and OVs exist on the surface of the samples, which can influence their band structures and further improve the photocatalytic activity for rhodamine B under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm). Furthermore, the locations of the conduction bands (CB) and valence bands (VB) of the samples are investigated by an electrochemical method. It is found that the CB and VB positions of the samples significantly shift up with the decrease in the Br/I molar ratio. The findings of this study not only provide a new insight into the role of defects but also open up a new way for band structure engineering for promoting photocatalytic activity.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			1466-8033			WOS:000437186400004

Indeed, synthesizing very pure activated carbon (> 99% carbon) using organic precursors containing only carbon and oxygen as hetero atoms to form a polymeric resin by pyrolysis. The proposed synthesis reaction is in the border of two sciences: the Sol-gel and polymerization. The polymerization by mechanism followed by the initiation and propagation, the sol-gel by evolution of the media environment starting with a solution of various ingredients to have the particle's sol in the emulsion solvent.The sol turns into a gel which is the result of three-dimensional crosslinking of the material trapping the solvent.In this work we propose to introduce a new method of synthesis of these nanoxerogels by polycondensation of resorcinol with formaldehyde in two different media (water and acetone) in the presence of two catalysts (acetic acid and sodium carbonate). By varying the following parameters: solvent, nature and quantity of catalyst, 16 samples were obtained. By the method of factorial design (2(k)): an optimization is realized by following three characteristics of nanoxerogels prepared: the density, the gel time and performance. The results indicate the best conditions for the synthesis of a carbon nanoxerogel: the lowest quantity of acid catalyst in aqueous media (A5).

Two low loading (LL) and high loading (HL) samples were prepared by ion exchange, and their methanol productivity measured in laboratory fixed bed reactor tests, resulting in selectivity higher than 85%. Both Cu-MOR samples outperformed Cu-CHA ones, resulting in 0.28 and 0.26 molCH(3)OH/molCu for the LL (Cu/Al = 0.13) and HL (Cu/Al = 0.36) samples, vs 0.10 and 0.17 molCH(3)OH/molCu for LL and HL Cu-CHA, respectively (Cu/Al = 0.16 and 0.49). The evolution of Cu oxidation state and local coordination environment was followed in all the reaction steps (O-2 activation, flush with He, CH4 dosage and subsequent CH3OH desorption by applying a wet stream) both during temperature changes (ramp in O-2 up to 500 degrees C, cooling to 200 degrees C for subsequent steps, etc.) and in steady-state conditions. Strong similarities were observed in the local structure of Cu sites in all samples, which showed similar redox dynamics during O-2 activation and subsequent cooling to 200 degrees C.

The development of such catalysts, free from precious group metals and capable of decreasing overpotentials in fuel cells, metal-air batteries, and water electrolyzers, also requires stable supporting and conducting substrates in order to deposit low metal oxide loadings. This challenging approach led us to prepare Co3O4 materials on graphene-based composites more stable than common used Vulcan carbon. Co3O4 particles synthesized from a solvothermal method were thereby deposited onto reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and N-doped reduced graphene oxide (NRGO) prepared from the Hummers method. The structural properties and surface composition of the different materials characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray induced photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were combined to cyclic voltammetry experiments for revealing the charge transfer from cobalt to nitrogen, which greatly affects the charge acceptance of the surface Co atoms. Electrochemical measurements provided sound evidence of active and stable Co3O4 catalysts toward the ORR and OER.									117	6	0	0	4	0	121			1932-7447			WOS:000374811100006

The formation of these species is a consequence of the occurrence of essential biochemical reactions that are normally balanced due to the existance of antioxidant mechanisms. The oxidative stress is produced by an unbalance between these processes that lead to the accumulation of prooxidants. That’s why many diseases have been connected with the oxidative stress.

The efficiency of different compounds in photoactivation correlated with the rate of linear electron transport in the presence of these compounds. The organic ligands, associated with the manganese ions, do not prevent the photoactivation of the water splitting complex (WOC). Photoactivation with different manganese complexes depended on the number of the Mn-ions in the complex, their valence state and the nature of their donor atoms. The most efficient restorations were achieved by using tetrameric complexes having a dimer+dimer structure, complexes containing Mn(H) ions, and having 4-6 oxygen and 0-2 nitrogen atoms as donor atoms. Further, the effectiveness of photoactivation depended largely on the structure of the complexes. Our data support the notion that WOC in intact thylakoids. requires the cooperation and well determined arrangement of all four manganese ions, and argue against the hypothesis that two manganese ions are sufficient for water splitting. Photoactivation by some complexes led to anomalous flash-oxygen patterns, which are explained by a modified/perturbed water splitting complex.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0939-5075			WOS:000172323400014	11724380	
J	Renger, G								Coupling of electron and proton transfer in oxidative water cleavage in photosynthesis								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOENERGETICS				1655	1-3			195	204		10.1016/j.bbabio.2003.07.007				APR 12 2004	2004	This minireview addresses questions on the mechanism of oxidative water cleavage with special emphasis on the coupling of electron (ET) and proton transfer (PT) of each individual redox step of the reaction sequence and on the mode of O-O bond formation. The following topics are discussed: (1) the multiphasic kinetics of Y-Z(ox) formation by P680(+..) originate from three different types of rate limitations: (i) nonadiabatic electron transfer for the "fast" ns reaction, (ii) local "dielectric" relaxation for the "slow" ns reaction, and (iii) "large-scale" proton shift for the mus kinetics; (2) the ET/PT-coupling mode of the individual redox transitions within the water oxidizing complex (WOC) driven by Y-Z(ox) is assumed to depend on the redox state S-i: the oxidation steps of S-0 and S-1 comprise separate ET and PT pathways while those of S-2 and S-3 take place via proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) analogous to Jerry Babcock's hydrogen atom abstractor model [Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1458 (2000) 199]; (3) S-3 is postulated to be a multistate redox level of the WOC with fast dynamic equilibria of both redox isomerism and proton tautomerism. The primary event in the essential O-O bond formation is the population of a state S-3(P) characterized by an electronic configuration and nuclear geometry that corresponds with a complexed hydrogen peroxide; (4) the peroxidic type S-3(P) is the entatic state for formation of complexed molecular oxygen through S-3 oxidation by Y-Z(ox) and (5) the protein matrix itself is proposed to exert catalytic activity by functioning as "PCET director". The WOC is envisaged as a supermolecule that is especially tailored for oxidative water cleavage and acts as a molecular machine. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Because these catalysts operate in aqueous buffer solutions at neutral to slightly basic pH, it is important to consider whether electrolytic cells can have low series loss under these conditions. Water-splitting or fuel-forming PECs will likely require porous separators or electrolyte membranes to separate the cathode products from oxygen produced at the anode. For this reason we analyze the individual potential losses in electrolytic systems of buffer solutions and commercially available anion-and cation-exchange membranes. Potentiometric analysis and pH measurements were employed to measure the potential losses associated with solution resistance, membrane resistance, and pH gradient formation at the current density (25 mA cm(-2)) expected for efficient PECs. The membrane pH gradient is the most problematic source of loss in these systems, but monoprotic buffers can minimize the pH gradient by diffusion of the neutral acidic or basic form of the buffer across the membrane. These results suggest that water-splitting PECs can be viable with properly chosen membrane-buffer combinations.									161	3	0	0	15	0	163			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000304354900030

Herein, we report a direct chemical synthesis of atomically thick Ni(OH)(2)-NMs by a NaBH4 assisted cyanogel hydrolysis method, which overcomes the shortcoming of the post-etching method for NM synthesis. Various physical characterization methods show that the as-synthesized Ni(OH)(2)-NMs have 1.7 nm thickness, a big surface area, abundant nanoholes, and numerous surface/edge atoms with low-coordination numbers. The as-synthesized Ni(OH)(2)-NMs show a better electrocatalytic performance for the urea oxidation reaction than conventional Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles without holes in the alkaline electrolyte, including a lower onset oxidation potential, faster reaction kinetics, and higher mass activity.									63	3	0	0	4	0	64			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000460162900025	30569934

In this work, 1, 10-phenanthroline monohydrate (PM) functionalized Pt nanodendrites (Pt-NDs) on carbon cloth (CC) (denoted as PM@Pt-NDs/CC) and polyethylenimine (PEI) functionalized Pt-NDs on CC (denoted as PEI@Pt-NDs/CC) are successfully achieved by immersing Pt-NDs/CC into PM and PEI aqueous solutions, respectively. PEI functionalization of Pt-NDs/CC improves its electroactivity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to local proton enrichment whereas PM functionalization of Pt-NDs/CC improves its electroactivity for formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) by facilitating dehydrogenation pathway. With such high activity, a two-electrode electrolyzer is assembled using PM@Pt-NDs/CC as the anodic electrocatalyst and PEI@Pt-NDs/CC as the cathodic electrocatalyst for electrochemical reforming of formic acid, which only requires 0.45 V voltage to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-1) for highpurity hydrogen production, much lower than conventional water electrolysis (1.59 V). The work presents an example of interfacial engineering enhancing electrocatalytic activity and indicates that electrochemical reforming of formic acid is an energy-saving electrochemical method for high-purity hydrogen production.

In parallel to the search for high catalytic performance, many works have focused on the mechanistic analysis of the process. In this perspective, the oxidation of water through light-assisted cycles composed of an electron acceptor (EA), a photosensitizer (PS), and a water oxidation catalyst (WOC) can provide insightful and complementary information with respect to the use of chemical oxidants or to electrochemical techniques. In this minireview, we discuss the mechanistic aspects of the EA/PS/WOC photoactivated cycles, and in particular: (i) the general elementary steps; (ii) the required features and the nature of the PS employed; (iii) the electron transfer processes and kinetics from the WOC to PS+ (hole scavenging); (iv) the detrimental quenching of the PS by the WOC and the alternative mechanistic routes; (v) the identification of WOC intermediates and, finally, (vi) the transposition of the above processes into a dye-sensitized photoanode embedding a WOC.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000466518100005

These losses have been attributed to sluggish charge transport within the solid lithium peroxide (Li2O2) discharge phase. Recent experiments have shown that use of Co3O4-containing Li/O-2 electrodes enhances rechargeability, but the mechanism responsible for this effect is unclear, as are the general prospects for the promotion of the Li/O-2 OER. Here first-principles calculations are combined with continuum-scale transport theory to build a multiscale model which demonstrates that the incorporation of trace Co into Li2O2 is a plausible mechanism for OER promotion. These calculations suggest that doping at equilibrium levels (tens of ppm) can enhance charge transport by shifting the balance of Li-ion vacancies and hole polarons. This mechanism could rationalize the improved rechargeability observed in Li/O-2 electrodes containing Co. On the basis of a computational assessment of 22 additional dopants, we speculate that Ni may also be an effective OER promoter.									69	0	0	0	4	0	69			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000349934500021

Thus, accurate predictions of radiation damage evolution require knowing the atomic scale mechanisms associated with those defects. Atomistic simulations are a key tool in providing insight into the types of mechanisms possible. Further, by extending the time scale beyond what is achievable with conventional molecular dynamics, even greater insight can be obtained. Here, we provide examples in which such simulations have revealed new kinetic mechanisms that were not obvious before performing the simulations. We also demonstrate, through the coupling with higher level models, how those mechanisms impact experimental observables in irradiated materials. Finally, we discuss the importance of these types of simulations in the context of predicting material behavior. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, Mn and Si have been combined in a Fe-Mn-Si-C master alloy powder in order to reduce their chemical activity and prevent oxidation during the heating stage of the sintering process. However, when this master alloy powder is mixed with an iron base powder, differences in chemical activity between both components can lead to an oxygen transfer from the iron base powder to the surface of the master alloy particles. The present research is focused on studying the evolution of the master alloy particle surface during the early stages of sintering. Surface characterization by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) shows that the master alloy powder surface is mostly covered by a thin easily reducible iron oxide layer (similar to 1 nm). Mn-Si particulate oxides are found as inclusions in specific areas of the surface. Evolution of oxides during sintering was studied on green compacts containing iron powder, graphite and Fe-Mn-Si-C master alloy powder that were heat treated in vacuum (10(-6) mbar) at different temperatures (from 400, 600, 800 to 1000 degrees C) and analyzed by means of XPS. Vacuum sintering provides the necessary conditions to remove manganese and silicon oxides from the powder surface in the range of temperatures between 600 degrees C and 1000 degrees C. When sintering in vacuum, since the gaseous products from reduction processes are continuously eliminated, oxidation of master alloy particles due to oxygen transfer through the atmosphere is minimized.

H-4[PNbMo11O40] (.) 13 H2O exhibits a long-range order structure similar to that of H-3[PMo12O40] (.) 13 H2O. The structural evolution of H-4[PNbMo11O40] (.) 13 H2O was studied under reducing (propene) and partial oxidation reaction conditions (propene and oxygen) by in situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy combined with mass spectrometry and corroborated by thermogravimetric analysis. Following the loss of crystal water in the temperature range from 373 K to 573 K, a partial decomposition and reduction of the molybdenum and the formation of a characteristic cubic HPOM is observed at 573 K, similar to the structural evolution of H-3[PMo12O40] (.) 13 H2O and H-4[PVMo11O40]. 13 H2O during treatment in propene. However, in contrast to H-3[PMo12O40] (.) 13 H2O and H-4[PVMo11O40] (.) 13 H2O, the cubic HPOM decomposes rapidly and the MoO3 formed is subsequently reduced to MoO2. Nb centers in the Keggin ion considerably destabilize the HPOM and accelerate the decomposition towards MoO3. A similar structural evolution is observed under propene and oxygen. The formation of the cubic HPOM with Mo centers on extra-Keggin framework positions coincides with the onset of catalytic activity. However, at about 673 K the active phase further decomposes to a mixture Of MoO3 and a more stable cubic HPOM resulting in a pronounced decrease of the catalytic activity. Evidently, preparation and structure-activity relationships for Nb containing mixed metal oxide catalysts need to take into account the particular structure directing properties of Nb during thermal activation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0044-2968			WOS:000227644200033

In2S3 and Bi2S3 nanosheets grow on the outer surface of oxygen-doped MoS2 spheres, and the tight interface between the spheres could ensure stable electron transfer. MoS2 with oxygen defects could inhibit the recombination of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. The unique core-shell structure increases the interface area and provides adequate surface reactive sites for the reactants. The resultant MoS2@In2S3/Bi2S3 shows broad-spectrum response and excellent photothermal effect, which is beneficial to trigger the near-field temperature rise and promote the photocatalytic process. The MoS2@In2S3/Bi2S3 exhibits excellent photo-catalytic H-2 evolution rate of 973.42 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), and the degradation efficiency of tetracycline within 90 min is 99.6%, which is ~ 10 times higher than that of pristine MoS2. It can be ascribed to the unique core-shell dual Z-scheme tandem heterojunction structure facilitates the transfer and spatial separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and greatly prolongs the carrier lifetime. In addition, the long-term stability indicates the potential applications due to the core-shell dual Z-scheme tandem structure inhibiting the photocorrosion of sulfides.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000785062000002

Herein, a self-supported H-2 evolution cathode based on pomelo peel (PP)-derived porous carbon (PPDC) membrane with embedded Co nanoparticles (Co@PPDC) is developed by direct carbonization of Co-adsorbed PP (Co2+ -PP). Benefiting from the large surface areas, the abundant open and interconnected pores, the highly graphitic PPDC membrane, and the highly dispersed Co nanoparticles, the self-supported Co@PPDC electrode demonstrates superior electrocatalytic performance for HER in 1.0 M KOH solution, with overpotentials of 154 and 264 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) , respectively. In addition, owing to the good structural integrity, the Co@PPDC electrode exhibits an excellent cycling stability for 2000 cycles and a stable current density of similar to 100 mA cm(-2) at a constant overpotential of 265 mV over 12 h with a nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency (FE) and H-2 production rate of 1.56 mmol h(-1) . Therefore, this work provides a versatile and effective strategy for development of high-performance self-supported electrodes at low cost for large-scale H-2 production from electrochemical water splitting.

Illumination of PSII particles in the presence of Cyt led to: (1) Cyt photooxidation by PSII reaction center (demonstrated at the first time), (2) Cyt photoreduction via O-2(-center dot) photoproduced on the acceptor side of PSII, and (3) Cyt photoreduction by reduced electron carriers of PSII. A step-by-step removal of components of water-oxidizing complex was accompanied by the appearance of Cyt photooxidation, an increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD)-dependent Cyt photoreduction (related to O-2(-center dot) formation), and a decrease in the SOD-independent Cyt photoreduction. Re-addition of PsbO protein diminished the Cyt-induced restoration of electron transfer in PSII. Addition of diuron led to inhibition of these photoprocesses, while exogenous Mn2+ inhibited only the Cyt c photooxidation. The results can be important for correct measurements of O-2(-center dot) photoproduction in PSII and for elucidation of the role of cytochrome c(550) in cyanobacterial PSII.									4	0	1	0	3	0	5			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000430309200023

In this way, the build up of the energy flow follows a bootstrapping process similar to that found in the development of computers, the first generation making possible the calculations necessary for constructing the second one, etc. In the biogenetic upstart of an energy flow, non-metals in the lower periods of the Periodic Table of Elements would have constituted the most primitive systems, their operation being enhanced and later supplanted by elements in the higher periods that demand more energy. This bootstrapping process would put the development of the metabolisms based on the second period elements carbon, nitrogen and oxygen at the end of the evolutionary process rather than at, or even before, the biogenetic event.									13	0	1	0	4	0	13			0001-5342	1572-8358		WOS:000251009100004	17960483

Transition-metal phosphide based heterostructures are very promising in enhancing HER performance but the facile fabrication and an in-depth study of the catalytic mechanisms still remain a challenge. In this work, the catalytically inactive n-type CeOx is successfully combined with p type CoP to form the CoP/CeOx heterojunction. The crystalline- amorphous CoP/CeOx heterojunction is fabricated by the phosphorization of predesigned Co(OH)2/CeOx via the as developed reduction-hydrolysis strategy. The p-n CoP/CeOx heterojunction with a strong built-in potential of 1.38 V enables the regulation of the electronic structure of active CoP within the space-charge region to enhance its intrinsic activity and facilitate the electron transfer. The functional CeOx entity and the negatively charged CoP can promote the water dissociation and optimize H adsorption, synergistically boosting the electrocatalytic HER output. As expected, the heterostructured CoP/CeOx-20:1 with the optimal ratio of Co/Ce shows significantly improved HER activity and favorable kinetics (overpotential of 118 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and Tafel slope of 77.26 mV dec-1). The present study may provide new insight into the integration of crystalline and amorphous entities into the p-n heterojunction as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for energy storage and conversion.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000829217100001	35820021

MXene exhibits both the metallic conductivity and the hydrophilic nature due to its metal layer structure and hydroxyl or oxygen terminated surfaces. This review provides an overview of the MXene used in the electrolytes and electrodes for the fuel cells and water splitting. MXene with functional groups termination could construct ion channels that significantly benefit ion conductivity through the electrolyte. The metal supported by MXene interaction offers electronic, compositional, and geometric effects that could enhance the catalytic activity and stability. MXene has already shown promising performance for fuel cells and water electrolysis. Herein, the etching and intercalation methods of MXene in recent years are summarized. The applications of MXene for fuel cells electrolyte, catalyst and water splitting catalyst are revealed to provide a more brief idea for MXene used as new energy materials.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1573-4137	1875-6786		WOS:000634848700002

One possibility to aid in compliance is through the use of torrefied biomass as a replacement or supplement for traditional fossil coal. To obtain a continuous understanding of the changes to biomass as it is torrefied, a three-stage chemical reaction model with intrinsic rate coefficients was used. This gas/vapor phase model predicts the evolution of primary torrefaction products and was further used to predict changes in elemental composition and energy content of torrefied biomass. From the model, over the typical torrefaction region (up to similar to 25-30% mass loss), the relative amount of carbon increased by approximately 9%, the oxygen decreased approximately 10%, and the hydrogen content was relatively unchanged. The material retained 90% of the original available energy, and the higher heating value increased by 22.5% from 19.1 to 23.4 MJ/kg. These properties were modeled as a function of mass loss and correspond well to values measured by others for woody feedstock (root mean squared error of 2.0% for carbon, 0.43% for hydrogen, and 2.8% for oxygen).									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000348094100021

More recently lumenal proteins have been revealed to play roles in numerous processes, most often linked with regulating thylakoid biogenesis and the activity and turnover of photosynthetic protein complexes, especially the photosystem II and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase-like complexes. Still, the functions of the majority of lumenal proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana are unknown. Interestingly, while the thylakoid lumen proteome of at least 80 proteins contains several large protein families, individual members of many protein families have highly divergent roles. This is indicative of evolutionary pressure leading to neofunctionalization of lumenal proteins, emphasizing the important role of the thylakoid lumen for photosynthetic electron transfer and ultimately for plant fitness. Furthermore, the involvement of anterograde and retrograde signaling networks that regulate the expression and activity of lumen proteins is increasingly pertinent. Recent studies have also highlighted the importance of thiol/disulfide modulation in controlling the functions of many lumenal proteins and photosynthetic regulation pathways.									61	3	0	0	54	1	64			1664-462X			WOS:000331441000001	24198822	
J	Manna, P; Vermaas, W								Mutational studies on conserved histidine residues in the chlorophyll-binding protein CP43 of photosystem II								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY				247	2			666	672		10.1111/j.1432-1033.1997.00666.x				JUL 15 1997	1997	Two chlorophyll-binding antenna proteins in the photosystem II core, CP43 and CP47, are structurally similar and are thought to have evolved from a common ancestor. Several conserved histidine residues in hydrophobic regions of CP47 have been shown to be important for photosystem IT structure, function, and energy transfer. The purpose of this study was to determine whether similarly located histidine residues in CP43 function in a similar way. Three conserved histidine residues in presumed membrane-spanning regions of CP43, His40, His105, and His119, were mutated to glutamine (Q) and tyrosine (Y). The strains H105Q. H119Q, and H119Y were photoautotrophs whereas H40Q, H40Y, and H105Y were obligate photoheterotrophs. The H40Y and H105Y strains lacked detectable amounts of photosystem II reaction centers and hence could not evolve oxygen whereas H40Q retained a significant amount of photosystem II and oxygen evolution capacity. The observation that mutation of histidine residues to tyrosine has more drastic effects than mutation of these residues to glutamine is in agreement with results obtained for CP47 and suggests the involvement of these residues in chlorophyll binding. The drastic functional changes observed upon mutating His40 and His105 of CP43 are similar to those observed when mutating the corresponding histidine residues in CP47, thus suggesting that the similarity between CP43 and CP47 extends to the relative importance of functionally relevant residues. Interestingly, the His40-->Gln mutation in CP43 had significant effects on photosystem II electron transfer in that it affected the thermodynamics of Q(A)(-) oxidation by Q(B) and increased the charge recombination rate between Q(A)(-) and donor side components. This indicates that relatively miner changes in CP43 can significantly impact the properties of the photosystem II reaction center. The implications of this finding an discussed.									16	0	0	0	13	0	16			0014-2956			WOS:A1997XM61300027	9266711	
J	Gamble, L; Jung, LS; Campbell, CT								Decomposition and protonation of surface ethoxys on TiO2(110)								SURFACE SCIENCE				348	1-2			1	16		10.1016/0039-6028(95)00942-6				MAR 1 1996	1996	The decomposition and protonation of surface ethoxy groups on TiO2(110) has been studied as a function of surface hydroxyl or water coverage by TPD and XPS. Surface ethoxys were produced by dissociative adsorption of deuterated ethanol (EtOD), as well as tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). The effects of both preadsorption and post-adsorption of water (and hydroxyls) on the thermal reactions of these ethoxys are studied. Two different types of adsorbed ethoxy species are identified: (1) ethoxys which can readily be removed by combination with surface hydroxyl groups to desorb as ethanol gas from similar to 250 to 400 K, and (2) ethoxys which cannot react with surface water or hydroxyls below similar to 450 K in TPD, even when recooled, dosed with hydroxyls again and reheated. The first type is attributed to ethoxy groups bound to surface Ti atoms (Ti-OEt), protonated with a proton from a hydroxyl group formed by a ''bridging oxygen'' atom of the surface lattice, O-br. The second type is attributed to ethoxy groups bound at ''bridging oxygen'' vacancies in the surface lattice, O-br-Et. Such vacancies are formed when water is produced from two O-br-H species. The O-br-Et groups are removed at similar to 650 K by decomposition, giving ethylene and ethanol in a 1:1 ratio. Product yields and a temperature shift found when using CD3CH2OH prove that this decomposition is initiated by beta-hydride elimination. Ethylene evolution is, however, not concerted with beta-hydrogen elimination. The Ti-OEt species also follows this path if insufficient hydroxyls are present to allow its full removal below 400 K. Migration of ethoxy and hydroxyl species between Ti4+ sites and surface oxygen vacancies is postulated to explain quantitative yields. Experiments on sputtered TiO2 support this model.									139	3	0	0	4	0	140			0039-6028			WOS:A1996TY77700003

Recent studies have demonstrated that slight surface oxidation of nitrides can boost their catalytic activity, especially towards hydrogen adsorption. In this study, we have considered VN as a simple model nitride to simulate H adsorption on pure and oxygen polluted surfaces. First, we have evaluated the physical characteristics and stability of various facets. Diversity in the VN catalytic activity can originate from a variety of surface characteristics. Our calculations reveal the (112) and (200) surfaces as the most stable ones, while the (101), (111), and (113) surfaces are roughly in the same range of energy. The facet-dependent activity of VN toward H adsorption is then carefully discussed. A low level of oxygen contamination appears to make the VN hydrogen adsorption robust and beyond that, a thin oxide surface layer can act as an activation layer, playing a positive role in improving the catalytic performance. We anticipate this picture to be an important input for designing enhanced nitride-based catalysts with controlled oxidation of surfaces.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2633-5409		WOS:000641263900001

This effect causes mechanical instability in Li-ion batteries and solid oxide fuel cells. Nevertheless, it can generate considerable force and deformation, making it attractive for mechanical actuation. Here a Si-compatible ECM actuator in the form of a 2 mm diameter membrane is demonstrated. Actuation results from oxygen ion transfer between two 0.1 mu m thick Ti oxide\Ce(0.8)Gd(0.2)O(1.9)nanocomposite layers separated by a 1.5 mu m thick Ce(0.8)Gd(0.2)O(1.9)solid electrolyte. The chemical reaction responsible for stress generation is electrochemical oxidation/reduction in the composites. Under ambient conditions, application of 5 V DC produces actuator response within seconds, generating vertical displacement of several mu m with calculated stress approximate to 3.5 MPa. The membrane actuator preserves its final mechanical state for more than 1 h following voltage removal. These characteristics uniquely suit ECM actuators for room temperature applications in Si-integrated microelectromechanical systems.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000575805500001

These inorganic-organic hybrids have gathered much attention because of their unique properties such as high surface area, vast structural diversity, pore surface characteristics, modifiable framework morphology and semiconductor nature. The synergistic effect provided by the customisable building blocks of MOFs has made them ideal candidates for designing versatile photocatalysts with superior performance. Hence, it becomes vital to present a glance of the recent breakthroughs in the development of various MOF-based photocatalysts to improve the pullbacks in this research area. This review gives an overall picture of the diverse range of MOF-based photocatalysts. The strategies that have been adopted to boost their photocatalytic activity such as post-synthetic modification (PSM), heterojunction designing, doping, introduction of co catalysts, ligand or substituent functionalization, modulation of metal-oxidation state and bandgap engineering also been explained. Further, the review focuses on the early research developments, structural diversity, synthesis methods, cleaner production and the recent developments in MOF-based photocatalysts for various photocatalytic applications including hydrogen production, CO2 conversion, photodegradation, photo electrochemical reaction (PEC), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and fabrication of MOF-derived compounds.

Recent studies have suggested the stability of MoS2 is questionable when exposed to oxidizing conditions found in water and air. In this study, the aqueous stability of 2H- and 1T-MoS2 and 2H-MoS2 protected with a carbon shell was evaluated in the presence of model oxidants (O-2, NO2-, BrO3-). The MoS2 electrocatalytic performance and stability was characterized using linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometry. In the presence of dissolved oxygen (DO) only, 2H- and 1T-MoS2 were relatively stable, with SO42- formation of only 2.5% and 3.1%, respectively. The presence of NO2- resulted in drastically different results, with SO42- formations of 11% and 14% for 2H- and 1T-MoS2, respectively. When NO2- was present without DO, the 2H- and 1T-MoS2 remained relatively stable with SO42- formations of only 4.2% and 3.3%, respectively. Similar results were observed when BrO3- was used as an oxidant. Collectively, these results indicate that the oxidation of 2H- and 1T-MoS2 can be severe in the presence of these aqueous oxidants but that DO is also required. To investigate the ability of a capping agent to protect the MoS2 from oxidation, a carbon shell was added to 2H-MoS2. In a batch suspension in the presence of DO and NO2-, the 2H-MoS2 with the carbon shell exhibited good stability with no oxidation observed. The activity of 2H-MoS2 electrodes was then evaluated for the hydrogen evolution reaction by a Tafel analysis. The carbon shell improved the activity of 2H-MoS2 with a decrease in the Tafel slope from 451 to 371 mV dec(-1). The electrode stability, characterized by chronopotentiometry, was also enhanced for the 2H-MoS2 coated with a carbon shell, with no marked degradation in current density observed over the reaction period. Because of the instability exhibited by unprotected MoS2, it will only be a useful catalyst if measures are taken to protect the surface from oxidation. Further, given the propensity of MoS2 to undergo oxidation in aqueous solutions, caution should be used when describing it as a true catalyst for reduction reactions (e.g., H-2 evolution), unless proven otherwise.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4				2046-2069		WOS:000519611200016	35497240

Here, we implement a new concept of plasma-enabled simultaneous N-P heteroatom doping to achieve the high-lycompetitive activity and stability of trimetallic Ni-V-Fe bi-functional electrocatalysts on a NiFe foam (N-NiVFeP/NFF), evidenced by the lower overpotentials for HER (79 mV) and OER (229 mV) to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (j(10)) in the 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Meanwhile, the N-NiVFeP/NFF exhibits ultra-stable performances with a current density from 10 to 100 mA cm(-2) for over 100 h. Specifically, the HER and OER performances are near to those of noble-metal based electrocatalysts in the high current density region (> j(200)) attributing to the rich active sites exposed on the formed heterointerfaces among Ni-V-Fe phospho-nitrides, the changed electronic structure, and increased conductivity with nitrogen doping.									40	2	0	0	3	0	41			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000521513300074

In general, dissolution of metal oxides is a slow and inefficient chemical reaction. Here, by introducing oxygen deficiencies to modify the surface chemistry of oxides, we can boost the dissolution kinetics of metal oxides in water, as in situ demonstrated in a liquid environmental transmission electron microscope (LETEM). The dissolution rate constant significantly increases by 16-19 orders of magnitude, equivalent to a reduction of 0.97-1.11 eV in activation energy, as compared with the normal dissolution in acid. It is evidenced from the high-resolution TEM imaging, electron energy loss spectra, and first-principle calculations where the dissolution route of metal oxides is dynamically changed by local interoperability between altered water chemistry and surface oxygen deficiencies via electron radiolysis. This discovery inspires the development of a highly efficient electron lithography method for metal oxide films in ecofriendly water, which offers an advanced technique for nanodevice fabrication.									32	6	0	0	7	0	34			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000408520900051	28738154

Since then, both experimental and theoretical studies have converged in showing that further decreasing the size of gold nano particles (Au NPs) would lead to non-assisted gold catalysis. This opens up new perspectives in the choice of the gold dispersant and in the development of more efficient, sustainable, viable gold catalysis. However, given the low melting point of gold, stabilizing such small Au NPs remains challenging. This article reviews the way in which gold catalyst preparation, i.e., synthetic strategies to tackle and address the size challenge in bottom-up chemical methods, has evolved as the understanding of the mechanism of the gold catalyzed oxidation of CO has progressed.

However, the inherent disadvantages of Li2MnO3 make these materials suffer from drawbacks such as fast energy-density decay, poor rate performance and safety hazard. In this paper, we propose to replace Li2MnO3 with Li2MoO3 for constructing novel Li-rich cathode materials and evaluate its feasibility. Comprehensive studies by X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and spherical-aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy clarify its lithium extraction/insertion mechanism and shows that the Mo4+/Mo6+ redox couple in Li2MoO3 can accomplish the task of charge compensation upon Li removal. Other properties of Li2MoO3 such as the nearly reversible Mo-ion migration to/from the Li vacancies, absence of oxygen evolution, and reversible phase transition during initial (de)lithiation indicate that Li2MoO3 meets the requirements to an ideal replacement of Li2MnO3 in constructing Li2MoO3-based Li-rich cathode materials with superior performances.									94	5	0	0	4	0	96			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000336637000030

The high-alkaline granites consist of quartz alkaline feldspar syenite, alkaline feldspar granite, quartz monzonite porphyry, alkaline feldspar syenite,etc, Based on the petrographic observation, whole-rock analysis and electronic probe analysis,it is showed that mineral assemblage of high-alkali granites is characterized by alkali feldspar,quartz, arfvedsonite and aegirine-augite. They display high Si, K＋Na, Fe and Mn and low Al, Ca, Mg and H_2O. Crystallization temperatures of the high-alkali granites are estimated between 650℃～755℃ and their oxygen fugacity is in the range of 10~(-17.17) pa～10~(-14.29) Pa on the light of ilmenite-magnetite thermometer. Combining with the feature of arfvedsonite, it can be inferred that water-rock reactions occurred during the late evolution processes of alkaline magma obviously, which suggests that the Zaheba oxygen fugacity,middle-high temperatures, high-alkali granites formed under low pressure, high and in an open magma system near the surface.			新疆东准噶尔北部扎河坝富碱花岗质岩石分布于乌伦古大断裂与额尔齐斯-玛因鄂博大断裂之间。富碱花岗岩类有石英碱性正长岩、碱性长石花岗岩、石英二长斑岩及碱性长石正长岩等岩石类型。在详细的显微镜观察基础上,全岩分析和电子探针分析结果表明,富碱花岗质岩中的矿物组合是碱性长石＋石英＋钠铁闪石＋霓辉石,以出现高硅、富碱、贫铝、低钙、低镁、高铁、高锰、贫水为特征。铁钛氧化物温度计估算出的富碱花岗岩体结晶温度在650℃～755℃之间,氧逸度为10~(-17.17) Pa～10~(-14.39) Pa,结合钠铁闪石的特征,碱性岩浆演化后期存在着明显的水-岩作用,扎河坝富碱花岗质岩石形成于低压、高氧逸度、中高温环境,反映了相对开放、浅成的形成环境。						1	3	0		0	0	3			1001-6872			CSCD:3110892

In this regard, the gradient distribution of oxygen vacancies in n-type metal oxides produces the ideal band structure for minimizing e(-)/h(+) recombination by efficient hole extraction; however, its achievement remains a daunting challenge. Here, a photoelectrochemical (PEC)-driven "self-purification" process is suggested, which can effectively generate a gradient distribution of oxygen vacancies in the thickness range of approximate to 9.5 nm. As a result, a charge transport efficiency of >95% can be achieved by efficient hole migration from the photoanode to the electrolyte. This unique protocol is expected to provide an advanced metal oxide photocatalyst and photoelectrochemical electrode that exhibit superior photocatalytic performance with enhanced charge separation.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000756673300012

Interactions of hadrons younger than their formation time are attenuated with respect to their normal values (transparency of hadronic matter for newly formed hadrons). The system of secondary hadrons produced in a heavy-ion collision thus expands as a gas of almost non interacting particles before hadrons reach their formation time. Densities of interacting hadronic matter produced in oxygen-lead and sulphur-lead collisions at 200 GeV/nucleon are estimated as a function of the formation time of hadrons. Uncertainties in our knowledge of the critical temperature T-c and of the Formation time of hadrons tau(0) permit at present three scenarios: an optimistic one (QGP has already been produced in collisions of oxygen and sulphur with heavy ions and will be copiously produced in Lead collisions), a pessimistic one (QGP cannot be produced al 300 GeV/nucleon) and an intermediate one (QGP has not been produced in oxygen and sulphur interactions with heavy ions and will be at best produced only marginally in Pb-coliisions). We find the last opinion as most probable.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0170-9739			WOS:A1995RT48700010

In this study, low-temperature deoxidization of cellulose was performed at various temperatures (200, 230, 260, 290, 320, 350 and 390 degrees C), and then the solid products were used for pyrolysis experiments in the pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The evolution of functional groups during low-temperature deoxidization was analyzed using two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy, which allowed a number of formation mechanisms to be proposed for typical products and demonstrated that the main deoxidization temperature range corresponded to 290-320 degrees C. Notably, low-temperature deoxidization of cellulose was shown to involve the initial breakage of infra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which resulted in the occurrence of ring-opening reactions and afforded straight-chain olefins that were subsequently dehydrated at higher temperatures. Finally, cellulose aromatization reactions were observed starting from similar to 290 degrees C. In summary, the obtained results showed that lower temperature pretreatment (200-290 degrees C) influenced only the content of oxygen-containing components in liquid products obtained by subsequent pyrolysis, whereas higher temperature pretreatment (320-390 degrees C) also influenced the types of components.									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000453496400009

We report, with periodic density functional theory calculations, the LixOy (x and y = 0, 1, and 2) reaction pathway and (Li2O2), growth mechanism of lithium-air batteries on carbon nanotube (CNT) electrodes. The stable tube spacing (internal or external) of the optimized CNT cathode is theoretically confirmed to be 3.4 angstrom via noninterference between electrons. We demonstrate that upon interaction with CNTs, Li2O2 and Li2O molecules that are preferentially generated through lithiation reaction rather than disproportionation reaction are physically adsorbed on the surface of CNTs. Interestingly, the (Li2O2), cluster with n > 1 formed by aggregation is unstable on the CNT surface, which proved to be beneficial to the formation of toroidal Li2O2. Compared with single-walled CNTs, double-walled CNTs exhibit stronger LixOy adsorption, larger (Li2O2)(2) generation threshold potential, smaller (Li2O)(2) generation threshold potential, clearer product morphology distribution, and higher (Li2O2)(n)@CNT electronic conductivity. The abovementioned innovative conclusions inspired us to pay attention to the influence of the CNT structure on the electrochemical properties. Therefore, the adjustment of the spacing and layer of CNTs inevitably plays a vital role in improving the cycle and rate performance of lithium-air batteries. Our results provide theoretical guidance for the design of advanced cathode catalysts in lithium-air batteries and other potential metal-O-2 batteries.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2574-0962			WOS:000636714000015

The gas-phase model (Ranzi et al., 2012) was expanded to include the chemistry of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) up to four-to-five ring PAHs, with a modular and hierarchical approach. The discrete sectional method was employed to solve the size evolution of the particle size distribution function (PSDF). Analogy and similarity rules were employed to describe heterogeneous reaction kinetics of soot surface reactions. A variable collision efficiency was assumed for the coalescence of small soot particles. Larger particles were assumed to undergo aggregation. The predicted PSDFs are found to be in reasonably good agreement with the experimental data for nascent soot measured in an atmospheric-pressure premixed ethylene-oxygen-argon flame in the burner-stabilized stagnation flame configuration. Sensitivity analyses of the PSDF, number density, and volume fraction were carried out with respect to the rate parameters of addition reactions of acetylene, PAHs, resonantly stabilized radical reactions, and coalescence and aggregation. The results show that the reaction of PAHs and acetylene with soot surfaces and the kinetics of coalescence and aggregation exhibit dominant effects on the detailed and global soot properties for the flame studied, in agreement with conclusions of a large range of previous modeling studies.

As a potential alternative of Pt/C catalyst, two-dimensional (2D) porous carbon materials are widely investigated due to the highly accessible surface area and active sites, wherein carbon films doped with a plurality of metals and non-metal elements are rarely reported due to an uncontrollable synthesis process. Here, a bi-metallic (NiCo alloy nanoparticles) and nonmetallic (N) co-doped porous carbon film (Ni-Co-N@CF) is fabricated by a simple controllable and scalable strategy comprising the synthesis of NiCo alloy nanoparticles, modification of organic molecules, and high-temperature carbonization process. The optimized Ni-Co-N@CF catalyst shows an excellent ORR electrocatalytic activity with a larger electrochemically active surface area (2.31 m(2) g(-1)), a higher half-wave potential (0.86 V) and a lower diffusion limited current density (-4.43 mA cm(-2)) than all the prepared control catalysts. Moreover, the designated catalyst also exhibits high durability and superior methanol tolerance in alkaline media, significantly better than the commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). The superior ORR performance is attributed to the synergetic interactions of ternary doping of Ni/Co/N in the 2D film skeleton, which not only greatly enhances conductivity but also provides more Co-N active sites.

The defect-rich structures of the obtained AB play a critical role in providing more appropriate sites for sulfur atom doping. After a pyrolysis process in the presence of melamine as N doping agent, the sulfur template was decomposed and yielded the N, S-codoped porous carbon material with additional porosity. The synergistic effects between the defect-projecting and heteroatoms-doping boost the activity of electrocatalysts in terms of the enhanced oxygen reduction efficiency and optimized kinetic process, both are better than that of commercial Pt/C. And the improved reactivity between carbon atoms and heteroatoms as well as sulfur and nitrogen atoms greatly suppress the loss of active ingredient of the catalyst, the mechanism yields a striking long-term stability for the unique metal-free OAB@S-N electrocatalyst.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000447741800008

Charge transfer and recombination processes were characterized by transient photocurrent responses, electrochemical impedance test, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The photocatalytic performances were investigated through rhodamine B degradation test under an irradiation source based on 30 W cold visible-light-emitting diode. The highest visible-light photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic activities were observed from the heterojunction with 1:2 mass ratio of Ti3+-TiO2 to O-g-C3N4. The photodegradation reaction rate constant based on this heterojuction is 0.0356 min-1, which is 3.87 and 4.56 times higher than those of pristine Ti3+-TiO2 and pure g-C3N4, respectively. The remarkably high photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic performances of the heterojunctions are mainly attributed to the synergetic effect of efficient photogenerated electron-hole separation, decreased electron transfer resistance from interfacial chemical hydroxy residue bonds, and oxidizing groups originating from Ti3+-TiO2 and O-g-C3N4.									209	10	0	0	34	1	213			1944-8244			WOS:000398764100029	28266841

The evolutionary behavior of inclusion in various processes was systematically analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDS), and the total oxygen content and nitrogen content in 27SiMn steel were measured at various production steps. On the basis of the calcium treatment for 27SiMn steel, the equilibrium reactions for Ca-Al were calculated according to the thermodynamic equilibrium model. The results showed that the types of inclusions at the start of LF stations are mainly Al2O3-FeO and MnS-Al2O3. Before calcium treatment, the inclusions are mostly calcium aluminate and CaO-MgO-Al2O3. Compared with the process after soft blowing, the number density of inclusions in tundish increased by 77.88%, possibly due to secondary oxidation. From the soft blowing process to the continuous casting round billet, the inclusions translate into spherical CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2, and a large number of CaS were observed. One part of the CaS precipitated separately, the other part was semi-wrapped with the composite inclusions. At the same time, calcium treatment increases the number density, mean diameter, and the area fraction of inclusions. The mass fraction of T.O. (total oxygen content) increased significantly after soft blowing, and the N content increased greatly from station to tundish. The change trend of N content in steel was basically consistent with that of T.O. content. It was necessary to prevent the secondary oxidation of molten steel during calcium treatment and the casting process. When the liquidus temperature of liquid steel is 1873 K, w[Al] = 0.022%, and w[Ca] in steel is controlled between 1.085 x 10(-6) and 4.986 x 10(-6), the Al2O3 inclusion degeneration effect is good.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2075-4701		WOS:000803499900001

Better efficiency of hydrogen evolution reactions is achieved by the development of highly active non-precious electrocatalysts. In this work, a cobalt phthalocyanine-embedded iron ore particle hybrid composite was prepared for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). First, cobalt tetrabenzimidazole phthalocyanine (CoTBImPc) was synthesized and characterized by different analytical and spectroscopic techniques. Then, iron ore particles obtained by ball milling were mixed with CoTBImPc to obtain a hybrid composite. Electrical conductivity studies revealed the semiconducting nature of the synthesized phthalocyanine molecule, whereas the composite of magnetite and phthalocyanine showed better conductive behaviour when its composition is in the ratio of 1 : 7.5. The organic hybrid composite was immobilized on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE/Fe3O4-CoTBImPc) and used for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A remarkable HER activity was displayed by the composite hybrid material with a significant decrease in the overpotential. GCE/Fe3O4-CoTBImPc exhibited an overpotential of 49 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), whereas the benchmark GCE/(Pt/C) showed an overpotential of 7.02 mV for HER at the same current density. The HER activity of the composite electrode is highly comparable to that of precious metal and metal oxide electrocatalysts used for HERs. The decrease in the overpotential for HER at the composite electrode is ascribed to the surface enhancement of the composite and improvement in the conductivity of CoTBImPc due to embedded Fe3O4 particles. The Tafel slope of the composite electrode demonstrated a lower value than that of pristine phthalocyanines and Fe3O4 particles, which is comparable to that of Pt/C. As the overpotential for the HER at the GCE/Fe3O4-CoTBImPc electrode reaches a value closer to that of the precious Pt/C electrode, the composite electrode can be used instead of the Pt/C electrode for HER applications.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2398-4902			WOS:000626710500014

Chou-Fasman analysis of the amino-acid sequence of this protein suggests that this component contains a high proportion of alpha-helical structure and only relatively small amounts of beta-sheet structure. A computational study using more sophisticated techniques (Beauregard, M. (1992) Environ. Exp. Bet. 32, 411-429) concluded that the protein contained little periodically ordered secondary structure. In this study, we have directly measured the relative proportions of secondary structure present in the 33 kDa protein using far-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectroscopy. Our results indicate that, in solution, this protein contains a large proportion of beta-sheet structure (38%) and relatively small amounts of alpha-helical structure (9%). A structural model of the 33 kDa protein based on a constrained Chou-Fasman analysis (Teeter, M.M. and Whitlow, M (1988) Proteins 4, 262-273) is presented.									52	4	0	0	43	0	56			0005-2728			WOS:A1994QG26500030	7803456

Previous work on edge-rich MoS2 nanoplatelet 3D porous films (3D-ER-MoS2) shows they are promising catalysts, yet have basal planes that are inactive. Here we demonstrate how hydrogen annealing and oxygen plasma etching of 3D-ER-MoS2 generates defects and increases active site density within the basal plane, leading to dramatic improvements in HER catalytic activity. We also explore the critical processing parameters for electrocatalytic enhancement. Significantly enriched edge density was revealed for both routes. O-2 plasma treatment was more effective in increasing the number of edges by creating micro-cracks and local surface damage on the basal planes as well as structuring saw-toothed edges; H-2 etching mainly introduced irregular shaped basal surface nanopores and strips. By controlling processing parameters, optimum surface area/active sites density enhancement can be achieved, together with the robust 3D porous architecture and superaerophobic surface. The defect-rich MoS2 catalysts exhibit excellent HER activity: 700 degrees C - H-2 - MoS2 shows Tafel slope of 94 mV/dec and low onset overpotential of 193 mV; 15 min - O-2 - MoS2 performs amongst the best with excellent exchange current density of 57 mu A/cm(geo)(-2). Our defect engineered 3D-ER MoS2 exhibits j(geo) (eta = 0.5 mV) of 6-fold and 38-fold compared to monolayer MoS2 subject to similar process, for O-2 plasma and H-2 etching approaches respectively. Our study demonstrates an effective way to realize high performance Pt-free electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation by dual enhancement via edge enrichment and basal surface activation.

However, most of the MoP synthesized so far are crystalline MoP with relatively fewer exposed active sites and low electrical conductivity. Here, we use a metallo-organic Mo precursor (MoO2(acac)(2)) to create defect-rich crystalline MoP nanoparticles and uniformly anchor them on reduced graphene oxide (denoted as D-MoP/rGO). High-temperature thermal decomposition of the precursor generates gases, which induce a variety of defects in D-MoP/rGO along with a P-rich surface composition. The electrochemically active surface area of D-MoP/rGO is 8 times that of bulk MoP. D-MoP/rGO requires a small overpotential of 122 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculation results reveal that surface P sites are the key active sites, which favor the adsorption of H atoms and also act as an H deliverer to promote the HER. Importantly, D-MoP/rGO is also a highly active catalyst for the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and requires a low overpotential of 84 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Thus, efficient HER||HzOR hybrid water-splitting can be realized using D-MoP/rGO, which can deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at a small cell voltage of 0.74 V and undergo a stable 12 h operation. In summary, a simple method has been demonstrated to generate high-performance metal phosphide electrocatalysts for total water splitting. Furthermore, the material design concept of creating defective crystalline nanoparticles using gas generating metal precursors can serve as a general approach to create various catalytic active defective crystalline materials.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			2052-1553			WOS:000489333000006

Here, we demonstrated the feasibility of the electrodeposition to synthesize in situ and quick Rh/Mg/Al hydrotalcite-type (HT) syngas catalyst precursors with controlled composition, morphology and thickness around 5 to 20 mu m on the surface of FeCrAlloy foams using a two-compartment flow electrochemical cell. After calcination at 900 degrees C, catalytic coatings with properties similar to those of conventional co-precipitated HT-derived catalysts were identified by synchrotron nano-XRF/XRD tomography and HRTEM. The resulting structured catalysts, therefore, merged the properties of both HT-derived catalysts and open-cell foams, namely, thermally stable nano MgO- and spinel-type phases where Rh was dispersed and stabilized against sintering, and high mass and heat transfer. Moreover, the development of a MgAl2O4 thin film in the support-coating interface, by chemical reaction between Mg2+ from the coating and Al3+ from the support during calcination, increased the catalyst adhesion. Consequently, active and stable performance was obtained under harsh reaction conditions in the catalytic partial oxidation of CH4 to syngas as a model reaction. Even in the catalysts operating under severe reaction conditions for about 50 h, the coating was stable and Rh metallic nanoparticles around 2 nm were still well dispersed.									16	1	0	0	2	0	16			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000435749100002

The interface of hetero-nanostructures can integrate different components into a single synergistic hybrid with high activity. Here, the synthesis of PdO-RuO2-C with abundant interfaces/defects was achieved for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). It exhibited a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 44 mV with a Tafel slope of 34 mV dec(-1) in 1 m KOH. The HER mass activity was 3 times higher in base and comparable to Pt/C in acid. The stability test confirmed high HER stability. The catalyst also exhibited excellent HOR activity in both media; in alkaline HOR it outperformed Pt/C. The exchange current density i(0,m) of PdO-RuO2/C was 522 mA mg(-1) in base, which is 58 and 3.4 times higher than those of Pd/C and Pt/C. The HOR activity of PdO-RuO2/C was 22 and 300 times higher than those of PdO/C in acid and base. Improvement of HER/HOR kinetics in different alkaline electrolytes was observed in the order K+<Na+<Li+, and increase of HER as well decrease of HOR kinetics was observed with increasing Li+ concentration. It was proposed that OHad-M+-(H2O)(x) in the double-layer region could influence HER/HOR activity in base. Based on the hard and soft acid and base (HSAB) theory, the OHads-M+-(H2O)(x) could help to remove more OHads into the bulk, leading to increase in HER/HOR activity in alkaline electrolyte (K+<Na+<Li+) and increasing the HER with increasing Li+ concentration. The decrease of HOR activity of PdO-RuO2/C with increasing M+ was due to M+-induced OHads destabilization through the bifunctional mechanism. The high HER/HOR activity of PdO-RuO2/C could be attributed, among other factors, to interface engineering and strong synergistic interaction. This work provides an opportunity to design oxide-based catalysts for renewable energy technologies.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000637978200001	33760385

Compared with bare ReS2, the ReS2/RGO hybrid delivers much better electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media. It exhibits a lower Tafel slope of 107.4mVdec(-1) and a larger current density of -5.2mAcm(-2) at -250mV (vs. RHE), compared with ReS2 (152.7mVdec(-1), -3.1mAcm(-2)). The ReS2/RGO hybrid has a unique architecture constructed by highly conductive and porous RGO internetworks, which guarantees easy electrolyte infiltration and efficient charge transfer and provides sufficient active edge sites, resulting in enhanced HER performance. The present synthesis approach can be extended to synthesize other 2D-semiconductor-based composites for energy storage and catalytic devices.									27	9	0	0	0	0	28			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000451059000002		
J	AHMAD, S								BIOCHEMICAL DEFENSE OF PROOXIDANT PLANT ALLELOCHEMICALS BY HERBIVOROUS INSECTS								BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMATICS AND ECOLOGY				20	4			269	296		10.1016/0305-1978(92)90040-K				JUN 1992	1992	A new aspect of interactions among insect herbivores and defensive chemistry of plants in the regulation of oxygen toxicity exerted by pro-oxidant allelochemicals is described. Endogenous oxygen toxicity results from activation of the ground state of molecular oxygen to the superoxide anion radical (O2.-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (.OH), lipid hydroperoxides (LOOHs), and peroxyl radicals (LO2. or RO2.). The strongly lipid-peroxidizing singlet oxygen (1-DELTA-gO2) is also produced during light activation of photosensitizers. Ingestion of pro-oxidants exacerbates oxygen toxicity by increasing the production of these deleterious forms of oxygen. The role of ascorbate, alpha-tocopherol, glutathione, carotenoids and urate as antioxidants in insects is apparent, but needs more work for the elucidation of their roles. The major defence mechanism includes a group of antioxidant enzymes represented by superoxide dismutese (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase's peroxidative activity (GSTPX), glutathione reductase (GR), and DT-diaphorase. SOD converts O2.- radicals to H2O2 and O2, CAT decomposes H2O2 to H2O and O2, GSTPX reduces LOOHs to LOHs with GSH as reductant and GSSG formed from GSH during the GSTPX reaction is reduced to GSH by GR. DT-diaphorass is an important antioxidant in that it reduces quinones by a two-electron reduction to stable products, thereby preventing the one-electron reduction to semiquinone radicals which generate O2.- radicals. Therefore, these enzymes are crucial for insect herbivores for preventing the free-radical cascade of oxygen, and terminating the toxic lipid peroxidation chain reaction, in response to the endogenous and potential exogenous oxidant-induced injury.									164	6	0	0	160	1	172			0305-1978	1873-2925		WOS:A1992JE28800001

However, the shape of this cycle has a huge variation from one parameter to another and from one monitoring point to another on the same river. Important variations also occur at the same point during some events, such as high waters. Water level, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen, oxidation reduction potential, and pH of the Suceava River were monitored for 365 days (2018-2019, hourly sampling frequency) in order to assess the upstream-downstream changes in the diurnal cycle of these parameters, some of these changes being caused by the impact of Suceava city, which is located between the selected monitoring points. The multiresolution analysis of the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform and the wavelet coherence analysis were combined in a flexible methodology that helped in comparing the upstream and downstream shapes of the diurnal cycle. The methodology allowed for a fast comparison of diurnal profiles during periods of high waters or baseflow. Notable changes were observed in the moments of diurnal maxima and minima.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1				2073-4441		WOS:000507378600097

This combination of electrolytes provides a favorable environment for both catalysts and shows the effective use of bicarbonate and KOH to obtain low cell voltages. This architecture brings down the total cell voltage by more than 1 V compared to that with conventional use of a Pt counter electrode and monopolar membranes, and at the same time, it reduces contamination and improves stability at the cathode.									97	1	0	0	6	0	100			2380-8195			WOS:000390086400011

LiNbO3:Fe has been exposed to treatments in reducing (95%Ar + 5%H-2) and oxidizing (O-2) atmospheres at temperatures up to 1100 K. The high temperature spectra have been discussed in respect to the electronic defects giving rise to absorption. In addition, the time-dependent evolution of optical spectra upon rapid replacement of gas atmospheres has been followed at fixed wavelength. The experimental reaction kinetics is discussed in terms of oxygen vacancy diffusion accounting for the associated changes in the point defect subsystem of the material.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0925-3467	1873-1252		WOS:000518692000060

J	Levy, O; Dubinsky, Z; Schneider, K; Achituv, Y; Zakai, D; Gorbunov, MY								Diurnal hysteresis in coral photosynthesis								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				268				105	117		10.3354/meps268105				2004	2004	In oxygenic photosynthesizing organisms, it has been noticed on a number of occasions that photosynthetic performance was lower in the afternoon than in the morning, at the same light intensities. This hysteresis phenomenon is called the 'afternoon depression' and has been observed in phytoplankton, macroalgae, and higher plants. Here we characterize, with high temporal resolution, in situ diel courses of oxygen evolution and chlorophyll fluorescence yields in 3 Indo-Pacific corals (Favia favus, Goniopora lobata, Plerogyra sinuosa) and 2 Caribbean symbiotic corals (Montastrae faveolata and Porites astreoides) using a 3-chamber submersible respirometer and a SCUBA-based fast repetition rate fluorometer. In contrast to all previously published cases, the oxygen measurements revealed an unexpected hysteresis, with higher photosynthetic rates occurring in the afternoon than in the morning. The oxygen diel patterns were highly consistent in all organisms examined, including the 3 corals and 2 macroalgae (Ulva sp. and Gracilaria sp.) from the Red Sea. Surprisingly, the diurnal patterns of the quantum yields of photochemistry in Photosystem II (PSII), assessed from variable fluorescence (quantum yield of photochemistry in PSII measured under ambient light, DeltaF'/F-m') exhibited much higher variability and often showed a hysteresis pattern opposite to that of oxygen. In most organisms the values of DeltaF'/F-m' and the deduced rates of photosynthetic electron transport were higher in the morning than in the afternoon; however, the opposite trend with lower values of DeltaF'/F-m' in the morning was also observed. Lower values of DeltaF'/F-m' were always accompanied by higher quantum yields of non-photochemical quenching, consistent with the energetic balance within the primary photosynthetic reactions. The direction of the diurnal hysteresis in variable fluorescence appears to be species-specific and may vary even within the same species, reflecting microscale variability in bio-optical properties and gross photosynthesis of the corals.									75	0	0	0	65	0	75			0171-8630			WOS:000220739000009

More than a support to immobilize metal nanoparticles and improve atomic usage, the carbon materials can also impact the catalysis performance in a way of engineering the electronic structure of active metal components. The modulation of such an electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI) for designing efficient catalysts has been a hotspot in recent years. Benefiting from the development of advanced characterization techniques and theoretical simulations, one can shed light on the key points regarding EMSI and construct the relationship between EMSI and catalysis performance. In this Review, we summarize the recent work concerning the electronic interaction between carbon supports and metals, and discuss the underlying factors, including the nature of metal, metal morphology, metal particle size, carbon structure, heteroatom doping, carbon coating, and interfacial binding. The relationship between EMSI and the catalytic performance, by taking hydrogen/oxygen electrocatalysis for examples, is highlighted. These summaries would deepen the understanding of EMSI and favor the progress of carbon-supported metal catalysts.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9				2639-4979		WOS:000683024500011

The combustion products were studied by XRD, SEM, EDS and EPMA. The effect of the composite coating on the combustion behavior of TC11 titanium alloy was discussed. The results show that there is regional microstructural evolution along radial direction in the substrate of the combusted specimen. The substrate near the central hole is the ignition source. When the combustion degree is low, the effect of the YSZ intermediate layer on the combustion behavior of titanium alloys can be ignored. However, when the combustion degree is high, the YSZ intermediate layer dissolves greatly in the titanium alloy melt through decomposition reaction, which provides O and Zr for the titanium alloy melt and accelerates the interaction between Ti and O. Furthermore, the ZrTiO4 combustion product has a worse ability to block oxygen diffusion than TiO2. As a result, NiCrAl/YSZ/NiCrAl-B.e composite coating, especially the YSZ layer, promotes the extended combustion of TC11 titanium alloy.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			1001-4381			WOS:000468246300006

However, the widespread occurrence of moissanite (SiC) in kimberlites, and a suite of super-reduced minerals (SiC, alloys, native elements) in peridotites in Tibet and the Polar Urals (Russia), suggest that more reducing conditions (f(O2) = 6-8 log units below IW) must occur locally in the mantle. We describe pockets of melt trapped in aggregates of corundum crystals ejected from Cretaceous volcanoes in northern Israel which contain high-temperature mineral assemblages requiring extremely low f(O2) (IW < -10). One abundant phase is tistarite (Ti2O3), previously known as a single grain in the Allende carbonaceous chondrite (Mexico) and believed to have formed during the early evolution of the solar nebula. It is associated with other reduced phases usually found in meteorites. The development of super-reducing conditions in Earth's upper mantle may reflect the introduction of CH4 + H-2 fluids from the deep mantle, specifically related to deep-seated volcanic plumbing systems at plate boundaries.									41	2	2	0	2	0	44			0091-7613	1943-2682		WOS:000384307200009

In this paper, an in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyzer with a heater was used to study the pyrolysis of Huadian oil shale and its demineralization samples (kerogen concentrates) during the heating up to 600 degrees C. Transition state theory (TST) was used to analyze the conversion mechanisms of different oxygen-containing functional groups to H2O, CH4, CO, etc. The pyrolysis of dried oil shale begins with the rupture of C-OH and subsequently progresses to the decomposition of thermosensitive oxygen-containing groups (C-O and C=O in sequences). Also, then, aliphatic compounds will begin to decrease obviously from 350 degrees C due to cracking and evaporation while aromatic compounds exhibit excellent thermostability. The minerals in oil shale produce catalytic effects on the conversion of kerogen to bitumen, making the pyrolysis reactions easier in oil shale than in pure kerogen.									25	1	0	0	0	0	26			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000380523200045

Conductance and capacitance of bilayer protective oxides for silicon water splitting anodes								ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE				9	2			504	516		10.1039/c5ee02484f				2016	2016	State-of-the-art silicon water splitting photoelectrochemical cells employ oxide protection layers that exhibit electrical conductance in between that of dielectric insulators and electronic conductors, optimizing both built-in field and conductivity. The SiO2-like layer interposed between a deposited protective oxide film and its Si substrate plays a key role as a tunnel oxide that can dominate the total device impedance. In this report, we investigate the effects of changes in interfacial SiO2 resistance and capacitance in the oxide bilayer through both solid state leakage current and capacitance-voltage measurements and through electrochemical methods applied to water splitting cells. Modelling is performed to describe both types of data in a simple and intuitive way, allowing for insights to be developed into the connections among both the dielectric (charge storage) and conductive (charge transport) properties of bilayer protective oxides and their effects on oxygen evolution performance. Finally, atomic layer deposited (ALD) Al2O3 is studied as an insulator layer with conductivity intermediate between that of tunnel oxide SiO2 and the more conductive ALD-TiO2, to further generalize this understanding.									32	0	0	0	1	0	31			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000369744500017

An effective way of promoting photocatalytic activity is by creating heterogeneous photocatalysts. In this paper, a hybrid nanostructured photocatalyst with desired three-dimensional (3D) nanoarchitecture by assembling Sn3O4 nanosheets on N-doped TiO2 nanotubes has been constructed with enhanced broad spectrum photocatalytic properties, which can harness UV and visible light to decompose organic contaminants in aqueous solutions and split water to hydrogen. Photocatalytic tests showed that the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures possessed a much higher degradation rate of methyl orange and hydrogen evolution rate than that of the unmodified TiO2 nanotubes, N-TiO2 nanotubes, Sn3O4 nanosheets and Sn3O4/TiO2 hybrid nanostructures. The mechanism related to the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity was discussed. Deposition of Sn3O4 nanosheets onto N-TiO2 nanotubes resulted in a dramatic increase in light-induced generation of hydroxyl radicals, superoxides and singlet oxygen, and the production of holes and electrons. This work is the first instance of combining Sn3O4 with NTiO2, the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures show good photocatalytic performance. This study is potentially applicable to a range of 3D hybrid nanostructures with promising applications in photocatalysis and relevant areas.									64	6	0	0	4	0	65			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000361553100041

However, owing to the lack of appropriate diagnostic tools, the systematic understanding and observation on the redox reaction heterogeneity at the individual secondary-particle level is still limited. Raman spectroscopy can not only reflect the depth of the redox reaction through probing the vibrational information on the metal-oxygen coordination structure but also sensitively detect the local structure changes of different regions within the secondary particle with suitable spatial resolution. Therefore, Raman spectroscopy is applied here to conveniently conduct the high-resolution and in-depth analysis of the rate-dependent reaction heterogeneity within nickel-rich NCM secondary particles. It is found that, under high-rate conditions, the oxidation/reduction reaction mainly occurs in the surface region of the particles and the cause of this particle-scale reaction heterogeneity is the limitation of the slow solid-phase Li+ diffusion and the transient charging/discharging processes. In addition, this reaction heterogeneity would aggravate the structural instability of the material continuously during the charging/discharging cycles, thus resulting in a slowdown in the kinetics of Li+ de/intercalation and the apparent capacity decay. This work can not only provide fundamental insight into the rational modification of high-power nickel-rich NCM materials but also guide the setting of electrochemical operating conditions for high-power lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).									12	2	0	0	0	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000664289800040	34086432

Herein, we firstly used atomically dispersed IrClx to uniformly decorate ultrathin Co(OH)(2) nanosheets to dramatically improve electrocatalytic activity. The synthesized IrClx-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibits an overpotential of 230 mV to reach 10 mA/cm(2), which was much enhanced compared to that of pristine Co(OH)(2)/CNTs (308 mV) and commercial benchmark IrO2(309 mV). X-ray absorption fine structure and density functional theory simulations demonstrate strong interfacial interaction between IrClx and Co(OH)(2) nanosheets via the Cl-Ir-O and Ir-Cl-Co bond can efficiently boost its electronic conductivity. The accelerated charge transfer promotes the formation of more positively charged O atoms around cobalt centers, which is beneficial for the deprotonation on IrClx-Co(OH)(2) and makes the catalyst facilitate OER.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000566455400004

The results show absolute values of BOD5 significantly influenced by the existence of tested substances in the wastewater and allow the establishing of a scale for the inhibitive effect of such substances taking into consideration the degree of reduction of the evaluated indicator. The kinetics completes the overall image on the consequences of the pollutants on the evolution in time of the biochemical reaction of oxygen consumption. The quality indicator BOD5 is used for the indirect determination of organic load from wastewater and it is the most employed parameter for characterising wastewater. The investigation of BOD5-related issues is of a paramount importance in order to ensure the requirements of a proper design and optimal functioning of wastewater treatment plants so that the quality of the effluent meets the quality standards regulated by the legislation regarding the preservation of water resources.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2069-5837			WOS:000402726300011

Of them, Ti/Bi-PbO2 anode displayed excellent electrocatalytic performance. Cyclic voltammetric experiments were carried out to get a better understanding of the electrocatalytic properties of these anodes. The Ti Bi-PbO2 anode had the highest overpotential of 1.75 V (vs. SCE) for oxygen evolution. Both XRD patterns and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) images demonstrated that the incorporation of Bi could diminish the size of the crystal particles. Oxidants such as hydroxyl radical. hydrogen peroxide were determined, and their amount was proportional to the electrocatalytic activities of modified PbO2 anodes. Electrocatalytic oxidation of o-nitrophenol was conducted by using these anodes as anode and stainless steel sheet as cathode. Ti/Bi-PbO2 anode displayed not only excellent electrocatalytic performance but also low energy consumption. The Ti/Bi-PbO2 anode is a promising anode for the treatment of organic pollutants.

PCC 6803, which can grow only in PG-supplemented media. 1) A few days of PG depletion suppressed oxygen evolution of mutant cells supported by p-benzoquinone (BQ). The suppression was recovered slowly in a week after PG re-addition. Measurements of fluorescence yield indicated the enhanced sensitivity of Q(B) to the inactivation by BQ It is assumed that the loss of low-affinity PG (PG(L)) enhances the affinity for BQ that inactivates Q(B). 2) Oxygen evolution without BQ supported by the endogenous electron acceptors, was slowly suppressed due to the direct inactivation of Q(B) during 10 days of PG depletion, and was recovered rapidly within 10 h upon the PG re-addition. It is concluded that the loss of high-affinity PG (PG(H)) displaces Q(B) directly. 3) Electron microscopy images of PG-depleted cells showed the specific suppression of division of mutant cells, which had developed thylakoid membranes attaching phycobilisomes (PBS). 4) Although the PG-depletion for 14 days decreased the chlorophyll/PBS ratio to about 1/4, florescence spectra/lifetimes were not modified indicating the flexible energy transfer from PBS to different numbers of PSII. Longer PG-depletion enhanced allophycocyanin fluorescence at 683 nm with a long 1.2 ns lifetime indicating the suppression of energy transfer from PBS to PSII. 5) Action sites of PG(H), PG(L) and other PG molecules on PSII structure are discussed.

By eliminating the need to remove organic surfactants prior to nanoparticle incorporation into electrodes, we were able to use electrostatic assembly to achieve well-defined nanoparticle dispersions in contrast to the aggregated structures common in the field. The approach has allowed us to elucidate the nature of structure sensitivity for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction in acidic and alkaline media. In this paper, we provide a detailed investigation of the evolution of surface-adsorbed Sn-Pt ligand interaction during Pt nanoparticle growth. We show that surface adsorbed SnCl3 exists as pyramidally coordinated to the Pt nanoparticle through Sn-Pt bond formation, resulting in a distorted tetrahedrally coordinated Sn-moiety. Furthermore, we show the shift in the bond charge distribution as the Pt is reduced from its initial Pt2+ state to its metallic state. Direct evidence for the distorted tetrahedral coordination of Pt-SnCl3 and the shift in Sn-Pt bond charge during nanoparticle growth emerges from the Sn-119 Mossbauer quadrupole splitting (QS) and Isomer-shift (IS) respectively. Evolution of the structure and chemistry of inorganic complexes during nanoparticle growth has never before been demonstrated and our work is the first to identify the strength of the Sn-Pt interaction in these systems. Such an understanding of nanoparticle surface chemistry will permit extension of this technique to other metals and macro-structures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Delafossite CuCoO2 has unique crystal structure, suitable band gap and energy band edge, and excellent catalytic activity, which is a new photocatalyst well worth developing. However, the as-prepared CuCoO2 samples in literature often have the problems of containing impurity or secondary phases, non-stoichiometry, leading to some controversies about its fundamental physicochemical properties. Moreover, there is also insufficient understanding of the use of CuCoO2 as a novel photocatalyst. Herein, one-pot hydrothermal method was used to prepare stoichiometric delafossite CuCoO2 microcrystals (similar to 3.65 mu m) with high purity and single-phase. Then, its detailed fundamental physicochemical properties as photocatalyst are further provided by a series of experimental characterization and density functional theory calculations. The results show that delafossite CuCoO2 exhibit outstanding semi-metallic ferromagnetism, multiple electron transitions caused by various band gap types, multi band absorption and full spectrum absorption, and has appropriate band edge position, which can be applied to HER and OER of water splitting. The photocatalytic performance of CuCoO2 was systematically tested for the first time by photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride, photocatalytic water-splitting, and photocurrent measurement in PEC cell. Under visible light irradiation, the as-prepared CuCoO2 can degrade more than 90% of tetracycline hydrochloride within 4 h. Without sacrificial agent and cocatalyst, the shows the hydrogen and oxygen evolution rates from photocatalytic water-splitting of as-prepared CuCoO2 reached to 2.60 and 128.53 mu mol/ h g, respectively. In the three electrode electrochemical cell with 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte and zero-bias, the photocurrent density of CuCoO2 based photocathode reached to 20 mu A/cm(2). These findings prove that CuCoO2 has obvious advantages and great potential as a visible-light-driven photocatalyst.[GRAPHICS].									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000870672600004

A stimuli responsive Co(II) containing a low-molecular-weight metallo-organogel (CoGel) has been synthesized on a nitrogen-rich triazole platform. CoGel shows autonomous self-healing ability owing to the presence of extensive hydrogen bonding between exocyclic amines of the triazole moiety and the entrapped solvent molecules. CoGel-derived Co-xerogel (xerogel1), having a crumpled sheet-like morphology and a large effective surface area, has been calcined in air to obtain sea-urchin-like Co3O4. This Co3O4 has been compared with xerogell to understand the beneficial effect of the presence of exposed Co(II)-sites, and also, the presence of a ligand that stabilizes both Co2+ and Co3+ states, in designing efficient and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Both xerogell and Co3O4 have shown excellent activity for electrocatalytic OER in acidic and in alkaline media. Combined electrochemical studies revealed that Co3O4 was more stable compared to xerogell and, consequently, delivered better activity in an acidic medium, whereas the trend was just reversed in an alkaline medium where xerogell was found to be a better catalyst. The xerogell in alkaline OER showed a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 91.72%, as observed from a rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) experiment. Moreover, a time course study of O-2 evolution carried out by gas chromatography resulted in a FE in accordance with that observed from the RRDE experiment. Our results are comparable to reported cobalt-based electrocatalysts and introduce possibilities of developing efficient electrocatalytic systems in the future.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2168-0485			WOS:000489986400029

The present study demonstrated that irrE gene from Deinococcus radiodurans R1 promoted the furfural resistance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae through directed evolution. Compared to the wild-type strain, the FR mutant not only showed improved tolerance to single- or multi- inhibitors (furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, formic and acetic acid), but also obtained better ability of eliminating reactive oxygen species. Consequently, batch fermentation of the FR mutant in synthetic medium (200 g/L glucose and 2.0 g/L furfural) resulted in an 37% increase in ethanol productivity, although ethanol titer (similar to 88 g/L) was comparable to that of the control. This study provides the first evidence that an exogenous global regulator can improve the stress tolerance of yeast, which is significant for production of industrial products from lignocellulose by S. cerevisiae.

By means of density functional theory with a semi-local exchange-correlation functional, and classical dynamics calculations, we show that the recently observed activated character of O-2 adsorption on Cu(111) and Cu-ML/Ru(0001), as well as the delicate interplay between dissociative and non-dissociative O-2 sticking on Cu(111) at different surface temperatures, can be explained by assuming an adiabatic evolution of the molecular spin. This suggests that spin adiabaticity during O-2 adsorption on metal surfaces could be a more general scenario than anticipated.									15	1	0	0	0	0	16			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000400117700001	28393951

In this study, graphene-based electrochemical Raman measurements were performed to clarify the absolute potential of the Fermi level of plasmonic nanoparticles to induce an efficient OER under modal strong coupling condition. The measurements revealed a correlation between OER performance and the Fermi level potential. The electrode with higher activity showed a more positive Fermi level than that with lower OER activity. We also observed characteristic electronic excitation of the plasmonic field under modal strong coupling. The investigations yielded significant information such as the characteristic electronic structures and controlled electronic excitation of the plasmonic field for effective OER. This sets important requirements for further developing plasmonic water oxidation devices.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000614317500014

The silicon/NiOx core/shell nanowire photoanodes are fabricated by a simple and scalable one-step galvanic displacement reaction and thermal annealing. The conformal NiOx shell layer functions as an oxygen evolution catalyst to reduce the onset potential as well as a protection layer against corrosion. It was found that about 30 nanometer thick NiOx film coated p-type silicon nanowire arrays exhibited efficient water oxidation activity with stability for more than 48 h in aqueous Na2SO4 solution (pH similar to 7). The scalability of this approach is promising for the fabrication of Si-based photoelectrodes.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9				2046-2069		WOS:000363416400059

The multilayered architecture provided both the horizontal and vertical channels for electrolyte access during fast charging and discharging. The graphene layer turned out to play an important role in enhancing the electron conduction in the multilayered architecture. Therefore, the improved electrochemical behavior might result from the significantly improved ion transport and electron conduction in the multilayered architecture of the graphene/MnO2 composite electrode. Furthermore, the MnO2 nanowire layer coated on the graphene layer could significantly suppress the oxygen evolution reaction, broadening the potential window of water stability.

Zirconyl chloride octahydrate is one of the most used compounds as zirconium source for the synthesis of zirconium phosphates and zirconium phosphonates. The synthetic routes include precipitation and sol-gel methods.

While, the membrane electrode assembly shows poor-repetitive reversal performance as the fuel starvation tests are repeated in the previous studies. Herein, IrO2/RuO2 nanocomposites are prepared by a modified Adams method and characterized by physical and electrochemical measurement. Then, the as-prepared IrO2/RuO2 is used as an oxygen evolution reaction catalyst in reversal tolerant anodes, and the results exhibit an unexpected repetitive reversal tolerant performance with the voltage reversal times become longer as the increase of fuel starvation tests.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			2470-1343			WOS:000530659700051	32391497

However, the ways in which bubbles dynamically alter the electrochemically active surface area during bubble evolution are not well understood. Here, we study hydrogen evolution at industrially relevant current densities by using controlled microtexture to examine this fundamental relationship. Surprisingly, the most densely microtextured electrodes have the lowest performance on an active surface area basis. Using high-speed imaging, we show that the benefits of microtexture to release smaller bubbles more consistently are outweighed by the inactivation induced by bubbles growing within the denser microtexture, causing these performance limitations. Additionally, we show that the area beneath adhered bubbles is electrochemically active, contrary to currently held assumptions. Our study therefore has broad implications for electrode design to avoid ineffective use of precious catalyst materials, which is especially critical for porous electrodes and three-dimensional structures with high specific surface areas.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0743-7463			WOS:000812137400001	35229608

This has been accomplished using a new, unique gas-surface scattering instrument that combines a supersonic molecular beam with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) in ultrahigh vacuum. Using this new instrument, we are able to tightly control the energy, angle, and flux of impinging oxygen along with the surface temperature and examine the reacted surface spanning atomic, nano, and mesocopic length-scales. We observe that different oxidation conditions produce morphologically distinct etching features: anisotropic channels, circular pits, and hexagonal pits faceted along crystallographic directions. These outcomes depend upon independent effects of oxygen energy, incident angle, and surface temperature. Reaction probability increased with beam energy and demonstrated non-Arrhenius behavior with respect to surface temperature, peaking at around 1375 K. At the incident collision energies used, it was found that beam impingement angle had only minor effects on the reaction probability and etch pit Morphology. Comparison of the relative reactivity of higher grade versus lower grade HOPG indicates that the formation of etched channels largely depends on the presence of grain boundaries. We have also observed the transition to multilayer etching. The influence of structural inhomogeneities such as defects and grain boundaries can now be assessed by real-time visualization of reacting interfaces. For example, the insertion of intentionally created point defects via ion sputtering leads to marked enhancement in interfacial reactivity. The approach used herein has allowed us to correlate time-evolving surface morphology with atomic-level interfacial kinetics and dynamics, providing new insight into the reactivity of materials in aggressive, energetic environments.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1932-7447			WOS:000438178900053

Local alkalization and oxygen consumption related to cathodic activity were detected above the zinc layer covered with the thinner polymeric coating, providing a direct evidence of a differential aeration process effectively operating in an asymmetrical cut edge, in addition to the galvanic coupling of aluzinc and steel. Anodic activity leading to local acidification occurred at the other aluzinc layer at all exposures.

Contamination by SO2 in the cathode air stream caused either one-stage or two-stage degradation of the performance of the PEMFC, depending on the operating conditions. A partial recovery of the cell voltage showed that processes involving weak (reversible) and strong (irreversible) adsorption of SO2 occur during the contamination of the electrode. Experimental studies of the dependence of the two-stage degradation process on the cell voltage suggested that the process can be explained in terms of the formation of a sulfur monolayer followed by the formation of a multilayer of sulfur on the catalyst.					10th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells Symposium (PEFC) Conducted Under the Auspices of the 218th Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society (ECS)10th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells Symposium (PEFC) Conducted Under the Auspices of the 218th Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society (ECS)	OCT, 2010OCT, 2010	Electrochem Soc (ECS); Energy Technol (ETD); Phys & Analyt Electrochem (PAED); Battery (BATT); Ind Electrochem & Electrochem Engn; Asahi Kasei E-Mat Corp; Ion Power Inc; UTC Power Corp; Umicore; Tokuyama Corp; Toyota Motor Eng & Mfg N Amer; Pine Res Instruments; Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K KElectrochem Soc (ECS); Energy Technol (ETD); Phys & Analyt Electrochem (PAED); Battery (BATT); Ind Electrochem & Electrochem Engn; Asahi Kasei E-Mat Corp; Ion Power Inc; UTC Power Corp; Umicore; Tokuyama Corp; Toyota Motor Eng & Mfg N Amer; Pine Res Instruments; Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K K	Las Vegas, NVLas Vegas, NV	9	2	0	0	0	0	11			1938-5862	1938-6737	978-1-56677-820-6	WOS:000313331100159

Reaction rate is linearly dependent upon catalyst concentration for all particle sizes. Rate constants vary with particle radius raised to the power -1.7 and exhibit absolute values consistent with mass transfer of Ce-IV ions to the catalyst surface being the rate-limiting step. Activation energies are found to decrease with particle radius, and this effect is attributed to the influence of the steric stabilizer upon the temperature-dependent viscosity of solution near the catalyst surface.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0022-3654			WOS:A1994PJ46900024

The rate law is expressed as -dc(S2O82-)/dt = 2dc(O-2)/dt = k(L)c(S2O82-)c(Ag+), where k(L) is 12.4 +/- 1 mol(-1) L h(-1) at 24.5 degrees C and the activation energy is 3.7 x 10(4) J mol(-1). It is found that visible light can improve the evolution of O-2 remarkably. Compared with those without illumination, the rate constants under visible light are increased by ca. 3.8 mol(-1) L h(-1) at 4.5, 11.5, 17.5 and 24.5 degrees C, which are hardly affected by the reaction temperature. Employing MS/MS, ESR, XRD and UV-visible spectroscopy, the intermediate species {AgS2O8}(-), Ag2+, OH, Ag2O3 and AgO+ in the process of water oxidation have been detected. Based on the experimental evidence, the mechanism of Ag(I)-catalysed water oxidation with S2O82- has been developed, in which the reaction (AgO+ + H2O -> Ag+ + H2O2) is considered as the rate-determining step. The increase of the O-2-evolution rate under visible light illumination results from the absorbance of the AgO+ species at 375 nm, promoting the rate-determining step.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000346412500037	25386974	
J	Cai Mingyong; Jiang Guochen; Zhong Minlin								Laser Fabricated Electrodes with Micr-Nano Structures for Electrocatalytic Water Splitting								CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG				48	2					0202008	10.3788/CJL202118.0202008				FEB 2021	2021	Significance It is well known that energy, material, and information have been regarded as the three cornerstones of human civilization and social development. The exploitation and utilization of energy by human beings has continued through human evolution without interruption. Fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, have promoted tremendous social change and brought inestimable value to human beings. Traditional fossil fuels are non-renewable energy sources with limited reserves in the earth's crust. Excessive exploitation without replacement or alternative energy sources will inevitably lead to fossil fuel depletion. Due to increasing environmental pollution, humans begin to realize environmental hazards caused by the excessive use of fossil fuels, such as global warming, acid rain, and particulate matters. With respect to severe energy and environmental crises, it is imperative to develop green and clean energy technologies to reduce the use of increasingly exhausted fossil fuels and achieve environmentally-friendly and sustainable social developments.Hydrogen, as a renewable energy carrier, has attracted significant attention due to the following four reasons. First, hydrogen is a clean and low-carbon energy carrier and its reaction product is only water with no carbon dioxide emissions. Second, hydrogen has a high calorific value, about three times higher than fossil fuels. Third, hydrogen is widely used in electricity, construction, transportation, and industrial fields. It can be used as a raw material for the steel, metallurgical and chemical industries and as a fuel in fuel cells. Fourth, hydrogen is earth-abundant, which can originate from fossil fuel reforming, water splitting, and by-products of the chlor-alkali industry. Many governments around the world are committed to developing hydrogen energy and arranging relevant industrial chains. The International Renewable Energy Agency pointed out that hydrogen can build a connection among electricity, construction, industry, and transportation to achieve deep decarbonization.Developing various technologies for hydrogen production is important in developing hydrogen energy and the hydrogen economy. Nowadays, there are three main pathways for hydrogen production, namely, methane-steam reforming, coal gasification, and electrocatalytic water splitting. Though the first two pathways account for about 95% of hydrogen production, they still rely on fossil fuels and emit large amounts of carbon dioxide, which violates the goal of developing hydrogen energy. In contrast, electrocatalytic water splitting does not lead to carbon emissions and is a green and sustainable hydrogen production technology. However, electrocatalytic water splitting has shortcomings of excessive energy consumption and high cost, which restricts its large-scale application. Electrocatalytic water splitting contains a cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and an anodic oxygen evolution reaction ( OER), both which need efficient electrocatalysts to overcome the high reaction barrier.Therefore, how to improve electrocatalytic performance and reduce electrolytic overpotential are keys in realizing large-scale applications of electrocatalytic water splitting.Over the past few years, various methods have been developed to prepare electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting, mainly including the hydrothermal/solvothermal method, sol-gel method, electrochemical deposition, chemical bath deposition, chemical vapor deposition, and physical vapor deposition. Specifically, lasers have become an effective tool to prepare catalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting with advantages of being efficient, flexible, contactless, and highly controllable. Many corresponding advances have been achieved, but they still face a series of challenges in terms of industrial feasibility and performance improvement. Hence, it is important and necessary to summarize the existing research to guide the future development of this field more rationally.Progress Preparation methods of electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting based on lasers and their catalytic performances have been summarized. First, the implementation process of electrocatalytic water splitting, evaluation parameters, classification, and preparation methods of electrocatalysts are introduced. The evaluation parameters include overpotential, Tafel slope, stability, Faraday efficiency, and turnover frequency. Then, the catalytic performances of electrocatalysts prepared by laser are comprehensively summarized according to previously reported studies. Subsequently, powder catalysts by laser in liquid and self-supported catalytic electrodes with micronano structures by laser are elaborated. Considering the interaction mechanism, the preparation process of powder catalysts by laser can be divided into laser irradiation in liquid and laser ablation in liquid. Haimei Zheng's research group from University of California, Berkeley, has pioneered laser irradiation in liquid. Xiwen Du's research group from Tianjin University has engaged in plenty of systematic studies on laser ablation in liquid. Based on the preparation method, the preparation process of self-supported catalytic electrodes with micro-nano structures by laser can be divided into laser direct preparation and laser hybrid with other chemical synthesis methods. Currently, studies of self-supported catalytic electrodes by laser are limited and incomprehensive. In the end, the problems faced and ongoing research trends in this field are discussed, including the type of laser, the characterization and theoretical calculation of catalysts, the design of bifunctional catalysts, and the performance evaluations at industrial conditions.Conclusion and Prospect Lasers are gradually becoming a popular tool to prepare various functional materials. In summary, the preparation of micro -nano catalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting by laser still needs in-depth and detailed exploration to promote the development of this hydrogen production technology in academic and engineering aspects.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			0258-7025			WOS:000640971600009

Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)				58	10						10.3390/medicina58101414				2022 Oct 09	2022	Background and Objectives: Mounting evidence implicates oxidative damage in prostate carcinogenesis, contributing to modifications of macromolecules that drive cellular malignant transformation. Functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of enzymes involved in redox homeostasis can disrupt pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance, leading to accumulation of reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage. We investigated the potential role of genetic polymorphisms of antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1 rs1050450) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2 rs4880) and regulatory antioxidant protein nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2 rs6721961) in the susceptibility to prostate cancer development (PC) and prognosis. Materials and Methods: We conducted a case-control study consisting of 235 patients with PC and 240 controls. Gene polymorphisms were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers (PCR-CTTP) methods. Multiple risk models were composed to inspect the separate and mutual effect of multiple genes and in combination with acquired contributory factors on the risk of PC development. Results: Independently, carriers of at least one SOD2*C allele had increased risk of PC development, which was significantly further amplified in advanced statistical models. When tested in combination, individuals with both SOD2*C allele and Nrf2*C/C genotype were also at increased risk of PC development, which was augmented when combined with acquired contributory factors. During the mean 75 ± 25 months of follow-up, investigated gene polymorphisms did not affect overall survival. Conclusion: Our results suggest that these gene polymorphisms could be used as risk biomarkers of PC evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1648-9144		MEDLINE:36295574	36295574

However, one roadblock encountered in studying these binary oxide systems is the difficulty in describing the heterogeneities that occur in both structure and chemistry as a function of reaction coordinate. This is due to the complexity of the three-dimensional mosaic patterns that occur in these heterogeneous binary systems. By combining real-time imaging and chemical-sensitive electron tomography, we show that it is possible to characterize these systems with simultaneous nanoscale and chemical detail. We find that there is oxidation-induced chemical segregation occurring on both external and internal surfaces. Additionally, there is another layer of complexity that occurs during the oxidation, namely that the morphology of the initial oxide surface can change the oxidation modality. This work characterizes the pathways that can control the morphology in binary oxide materials.									46	4	0	0	3	0	48				2041-1723		WOS:000389492100001	27928998

The results indicated that the dependence of the critical fluoride concentration on pH (partial derivative pF/partial derivative pH) could be classified into two pH regions: partial derivative pF/partial derivative pH = -0.17 at region I (pH = 1.0 similar to 2.5) and partial derivative pF/partial derivative pH = -0.78 at region II (pH = 3.0 similar to 5.0), respectively. Electrochemical parameters for titanium in fluoride-containing acidic solutions were obtained by analyzing the polarization curves quantitatively. It was found that hydrogen evolution reaction controlled by charge transfer, and oxygen reduction reaction controlled by mass transfer dominated the cathodic reactions at Region I and Region II, respectively. The partial derivative pF/partial derivative pH values were calculated using the obtained parameters and were in line with the experimental results. Based on the calculations, the different partial derivative pF/partial derivative pH values between Region I and Region II were mainly determined by the anodic parameter, partial derivative lgI(m)/partial derivative pH, rather than the cathodic parameters. Accordingly, anodic reaction mechanisms were proposed considering the existence forms of the fluoride. They could be fully utilized to qualitatively explain the phenomenon of pH-related critical fluoride concentration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells utilize various disulfide oxidoreductases and redox-active cofactors to accelerate this oxidative reaction, and higher eukaryotes have diversified and refined these disulfide-introducing cascades over the course of evolution. Recent Advances: In the past decade, atomic resolution structures have been solved for an increasing number of disulfide oxidoreductases, thereby revealing the structural and mechanistic basis of cellular disulfide bond formation systems. Critical Issues: In this review, we focus on the evolution, structure, and regulatory mechanisms of endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductin 1 (Ero1) family enzymes, the primary disulfide bond-generating catalysts in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Detailed comparison of Ero1 with other oxidoreductases, such as Prx4, QSOX, Erv1/2, and disulfide bond protein B (DsbB), provides important insight into how this ER-resident flavoenzyme acts in a regulated and specific manner to maintain redox and protein homeostasis in eukaryotic cells. Future Directions: Currently, it is presumed that multiple pathways in addition to that mediated by Ero1 cooperate to achieve oxidative folding of many secretory and membrane proteins in mammalian cells. The important open question is how each oxidative pathway works distinctly or redundantly in response to various cellular conditions. Antioxid.

Herein, a 3D hierarchically structured nanotubular copper-doped nickel catalyst on nickel foam (NF) for HER is reported, denoted as Ni(Cu), via facile electrodeposition and selective electrochemical dealloying. The as-prepared Ni(Cu)/NF electrode holds superlarge electrochemical active surface area and exhibits Pt-like electrocatalytic activity for HER, displaying an overpotential of merely 27 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and an extremely small Tafel slope of 33.3 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution. The Ni(Cu)/NF electrode also shows excellent durability and robustness in both continuous and intermittent bulk water electrolysis. Density functional theory calculations suggest that Cu substitution and the formation of NiO on the surface leads to more optimal free energy for hydrogen adsorption. The lattice distortion of Ni caused by Cu substitution, the increased interfacial activity induced by surface oxidation of nanoporous Ni, and numerous active sites at Ni atom offered by the 3D hierarchical porous structure, all contribute to the dramatically enhanced catalytic performance. Benefiting from the facile, scalable preparation method, this highly efficient and robust Ni(Cu)/NF electrocatalyst holds great promise for industrial water-alkali electrolysis.									89	7	0	0	6	0	90			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000429579100016	29484816

A simple and transferable DFT approach to estimate these constant potential barriers for inner sphere electrochemical reactions is presented. The challenge of finding the transition state for an electrochemical reaction step (A*+ H+ + e(-) -> AH*, where * denotes surface-adsorbed species) is met by using an equivalent analogous non-electrochemical reaction (A*+ H* -> AH*). The transition state of the non-electrochemical step is referenced to an equilibrium potential (U-0), at which the analogous non-electrochemical state mu(H*) is in equilibrium with its equivalent electrochemical state mu(H+ + e(-)), allowing for the barrier to be referenced to the chemical potential of the ion in the bulk electrolyte. The potential-dependence is incorporated by extrapolating the activation energy using Marcus theory. The first elementary step of CO2 electroreduction to COOH* is used as a detailed example case for illustrating the method. Additional elementary reduction reactions involving C-H, O-H and N-H bond formations are included to demonstrate the transferability of the method. The method is simple and easy to implement to approximate potential dependent activation energies at the computational cost of a singly hydrogenation barrier calculation and can aid in the development of more active and selective catalysts for electrochemical reactions.

The products were mainly characterized by microscopic analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), followed by discussing the formation mechanism in details. The electrochemical characterizations were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry (CA). The results revealed that the prepared architectures had the biggest current density (58.4 mA cm(-2)) for ethylene glycol oxidation, which is 3.5-fold, 1.2-fold, 2.3-fold and 2.4-flod enhancement relative to those of home-made single Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and Pd NPs, commercial Pt black and Pd black catalysts, respectively. Also, the obtained Pt@Pd NCs showed improved catalytic activity and stability towards glycerol oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions compared to the references. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We develop here a facile and scalable "delignification-impregnation-carbonization" strategy to fabricate uniformly dispersed NiFe alloy nanoparticles anchored on bamboo stick-derived N-doped carbon fibers (NiFe@N-CFs) as an air cathode for flexible Zn-air batteries. Benefiting from the inherent cellulose fibers with abundant macroporous structures in the raw bamboo stick, the lignified carbon fibers possess an interconnected porous structure. In addition to having high electrical conductivity endowed by one-dimensional carbon fibers, this porous structure is favorable for exposure of more active surface sites for electrochemical reactions and fast mass transport. Moreover, the strong metal-support interaction between NiFe nanoparticles and N-doped carbon and their synergistic effect may also contribute to the catalytic performance. Consequently, the resultant electrocatalyst displays excellent catalytic activity and stability toward oxygen electrocatalysis with a remarkably small potential gap (Delta E) of 0.71 V between the half-wave potential (E-1/2) of the ORR and the potential at 10 mA cm(-2)(E-j=10) of the OER. When employed as a bifunctional air cathode in a liquid Zn-air battery, the NiFe@N-CF based device can achieve a peak power density of 102 mW cm(-2)and specific capacity of 729 mA h g(Zn)(-1)and can be steadily cycled for 150 h at 10 mA cm(-2), which is extraordinary. The NiFe@N-CFs can also be used as a self-supporting air cathode in a flexible quasi-solid-state Zn-air battery, showing high round-trip efficiency and mechanical stability. This work provides a new avenue for the development of energy-related devices by converting biomass into advanced electrodes.									51	3	0	0	2	0	53			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000548452100029

The obtained WC crystals were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and electrochemical methods. Hexagonal WC was successfully prepared when the temperature was as low as 500 degrees C. The content of carbon was more than that of W and the composition of the treated sample was C and WC only. The diameter of WC nanocrystals was ranged from 40 to 70 nm and the crystal was dispersed on C films. The WC nanocrystals promoted the Pt/C electrocatalyst ability obviously for the oxygen reduction reaction with the onset potential over 173 mV, which was more positive compared with that of the traditional Pt/C electrocatalyst.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			0253-9837	1872-2067		WOS:000258484400005

Thus, it is shown through various case studies how high-throughput transient kinetics may both accelerate the search for new catalytic materials and bring fundamental insights in reaction mechanisms. As a first case study, the cracking reactions of the C-6 isomers (n-hexane, 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, 2,3-dimethylbutane, and 2,3-dimethylbutane) over a fluidised catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst at temperatures between 300 and 650 degreesC have been studied in a temporal-analysis-of-product (TAP) reactor. A mathematical model taking into account the extra- and intracrystalline transport phenomena was used to determine the diffusion, sorption, and kinetic parameters for the hydrocarbons studied. Sorption and diffusion decrease with increasing branching in agreement with literature data. Except product distribution, the activation energies for the overall cracking of the C-6 isomers are similar for all isomers. As a second case study, a "paralleled" TAP reactor with a multisample holder is shown to be an efficient tool for acquiring adsorption/desorption parameters for a series of zeolites, tested to evaluate their potential as catalyst supports in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. Finally, the applied combinatorial study was found also suitable for discovering new materials precursors of dense oxygen-conducting membranes. From high-throughput transient TAP and TPD experiments, it was possible to derive a strategy directing the rapid combinatorial evolution within the available parameter space. It was shown that high-quality information is accessible from these data, providing all parameters necessary for a well fitting description with a kinetic model. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Here, we report gas-permeable shells formed on Rh nanoparticles with enhanced activity and durability for the surface reaction. First, Fe species were doped into ceria, enhancing the transfer of surface oxygen species. When Rh was deposited onto the Fe-doped ceria (FC) and reduced, a shell was formed on Rh nanopartides. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) results show that the shell is formed upon reduction and removed upon oxidation reversibly. CO adsorption on the Rh surface through the shell was confirmed by ayo-DRIFTS. The reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction (CO2 + H-2 -> CO + H2O) occurred on the encapsulated Rh nanoparticles effectively with selective CO formation, whereas bare Rh nanopartides deposited on ceria produced methane as well. The CO adsorption became much weaker on the encapsulated Rh nanopartides, and H-2-spillover occurred more on the FC, resulting in high activity for RWGS. The exposed Rh nanoparticles deposited on ceria presented degradation at 400 degrees C after 150 h of RWGS, whereas the encapsulated Rh nanoparticles showed no degradation with superior durability. Enhancing surface oxygen transfer can be an efficient way to form gas-permeable overlayers on metal nanoparticles with high activity and durability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2691-3704		WOS:000805741400011	35647595

However, the poor electron transportation ability in BCN leads to a low reactivity of oxygen functional groups (-C=O and-B-OH). Herein, we present a generalized strategy to promote the catalytic activity of BCN through in situ encapsulation of transition-metal (Fe, Co, Ni) nanoparticles within BCN nanotubes (BCNNTs). Among them, individual metal particles themselves do not contribute directly on ODH reactions and mainly serve as electron modulators to tune the electron density of-C=O and-B-OH active sites on BCNNTs. As a result, catalytic activities of all metal@BCNNTs catalysts surpass pure BCN in ethylbenzene (EB) ODH reactions, among which Fe@BCNNTs displays a significant activity enhancement with 36 % EB conversion with the styrene (ST) selectivity remaining >98% under gentle reaction conditions. Structural and kinetic analyses proved that the promotion effect originated from the strong interactions between metal nanoparticles and BCNNTs. The theoretical calculations disclosed that the enhanced ODH activity was due to the electron transfer from the encapsulated metal to BCNNTs, which increases the electron transportation ability and electron density of BCNNTs, thus promoting the nucleophilicity of-C=O and-B-OH active sites, leading to the reduced activation energy barrier for-C-H bond dissociation. The present work sets forth the structure function relationship, identifying opportunities for rational design of highly efficient BCN catalysts for ODH reactions. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Defect engineering has been illustrated to be an effective strategy to improve the catalytic activity and selectivity of electrocatalysts via changing the electronic states as well as creating additional active sites for reduction reactions. Thus far, various approaches have been adopted to tune the physical and chemical properties of catalyst materials by means of inducing defects of different types and varying their concentrations or locations in host materials. In this review, the mechanisms and design principles of defective electrocatalysts for the NRR are introduced, and the refined synthesis and characterization techniques of defect engineering are systematically summarized. Based on the recent advances in defect engineering of electrocatalysts for the NRR, the roles of various defect states, such as vacancies and the amorphous phase, in the catalytic enhancement mechanism are comprehensively discussed. Finally, perspectives on the challenges and opportunities in developing new cost-effective and high-efficiency NRR catalysts for practical applications are outlined.									29	2	0	0	0	0	29			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000530495500001

In spite of extensive interest in and work on this material, a systematic atomistic understanding of the combined role of faceting and heteroatom doping for hydrogen evolution on WC electrocatalysts in aqueous solution is not available. To fill this knowledge gap, here we explore the interplay of these parameters for the electrocatalytic performance of WC by means of density functional theory (DFT) simulations. In our simulations, we explicitly account for solvent (water) effects and related electrochemical potential-dependent oxygen or hydroxyl (co)adsorption on the WC surfaces as determined by the analysis of surface Pourbaix diagrams. Among the several low-index WC surfaces screened, the DFT simulations indicate that the W-terminated (-100) and (111) surfaces of WC show comparable exchange currents of 3.908 and 0.133 mA/cm(2), respectively. The simulations also suggest that V or N doping can substantially increase the HER activity of some WC surfaces to levels comparable to commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts, with current densities as large as 10.555, 1.730, and 0.636 mA/cm(2) for the V-doped W-terminated (001), V-doped (101), and N-doped (101) WC surfaces, respectively. The improved HER activities are rationalized in terms of the d-band or p-band center, which are both shown to be related to the capability of tuning the hydrogen adsorption, and thence the HER performance. The calculated strong dependence of the HER activity on the presence of the electrochemical adsorption of oxygen and hydroxyls reiterates the importance of modeling realistic electrochemical conditions for WC pristine or doped surfaces. We expect the DFT results presented to provide timely and original guidelines for further theoretical and experimental studies of HER activity on WC-related electrocatalysts.									7	2	0	0	0	0	7			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000626769100030

In this study, the catalytic performance of CO2RR on defective graphene-supported Cu4S2 clusters as well as isolated Cu4Xn (X = O, S, Se; n = 2, 4) was systematically investigated based on density functional theory (DFT) computations. Calculation results revealed that the most thermodynamically feasible product is CH3OH among the C1 products on Cu4X2 clusters, in which the Cu4S2 cluster has the best activity concerning CH3OH synthesis with a limiting potential of -0.48 V. When the Cu4S2 cluster was further supported on defective graphene, the strong interaction between cluster and substrate could greatly improve the performance via tuning the electronic structure and improving the stability of the Cu4S2 cluster. The calculated free energy diagram indicated that it is also more energetically preferable for CH3OH production with a low limiting potential of -0.35 V. Besides, the defective graphene support has a significant ability to suppress the competing reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO and HCOOH production. Geometric structures, limiting potentials, and reduction pathways were also discussed to gain insight into the reaction mechanism and to find the minimum-energy pathway for C1 products. We hope this work will provide theoretical reference for designing and developing advanced supported Cu-based electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000803178400001

The effects caused by the presence of low-coordinated atoms on the catalyst were taken into consideration by using the stepped Au(321) surface. A careful analysis of several reaction mechanisms was made and it is concluded that if hydrogen species are not available on the catalyst surface, the N-O bond cleavage will proceed through the ON2O and N2O intermediates while CO reacts directly with formed oxygen adatoms. If hydrogen species are available on the catalyst, the reaction will occur via the NOH and N2O intermediates. However, the reaction has to compete with a more favorable route, where NH3 instead of N-2 is obtained after formation of NOH and NHxOH intermediates. The calculations agree also with the experimental observation of the NCO intermediate species which is formed without energy cost from combination of CO and N fragments. The NCO species is very probably a spectator at moderate temperatures since its evolution toward N-2 and CO2 is less favorable than other possible routes studied in this work. Finally, calculated reaction rate constants at three different temperatures show that most of the reactions studied are only possible at moderately high temperature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

An approach to analysis of high level waste container performance in an unsaturated repository environment								Scientific Basis for Nuclear Waste Management XVII. Symposium								863	6						1994	1994	One of the requirements for the performance of waste packages prescribed in 10CFR 60.113 is that the high level waste must be `substantially completely' contained for a minimum period of 300 to 1000 years. During this period, the radiation and thermal conditions in the engineered barrier system and the near-field environment are dominated by fission product decay. In the present US design of the engineered barrier system, the outer container plays a dominant role in maintaining radionuclide containment. A quantitative methodology for analyzing the performance of the container is described in this paper. This methodology enables prediction of the evolution of the waste package environment in terms of temperature fields, stability of liquid water on the container surface, and concentration of aggressive ions such as chloride. The initiation and propagation of localized corrosion is determined by the corrosion potential of the container material and critical potentials for localized corrosion. The corrosion potential is estimated from the kinetics of the anodic and cathodic reactions including oxygen diffusion through scale layers formed on the container surface. The methodology described is applicable to a wide range of metals, alloys and environmental conditions.					Scientific Basis for Nuclear Waste Management XVII.

J	Rodriguez, JA; Jirsak, T; Chaturvedi, S; Kuhn, M								Reaction of SO2 with ZnO(000(1)over-bar)-O and ZnO powders: photoemission and XANES studies on the formation of SO3 and SO4								SURFACE SCIENCE				442	3			400	412		10.1016/S0039-6028(99)00952-8				DEC 1 1999	1999	Synchrotron-based high-resolution photoemission and X-ray absortion near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) have been used to study the interaction of SO2 with ZnO(000 (1) over bar)-O and polycrystalline films and bulk powders of ZnO. The adsorption of SO2 on the (000 (1) over bar) oxygen-terminated face of ZnO at 110 K produced SO3 species which were stable up to temperatures well above 400 K. On polycrystalline ZnO, the Zn<->SO2 interactions were very weak, there was no decomposition of the admolecule, and evidence for bonding of zinc to SO2 was found only at low temperatures (similar to 100 K) when the adsorbate had a limited mobility on the surface. At 300 K and moderate pressures, SO2 only reacted with the oxygen centers of ZnO forming mainly SO3 groups. Part of the formed SO3 decomposed at temperatures between 400 and 600 K with evolution of SO2 into the gas phase (ZnSO3,solid-->SO2,gas + ZnOsolid). At 600 K, a significant amount of SO2 was still present on the ZnO systems. Reaction with O-2 led to an SO3-->SO4 transformation on ZnO(000 (1) over bar)-O and powders of ZnO previously exposed to SO2. SO4 was directly formed during the adsorption of SO2 on polycrystalline surfaces of zinc oxide that were rich in oxygen atoms which had a low coordination number (<3) and a relatively high mobility. On ZnO(000 (1) over bar)-O and polycrystalline ZnO, there was no decomposition of sulfur dioxide. Promotion with potassium and cesium facilitated the cleavage of S-O bonds. After dosing SO2 to (root 3 x root 3)-K/ZnO(000 (1) over bar)-O and (root 3 x root 3)-Cs/ZnO(000 (1) over bar)-O at 300 K, several sulfur species (S, SO3, SO4) coexisted on the alkali-metal-promoted surfaces whereas only SO3 was formed on the pure ZnO(000 (1) over bar)-O system.

However, current system still suffers from weak reagent supply and high reaction barrier, and modulating the structural/electronic configurations of electrocatalysts with optimized properties plays a vital role for achieving efficient NRR. Herein, distorted spinel ferrite heterostructure is rationally designed via large-scale substitution of alkaline earth metal with large atomic radius, and serves as a highly active and selective NRR electrocatalyst. The distorted structure generates superior N2 affinity to realize its localization, which is beneficial for the following adsorption. Moreover, the number of electrons occupied at the Fermi level of active sites is greatly increased, so that the electron transfer to the adsorbed N2 is efficiently facilitated and the reaction barrier is significantly reduced. Such optimized electronic structure also dramatically increases the reaction barrier of hydrogen evo-lution reaction (HER), allowing H+ to preferentially participate in the nitrogen hydrogenation. With boosted NRR and suppressed HER, an outstanding NRR performance with a superior Faradaic efficiency of 76.7 % and a high NH3 yield rate of 36.4 mu g h-1 mg-1 is achieved under ambient conditions. This work offers valuable insights into the rational design of spinel ferrite for efficient electrocatalysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000841966400004

FromUV-vis spetroscopy of the solution for the deposition and their characterization it was concluded that a mixture of Ir(III)/Ir(IV) monomers participates in the deposition of IrOx film. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of IrOx films indicated that both types of films contained hydrated Ir(IV) hydroxide as the dominant species, but in the film deposited by potential cycling the presence of the additional Ir(III) species was evident. The scanning electon microscopy (SEM) analysis of the surface morphology revealed that films deposited by potential cycling were more uniform than the films deposited at a constant potential. The amount of electrochemically active Ir-species on the surface of deposited IrOx films was estimated from the voltammetric charge of the Ir(III)/Ir(IV) transition. Depending on the film electrodeposition parameters, the values between 15 and 1080 nmol cm-2 were obtained. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of IrOx films was calculated from cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements and ranged from 3 to 131 cm(2) per 1 cm(2) of geometric surface area for various films. The activity and stability of IrOx films toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was investigated in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution under potentiostatic conditions. The intrinsic activity, stated as turnover frequency and specific current density normalized per ECSA, showed that the OER activity of IrOx films deposited by potential cycling are up to two and a half times higher than the activity of films deposited at a constant anodic potential. Potentiostatic stability test showed a decrease in OER current over time for both type of the films. Determination of ECSA, the amount of electroactive Ir species, XPS spectrum and SEM imaging after the test indicated that the decrease in OER activity was caused by partial dissolution and delamination of the film as well as by oxidation of highly active hydroxide Ir(III) species.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000648498200009

The range of conditions spans temperatures from 773 to 2500 K, equivalence ratios from pure pyrolysis to very fuel-lean and pressures from 0.3 to 1.5 atm. New experimental results from the oxidation of formaldehyde in flow reactors at 1095 K are reported. The original model, based on reaction rate constants obtained in the literature, was modified based on comparisons of calculated and experimental results. Recommended changes were guided by extensive sensitivity and flux analysis for each case, as well as on the current knowledge of uncertainties in reaction rate constant values. The comprehensive mechanistic features of formaldehyde oxidation at low and high temperatures are discussed. The results of the analysis reveal the key role of HO, radicals up to temperatures around 1100 K, through the cycle HCO + O2 --> CO + HO2, CH2O + HO2 --> HCO + H2O2 and H2O2 + M --> OH + OH + M. Shock tube data are revisited using more recent rate constants to verify the model. Finally, the competition between formyl radical reactions HCO + M --> H + CO + M and HCO + O2 --> CO + HO2, which determines the rate of production of H radicals, was found to be the primary controlling factor in the evolution of lean formaldehyde flames. A matrix of influences of the most important reaction rates on the calculated parameters for the different experimental conditions summarizes the conclusions.									46	3	0	0	0	0	48			0010-2180			WOS:A1992JZ30900005

These dependences make it possible to identify the contributions to the sensor response from the reactions of carbon monooxide with the atomic and molecular forms of chemisorbed oxygen. The time evolution of the response suggests that the thin films are heated due to the exothermicity of the oxidation of CO and a sharp increase in the electric current flowing through the film. At 230-250degreesC, the amplitude and time of response attain their optimal values, a circumstance that makes it possible to use the studied films for detecting CO in a wide concentration range, from 10 to 1000 ppm.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0036-0244			WOS:000224996900027

Though in the combined redox dissociation of water into oxygen and hydrogen no protons and electrons occur, both half reactions show photoinduced proton coupled electron transfer (PCET). Regarding a classical approach, photosensitizers (PS) deliver electrons and protons that are accepted by water reduction catalysts (WRC) containing suitable basic atoms like nitrogen working as proton relays. However, the mechanisms of PCET reactions differ, where concerted proton electron transfer (CPET) is an elementary step. In CPET simultaneous electron and proton transfer occurs in the femtoseconds range, being rapid when compared to the periods for coupled vibrations and solvent modes. This has to be distinguished from stepwise electron and proton transfer, leading to underlying thermodynamics of the intermediates. DFT calculations based on X-ray diffraction (XRD) data help to specify the different reaction pathways. A plethora of experimental procedures are used in order to verify the theoretical predictions. Among them femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopic measurements play an important role. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry (CV) has proven to be also a powerful tool. In the case of electrochemical PCET rotating-disk electrode voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and spectroelectrochemistry complete the experimental tools.

In recent years, Au-based nanostructured materials have been considered as one of the most promising non-platinum (Pt) electrocatalysts. The controlled synthesis of Au-based NPs and NCs and the delicate microstructure adjustment play a vital role in regulating their catalytic activity toward various reactions. This review focuses on the latest progress in the synthesis of efficient Au-based NP and NC electrocatalysts, highlighting the relationship between Au nanostructures and their catalytic activity. This review first discusses the parameters of Au-based nanomaterials that determine their electrocatalytic performance, including composition, particle size and architecture. Subsequently, the latest electrocatalytic applications of Au-based NPs and NCs in various reactions are provided.

In cyclic voltammetric experiments, the anodic response shows a strong dependence on the magnitude and the time spent at negative potentials, particularly in the case of relatively thick films, while the cathodic peak remains essentially unaffected by these variables. Potential step experiments show unusual maxima and peculiar anodic-to-cathodic charge ratios. These results have been explained in terms of ion/solvent injection/expulsion processes which take place during film oxidation-reduction and a disproportionation reaction which occurs within the oxide film under non-steady-state conditions.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0022-0728			WOS:A1991HJ07400018

The results showed that the designed nanosystem photocatalysts were successfully fabricated, with intimate interfacial contact between g-C3N4 and Fe2O3 and uniform distribution of Pt and Au on the surface of g-C3N4 which can significantly improve the photocatalytic activity compared to its constituents. Localized surface plasmon resonance of Au, Z-scheme heterojunction interaction of two semiconductors, Schottky barriers and active sites of Pt can effectively promote hydrogen production. The photocatalytic mechanism of the produced system is suggested. The H-2-evolution rate of 4.6 mu mol h(-1) mg(-1) was achieved and the synthesized samples exhibited good photocatalytic stability in recycling H-2 evolution. This work provides a new way to design effective photocatalysts for splitting water under solar light, which can simultaneously extend light absorption range for better electron-hole generation, reduce carrier recombination and increase H+ absorption for efficient H-2 production.									25	2	0	0	2	0	25			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000474530600080

Mathematical modelling of spatio-temporal glioma evolution								THEORETICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICAL MODELLING				10						47	10.1186/1742-4682-10-47				JUL 24 2013	2013	Background: Gliomas are the most common types of brain cancer, well known for their aggressive proliferation and the invasive behavior leading to a high mortality rate. Several mathematical models have been developed for identifying the interactions between glioma cells and tissue microenvironment, which play an important role in the mechanism of the tumor formation and progression.Methods: Building and expanding on existing approaches, this paper develops a continuous three-dimensional model of avascular glioma spatio-temporal evolution. The proposed spherical model incorporates the interactions between the populations of four different glioma cell phenotypes (proliferative, hypoxic, hypoglychemic and necrotic) and their tissue microenvironment, in order to investigate how they affect tumor growth and invasion in an isotropic and homogeneous medium. The model includes two key variables involved in the proliferation and invasion processes of cancer cells; i.e. the extracellular matrix and the matrix-degradative enzymes concentrations inside the tumor and its surroundings. Additionally, the proposed model focuses on innovative features, such as the separate and independent impact of two vital nutrients, namely oxygen and glucose, in tumor growth, leading to the formation of cell populations with different metabolic profiles. The model implementation takes under consideration the variations of particular factors, such as the local cell proliferation rate, the variable conversion rates of cells from one category to another and the nutrient-dependent thresholds of conversion. All model variables (cell densities, ingredients concentrations) are continuous and described by reaction-diffusion equations.Results: Several simulations were performed using combinations of growth and invasion rates, for different evolution times. The model results were evaluated by medical experts and validated on experimental glioma models available in the literature, revealing high agreement between simulated and experimental results.Conclusions: Based on the experimental validation, as well as the evaluation by clinical experts, the proposed model may provide an essential tool for the patient-specific simulation of different tumor evolution scenarios and reliable prognosis of glioma spatio-temporal progression.									15	0	0	0	8	0	15			1742-4682			WOS:000322726700001	23880133

In this work, polyallylamine-encapsulated Ir metallene with defects and porous structure (Ir@PAH metallene) is easily fabricated by a one-step wet chemical reduction method. The Ir@PAH metallene exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with an overpotential of only 14 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 31.2 mV dec(-1), and almost no activity decay after stability test. The abundant defects and pores as well as several-atomic-layer nanosheet structures of Ir@PAH metallene provide a large specific surface area, high conductivity, and efficient mass transport/diffusion. In addition, surface-functionalized PAH molecules can modulate the electronic structure through strong Ir-N interaction and act as proton carriers to capture hydrogen ions, which is very beneficial for the HER in acidic media. This work provides a useful strategy for the synthesis of the defective and porous metallene with functionalized surfaces for various catalytic applications.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000778205800001	35263473

Here, we report a one-pot aqueous synthesis of versatile NiPd nanostructures at room temperature without employing organic solvents or surfactants. The synthesis can be tuned to form zero-dimensional (0D) architectures, such as core-shell and hollow nanoparticles (NPs), as well as nanostructures with higher dimensionality, such as extended nanowire networks and three-dimensional (3D) nanodendrites. The diverse morphologies were successfully obtained through modification of the HCl concentration in the Pd precursor solution, and the reaction aging time. An in-depth understanding of the formation mechanism and morphology evolution are described in detail. A key factor in the structural evolution of the nanostructures was the ability to tune the reduction rate and to protonate the citrate stabiliser by adding HCl. Spherical core-shell NPs were formed by the galvanic replacement-free deposition of Pd on Ni NPs which can be transformed to hollow NPs via a corrosion process. High concentrations of HCl led to the transition of isotropic spherical NPs into anisotropic wormlike nanowire networks, created through an oriented attachment process. Aging of these nanowire networks resulted in the formation of 3D porous nanodendrites via a corrosion process. The diverse structures of NiPd NPs were anchored onto acid treated-activated carbon (AC) and exhibited improved catalytic efficiency towards the hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP).

The phase composition, lattice parameter and the microstructure of products after treatment at different temperatures and under different conditions were analyzed by XRD, SEM and TEM. The results show that TiN/AI2O3 composite ceramics can be produced in coke bed via aluminothermic reduction reaction or in flowing nitrogen. However, the treating temperature and atmosphere affects the evolution of aluminothermic reaction and morphology of products obviously. The TiN content, grain size and lattice parameter of TiN in products in coke bed were much lower than those in nitrogen stream. Thermodynamically it is confirmed that metal Al reacts with oxygen in coke bed while it is involved in aluminothermic reduction reaction, which caused the lack of Al taking part in the aluminothermic reaction and led to a surplus rutile in the products.									0	0	0		0	0	0			1002-185X			INSPEC:9709079

Many efficient and cost-affordable electrocatalysts have been reported in the development of electrochemical OER and CO2RR; however, during the electro-derived oxidation or reduction processes, a critical fact that, most catalysts tend to undergo structural reconstruction and/or surface rearrangement, has been widely observed, which greatly subverts the traditional conception of "catalysts". In this respect, the research trends have gradually transferred from optimizing catalyst materials to elucidating the real active sites of the catalysts as well as understanding the underlying mechanisms behind these complex reactions. Most importantly, the in situ/operando characterization techniques are powerful tools to achieve this goal. Herein, recent advances in the in situ X-ray diffraction and absorption spectroscopy that have provided a unique opportunity to investigate the structural reconstruction and/or surface rearrangement of catalysts under realistic OER and CO2RR conditions are thoroughly reviewed. Finally, the challenges of the material design are discussed, and the future perspective for developing next-generation catalysts with imperative requirements of material nature is provided.									77	3	0	0	4	0	78			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000642435400009		
J	Fischer, M; Warneck, P								Photodecomposition and photooxidation of hydrogen sulfite in aqueous solution								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY				100	37			15111	15117		10.1021/jp953236b				SEP 12 1996	1996	A zinc are lamp and a mercury lamp, respectively, were used to study the photodecomposition of HSO3- and SO32- in aqueous solutions saturated with either argon or nitrous oxide. The main products in both cases were sulfate and dithionate, which are attributed to arise from the self-reaction of SO3- radicals. Quantum yields for the formation of SO3- in argon-saturated solution based on hydrazoic acid and/or ferric oxalate actinometry were 0.19 +/- 0.03 for HSO3- and 0.39 +/- 0.03 for SO32-, essentially independent of S(IV) concentration. In both systems, the rate of sulfate formation rose with time at the expense of that of dithionate, This is explained by reactions of hydrogen atoms and hydrated electrons with dithionate (rate coefficient k(5) approximate to 2 x 10(5) dm(3) mol(-1) s(-1)). N2O as a scavenger for these radicals removed the effect and raised the quantum yields to 0.25 +/- 0.03 and 0.75 +/- 0.04, respectively. The product ratios under these conditions were [S2O62-]/[SO42-] = 0.43 +/- 0.04 for HSO3- and 0.61 +/- 0.03 for SO32-. In oxygen-saturated solutions, the photolysis of HSO3- led to a short chain reaction with sulfate and peroxodisulfate as products. The latter product was assigned to arise from the recombination of SO5- radicals. Steady state analysis of the product evolution with time gave rate coefficients for two of the reactions involved: k(16)(SO5- + HSO3-) = (1.2 +/- 0.4) x 10(4) dm(3) mol(-1) s(-1) for the main propagation reaction and k(19a)(HO2 + SO5-) = (1.8 +/- 1.0) x 10(9) dm(3) mol(-1) s(-1) for the principal termination reaction. These values agree well with recent data from radiolysis experiments.									94	7	0	0	61	0	101			0022-3654			WOS:A1996VG90300017

To solve these problems, phosphorus-doped g-C3N4 with a porous structure was constructed. Benefiting from enhanced light absorption and electron-hole separation efficiency, PCNT has intensive oxygen activation ability to generate superoxide radicals, and is highly active in organic synthesis. In addition, PCNT has enhanced surface nucleophilicity, which is conducive to the carbon-carbon coupling process of the intermediate product benzaldehyde molecules and benzyl alcohol molecules in the benzoin condensation reaction. Metal-free PCNT is expected to replace the previously used highly toxic cyanide catalysts and provide a new way for the low-cost and efficient photocatalytic synthesis of benzoin.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000637953200024	35423808

The composite photocatalyst exhibits double the O-2-production activity than that of bare Ag3PO4 under visible light irradiation. Moreover, it exhibits enhanced activity in comparison to unsupported Ag3PO4/Ag/AgBr, to graphene-supported bare Ag3PO4 powder as well as to Ag/AgBr powder. This increase in activity is attributed to a combination of depletion of the conduction band of the as-synthesized n-doped Ag3PO4 material and a downshift of the Ag3PO4 valence band due to the pinning of its conduction band at the silver Fermi level, a process that is assisted by charge transfer and distribution onto the graphene support.									118	3	0	0	11	0	121			1932-7447			WOS:000309150200002

Results of electrochemical characterization with emphasis on the activity of the catalyst are presented, which was demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) employing a rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique. The experiments show that the as-prepared MnO2 catalyst with nanotube structure exhibited high electro-catalytic activity and stability during battery discharge, charge and cycling processes in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The primary Zn-air battery showed a discharge peak power density similar to 293 mW cm(-2), which corresponds to the energy density similar to 725 mA hg(-1). The rechargeable Zn-air battery exhibited a small charge-discharge voltage polarization of similar to 0.7 V at 10 mA cm(-2), high reversibility and stability over short charge and discharge cycles, and similar to 1.1 V for a long charge and discharge cycles test.					6th International Conference on Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development (ICEESD)6th International Conference on Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development (ICEESD)	MAR 11-12, 2017MAR 11-12, 2017	Jiangsu Univ Sci & Technol; Shanghai Univ Elect PowerJiangsu Univ Sci & Technol; Shanghai Univ Elect Power	Zhuhai, PEOPLES R CHINAZhuhai, PEOPLES R CHINA	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2352-5401		978-94-6252-328-9	WOS:000414083700184

Herein, we investigate the effect of Sr-substitution in a series of La2-xSrxNiO4+delta Ruddlesden-Popper catalysts on the electrooxidations of urea, methanol, and ethanol and conclude that activities toward the urea oxidation reaction increase with increasing Ni oxidation state. The 75% Sr-substituted La0.5Sr1.5NiO4+delta catalyst exhibits a mass activity of 588 mA mg(ox)(-1) and 7.85 A mg(-1) cm(ox)(-2) for the electrooxidation of urea in 1 M KOH containing 0.33 M urea, demonstrating the potential applications of Ni-based Ruddlesden-Popper materials for direct urea fuel cells and low-cost hydrogen production. Additionally, we find the same correlations between Ni oxidation state and activities for the electrooxidations of methanol and ethanol, as well as identify processes that result in catalyst deactivation for all three oxidations. This demonstration of how systematically increasing Ni - O bond covalency by raising the formal oxidation state of Ni above +3 serves to increase catalyst activity for these reactions will act as a governing principle for the rational design of catalysts for the electrooxidation of urea and other small molecules going forward.									60	0	0	0	2	0	60			2155-5435			WOS:000460600600099

At Kyushu University Tandem accelerator Laboratory (KUTL), the measurement of He-4(C-12,O-16)gamma cross section is in progress in the energy range of astrophysical nuclear reaction. Since the charge state of product O-16 ions after passing through the gas target is spread and only one charge state can be measured at terminal detector, it is necessary to know the charge state distribution of O-16 ions passing through the He gas target precisely. Here, we report the charge state distribution of the O-16 recoils both experimentally and theoretically. Experimentally, we measured the equilibrium charge state distribution of O-16 ions in the windowless helium gas target with the beam energy of primary O-16 ions at 7.2, 4.5, and 3.45 MeV at KUTL. The measured results showed a Gaussian distribution for the charge state fraction. Theoretically, we proposed a framework for the charge state distribution study. Charge state distribution was computed by solving a set of differential equations including a series of charge exchange cross sections. For the ionization cross section, plane-wave Born approximation was applied and modified by taking target atomic screening as a function of momentum transfer into account. For the capture cross section, continuum distorted wave approximation was applied and the influence of the gas target density was taken into account in the process of electron capture. Using above charge exchange cross sections, the charge state evolution was simulated. According to the equilibrium distribution, we compared the theoretical calculation to the experimental data. After taking into account the density effects in the charge exchange process, the theoretical charge state distributions shows a good agreement with the experimental data. Both experimental and theoretical results are useful to understand the charge fraction of recoil oxygen created via He-4(C-12,O-16)gamma reaction, especially in the energy range of astrophysical nuclear reaction.

Optimal ORR catalysts should have moderate binding strength (Delta E-ads) with O-2-derived intermediates, where the metal species and its coordination numbers are the essential determining factors for Delta E-ads. However, in conventional non-noble-metal-based ORR catalysts, such as metal nitrogen-doped carbons, the metal species and its coordination structure cannot freely be chosen. In contrast, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which are cross-linked microporous polymers, have high design flexibility; as such, they can be purposefully designed by using a wide range of monomers. The present work investigated the adsorption strength of ORR intermediates on single 3d metal atoms (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) doped in COFs with different coordination structures using first-principles calculations toward the development of efficient non-noble-metal ORR catalysts. The adsorption strength of the intermediates was found to monotonically increase as either the number of d-electrons or coordination number of metal centers decreased, and a volcano-type relationship was observed between the adsorption energies of the intermediates and the theoretical ORR activities. Therefore, to develop efficient non-noble-metal-based ORR electrocatalysts, the adsorption strength should be tuned close to the volcano peak by an appropriate choice of metal species and/or coordination number as the control parameters. Considering the high designability of metal species and of its coordination numbers in COFs, COFs are expected to become the next-generation platform of supports of single-atom catalysts using the design direction provided by the present work.									25	2	0	0	0	0	27			2574-0962			WOS:000516665300046

However, their performance and large-scale practical applications are largely limited by poor durability and high overpotential on the air-cathode due to the slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER). Therefore, it is highly desired to exploit an ideal bifunctional catalyst to endow the obtained ZnABs with excellent ORR/OER catalytic performances. Herein, a new nonprecious-metal bifunctional catalyst of urchin-like NiCo2S4 microsphere synergized with sulfur-doped graphene nanosheets (S-GNS/NiCo2S4) is controllably designed and synthesized by simply tailoring the structure and electronic arrangement, which endow the as-prepared catalyst with excellent electroactivity and long-term durability toward ORR and OER. Importantly, ZnABs constructed by this outstanding catalyst exhibit high power density, small charge/discharge voltage gap, and excellent cycle stability, notably outperforming the more costly commercial Pt/C + Ir/C mixture catalyst. These excellent electrocatalytic performances together with the simplicity of the synthetic method, make the urchin-like NiCo2S4 microsphere/S-GNS hybrid nanostructure exhibit great promise as a superior air-cathode catalyst for high-performance rechargeable ZnABs.									174	13	0	0	5	0	175			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000427110100029

The silicon at the BC/TC interface, or very close to it, behaved as a reactive element promoting the rapid formation and stabilization of alpha-Al2O3 (TGO), and a second scale layer of mixed oxides and silicon-rich compounds, jointly limiting inward oxygen diffusion and resulting in thinner TGO layers, whose kinetic oxidation follows a subparabolic behavior, increasing oxidation life-span.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:000677546700003

Nonequilibrium local heating can enhance dehydration of alcohol in the pores of zeolite by preparing zeolite particles with carbon cores. Acceleration of electron transfer at the interface of solids under microwave irradiation was observed for photoreduction of violegen derivatives by cadmium sulfide and water oxidation at the surface of hematite electrodes.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1346-8804			WOS:000431286400007

In this Letter, we develop a nanoscale continuum model for the growth of Li2O2 crystals in lithium oxygen batteries with organic electrolytes, based on a theory of electrochemical nonequilibrium thermodynamics originally applied to Li-ion batteries. As in the case of lithium insertion in phase-separating LiFePO4 nanoparticles, the theory predicts a transition from complex to uniform morphologies of Li2O2 with increasing current. Discrete particle growth at low discharge rates becomes suppressed at high rates, resulting in a film of electronically insulating Li2O2 that limits cell performance. We predict that the transition between these surface growth modes occurs at current densities close to the exchange current density of the cathode reaction, consistent with experimental observations.									130	4	0	0	10	0	130			1948-7185			WOS:000328920700005	26296168

Talc commonly forms fine-grained, fibrous aggregates, or pseudomorphs after tremolite; abundant tremolite is included as impurities in the talc ore. Talc generally was derived from tremolite in calc-silicate rock within the dolomitic marble. Calc-silicate rock, consisting mainly of tremolite and diopside, was generated from silicic metasomatism during the prograde stage, which promoted decarbonation reactions until dolomite was exhausted locally. Hydrothermal alteration of calc-silicate rock to talc is marked by the addition of Mg and Si, and the leaching of Ca; Cr, Co, and Ni were relatively immobile during the retrograde stage. Contact metamorphism related to the granite intrusion generated the successive appearance of tremolite, diopside, and forsterite, or wollastonite-bearing assemblages in the marble, depending on the bulk rock composition. The X-CO2 content of the metamorphic fluids rose initially above X-CO2 = 0.6, and decreased steadily toward a water-rich composition with increasing temperature above 600 degreesC in the calcitic marble, while buffered reaction of the dolomitic marble occurred at higher X-CO2 conditions above 600 degreesC. Talc mineralization developed under metastable conditions with infiltration of large amounts of igneous fluids along a fault-shattered zone during the retrograde stage and is characterized by the loss of Ca2+ with the addition of Mg2+. Oxygen and carbon isotopic variations of carbonate and calc-silicate minerals are in agreement with theoretical relationships determined for decarbonation products of contact metamorphism. Talc formation temperatures obtained from oxygen isotope fractionation, T-X-CO2 relationships, and activity diagrams range from 380 to 400 degreesC. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, some questions remain regarding how their synthesis parameter influences the charge carrier dynamics and overall photocatalytic process. Here, we show that the product of the transient pseudophotoconductivity maximum (phi Sigma mu(max)) and half-lifetime (tau(1/2)), as evaluated by time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements, correlates well with the O-2 evolution rates of such oxyhalides. Such correlation in Bi4TaO8Cl is rationalized by the increased crystallite size and decreased Cl/Bi atomic ratio with the increasing calcination temperature. On the basis of this, we examined the processing temperature of the rarely studied PbBiO2Cl by TRMC analysis and demonstrate a 3-fold enhancement of its O-2 evolution rate (apparent quantum efficiency of 3%), which is among the best performances of oxyhalides prepared by a solid-state reaction. This study suggests that TRMC evaluation provides a facile means to examine the potential of semiconducting photocatalysts.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			2380-8195			WOS:000475827900011

Cobalt-substituted chlorophyll derivative (Co-Chl) in chloroplasts is first obtained by successively rinsing in hydrochloric acid and cobalt acetate solutions. After calcining in nitrogen to 800 degrees C, Co-Chl is transferred to Co-N-C; while other parts of chloroplasts adsorbed with Co ions are transferred to CoOx retaining the microarchitecture of chloroplasts. The abundant active Co-N-C sites are protected by circumjacent biocarbon and CoOx to avoid leakage and agglomeration, and at the same time can overcome the poor conductivity weakness of CoOx by directly transporting electrons to the carbonaceous skeleton. This unique synergistic effect, together with efficient bioarchitecture, leads to good electrocatalytical performance for the ORR. The onset and half-wave potentials are 0.89 and 0.82 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, with better durability and methanol tolerance than that of commercial Pt/C. Different from the traditional concept of biomorphic materials which simply utilize bioarchitectures, this work provides a new example of coupling bioderivative components with bioarchitectures into one integrated system to achieve good comprehensive performance for electrocatalysts.									78	7	0	0	3	0	78			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000459488300015	30632276

In situ generation of foaming agents by chemical reactions of ligands in PCP during carbonization provides a simple way to create lightweight carbon material with a foam-like microstructure. Among several substituents investigated, the nitro group has been shown to be the key to obtain the unique foam-like microstructure, which is due to the fast kinetics of gas evolution during carbonization. Foam-like microstructural carbon materials showed higher pore volume and specific capacitance compared to a microporous carbon.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000360829600019	26242622

Several flow field designs were investigated with respect to stable operation and high performance. Due to carbon dioxide and water production on the anode and cathode, respectively, methanol and oxygen access to the electrodes is hindered. During single cell operation the effect of both carbon dioxide evolution and water production on the current output was observed. The difference between parallel and serial feeding of both fuel and oxidant to the DMFC stack was also investigated. It was found that it is very important to remove reaction products from the active cell surface in order to ensure stable stack operation at low temperatures. The maximal power realised with the 12-cell direct methanol fuel cell stack was 30 W.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1615-6846	1615-6854		WOS:000208115500014

However, searching for cheap and efficient OER electrocatalysts still remains an urgent task. Herein, we develop a new strategy involving a one-step electrochemical deposition and dissolution method to fabricate hydrophilic porous CoS2/carbon nanotube (CNT) composites (CNT-CoS2). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy measurements confirm the formation of hydrophilic groups on the surface of the porous CoS2 during electrochemical oxidation. Our design holds several advantages. The electricity conductivity of CoS2 is increased by introducing CNTs as a conductive substrate. The porous nanostructures of CoS2 increase its surface area, and provide paths to promote charge and reactant transfer. The active edge sites modified with hydrophilic groups can increase the content of electrolyte-electrode contact points, increasing the intrinsic catalytic performance of CoS2. These factors allow CNT-CoS2 to achieve a low onset potential of 1.33 V vs. RHE, a stable current density (j) of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 290 mV, and excellent stability under alkaline conditions compared to that of IrO2. The comprehensive performance of the CNT-CoS2 electrocatalyst is comparable to or better than that of any reported noble metal-free OER catalyst, even RuO2 and IrO2. This facile synthesis strategy involving synchronous electrochemical deposition and dissolution should be easily adapted for large-scale water electrolysis.									38	1	0	0	2	0	38			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000402034400033	28498384

This research reports the design and development of affordable cobalt (Co) based metallosurfactant (CoCPC(I)) which performs under acidic medium (0.5 N H2SO4) for HER. Such a fabricated catalyst is able to lower the cathodic potentials efficiently and exhibits 130 mV onset potential and Tafel slope of 104 mVdec(-1) that depicts the presence of Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. The results of the studies confirm that our synthesized metallosurfactant forms metallomicelles on the surface of electrode and surface remains stable even after the electrochemical cycle. Further, the surfactant protects the metal centre as an active site for a longer time via forming metallo-micelles which helps to sustain activity. These outcomes reveal the efficient mass and charge transfer capability of CoCPC(I) which results in faster charge transfer kinetics. Therefore, the utilization of Co based metallosurfactant can split water easily, cost-effectively, and without using hazardous chemicals. Our demonstrated technology seems suitable for industrial applications due to features of large-scale production possibilities. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Orthorhombic phase molybdite (alpha-MoO3) was successfully synthesized via hydrothermal method and the structure was confirmed through standard characterizations. Electrochemical performance was explored to evaluate specific capacitance, current densities, and stability. Product-specific capacitances were 164, 243, and 350 F/g at 10 mV/s and current densities were 194, 305, and 440 mA/g. M3 electrode showed 84% retention toward oxygen evolution reaction activity. The chronoamperometry study was conducted over 10 h to determine the long-term stability of M3 electrode. It showed high stability and good conductivity. Thus, it can be said that MoO3 is a promising material to improve electrochemical performance and be used in preparing an efficient electrochemical energy conversion device.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000558707400151

The annealing effect has been studied by analyzing morphological and structural evolution of ZnO films quantitatively. A coarsening transition was found occurring at a temperature of about 790 ℃. For the annealed films above and below this temperature, the diffusion mechanisms of oxygen vacancies and znic interstitials are assigned to be responsible for the coarsening behaviors, respectively. The coarsening transition temperature also dominated the reaction between ZnO film and Si substrate. SiO_2 diffusing towards ZnO film occurred at high temperature and resulted in the considerable increase of inner stress in the films.			本文利用原子力显微镜、透射电子显微镜、X射线衍射等分析手段研究了反应射频磁控溅射截然不同的阶段,其临界转变温度在790℃附近。进一步分析表明,决定低温退火的晶粒长大机制为Zn填隙原子扩散机制,而决定高温退火时的晶粒长大机制为O空位扩散机制。界面分析结果显示：在临界转变温度以下,ZnO薄膜与基体Si之间基本不发生界面反应;在高温退火过程中,ZnO薄膜与基体Si之间的界面反应主要以氧化后的Si表面层向ZnO扩散的方式进行,并导致了薄膜应力的迅速增加,而界面反应开始之前的薄膜应力的变化,则是由于晶粒合并所引起的。						1	1	0		0	0	1			1000-6281			CSCD:3058540

The kinetic scheme of Shafizadeh and Chin is employed to describe the pyrolysis process. The light gases formed during the biomass pyrolysis is assumed to consist of methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen and water vapor with given mass fractions relevant to those found in the experiments of high heating conditions. The combustion model takes into account the reactions of oxygen with methane, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, tar and char as well as gasification of char with water vapor and carbon dioxide. Appropriate correlations taken from past studies are used for computation of the rate of these reactions.The model allows calculation of time and space evolution of various parameters including biomass and char densities, gaseous species and temperature. Different experimental data reported in the literature are employed to validate the pyrolysis and combustion models. The reasonable agreement obtained between the predictions and measured data reveals that the presented model is capable of successfully capturing various experiments of wood particle undergoing a pyrolysis or combustion process. In particular, the role of gas phase reactions within and adjacent to particle on the combustion process is examined. The results indicate that for the case of small particles in the order of millimeter size and less, one may neglect any effects of gas phase reactions. However, for larger particles, a combustion model may need to include hydrogen oxidation and even carbon monoxide combustion reactions.

Producer gas can be cleaned and directly used in internal combustion engines or can be converted to various attractive biofuels.The paper sludge is a byproduct produced from recycled cardboard and into pallets. This paper is focused on gasification of paper sludge and its real-time gas evolution through this process. Variables include temperature; equivalence ratio and superficial velocity were tested and analyzed. Results demonstrate that CO2 and H2 formation is favored at higher temperature and higher oxygen concentrations. CO production is ruled by oxidation and water shift reactions but it is difficult to determine from two single variables.

Electrochemical Investigation of the O-2(g),Ni/YSZ System Using Cyclic Voltammetry								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				157	5			P49	P52		10.1149/1.3356015				2010	2010	Cyclic voltammetry was used for the electrochemical study of a Ni thin film (similar to 880 nm) deposited on an yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) solid electrolyte pellet at temperatures between 350 and 450 degrees C at 20 kPa O-2 and atmospheric pressure. NiO formed electrochemically by the O2- species supplied from the electrolyte upon anodic polarization, while it grew according to the parabolic growth law, in agreement with Wagner's oxidation theory of metals at high temperatures. A model for the NiO formation was proposed, where NiO is formed at the Ni/YSZ interface and grows by the outward diffusion of Ni2+ species through NiO, which is determined as the rate-limiting step. This implies the autoinhibition of NiO formation by its continuous growth. The above result agrees with Wagner's theory; however, a difference between the latter and the current model is the means of supplying oxygen for NiO formation. Also, O-2 evolution reaction is not firmly affected by NiO formation because it is controlled by the electronic current. An apparent activation energy of the limiting Ni2+ diffusion step was calculated to be 35 kJ/mol under 400 mV and decreased with potential increase.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0013-4651			WOS:000276555300091

The MoSe2/NiSe2 NWs are composed of 2D nanosheets, and they are uniformly and tightly distributed on CFP. The electrochemical measurement suggests that only an overpotential of 249 mV (vs. the RHE) is required to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4, which is lower by 56 and 96 mV as compared to MoSe2 (305 mV) and NiSe2 (345 mV). The Tafel slope of MoSe2/NiSe2 NWs is 46.9 mV dec(-1) and is substantially smaller than those of MoSe2 (69.2 mV dec(-1)) and NiSe2 (68.8 mV dec(-1)). The MoSe2/NiSe2 composite NW arrays exhibit remarkably enhanced activity because their 3D hierarchical structure could effectively suppress the aggregation or re-stacking of nanosheets and expose more active sites to participate in the HER. Moreover, the highly conductive NiSe2 dispersed in nanosheets facilitates the transfer of electrons from the electrode to the active edges on MoSe2 and further improves the activity.									111	5	0	0	2	0	113			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000411739700024

With the Na0H-treated sample, an additional hydrothermal treatment was carried out (HT-Co-NZ-OH). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in the Co2p satellite region indicate the presence of Co (II). Transmission electron microscopy of HT-Co-NZ-OH showed nanometer thick film-like deposits of cobalt compound on the surface of the nanocrystal, whereas for TMA-NZ, the deposits were spherical similar to 3 nm particles on the surface of the nanozeolite. Using the Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) - persulfate system, the photocatalytic activity of these materials for water oxidation was tested by measuring dissolved oxygen. The initial rate for TMA-NZ was 3.1 x 10(-2) mol O-2/mmol Co.s, whereas for HT-Co-NZ-OH, it was 1.4 x 10(-2) mol O-2/mmol Co.s. However, with the TMA-NZ sample, the photocatalytic rate dropped by an order of magnitude with the recovered catalyst, while the rate was unchanged for HT-Co-NZ-OH. With TMA-NZ, the similar to 3 nm cobalt species on the zeolite are mechanically unstable and fall off during the photocatalytic reaction, whereas the cobalt deposits on the HT-Co-NZ-OH are stable. The catalytic performance of HT-Co-NZ-OH is an order of magnitude higher than comparably prepared micron sized zeolites, due to the better utilization of the cobalt on the surface of the nanozeolite. Internal porosity of the zeolite is still accessible with HT-Co-NZ-OH for photochemical reaction with access to the catalyst on the surface. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, a novel structure of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes-encapsulated cobalt nanoparticles (Co@NCNTs) is synthesized by a simple dual-template strategy using silica colloid and tri-block copolymer (polyethylene oxide polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide, PEO-PPO-PEO, F127) as hard and soft templates, respectively. The Co@NCNTs-800 synthesized at 800 degrees C shows an excellent ORR performance, which can be attributed to the desirable combination of their unique one-dimensional carbon nanotube structure, the adequate nitrogen doping level, the large surface area created by the dual-template strategy, and the synergistic effect between graphitic carbon layer and cobalt nanoparticles. The doped N atoms can provide coordination sites for cobalt nanoparticles and form NAC moieties as dominant active sites, which provide positive effect on catalytic ORR activity. The graphitic carbon layers can protect cobalt nanoparticles against agglomeration and electrolyte corrosion, while cobalt nanoparticles can activate the bordering graphitic carbon layers and further increase ORR activities. This dual-template synthetic strategy provides an opportunity to promote the catalytic performance of NPMCs for application of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

It is found that the surface area and volume of the small pores (<10 Angstrom) do not change with carbon conversion when the coal char is gasified in air, while those of the larger pores (10-20 Angstrom, 20-50 Angstrom, 50-2500 Angstrom) increase with increase of carbon conversion. However in CO2 gasification, all the pores in different size ranges increase in surface area and volume with increase of carbon conversion. Simultaneously, the reaction rate normalized by the surface area of the pores >10 Angstrom for air gasification is constant over a wide range of conversion (>20%), while for CO2 gasification similar results are obtained using the total surface area. However, in the early stages of gasification (<20%) the normalized reaction rate is much higher than that in the later stage of gasification, due to existence of more inaccessible pores in the beginning of gasification. The inaccessibility of the micropores to adsorption at low and ambient temperatures is confirmed by the measurement of the helium density of the coal chars. The random pore model can fit the experimental data well and the fitted structural parameters match those obtained by physical gas adsorption for coal chars without closed pores.

The chemical processes are strongly coupled to the turbulent dynamics of the hot jet which rapidly mixes with the surrounding atmospheric air. Key issues of the chemical reactions in the jet regime are worked out and the results of extensive parameter studies are presented. The evolution of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur species is discussed in detail and related to observations. Spatially resolved, two-dimensional simulations are compared with box model calculations to point out specific features that result from the coupling between mixing and chemistry and to answer the question under which conditions box models can be applied to give a reasonable description of the jet plume chemistry. Main results concern the conversion efficiencies of primary into secondary exhaust products, the oxidation potential within young aircraft plumes to produce nitrous, nitric, and sulfuric acid, the sensitivity of these processes under variation of exit plane conditions, as well as the production of new aerosol particles. Open questions concerning chemical processing in near-field exhaust plumes are addressed. The modeling framework presented in this study serves as a basis for further near-held studies on the physics and chemistry in aircraft wakes.									52	0	0	0	4	0	52			2169-897X			WOS:A1996UV94800016

Herein, a defective TiO2 nanosheet photocatalyst simultaneously equipped with AuCu alloy co-catalyst and oxygen vacancies (AuCu-TiO2-x NSs) was rationally designed and fabricated for the selective conversion of CO2 into CH4. The experimental results demonstrated that the AuCu alloy co-catalyst not only effectively promotes the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs but also acts as synergistic active sites for the reduction of CO2. The oxygen vacancies in TiO2 contribute to the separation of charge carriers and, more importantly, promote the oxidation of H2O, thus providing rich protons to promote the deep reduction of CO2 to CH4. Consequently, the optimal AuCu-TiO2-x nanosheets (NSs) photocatalyst achieves a CO2 reduction selectivity toward CH4 up to 90.55%, significantly higher than those of NSs (31.82%), Au-TiO2-x NSs (38.74%), and Cu-TiO2-x NSs (66.11%). Furthermore, the CH4 evolution rate over the AuCu-TiO2-x NSs reaches 22.47 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1), which is nearly twice that of AuCu-TiO2 NSs (12.10 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1)). This research presents a unique insight into the design and synthesis of photocatalyst with oxygen vacancies and alloy metals as the co-catalyst for the highly selective deep reduction of CO2.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000706187100055	34555906

Cost-effective energy storage and conversion devices have attracted significant attention. Rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs) are widely studied because they are portable, possess high power density, and are environmentally friendly. However, the slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limit their practical application. It is crucial to develop dual-functional electrocatalysts with excellent electrocatalytic performance, low price, simple operation, and outstanding stability. Therefore, transition metals and carbon-based materials should be combined. Although Co2P has been widely reported as an efficient OER catalyst, there are few studies based on the ORR activity. Herein, a facile pyrolysis of cobalt salt, phytic acid, and k-carrageenan aerogel was carried out on Co2P nanoparticles within P-doped porous carbon (Co2P-PCA-800), showing enhanced ORR activity. The resulting composite (Co2P-PCA-800) with a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous architecture exhibited outstanding ORR activity with a high half-wave potential (E-1(/2)) of approximately 0.84 V, which is comparable to that of Pt/C. Simultaneously, we fabricated phosphorus-doped porous carbon (PCA) and cobalt-doped porous carbon (Co-CA) to compare the effect of structural morphology on the catalytic performance. Studies have found that a regular interconnected porous structure can be beneficial for mass transfer and can ensure uniform distribution of ion current, thereby resulting in increased number of effective active sites. The outstanding ORR activity mainly results from the synergistic effect of the 3D honeycomb hierarchical porous structure and positively charged Co2P nanoparticles encapsulated in P-doped carbon. In addition, the 3D honeycomb porous carbon structure not only facilitates mass transfer and accelerates electron transfer but also protects the cobalt phosphide. Finally, we assembled a rechargeable ZAB with Co2P-PCA-800 as the air cathode catalyst. Compared with precious metal catalysts, the catalyst has considerable charge-discharge performance and energy density as well as higher specific capacity and better cycle stability. We believe that this study will provide a significant direction for solving energy and environmental issues.									16	2	0	0	1	0	16			1000-6818			WOS:000616616500004

Indeed, if the interaction between the SA and the support, which can be seen as a solid ligand presenting its own specificities that fix the first coordination sphere of the metal, plays a central role as in homogeneous catalysis, other factors can strongly contribute to modification of the activity, selectivity and stability of SAs. Therefore, in this mini-review, we briefly summarize the importance of the support (oxide, carbon or a second metal) in SA photo- electro- and thermal-catalysis (support-assisted operation), and concentrate on other types of cooperativities that in some cases enable previously impossible reaction pathways on supported metal SAs. This includes topics that are not specific to SA catalysis, such as metal-ligand or heterobimetallic cooperativity, and cooperativity which is SA-specific such as nanoparticle-SA or mixed-valence SA cooperativity.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000635775000005	33729251

The excitation flash radiation initially was limited to flash lamps with a time resolution to study the decay of the excited states and the fast reactions of photo produced transients in milliseconds and microseconds. Some of the photolysis reactions investigated provide details in real time including the thermal reactions of molecular oxygen with cobalt(II) amine systems and the cobalt (III) alkyl complex formation on photolysis of cobalt(III) aminoacid complexes. Photoredox reactions of thiazine and safranine dyes are investigated using time resolved absorption and emission techniques in solution and on encapsulation in micro and mesoporous host materials. Picosecond and femtosecond diffuse reflectance fluorescence investigations in the porous solid host materials show intramolecular proton transfer reactions of the dyes and deprotonation of the dyes in the excited states. Photosensitization of nanoparticles of semiconductors, anatase TiO2 and ZnO by the excited states of dyes in meso and microporous silicate hosts is investigated using pico and femtosecond fluorescence and transient absorptions techniques and the results are reviewed.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0974-3626			WOS:000295982900001

Herein, the potential of several pi-conjugated metal bis(dithiolene) complex nanosheets (M3C12S12, where M denotes Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, and Pd) as CO2RR electrocatalysts was systemically investigated by means of comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) computations. The results reveal that among the studied candidates, Rh3C12S12 nanosheets exhibit the highest CO2RR catalytic activity due to their low limiting potential (-0.43 V) and activation barrier (1.60 eV). In particular, CH4 is identified as the product, and CHO* formation is the potential/rate-determining step. Thus, by carefully controlling the type of metal atoms, M3C12S12 can be utilized as a promising electrocatalyst for the CO2RR, which may provide a new avenue to design novel metal organic framework (MOF)-based electrocatalysts.									29	2	0	0	0	0	29			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000473054500037

Differing from BiOBr characterized by [Bi2O2](2+) layer and interleaved Br- double slabs, the crystal structure of CdBiO2Br comprises the [CdBiO2](+) layer and interbedded single Br- slice, rendering a narrowed interlayer spacing from 8.11 to 6.23 angstrom. The largely reduced interlayer distance drastically shortens the diffusion paths of photogenerated electrons (e(-)) and holes (h(+)) in CdBiO2Br, allowing favorable migration of carriers from bulk to the surface of the catalysts. Profiting from this structural advantage, CdBiO2Br presents a superior visible-light driven oxygen activation ability in evolution of superoxide radicals (O-center dot(2)-) and hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot), with a production rate of similar to 2.4 and 14.1 times that of BiOBr, respectively. DFT calculations unearth that CdBiO2Br has smaller effective masses for both e(-) and h(+) than BiOBr, and meanwhile bears a significant difference in the respective mobility of e(-) and h(+), indicative of efficient mobility and separation of carrier charge. In particular, the h(+) effective mass of CdBiO2Br is merely one-third of that in BiOBr, corresponding well to the far higher (OH)-O-center dot generation rate of CdBiO2Br. Our work not only exposes a visible-light-active layered material for environmental chemistry/biochemistry applications but also discloses the huge potential of crystal structure manipulation in governing the charge transport behavior and photo(electro)chemical properties.									53	2	0	0	6	0	53			1932-7447			WOS:000424955400024

Due to large temperature gradients near the glowing nest in a deposit of bulk material the detection of a smouldering fire is difficult and the smouldering fire may remain unnoticed until the reaction front breaks through the surface of the deposit. The present paper reports experimental investigations on thermal conditions, which may cause or promote an ongoing smouldering process, e.g; critical initial temperatures of embedded hot bodies or critical initial sizes of glowing nests. Propagation velocities of smouldering fires were dependent on the sample size, the oxygen content within the sample and on the caloric properties of three combustible dusts.

All the substrates were highly photooxidizable through a O-2((1)Delta (g))-mediated mechanism. Calculated quotients between the overall and reactive rate constants for the quenching of O-2((1)Delta (g)) by Tyr-derivatives (k(t)/k(r) values, accounting for the efficiency of the effective photooxidation) were 1.3 for Tyr, 1 for Tyr-Val, 2.8 for Val-Tyr and 1.5 for Val-Tyr-Val. The effect of pH on the kinetics of the photooxidative process confirms that the presence of the dissociated phenolate group of Tyr clearly dominates the O-2((1)Delta (g)) quenching process. Products analysis by LC-MS indicates that the photooxidation of Tyr di- and tripeptides proceeds with the breakage of peptide bonds. The information obtained from the evolution of primary amino groups upon photosensitized irradiation is in concordance with these results. Absolute rate constants for the reactions of phosphate radicals (HPO4.- and PO4.2-, generated by photolysis of the P2O84- at different pH) and sulfate radicals (SO4.-. produced by photolysis of the S2O82-) with Tyr peptides indicate that for all the substrates, the observed tendency in the rate constants is: SO4.- greater than or equal to HPO4.- greater than or equal to PO4.2-.

At the heart of many chemical and biological processes, such reactions are of particular interest in energy conversion and enzymatic processes. Among the numerous examples of PCET reactions, photosynthesis and particularly reactions inside the Photosystem II (PSII) subunit, involving a global four electrons and four protons process to perform water oxidation and respiration, is the most emblematic one. This review focuses on the photochemical approaches of PCET reactions involving phenolic molecules. Indeed, a significant part of photochemical PCET studies were conducted on tyrosine or phenol relevant to PSII and charge transport in enzymes. The mechanisms of these reactions, sequential or concerted, with particular emphasis on the influence of pH, temperature, solvent nature and H-bonding pattern are presented based on photochemical techniques and related theoretical analysis.									32	1	0	0	6	0	32			0031-8655	1751-1097		WOS:000296348400002	21895665

This often results in structural changes within the high-k layer, and formation of interface defects. This paper describes the thermodynamics of point defect equilibrium in HfO2 and related materials, including effects of oxygen partial pressure, internal interfaces, and contact with adjacent metal layers. Thermodynamic analysis is useful in predicting trends and driving forces for defect formation. Experimental results on point defect reactions and structural changes during thermal processing are reviewed. Implications for properties of MOS devices containing high-k metal oxides are discussed.

Herein, recent advancements towards closing this apparent community gap by discussing the concepts of the constrained ab initio thermodynamics approach and the volcano relationship, which were originally introduced for studying heterogeneously catalyzed reactions by first-principles methods at the beginning of the 21st century, are summarized. The translation of the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) approach or activity-based volcano plots to a computational lithium electrode (CLiE) or activity-stability volcano plots, respectively, for the investigation of electrode surfaces in batteries may refine theoretical modeling with the aim that enhancements of the underlying concepts are transferred between the research communities. The presented strategy of developing novel approaches by interdisciplinary research activities may trigger further progress of improved theoretical concepts in the near future.									31	0	0	0	1	0	31			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000473878300001	30861313	
J	Alfano, OM; Cabrera, MI; Cassano, AE								Photocatalytic reactions involving hydroxyl radical attack - I. Reaction kinetics formulation with explicit photon absorption effects								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				172	2			370	379		10.1006/jcat.1997.1858				DEC 1997	1997	A kinetic model to represent the time evolution of a photocatalytic reaction is presented. It can be applied for reacting systems having the following characteristics: (i) the catalyst is a suspension (in water) of fine particles of titanium dioxide, (ii) the substrate is a hydrocarbon compound amenable to hydroxyl radical attack for the initiation of an oxidative reaction, (iii) the catalyst activation is produced by radiation energy in the near ultraviolet range (300 nm less than or equal to lambda less than or equal to 400 nm), (iv) oxygen is always present in the reacting medium, and (v) there are no mass transport limitations. The model is based on Turchi and Ollis (J. Catal. 122, 178 (1990)) proposed reaction sequence. The described formulation incorporates a precise and detailed evaluation of the radiation energy absorption effects. With this purpose the kinetic model is used in conjunction with a specially developed experimental device (Cabrera et al., Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 33, 3031 (1994); Alfano et al., Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 33, 488 (1995)) for which a one-dimensional-one-directional radiation and reactor model has been derived and validated. The model provides an explicit formulation for the radiation-absorbed effects that comprises in a single equation the cases of low and high irradiating conditions. The whole kinetic model development has been applied to the photodegradation of trichloroethylene in water, and it is the subject of a companion paper. Using this approach, reliable intrinsic kinetic data can be obtained. (C) 1997 Academic Press.									133	3	0	0	37	1	135			0021-9517			WOS:000071256700011

In vitro experiments indicate that the sensitivity to high light of the isolated photosystem I (PSI) complex from wild type and from PsaF mutants is similar. In vivo measurements of photochemical quenching and oxygen evolution show that impairment of the donor side of PSI in the PsaF mutants leads to a diminished linear electron transfer and/or a decrease of photosystem II (PSII) activity in high light. Thermoluminescence measurements indicate that the PSII reaction center is directly affected under photo-oxidative stress when the rate of electron transfer becomes limiting in the PsaF-deficient strain and in the PsaF mutant K23Q. We have isolated a high light-resistant PsaF-deficient suppressor strain that has a high chlorophyll alb ratio and is affected in the assembly of light-harvesting complex. These results indicate that under high light a functionally intact donor side of PSI is essential for protection of C. reinhardtii against photo-oxidative damage when the photosystems are properly connected to their light-harvesting antennae.									32	2	0	0	34	0	37			0021-9258			WOS:000085474500083	10681576

The crystal structure and feature nanostructure of the Pd-Cr@carbon were established through the use of X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Meanwhile, its catalytic activity was studied using the cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical polarization techniques. Based on the XRD analysis, it was observed that the Pd phase with the fcc crystal structure was dominant, while the Pd-Cr phase with tetragonal crystal structure was detected only for the as-prepared sample and samples calcined at 573 K. The estimated average crystallite size of the Pd phase increased from 9.66 to 37.54 nm as the calcination temperature increased to 973 K, and the calcination time had a slight effect on the crystallite size. On the other side, the average crystallite size for the formed Pd-Cr phase slightly increased from 43.74 nm for the as-prepared sample to 44.90 nm for the sample calcined at 573 K for 3 h. The TEM examination revealed the uniform distribution of the Pd and Pd-Cr nanoparticles upon the carbon surface. The calcination temperature and time played an important role in controlling the structural and morphology parameters of Pd-Cr@carbon. The adsorption/desorption potentials were found to be dependent on the calcination temperature and time and hence the particle and crystallite sizes. The optimum ORR activity and chemical stability were observed for samples calcined at 773 K for 3 h.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1574-1443	1574-1451		WOS:000637666900002

Energy barriers for defect association and reorientation of oxygen vacancy-dopant (Cu and Fe) complexes are obtained from first-principles calculations and serve as input for kinetic coefficients of the rate equation model. The numerical solution of the model describes the time evolution of the oxygen vacancy distribution at different temperatures and dopant concentrations in the presence or absence of an alternating external field. We predict the characteristic time scale for the alignment of all defect dipoles with the spontaneous polarization of the surrounding matrix. In this state the defect dipoles act as obstacles for domain wall motion and contribute to the experimentally observed aging. Under cycling conditions the fully aligned configuration is perturbed and a dynamic equilibrium is established with defect dipoles in parallel and antiparallel orientation relative to the spontaneous polarization. This process can be related to the deaging behavior of piezoelectric ceramics.									58	0	0	0	3	0	58			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000321836100002

Thermal evolution of H-4[PMo11VO40] at 593 K leads to a complex mixture of different species with or without vanadium inside the Keggin structure. After reaction, the one and only heteropolyanion is partly reduced [PMo12O40](3-) and vanadium is present as vanadyl cations. Vanadyl cations are bound to the oxygen atoms of the heteropolyanion at 593 K and enhance the selectivity to methacrylic acid with respect to acetone. On the other hand, copper cations improve the reoxidation of the catalyst and increase the IBA conversion. Synergism between copper and vanadyl cations was observed.

By reducing the content of oxygen, the phase of WO3/W18O49 changes to pure W18O49 and the morphology of the W18O49 shows an obvious evolution from nanowire to flower-like W18O49 assembled by nanoneedle. The crystallite size of WO3/W18O49 and W18O49 are 29.85 nm and 14.13 nm, respectively. The photocatalytic activity of W18O49 UV-light irradiation is about 8 times as high as that of WO3/W18O49. This enhanced activity is attributed to smaller crystallite size and larger surface area. Furthermore, XPS analyses reveal that the lattice oxygen reduces under N-2 atmosphere. The increasing of oxygen vacancy results in a narrowing bandgap and strong light absorption performance. By combining the results of the transient photocurrent and electrochemical impedance measurements, the electron-hole pair separation rates and carrier migration rates of the W18O49 have been greatly improved.

Electrodeposition is an in-situ convenient technology for catalyst preparation without chemical residue. In an acid electrolyte, AuPt alloy catalysts were electrodeposited on carbon paper. The effect of main salt concentration, electrodeposition time and current density were studied by deposit micromorphology observation, structure analyses and composition testing. Catalytic abilities of AuPt alloys were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in an ionic liquid of EMI-TFSI/Li-TFSI [1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium-bis (trifluoromethanesulphonyl) imide/lithium-bis (trifluoromethanesulphonyl) imide]. The electrochemical behaviors of Au, Pt and AuPt deposits were also measured. An optimized direct-current electrodeposition process of getting high active AuPt catalyst is concluded, which is an aqueous solution containing 6.7 similar to 10 m mol.L-1 HAuCl4, 10 similar to 13.3 mmol.L-1 H2PtCl6 and 0.5 mol.L-1 H2SO4 as the electrolyte, current density of 20mA.cm(-2) and electrodeposition time of 8 similar to 34 s. The co-deposition of AuPt alloy is an irregular co-deposition controlled by diffusion, while gold atoms enter the platinum's crystal lattice in the structure of AuPt alloy. The increase of the concentration of H2PtCl6 in the electrolyte, the extension of the electrodeposition time or the raise of the current density can improve the content of Pt in the deposit. The clusters' diameters of AuPt catalysts decrease to 150 similar to 250 nm by adjusting current densities during electrodeposition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The nanohybrids exhibited impressive low overpotentials (eta 10) of 73, 97, and 99 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) in acidic (pH similar to 0), neutral (pH 7) and alkaline (pH 14) electrolyte, respectively, which competes with (or even surpasses) commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) catalysts. Furthermore, the NiPS3@DG electrocatalyst displayed long-term stability and durability in a pH-universal medium as confirmed by a negligible decay in catalytic performances after 40 h of continuous working and 5000 voltammetric sweeping cycles. Theoretical calculations further revealed that the optimal free energy of the hydrogen adsorption process (which stems from a synergistic effect of S and P) provides tremendous contribution to the pH-universal HER process. The design strategy of the di-anion nanohybrid electrocatalyst highlights a new avenue for preparing cost-effective and pH-universal electrocatalysts.									103	4	0	0	4	0	103			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000415990800016

Chemical and physical degradation are due to agricultural and industrial practices and domestic wastewaters. Over a three-month period, a study of the low-flow water quality characteristics throughout Medjerda wadi was undertaken. Longitudinal profiles of water quality were constructed using data from fourteen sites. All sewage, agricultural, and industrial inputs were included. Analyzed properties were nutrients (NO(3) (-), NO(2) (-), NH(4) (+), and PO(4) (3-)), Biochemical oxygen demand after five days (BOD(5)), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and dissolved oxygen (DO). Along Medjerda wadi, all values change because of conditions specific to each sampling station. Nitrate was the most important form of nitrogen-element load (94%). Its concentration reached 34.3 mg L(-1) at OM(4) point, downstream of domestic wastewater discharges. The spatial evolution of the organic pollution index (OPI) shows that the wastewater effluent constitutes the main source of pollution. Indeed, water quality goes from a moderate pollution state at some sampling stations not or slightly affected by wastewaters discharges to a very strong pollution state (OPI of about 1.75) downstream of the domestic effluents inputs of Souk-Ahras city.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			1866-6280			WOS:000276654900008

The first reduction cycle occurs at nearly constant potential for the whole composition range and is characteristic of nucleation and growth behavior. On the first oxidation and subsequent reduction-oxidation cycles, the results are similar to those obtained previously for polycrystalline electrodes and show the presence of a two-phase region for 0 less than or equal to delta less than or equal to 0.06 and a single phase with the composition 0.06 less than or equal to delta less than or equal to 0.13. The P4(2)/ncm phase with delta similar to 0.02 and a narrow range of stoichiometry, is apparent in d delta/dV versus delta data and in the behavior of the current decay curves. Examination of the crystals at various stages of cycling show the formation of extensive cracks that apparently increase in density with cycling. Measurements of the transient currents after potential steps have been used to estimate the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in La2NiO4+delta in the single phase region. Data were obtained for both polycrystalline and single crystal electrodes.					10th International Conference on Solid State Ionics (SSI-10)10th International Conference on Solid State Ionics (SSI-10)	DEC 03-08, 1995DEC 03-08, 1995	Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Phys; Asian Soc Solid State IonNatl Univ Singapore, Dept Phys; Asian Soc Solid State Ion	SINGAPORE, SINGAPORESINGAPORE, SINGAPORE	16	0	0	0	1	0	16			0167-2738			WOS:A1996VR72300021		
J	Gabruk, Michal; Mysliwa-Kurdziel, Beata					Gabruk, Michal/0000-0002-5639-2475			The origin, evolution and diversification of multiple isoforms of light-dependent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (LPOR): focus on angiosperms								BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL				477	12			2221	2236		10.1042/BCJ20200323				JUN 2020	2020	Light-dependent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (LPOR) catalyzes the reduction of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide, which is a key reaction for angiosperm development. Dark operative light-independent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (DPOR) is the other enzyme able to catalyze this reaction, however, it is not present in angiosperms. LPOR, which evolved later than DPOR, requires light to trigger the reaction. The ancestors of angiosperms lost DPOR genes and duplicated the LPORs, however, the LPOR evolution in angiosperms has not been yet investigated. In the present study, we built a phylogenetic tree using 557 nucleotide sequences of LPORs from both bacteria and plants to uncover the evolution of LPOR. The tree revealed that all modern sequences of LPOR diverged from a single sequence similar to 1.36 billion years ago. The LPOR gene was then duplicated at least 10 times in angiosperms, leading to the formation of two or even more LPOR isoforms in multiple species. In the case of Arabidopsis thaliana, AtPORA and AtPORB originated in one duplication event, in contrary to the isoform AtPORC, which diverged first. We performed biochemical characterization of these isoforms in vitro, revealing differences in the lipid-driven properties. The results prone us to hypothesize that duplication events of LPOR gave rise to the isoforms having different lipid-driven activity, which may predispose them for functioning in different locations in plastids. Moreover, we showed that LPOR from Synechocystis operated in the lipid-independent manner, revealing differences between bacterial and plant LPORs. Based on the presented results, we propose a novel classification of LPOR enzymes based on their biochemical properties and phylogenetic relationships.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0264-6021	1470-8728		WOS:000571449200006	32568402

Here, an interface engineering strategy is employed for preparing CoS/SnS2 heterojunctions on carbon cloth with rich sulfur vacancies. Such an electrocatalyst exhibits excellent performance for HER (eta(10): 151 mV) and OER (eta(10): 327 mV) under alkaline conditions. And only 1.71 V is required for a cell based on Cos/SnS2 as the bifunctional catalysts to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density for full water splitting. DFT calculations indicate that the excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the tunable electronic structure induced by sulfur vacancies and the heterojunctions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0042-207X	1879-2715		WOS:000827973100003

At the heart of these technologies are high-performance catalysts that efficiently increase the rate and selectivity of key chemical reactions involved. Single perovskites have long been considered as a class of active catalysts with a relatively simple atomic arrangement. Double perovskites, a subclass of perovskites characterized by cation ordering, are emerging alternatives to single perovskites showing comparable or even better performance. In this review, we explore recent developments of double perovskites in various catalytic applications including general catalysis, electrocatalysis, and photo(electro)catalysis. We also discuss how double perovskite chemistries can be tailored toward improved functionality and identify opportunities for the future research of double perovskite catalysts.									126	3	0	0	4	0	127				2589-5974		WOS:000521129800006

The study relies upon linear voltammetry and the importance of the various oxidative processes occurring at the graphite surface, namely electrochemical reactions of residual organic groups, carbon oxides and oxygen evolution, as well as the oxidation of tetravalent sulfur oxidation. The i-E curves relevant to bisulfite and sulfite oxidation are modeled by the simple Butler-Volmer law for irreversible direct processes even though the oxidation scheme has not yet been elucidated. Confidence intervals of the determined parameters, diffusion coefficient, exchange current density, and charge-transfer coefficient are estimated.									24	0	0	0	4	0	24			0013-4686			WOS:A1991FG55500048

In this method, negatively charged N-rGO was electrostaticaly bonded to the self-assembled interface of n-n type g-C3N4/NiFe LDH hybrid. XRD and AFM results revealed successful formation of heterostructure nanocomposite due to the coupling effect of exfoliated NiFe LDH nanosheets with N-rGO and g-C3N4. Among the as synthesized heterostructure, CNNG3LDH performed superior photocatalytic activities towards 95 and 72% mineralization of RhB and phenol. Furthermore, CNNG3LDH could achieve the highest photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of 2508 mu molg(-1)2h(-1) and O-2 evolution rate of 1280 mu molg(-1)2h(-1) under visible light irradiation. The CNNG3LDH possess lowest PL intensity, reduced arc of the Nyquist plot ( 43.8.) and highest photocurrent density (-0.97 mA cm(-2)) which revealed effective charge separation for superior photocatalytic activities. TRPL spectral results reveal the synergistic effect of layered component in CNNG3LDH for achievable higher life time of excitons of similar to 16.52 ns. In addition, N-rGO mediator based Z-scheme charge transfer mechanisms in CNNG3LDH were verified by the ESR and TA-PL studies. Enriched oxygen vacancy type defects in NiFe LDH and N-rGO mediated Z-scheme charge transfer mechanistic path strongly manifest the superior photocatalytic activities of the heterostructure materials.									104	4	0	0	12	0	104			2045-2322			WOS:000459281500027	30792529

The microwave radiation played an important role in obtainment of well dispersed ZnO nanoparticles directly on reduced graphene oxide sheets without any additional reducing reagents or passivation agent. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman and infrared spectroscopies indicated the reduction of GO as well as the successful synthesis of rGO-ZnO nanocomposites. The chemical states of the samples were shown by XPS analyses. Due to the synergic effect, the resulting nanocomposites exhibited high electronic interaction between ZnO and rGO sheets, which improved the electrocatalytic oxidation of water with low onset potential of 0.48 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in neutral pH and long-term stability, with high current density during electrolysis. The overpotential for water oxidation decreased in alkaline pH, suggesting useful insight on the catalytic mechanism for O-2 evolution. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Sulfate (SO4 center dot-) and hydroxyl ((OH)-O-center dot) radicals are most frequently generated from catalytic PDS/PMS decomposition by thermal, base, irradiation, transition metals and carbon materials. In addition, increasingly more recent studies have reported the involvement of singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) during PDS/PMS-based AOPs. Typically, O-1(2) can be produced either along with SO4 center dot- and (OH)-O-center dot or discovered as the dominant reactive oxygen species (ROSs) for pollutants degradation. This paper reviews recent advances in O-1(2) generation during PDS/PMS activation. First, it introduces the basic chemistry of O-1(2), its oxidation properties and detection methodologies. Furthermore, it elaborates different activation strategies/techniques, including homogeneous and heterogeneous systems, and discusses the possible reaction mechanisms to give an overview of the principle of O-1(2) production by activating PDS/PMS. Moreover, although O-1(2) has shown promising features such as high degradation selectivity and anti-interference capability, its production pathways and mechanisms remain controversial in the present literatures. Therefore, this study identifies the research gaps and proposes future perspectives in the aspects of novel catalysts and related mechanisms.									20	0	0	0	9	0	20				1660-4601		WOS:000638575100001	33804931	
J	Cui, XJ; Nabelek, PI; Liu, M								Heat and fluid flow in contact metamorphic aureoles with layered and transient permeability, with application to the Notch Peak aureole, Utah								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH				106	B4			6477	6491		10.1029/2000JB900418				APR 10 2001	2001	We have investigated the control of layered and transient permeability structures on fluid flow and thermal evolution in contact metamorphic aureoles using two-dimensional numerical modeling with petrological and geochemical constraints from the Notch Peak aureole, Utah. The model includes interbedded aquitard and aquifer lithologies on the scale of formations and transient enhancement of permeability due to devolatilization reactions. The results show that a layered permeability structure causes focusing of fluids into aquifer layers, resulting in flow pattern that is strongly time-dependent and significantly different from the predicted simple convection cells in aureoles with homogeneous permeability. The model predicts temporal development of three distinctive flow regimes: (1) early radial down-temperature flow due to release of magmatic fluid, (2) small flat convection cells near the pluton-aquifer contacts during peak metamorphism, (3) late unidirectional down-temperature flow in the upper aureole and up temperature flow in the middle to lower aureole. When the bulk permeability of host rocks is >10(-16) m(2), heat advection by flowing fluids is significant. At lower bulk permeability, heat conduction dominates, and the effects of detailed permeability structure on the thermal field become negligible. Metamorphic reactions enhance permeability within the inner aureole, localizing fluid convection and increasing fluid flux. The observed spatial distribution of mineral assemblages and oxygen isotopic shifts in the upper part of the Notch Peak aureole is consistent with the predicted time-integrated fluid flux, which over duration of metamorphism is dominated by the down-temperature flow of a large amount of water from the pluton into the wall rocks.									38	1	0	0	1	1	39			2169-9313	2169-9356		WOS:000167920500010

Functionalized NDs have been used as carbocatalysts to drive a diversity of heterogeneous reactions, presenting promising catalytic performances, great stability/durability, and low toxicity compared with other carbonaceous and metal materials. More importantly, the tunable configurations of NDs-related materials from spa to sp(2)/sp(3) and sp(2) carbons endow them as ideal chemical probes to elucidate the intrinsic nature toward metal-free catalysis. Herein, a comprehensive overview is presented in the synthesis, properties, functionalization, and characterization of NDs-based materials as well as their recent applications in fuel cell reactions, carbon dioxide reduction, photocatalysis, organic synthesis, oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, and advanced oxidation processes. More importantly, we provide an insightful discussion on unveiling the intrinsic catalytic centers and structure-reactivity chemistry of NDs in redox reactions from an atomic level. Advanced protocols were proposed for regulating the electronic structures of NDs by surface and structural engineering toward better carbocatalysis, which assists to provide valuable guidance for the rational design of ND-based materials toward target catalytic processes. Finally, future research opportunities were proposed to address the current dilemmas in materials synthesis, to facilitate mechanistic studies by theoretical computations, to enable structural/surface functionalization of NDs for advanced catalysis, and to expand the NDs-based materials toward other promising chemical reactions.									52	3	0	0	10	0	52			2155-5435			WOS:000480503700092

The results obtained from HP-DSC profiles indicated that for oil alone and its mixtures with quartz sand/crushed core, the peak temperature was lowered, and the heat flow increased with increasing oxygen partial pressure. The heat enthalpy of low temperature oxidation (LTO) was higher than that of high temperature oxidation (HTO) under oxygen partial pressures of 0.5, 1 and 1.5 MPa, and the increase in heat enthalpy of LTO with oxygen partial pressure was more pronounced than that of HTO. Unlike the crushed core, the addition of quartz sand delayed exothermic oxidation reactions. Compared with oil only and oil + quartz sand, the LTO and HTO peak temperatures of oil + crushed core were considerably lowered, and the effect of crushed core on increasing heat release for LTO at oxygen partial pressure of 1.5 MPa was more prominent. It was observed that the heat enthalpy of LTO and HTO increased quasi-linearly with the oxygen partial pressure in both the presence and absence of quartz sand/crushed core. ISC might be considered as an appropriate candidate for Jiqi block, based on exothermic continuity of the ARC curves, with the near-wellbore zone of target block heated to 180 degrees C where the exothermic oxidation activity is notably intensified. The kinetic results showed that the LTO and HTO intervals were divided into 6 and 2 subintervals, respectively, which facilitated more precise modelling of the ISC process.									24	1	0	0	1	0	24			0920-4105	1873-4715		WOS:000477944700088

The delicate optimization of chemical composition and architectural configuration is paramount to design high-efficiency non-precious metal HER electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a one-step scalable template/solvent-free pyrolysis approach for in situ immobilizing uniform CoP nanoparticles onto N and P co-doped carbon porous nanosheets (denoted as CoP@N,P-CNSs hereafter). The simultaneous consideration of architectural design and nanocarbon hybridization renders the formed CoP@N,P-CNSs with plentiful well-dispersed anchored active sites, shortened pathway for mass diffusion, enhanced electric conductivity, and reinforced mechanical stability. As a consequence, the optimized CoP@N,P-CNSs exhibit an overpotential of 115 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of 74.2 mV dec(-1), high Faradaic efficiency of nearly 100 %, and superb long-term durability in an alkaline medium. Given the fabrication feasibility, mass production potential and outstanding HER performance, the CoP@N,P-CNSs may hold great promise for large-scale electrochemical water splitting. More importantly, the explored one-step template/solvent-free pyrolysis methodology offers a feasible and versatile route to fabricate carbon nanosheet-based nanocomposites for diverse energy conversation-related applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000652068200001	33891343

The activity is restored by moderate illumination at room temperature. We examined the changes in the redox state of the Mn-cluster in cucumber leaves in the processes of dark-chilling inhibition and subsequent light-induced reactivation by means of thermoluminescence (TL). A TL B-band arising from S(2)Q(B)(-) charge recombination in PSII was observed upon single-flash illumination of untreated leaves, whereas four flashes were required to yield the B-band after dark-chilling treatment for 24 h. This three-step delay indicates that over-reduced states of the Mn-cluster such as the S-2 state were formed during the treatment. Fitting analysis of the flash-number dependence of the TL intensifies showed that the Mn-cluster was more reduced with a longer period of the treatment and that S-3 was the lowest S-state detectable in the dark-chilled leaves. Measurements of the Mn content by atomic absorption spectroscopy showed that Mn atoms were gradually released from PSII during the dark-chilling treatment but re-bound to PSII by illumination at 30 degreesC. Thus, dark-chilling inhibition of oxygen evolution can be ascribed to the disintegration of the Mn-cluster due to its over-reduction. The observation of the S-3 State in the present in vivo system strongly suggests that S-3, which has been observed only by addition of exogenous reductants into in vitro preparations, is indeed a redox intermediate of the Mn-cluster in the processes of its disintegration and photoactivation.

The oxygen atoms of evolved oxygen come from water as confirmed by isotope-labeled experiments. Cyclic voltammetric measurements of 1 and 2 at various pH's indicate that both complexes 1 and 2 exhibit three one-electron redox couples based on ruthenium center. The Pourbaix diagrams (plots of E-1/2 vs pH) support that the Ru(III) complexes are oxidized to the Ru(V)-oxo complexes with CAN. The Ru(V)-oxo complex derived from 1 was detected by UV-visible absorption, EPR, and resonance Raman measurements in situ as an active species during the water oxidation reaction. This indicates that the Ru(V) -oxo complex is involved in the rate-determining step of the catalytic cycle of water oxidation. The overall catalytic mechanism of water oxidation was revealed on the basis of the kinetic analysis and detection of the catalytic intermediates. Complex 2 exhibited a higher catalytic reactivity for the water oxidation with CAN than did complex 1.									177	6	0	0	25	0	178			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000293872800040	21702460

In this report its expression in Escherichia coli is described. The 23 kDa protein was expressed and secreted to the periplasm where it accumulated in a soluble form. After purification by cation exchange chromatography the recombinant protein was bound to NaCl-washed Photosystem II, Detailed analysis of oxygen-evolving activity demonstrates its function in Ca2+ binding identical to the spinach 23 kDa protein.

Carboxylate groups on the manganese-stabilizing protein were modified with glycine methyl ester in a reaction facilitated by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. The manganese-stabilizing protein which was modified while associated with NaCl-washed membranes could bind to calcium chloride-washed PS II membranes and reconstitute oxygen evolution in a manner similar to that observed for unmodified manganese-stabilizing protein (Frankel, L.K, Cruz, J. C. and Bricker, T. M. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 14271-14278). However, PS II membranes reconstituted with this modified protein were defective in their ability to bind the extrinsic 24 kDa protein of Photosystem II. Mapping of the sites of modification was carried out by trypsin and Staphylococcus V8 protease digestion of the modified protein and analysis by MALDI mass spectrometry. These studies indicated that the domains E-1-D-71, D-97-D-144, and D-180-E-187 are labeled when the manganese-stabilizing protein is bound to NaCl-washed Photosystem II membranes. We hypothesize that modified carboxylates, possibly residues E-1, E-32, E-139, and/or E-187, in these domains are responsible for the altered binding affinity of the 24 kDa protein observed.									20	0	0	0	20	0	20			0006-2960			WOS:000181098800027	12590593

Herein, a simple but effective strategy for manganese-metal-heteroatom doping is adopted to intrinsically elevate the electrocatalytic activities of SnS2 nanosheets by a facile two steps hydrothermal-sulfurization approach. Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution (HER) performance of Mn-SnS2 nanosheets grown on 3D nickel foam (Mn-SnS2/NF) is efficiently optimized since the dopants and defects endow the Mn-SnS2/NF vast active sites. An overpotential as low as 71 mV is required to drive a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with a low Tafel slope of 72 mV dec(-1) in alkaline environment (1 M KOH). In addition, the Mn-SnS2/NF exhibits prominent stability in 1 M KOH electrolyte, which is an indispensable index for the potential HER electrocatalysts. The present work demonstrates that the heteroatom manganese doping strategy renders a meaningful route for synthesizing cost-efficient HER electrocatalysts in alkaline condition.

Whether carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be efficiently tuned into ORR electrocatalysts only by intrinsic defects rather than heteroatom doping has not been well studied yet in experiment and theory. Here we introduce topological defects of nonhexagon carbon rings into CNTs to break the delocalization of their orbitals and make such type of CNTs to be a high-performance ORR catalyst. The electrochemical tests and theoretical studies indicate that the O-2 chemisorption and the following electrocatalytic activity are promoted by the introduced topological defects and show a strong dependence on the defect amount. Such topological-defect CNTs (TCNTs) have an excellent ORR performance owing to a 3.8-electron-transferring process, similar to 4 times higher current density and similar to 120 mV more positive peak potential than normally straight CNTs. Moreover, TCNTs show a higher steady-state diffusion current density and much better stability and immunity to crossover effect as compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst. Hence, our results strongly suggest that tuning the surface structure of CNTs with nonhexagon carbon rings is a novel strategy for designing advanced ORR electrocatalysts for fuel cells.									34	1	0	0	3	0	34			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000344997600025	25322159

The results showed that the evolution rates of H-2 and O-2 gases for our Pt/TiO2 catalysts were ca. 5-10 times of those prepared by a conventional photodeposition method. The molar ratios of H-2 versus O-2 were close to be 2, revealing that the stoichiometric water decomposition occurred. The characterizations of the prepared samples implied that the smaller Pt nanoparticles were highly dispersed on the TiO2 particles by the polygonal barrel-sputtering method. The deposition of the smaller Pt particles increased the Pt surface areas, which can improve the water splitting activities. In addition, the particles deposited by the sputtering method were electron-deficient Pt metals that can enhance the water splitting reaction, whereas those by the photodeposition method were electron-rich Pt metals that reduce the effectiveness of the photocatalytic reaction. These different electron states would play an important role in the remarkable differences in the water splitting activities between the Pt/TiO2 catalysts. Consequently, the polygonal barrel-sputtering method is useful for preparing photocatalysts with the high water splitting activities.									34	4	0	0	3	0	34			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000472697500002

Herein, a hierarchical core-shell nanorod array (NRA) comprising an inner crystalline CoP nanorod and an outer amorphous CoB (a-CoB) nanosheet (CoP@a-CoB) is fabricated on conductive carbon cloth through a successive phosphidation-chronoamperometry-boronation strategy. The as-obtained catalyst exhibits excellent HER activity with low overpotentials of 56.3 and 81.2 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline and acidic electrolytes, respectively. Furthermore, it exhibits superior long-term stability with almost no activity degradation. The outstanding HER electrocatalytic performance might be attributed to the unique hierarchical core-shell NRA structure with the crystalline CoP nanorod as the core and the amorphous CoB nanosheet as the shell, which could not only provide abundant active sites, but also guarantee effective electron transport. This work opens up a promising way to rationally design high-efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen production.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000659206800001

The phase transition of BBNTBS from tetragonal to pseudo cubic is demonstrated by XRD and Raman spectra.

The basic mechanisms of conduction and relaxation processes in the high temperature region were thermal activation, and oxygen vacancies might be the ionic charge transport carriers. Meanwhile, BBNTBS (x = 0.1) exhibited decent energy storage density (J(d) = 0.58 J/cm(3)) and excellent thermal stability (the variation of J(d) is less than 3% in the temperature range of 25-120 degrees C), which could be a potential candidate for high energy density capacitors.									29	2	0	0	0	0	29			2226-4108	2227-8508		WOS:000480594600011

Here the application of positively charged Pt in an effective Fe-PtNiPO nanoreactor for highly efficient and stable HER is demonstrated. Synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirms the formation of internal positively charged Pt and the in situ experiments reveal the quick charge transfer in the nanoreactor. Ni-based materials around Pt are used to tune the electronic structure and promote the water dissociation to form locally enriched H+, while a porous Fe shell can both prevent the loss of active material and allow the efficient material transport. All the beneficial compositions work together to form an effective nanoreactor for HER. As a result, the Fe-PtNiPO nanoreactor shows a low overpotential of 19 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits a high mass activity of 10.93 A mg(Pt)(-1) (at 100 mV). Most importantly, it only needs an ultra-low overpotential of 193 mV to achieve a high current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) with an excellent stability over 300 h, which represents one of the best electrocatalysts for alkaline HER and might be used for large-scale industrial application in the future.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2198-3844		WOS:000837809900001	35945173

Polycrystalline Si films masked with a photoresist pattern of lines and spaces were etched in electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) Cl-2 and Cl-2/O-2 plasmas with additional rf biasing. Experiments were performed by varying the gas pressure, substrate temperature, and percentage of O-2 added. Moreover, the profile evolution during etching was simulated taking into account the transport of neutral and ionic species in microstructures and the following surface reactions: adsorption of neutral reactants, ion-stimulated desorption of reaction products, surface oxidation, and redeposition of etch products. The etched profiles obtained in ECR Cl-2 and Cl-2/O-2 plasmas were compared with simulated results, and interpreted in terms of the deposition of etch products and the surface oxidation that occur competitively during etching. Etch products desorbed from the surface in microstructures have a sticking coefficient S-p less than or similar to 0.1, while etch products arriving from the plasma have a much larger coefficient S-p greater than or similar to 0.5. It was also shown that the competitive surface oxidation by incoming oxygen atoms plays a, more important role in achieving aspect-ratio-independent etching than the deposition of etch products: the increased deposition of etch products resulted in enhanced sidewall tapering with little change in vertical etch rate; the surface oxidation resulted in inverse reactive-ion-etching lag without significant change in sidewall tapering.					18th Dry Process Symposium (DPS 96)18th Dry Process Symposium (DPS 96)	NOV 05-06, 1996NOV 05-06, 1996	Inst Elect Engineers Japan; Japan Soc Appl Phys; Inst Electr Informat & Commun Engineers; Electrochem Soc, Japan ChapterInst Elect Engineers Japan; Japan Soc Appl Phys; Inst Electr Informat & Commun Engineers; Electrochem Soc, Japan Chapter	WASEDA UNIV, INT CONF CTR, TOKYO, JAPANWASEDA UNIV, INT CONF CTR, TOKYO, JAPAN	29	0	0	0	0	0	29			0021-4922			WOS:A1997WY80000010

The graphene-dot wrapping takes place via the exfoliation of carbon dots during the co-reduction of Pt/Mo precursors and carbon dots at a low temperature in an aqueous solution. The synergistic effects of inner metallic alloy networks and outer graphene dots in the 3D PtxMo1-x@graphene are responsible for the outstanding HER performance and superb durability in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The 3D PtxMo1-x@ graphene shows a low Tafel slope of 32 mV/dec and 51 mV/dec together with a low overpotential of 32 mV and 97 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. The catalyst also shows superb stability, as confirmed by a large amount of repeated potential cycling exceeding 5000 cycles in acidic solution and long-term durability of over 50,000 seconds in an alkaline solution. This work provides a new feasible mean of synthesizing graphene-dot-wrapped Pt-based nanostructures with highly efficient catalytic activity and superb stability for HER without the need for surfactants or stabilizers.

Moreover, it also shows strong electrochemical durability with high turnover frequency values of 0.069 and 0.390 mol O-2 s(-1) at overpotentials of 300 and 400 mV, respectively.									71	5	0	0	5	0	71			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000418367400015

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that betatopic Ni species with high valence states are present within the Fe-NiS2 matrix and relatively less oxidized layers exist on the catalyst's surface, indicating its greatly enhanced anti-oxidized capability. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Ni and Fe sites on the Fe-NiS2 catalyst surface possess strong adsorption capacity toward hydroxyl ions compared with the Ni sites on NiS2. Benefiting from its unique microstructure and modulated electronic structure due to the effects of iron species, the Fe-NiS2 catalyst prepared on carbon fiber delivers a remarkably enhanced catalytic activity and superior long-life durability for overall water splitting. The present results provide an efficient strategy for the design and configuration of anti-oxidation catalysts, especially for energy storage and catalysis.									10	1	0	0	1	0	11			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000433048600041

In both cases, it was possible to decompose the barium carbonate below 690-degrees-C and to form the 123 phase directly from the precursor in an helium atmosphere. High-T(c) superconducting 123 phase with a sharp transition at 93 K was obtained after oxygen annealing. High-temperature, in situ, X-ray diffraction was used to follow phase evolution and reaction sequences at several stages in the formation as well as in the decomposition of the 123 phase. We investigated the effects of precursor homogeneity in the formation of the 123 phase during low-temperature processing. The properties and phase purity of the low-temperature processed superconductor ceramics are strongly dependent on precursor homogeneity and morphology. Additionally, our results show that the existence of low-temperature grown binary impurities affects the successive evolution of entire phase assemblage during further stages of heating till complete decomposition of the 123 phase.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			0921-4534			WOS:A1992KF57200019

Geographic variation in phenotypic plasticity in response to dissolved oxygen in an African cichlid fish								JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY				23	10			2091	2103		10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02069.x				OCT 2010	2010	Genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity are two ways in which organisms can adapt to local environmental conditions. We examined genetic and plastic variation in gill and brain size among swamp (low oxygen; hypoxic) and river (normal oxygen; normoxic) populations of an African cichlid fish, Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor victoriae. Larger gills and smaller brains should be advantageous when oxygen is low, and we hypothesized that the relative contribution of local genetic adaptation vs. phenotypic plasticity should be related to potential for dispersal between environments (because of gene flow's constraint on local genetic adaptation). We conducted a laboratory-rearing experiment, with broods from multiple populations raised under high-oxygen and low-oxygen conditions. We found that most of the variation in gill size was because of plasticity. However, both plastic and genetic effects on brain mass were detected, as were genetic effects on brain mass plasticity. F-1 offspring from populations with the highest potential for dispersal between environments had characteristically smaller and more plastic brains. This phenotypic pattern might be adaptive in the face of gene flow, if smaller brains and increased plasticity confer higher average fitness across environment types.									92	5	0	0	91	1	92			1010-061X	1420-9101		WOS:000281827000006	20722894	
J	Esrafili, Mehdi D.; Heydari, Safa								NO reduction over an Al-embedded MoS2 monolayer: a first-principles study								RSC ADVANCES				9	67			38973	38981		10.1039/c9ra05759e				DEC 1 2019	2019	Converting toxic air pollutants such as nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) into less harmful gases remains a critical challenge for many industrial technologies. Here, by performing first-principles calculations, we introduce a cheap, stable and novel catalyst for the conversion of NO and CO molecules into N2O and CO2 using Al-doped MoS2 (Al-MoS2). According to our results, dissociation of NO molecules on Al-MoS2 has a large energy barrier (3.62 eV), suggesting that it is impossible at ambient temperature. In contrast, the coadsorption of NO molecules to form (NO)(2) moieties is characterized as the first step of the NO reduction process. The formed (NO)(2) is unstable on Al-MoS2, and hence it is easily decomposed into N2O molecules, and an oxygen atom is adsorbed onto the Al atom (O-ads). This reaction step is exothermic and needs an activation energy of 0.37 eV to be overcome. Next, the O-ads moiety is removed from the Al atom by a CO molecule, and thereby the Al-MoS2 catalyst is recovered for the next round of reaction. The side reaction producing NO(2)via the reaction of NO with the O-ads moiety cannot proceed on Al-MoS2 due to its large activation energy.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				2046-2069		WOS:000501820700008	35540686

The key astrophysical resonance in the Ne-19 + p system has been definitely measured for the first time at Ec.m. = 456(-2)(+5) keV with an associated strength of 17(-5) (+7) meV. The present results are in agreement with resonance strength upper limits set by previous direct measurements, as well as resonance energies inferred from precision (He-3, t) charge exchange reactions. However, both the energy and strength of the 456 keV resonance disagree with a recent indirect study of the Ne-19(p,gamma)Na-20 reaction. In particular, the new Ne-19(p,gamma)Na-20 reaction rate is found to be factors of similar to 8 and similar to 5 lower than the most recent evaluation over the temperature range of oxygen- neon novae and astrophysical x-ray bursts, respectively. Nevertheless, we find that the Ne-19(p,gamma)Na-20 a reaction is likely to proceed fast enough to significantly reduce the flux of F-19 in nova ejecta and does not create a bottleneck in the breakout from the hot CNO cycles into the rp process.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0031-9007	1079-7114		WOS:000417692700002	29286739

Reference beta-Ni(OH)(2) and Fe-doped Ni(OH)(2) samples were synthesized by hydrothermal precipitation of mixed Ni(II) and Fe(III) nitrate aqueous solutions in a highly alkaline medium. The samples were investigated using X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), scanning and transmission electron microscopy (FE-SEM and TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Mossbauer spectroscopy, magnetic measurements, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and electrochemical measurements. Incorporation of Fe in beta-Ni(OH)(2) by cation substitution was confirmed from the shifts in position of XRPD lines due to the difference in the ionic radius of Fe3+ and Ni-2. The Fe-3-for-Ni2+ substitution in beta-Ni(OH)(2) caused formation of an interstratifled structure with beta-Ni(OH)(2) and alpha-Ni(OH)(2) structural units interconnected within the same structural layers and crystallites. Mossbauer spectra revealed the presence of Fe3+ ions in highly distorted octahedral sites, presumably at the boundary between the alpha-Ni(OH)(2) and beta-Ni(OH)(2) structural units within the same structural layer. Electrochemical measurements showed significant increase in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity of Fe-doped Ni(OH)(2) compared to pure phase. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J	HASHIMOTO, M				Thielemann, Friedrich/ABG-1866-2020	Thielemann, Friedrich/0000-0002-7256-9330			SUPERNOVA NUCLEOSYNTHESIS IN MASSIVE STARS								PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS				94	5			663	736		10.1143/PTP.94.663				NOV 1995	1995	Presupernova models and nucleosynthesis in massive stars are reviewd in the context of supernovae. First, presupernova evolutionary models of massive stars toward the onset of collapse from 13 to 70 M(.) stars in the main-sequence stage are presented. It is stressed that silicon (''Si'') shell burning is the key point to determine the final size of the iron core. As the result, we obtain the iron core ranges from 1.2 to 1.9 M(.) for 13-70 M(.) stars. Silicon-rich layers and the boundary between ''Si'' and oxygen-rich layers are neutronized during ''Si'' shell burning. The s-process during core helium burning is investigated in detail for whole massive stars. It is found that the weak component of the s-process is well overproduced compared with the solar system s-nuclei.Next, the results of the explosive nucleosynthesis in massive stars are presented. The explosion energy is assumed to be 1-1.5x10(51) erg. The location of the mass cut is adjusted to explain enough amount of Ni-56 to reproduce the observed light curves of Type Ib, Ic and Type II-L, II-P supernovae. Thus, the mass cut ranges from 1.2 to 1.9 M(.) for our presupernova models. The iron peak elements produced are critically influenced by both the location of the mass cut and the degree of neutronization around there. Then, it is found that the amount of Ni-56 produced ranges from 0.07 to 0.15 M(.). If the neutron-rich elements are observed in a remnant of supernova due to the explosion of a massive star, they would pose severe constraints to the presupernova models and to the scenario of the explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae. It is suggested that the lower rates of electron captures during ''Si'' burning will save the overproduction of the neutron-rich elements in spite of the way of convective mixing.The abundances ejected by the supernova explosion consist of those produced during the hydrostatic evolution and those by the explosion. For typical abundances (16 less than or equal to A less than or equal to 62) classified as the explosive and hydrostatic burning products, the ratio between the produced and solar system abundances agrees with each other within a factor of 2-3 when we consider the contribution from both Type Ia and Type II supernovae. The p-process during the passage of a shock wave through the oxygen/neon-rich layer co-produces about 60 % of the p-nuclei. It is insisted that the p-process is crucially affected by the seed nuclei produced by the s-process during the hydrostatic evolution of massive stars.Our presupernova models have been obtained using the reaction rate of C-12(alpha,gamma)O-16 published in 1985 which is about 2 times higher than the rate in 1988. Since the presupernova models are influenced by this rate, the ratio of Type Ia/Type II supernovae is also affected. Using the Schwarzschild criterion for convection, our results indicate that the higher rate in 1985 is preferred. However, if convective overshooting is included during core helium burning, a smaller C-12(alpha,gamma)O-16 rate would be suitable. To determine several uncertain nuclear reactions will clarify the confusion between the convection and the reaction rate. The absolute amounts of O-16 and Fe-56 become critical to model the chemical evolution of galaxies and to infer the boundary of stellar mass between a neutron star and a black hole.Thus our results play a crucial role to solve the problems for the origin of the elements, nuclear gamma-ray astronomy, supernova explosion, birth of a neutron star or a black hole, and evolution of galaxies from quasars. Our results will be also very useful to identify the progenitor and predict the observed abundances of supernovae like SN 1987A, SN 1993J and SN 1994I.									123	1	0	0	0	0	123			0033-068X			WOS:A1995TJ13400001

Herein, we report platinum (Pt) alloyed with titanium (Ti) from the surface of Ti3C2Tx MXenes to form Pt3Ti intermetallic compound (IMC) nanoparticles (NPs) via in situ coreduction. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) indicates that Pt undergoes a temperature-dependent transformation from single atoms to intermetallic compounds, and the catalyst reduced at 550 degrees C exhibits a superior HER performance in acidic media. The Pt/Ti3C2Tx-550 catalyst outperforms commercial Pt/Vulcan and has a small overpotential of 32.7 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 32.3 mV dec(-1). The HER current was normalized by the mass and dispersion of Pt, and the mass activity and specific activity of Pt/Ti3C2Tx-550 are 4.4 and 13 times higher, respectively, than those of Pt/Vulcan at an overpotential of 70 mV. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the (111)- and (100)-terminated Pt3Ti nanoparticles exhibit *H binding comparable to Pt(111), while the (110) termination has an *H adsorption that is too exergonic, thus poisoned in the low overpotential region. This work demonstrates the potential of MXenes as platforms for the design of electrocatalysts and may spur future research for other MXene-supported metal catalysts that can be used for a wide range of electrocatalytic reactions.									72	8	0	0	4	0	73			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000481563800038	31271283

The investigation with solid-state H-1, C-13, and Si-29 NMR analyses showed the influence of the oxygen affinity of Si atoms on the chemical structural changes of the SiOCH system during pyrolysis (up to 800 degrees C). In particular, the mechanism of phase segregation (SiOC-SiC+SiO2+C) in amorphous SiOC structure at 800-1250 degrees C was determined. Carbon in the Si-O-C networks is replaced by silicon, forming the Si-O-Si network, while the cleaved carbon atoms, which have unpaired electrons, combine, forming C=C bonds. This mechanism accounts for the structural rearrangement from O2SiC2 to O3SiC to SiO4 (from the silicon-centered standpoint, i.e., SiO2 phase), the growth of -SiC crystallites, and the carbon clustering.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			1574-1443	1574-1451		WOS:000449330700005

However, the application of Li/S cells is still hampered by short cycle life. Sulfur graphene oxide (S-GO) nanocomposites have shown promise as cathode materials for long-life Li/S cells because oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of graphene oxide were successfully used as sulfur immobilizers by forming weak bonds with sulfur and polysulfides. While S-GO showed much improved cycling performance, the capacity decay still needs to be improved for commercially viable cells. In this study, we attempt to understand the capacity fading mechanism based on an ex situ study of the structural and chemical evolution of S-GO nanocomposite cathodes with various numbers of cycles using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It is found that both the surface morphologies and chemical structures of the cathode materials change considerably with increasing number of cycles. These changes are attributed to several unexpected chemical reactions of lithium with S GO nanocomposites occurring during the discharge charge processes with the formation of Li2CO3, Li2SO3, Li2SO4, and COSO2Li species. These reactions result in the loss of recyclable active sulfur on the surface of the electrode, and thus capacity fades while coulombic efficiency is near 100%. Moreover, the reaction products accumulate on the cathode surface, forming a compact blocking insulating layer which may make the diffusion of Li ions into/out of the cathode difficult during the discharge charge process and thus lead to lower utilization of sulfur at higher rates. We think that these two observations are significant contributors to the capacity and rate capability degradation of the Li/S-GO cells. Therefore, for the rechargeable Li/S-GO cells, we suggest that the content of oxygen-containing functional groups on GO should be optimized and more stable functional groups need to be identified for further improvement of the cycling performance. The information we gain from this study may provide general insights into the fundamental understanding of the degradation mechanisms of other rechargeable Li/S cells using similar oxygencontaining functional groups as sulfur immobilizers.									97	5	0	0	6	0	99			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000340353000008	24781200

In this work, the potential of employing graphenylene-based triple-atom catalysts for the nitrogen reduction reaction was investigated by using first-principles calculations. The performance of these catalysts was studied focusing on configuration optimization, thermal stability, catalyst selectivity and activity and the interaction mechanism. There was electron transfer between the transition metal atoms and the graphenylene substrate, which strengthens the structure stability of the complex systems and brings about sufficient catalytic activity. A more negative Delta G (N-2) for the nitrogen reduction reaction than Delta G (H) for the hydrogen evolution reaction is selected as an evaluation standard of good selectivity. Moreover, Delta G (*N*NH) or Delta G (*NNH) < 0.6 eV is used as a screening criterion for good activity. By screening, Mo-3@GP is found to show the best nitrogen reduction reaction performance with a low limiting potential of -0.39 V through a consecutive pathway. The excellent performance derives from the largest electron transfer ability of Mo-3 atoms and the electronic reservoir function of the GP substrate.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000869866100001	36218143

We report the controllable growth of molybdenum disulfide with different boundary structures via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). A facile and rigorous route to distinguish the boundary structure via oxygen etching was proposed. The boundary control was realized by changing the substrate height to adjust the Mo:S ratios. Based on the stability differences of the boundary structures in oxygen, the microscopic boundary structures were characterized by oxygen etching. Our work combined growth and etching to develop a general route to identify the boundary structure of MoS2. Results of this study provide a mean to determine the controllable growth of MoS2 domains with different boundaries and to design the domains with special boundary structure efficiently.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000514902000041

Herein, facile hydrothermal growth followed by electrodeposition is applied to fabricate a RuO2@TiO2 electrode with nanostructured morphology toward the chlorine evolution reaction (CER), which contributes to reducing energy consumption and environmental pollution in comparison with the traditional thermal decomposition route to form a "mud-crack" structure. The appropriate amount of RuO2 nanoparticles (NPs) decorated on TiO2 nanobelt arrays (NBs) is determined by controlling the electrodeposition time to realize aligned morphological features instead of typically calculating various molar ratios of Ti and Ru to determine the best catalytic activity. Benefitting from the nanostructure of broadly outstretched TiO2 NBs and the perfect decoration of highly catalytically active RuO2 NPs roughening the nanomaterial surface, the RuO2 NPs@TiO2 NBs electrode exhibits enhanced catalytic activity with splendid stability and high selectivity toward the CER. It requires an extremely low potential of 1.34 V (overpotential 80 mV) to achieve a catalytic current density of 50 mA/cm(2) and the current efficiency of the material electrode for chlorine evolution is up to 90%, making it among the best CER anodes reported so far.

Herein, a novel donor-acceptor (D-A) covalent organic framework (CT-COF) was constructed by the Schiff-base reaction of carbazole-triazine based D-A monomers and possessed a suitable energy band structure, strong visible-light-harvesting, and abundant nitrogen sites. CT-COF as a metal-free photocatalyst could reduce CO2 with gaseous H2O to CO as the main carbonaceous product with approximately stoichiometric O-2 evolution under visible-light irradiation and without cocatalyst. The CO evolution rate (102.7 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) was 68.5 times that of g-C3N4 under the same conditions. In situ Fourier-transform (FT)IR analysis indicated that CT-COF could adsorb and activate the CO2 and H2O molecules and that COOH* species may be a key intermediate. DFT calculations suggested that nitrogen atoms in the triazine rings may be photocatalytically active sites.									89	4	0	0	11	0	89			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000523506000008	31958209

However, wastewaters are a heterogeneous mixture of materials with a wide range of particle size and molecular weight, and most processes involved in treatment (sedimentation, mass transfer, adsorption, diffusion, biochemical reactions, filtration) are effected by particle dimension. This study deals with the evolution;of the particular and dissolved content of synthetic sewage during treatment. The experimental system consisted of a pilot-scale low-rate trickling filter, with and without secondary settlement, followed by crossflow microfiltration (CFMF). In terms of particle size distribution (PSD), results show a shift towards larger particle sizes through biological filtration, most of which can then be removed by settlement. Some fine particles remain and these can be removed by CFMF with a 0.1 mu m pore size membrane. High performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) was used to study the evolution of the dissolved fraction of wastewater through treatment. Both PSD and HPSEC are shown to be valuable tools to assess the performance of wastewater treatment processes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Moreover, because fossil fuels are a non-renewable energy source, they cannot meet the continuously increasing demand for energy. Therefore, the development of clean and renewable energy sources is necessitated. Hydrogen energy is a clean, non-polluting renewable energy source that can ease the energy pressure of the whole society. The sunlight received by the Earth is 1.7 x 10(14) J in 1 s, which far exceeds the total energy consumption of humans in one year. Therefore, conversion of solar energy to valuable hydrogen energy is of significance for reducing the dependence on fossil fuels. Since Fujishima and Honda first reported on TiO2 in 1972, it has been discovered that semiconductors can generate clean, pollution-free hydrogen through water splitting driven by electricity or light. Hydrogen generated through this approach can not only replace fossil fuels but also provide environmentally friendly renewable hydrogen energy, which has attracted considerable attention. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting can use solar energy to produce clean, sustainable hydrogen energy. Because the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over a photoanode is sluggish, the overall energy conversion efficiency is considerably low, limiting the practical application of PEC water splitting. A cocatalyst is, thus, necessary to improve PEC water splitting performance. So far, the synthesis of first-row transition-metal-based (e.g., Fe, Co, Ni, and Mn) cocatalysts has been intensively studied. Iron is earth-abundant and less toxic than other transition metals, making it a good cocatalyst. In addition, iron-based compounds exhibit the properties of a semiconductor/metal and have unique electronic structures, which can improve electrical conductivity and water adsorption. Various iron-based catalysts with high activity have been designed to improve the efficiency of PEC water oxidation. This article briefly summarizes the research progress related to the structure, synthesis, and application of iron oxyhydroxides, iron-based layered double hydroxides, and iron-based perovskites and discusses the evaluation of the performance of these cocatalysts toward photoelectrochemical water oxidation.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			1000-6818			WOS:000613263000003

Herein we report the designed synthesis of hierarchical nanosheet-based CoMoO4-NiMoO4 nanotubes by a hydrothermal treatment and a subsequent calcination method. The walls of the hierarchical nanotubes are composed of interconnected NiMoO4 nanosheets and CoMoO4 nanoparticles anchored on the surface of the nanosheets. The diameter of the hollow interior, the thickness of NiMoO4 nanosheets and the diameter of CoMoO4 nanoparticles are around 180 nm, less than 6 nm and 3 nm, respectively, providing the hierarchical nanotubes with a high surface area and a large pore volume. When evaluated as electrodes for pseudocapacitors, the hierarchical nanotubes with an appropriate amount of CoMoO4 show a high specific capacitance of 1079 F g(-1) at a current density of 5 A g(-1) and excellent stability with 98.4% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles. Furthermore, an asymmetric capacitor, consisting of active carbon and hierarchical nanosheet-based CoMoO4-NiMoO4 nanotubes as negative and positive electrodes, respectively, delivers an energy density of 33 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 375 W kg(-1), and 16.3 W h kg(-1) even at a high power density of 6000 W kg(-1). The supercapacitive properties are much higher than those of single-phase NiMoO4 nanotubes, and most of the other metal molybdates and metal oxides reported previously. Besides, the hierarchical nanotubes also exhibit much better electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction than single-phase NiMoO4 nanotubes, and most of the other metal molybdates and metal oxides. Our results demonstrate the importance of rational design of complex hollow structures with enhanced properties for a wide range of practical applications.									110	6	0	0	10	0	111			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000365011400028

SEM-EDS and XPS were used to study the morphology of coal-based electrode and the composition and existing state of the load substances, and the reaction mechanism were analysed and discussed. The results show that the removal rates of CNT, Cu, Zn, CN-, SCN- in cyanide wastewater were 97.03%, 95.79%, 99.82%, 99.42% and 94.19%, respectively, when the applied voltage of 4 V, the electrode distance of 10 mm, the flow rate of 30 ml/min, the reaction time of 2.5 h and the dosage of activated carbon particles of 2 g. The applied voltage is the key factor affecting ion removal. When the voltage was 2 V, the ion removal is mainly due to the synergistic effect of chemisorption and electrosorption. The CN-, SCN-, and metal cyanide complex anions in wastewater migrate to the anode of coal-based anode and particle electrode rapidly under the combined action of electric field and magnetic stirring. On the surface of porous coal-based electrode, the removal of CN-, SCN- was mainly attributed to the oxidation of oxygen evolution from the anode reaction, while the removal of Cu, Zn and other metal ions was mainly by the electrodeposition process on the cathode surface.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			0959-3330	1479-487X		WOS:000493230900001	31591951

In this work, we have prepared a quasi-double star catalyst composed of nearby Ni and Fe active sites via a simple pyrolysis of Ni and Fe co-doped Zn-based MOFs in order to achieve a high selectivity at a low overpotential during the CO2 RR. Specifically, the optimized Ni/Fe-N-C catalyst shows an exclusive selectivity (a maximum FE(CO) of 98%) at a low overpotential of 390 mV vs. RHE, which is superior to both the single metal counterparts (Ni-N-C and Fe-N-C catalysts) and other state-of-the-art M-N-C catalysts. The DFT results further reveal that regulating the catalytic CO2 RR performance via nearby Ni and Fe active sites can potentially break the activity benchmark of the single metal counterparts because the neighboring Ni and Fe active sites not only function in synergy to decrease the reaction barrier for the formation of COOH* and desorption of CO* in comparison to their single metal counterparts, but also prevent the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work presents a quasi-double-star catalyst composed of two metal sites for high-efficiency CO2 reduction, which paves the way for the rational design of bimetallic catalysts with separated active sites for other reactions.									7	2	0	0	0	0	8			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000681618700001

Above the temperature of 750 degrees C, hydrogen desorption from the thermally decomposed as received powder is kinetically delayed compared to that from the pre-oxidized samples. The scanning electron microscopy observations suggest that the delay stems from simultaneous surface coarsening and particles sintering that occur predominantly in the as-received powder at lower temperatures. It is also suggested that the difference in morphology evolution of the as-received and pre-oxidized powders originates from the dependence of Ti diffusion on the concentration of oxygen dissolved in Ti, since the oxide layer itself was found to dissociate at lower temperatures (similar to 500 degrees C).

Herein, a visible-light-absorbing Sr2NiWO6 double perovskite oxide photocatalyst was successfully prepared via a conventional solid-state reaction method. The intrinsic Sr2NiWO6 shows photocatalytic oxygen evaluation reaction (OER) activity of 60 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), even without loading any cocatalysts. The DFT calculation indicates that the Ni species on the surface is the active site for the OER. The photocatalytic OER activity was further improved by loading Pt and RuO2 dual redox cocatalysts on the surface of Sr2NiWO6 to achieve a photocatalytic OER activity of 420 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), which corresponds to a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 8.6% (lambda approximate to 420 nm). The result indicates that Sr2NiWO6 is one of the best double perovskite oxide-based photocatalysts for the photocatalytic OER, and the activity is even comparable to the benchmark BiVO4-based photocatalyst. The improvement of the photocatalytic OER activity is due to the provision of more active redox sites as well as the synergetic effect of the dual redox cocatalysts in facilitating charge separation and transfer. This work demonstrates that double perovskite oxides may serve as a novel class of efficient and stable oxide-based semiconductor photocatalysts for water splitting.									25	1	0	0	1	0	25			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000541679900043	32407619

The PAW trajectories were calculated for several temperatures between 1 and 600 K, for evolution time periods up to 20 ps, and with a constant time interval of 0.12 fs. At elevated temperatures proton transfer is not associated with a well-defined C-2v-symmetric transition state, but takes place in widely differing geometric situations, Although a short O - O distance favors proton transfer, it is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition. Analysis of the data by a discriminant method and with a neural network yielded several relevant molecular parameters, and the resulting discrimination functions predicted the occurrence of proton transfer with an accuracy greater than 95%. The energetics of the proton motion was modeled by calculating time evolutions of the potential energy along a properly chosen reaction coordinate within a heavy-light-heavy atom approximation At any instant the proton motion is governed by this potential, but while the proton moves, the potential also changes due to the dynamics of the molecule. Three extremes can be distinguished: i) Normal periods, in which the proton is trapped at one oxygen atom. The proton is stationary within an approximately constant, strongly asymmetric potential; the frequency of about 2850 cm(-1) is close to the experimentally observed v(OH) frequency. ii) Statistical isolated proton-transfer transitions, in which the proton rapidly moves from one oxygen atom to the other. The process starts and ends with strongly asymmetric potentials, but passes through (nearly) symmetric double- or single-minimum potentials. iii) Proton-shuttling periods, which include several consecutive nonstatistical transitions. These are not true proton transfers. The proton is (quasi)stationary within a (nearly) symmetric single-minimum potential, which remains approximately constant for a longer time period; the motion corresponds to a v(OH) vibration with a frequency of about 2000 cm(-1).

Previously, we reported high OER electrocatalytic activity from nanocrystals of the cubic phase vs. poor activity from the layered phase - the archetypal lithium-ion battery cathode. Here we apply transmission electron microscopy, electron diffraction, voltammetry and elemental analysis under OER electrolysis conditions to show that labile Li+ ions partially deintercalate from layered LiCoO2, initiating structural reorganization to the cubic spinel LiCo2O4, in parallel with formation of a more active catalytic phase. Comparison of cubic LiCoO2 (50 nm) to iridium (5 nm) nanoparticles for OER catalysis (commercial benchmark for membrane-based systems) in basic and neutral electrolyte reveals excellent performance in terms of Tafel slope (48 mV dec(-1)), overpotential (eta = similar to 420 mV@10 mA cm(-2) at pH = 14), faradaic yield (100%) and OER stability (no loss in 14 hours). The inherent OER activity of cubic LiCoO2 and spinel LiCo2O4 is attributed to the presence of [Co4O4](n+) cubane structural units, which provide lower oxidation potential to Co4+ and lower intercubane hole mobility. By contrast, the layered phase, which lacks cubane units, exhibits extensive intra-planar hole delocalization which entropically hinders the four electron/hole concerted OER reaction. An essential distinguishing trait of a truly relevant catalyst is efficient continuous operation in a real electrolyzer stack. Initial trials of cubic LiCoO2 in a solid electrolyte alkaline membrane electrolyzer indicate continuous operation for 1000 hours (without failure) at current densities up to 400 mA cm(-2) and overpotential lower than proven PGM (platinum group metal) catalysts.									64	4	0	0	5	0	65			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000367622700021

The aim of depositing a well-adhered composite coating onto the surface of the titanium and nickel substrate materials was pursued using three different coatings. The performance of the produced anodes was examined in terms of oxygen evolution potential and service life. Both of the anodes with PbO2-CoOx or PbO2-Co3O4 deposited on titanium resulted in reduction of the oxygen evolution potential of 300 to 400 mV compared with a conventional PbCaSn anode. The anodes prepared by applying the same coatings onto a nickel substrate showed poor stability in the acidic electrolyte media used in this experiment to represent typical copper electrowinning conditions. Of the different coatings tested, a combination of thermal deposition of a SnO2-Sb2O3 interlayer on the surface of a titanium substrate followed by electrodeposition of the top layer of the composite coating resulted in the best electrochemical activity and service life for the anodes. A Tafel slope of 88 mV dec(-1) was recorded for the anode with a top coating of PbO2-CoOx and 47 mV dec(-1) for the anode with a top coating of PbO2-Co3O4, which both compare favourably to the 122 mV dec(-1) which was observed for a conventional PbCaSn anode. Anodisation tests were carried out for a period of 16 h both in the presence and in the absence of the organic additive thiourea in the electrolyte. Corrosion rates were estimated from these tests and the results showed that the titanium-based anode with a SnO2-Sb2O3 interlayer and PbO2-CoOx coating has a lower corrosion rate than a conventional PbCaSn anode, whereas the corrosion rate of the titanium-based anode with same interlayer and PbO2-Co3O4 coating might be much greater but this remains to be confirmed. The results also showed that the addition of thiourea appears to increase the corrosion rate of the composite-coated anodes although it reduces the corrosion rate of a PbCaSn anode. Thiourea showed no obvious effect on the anode potential. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									15	5	0	0	0	0	20			0304-386X			WOS:000322926600008

The occurrence of two pools of fatty acids has been hypothesized. Analysis of numerous plant species showed higher galactolipase activity in the chilling-sensitive than in the chilling-resistant plants. Differences in the pH-dependence curve and in the response to detergents of galactolipases from these two groups of plants suggest heterogeneity of the enzyme.Referring to the hypothesis concerning the role of high melting-point fatty acids of phosphatidylglicerol molecular species in chilling sensitivity the data are presented against generalization of this hypothesis.									9	0	0	0	9	0	11			0001-527X			WOS:A1997WQ20800003	9241351

The coating solutions were prepared by dissolving IrCl3. 3H(2)O in 15% HCl (traditional method), by dissolving iridium acetylacetonate in isopropanol and acetic acid (inorganic sol-gel method) and by dissolving IrCl3. 3H(2)O in ethyleneglycol and citric acid (Pechini method). The redox processes occurring on these films were characterized by cyclic voltammetry at 20 mV s(-1) in 0.5 M aqueous H2SO4 at room temperature. The measured anodic voltammetric charge is related to the active area of the electrode; the electrode derived from traditional method had the highest value. The Tafel plots revealed that the electrocatalytic activities are not affected by the surface morphology, indicating that the preparation procedures produce electrocatalytic coatings with comparable activity. For an applied current density of 100 mA cm(-2) the combination of the conductivity and roughness effects caused the electrode derived from inorganic gel and heat-treated at 400 degrees C to exhibit the lowest overpotential for the OER. On the other hand, the accelerated life tests performed at 80 degrees C in 30% aqueous H2SO4 with an anodic current density of 750 mA cm(-2) showed that the stability of the coatings increases with the temperature of the heat-treatment and the Pechini-derived electrodes had a longer-life time under this condition in all the cases.

Understanding the relationship between a material's structure and functionality is an important step in the process, such that viable polymorphs for a given chemical composition need to be identified. Machine-learning-based surrogate models have the potential to accelerate the search for polymorphs that target specific applications. Herein, we report a readily generalizable active-learning (AL) accelerated algorithm for identification of electrochemically stable iridium oxide polymorphs of IrO2 and IrO3. The search is coupled to a subsequent analysis of the electrochemical stability of the discovered structures for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Structural candidates are generated by identifying all 956 structurally unique AB(2) and AB(3) prototypes in existing materials databases (more than 38000). Next, using an active learning approach, we find 196 IrO2 polymorphs within the thermodynamic amorphous synthesizability limit and reaffirm the global stability of the rutile structure. We find 75 synthesizable IrO3 polymorphs and report a previously unknown FeF3-type structure as the most stable, termed alpha-IrO3. To test the algorithms performance, we compare to a random search of the candidate space and report at least a 2-fold increase in the rate of discovery. Additionally, the AL approach can acquire the most stable polymorphs of IrO2 and IrO3 with fewer than 30 density functional theory optimizations. Analysis of the structural properties of the discovered polymorphs reveals that octahedral local coordination environments are preferred for nearly all low-energy structures. Subsequent Pourbaix Ir-H2O analysis shows that alpha-IrO3 is the globally stable solid phase under acidic OER conditions and supersedes the stability of rutile IrO2. Calculation of theoretical OER surface activities reveal ideal weaker binding of the OER intermediates on alpha-IrO3 than on any other considered iridium oxide. We emphasize that the proposed AL algorithm can be easily generalized to search for any binary metal oxide structure with a defined stoichiometry.									37	1	0	0	4	0	37			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000551412800045		
J	Lingens, A; Reeker, M; Schreiber, M								Instability of buoyant diffusion flames								EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS				20	4			241	248						FEB 1996	1996	Buoyant jet diffusion flames are known to exhibit large scale vortical flow structures strongly interacting with flame structures. In the present work, the formation and evolution of coherent flow structures is studied in a methane/air coflow arrangement. This is accomplished by utilizing visualization techniques (planar laser induced hydroxyl fluorescence and Mie-scattering) and Laser Doppler Velocimetry. A striking repeatability and correlation of evolving coherent structures of the air co-flow and the reaction zone is observed. In the transitional region, flow and flame structures oscillate at very pure frequencies ranging from 10-15 Hz. A local absolutely unstable velocity profile close to the burner rim seems to be responsible. Self-excited axisymmetric wavelike structures propagate up- and downstream of this location. We study the influence of the,exit velocities and the type of coflowing oxidizer (air or oxygen) on the location of transition to periodic flow structures and related frequencies. Conditional averages of image and velocity data are employed to describe the evolution of coherent flow structures and their interaction with flame structures.									47	2	0	0	1	0	49			0723-4864			WOS:A1996TY89200002

ABO(3)-type perovskite oxides can improve their catalytic activity and electronic conductivity by doping transition metal elements at B sites. Here, we develop a novel Sm0.5Sr0.5Co1-xNixO3-delta (SSCN) nanofiber-structured electrocatalyst. In 0.1 M KOH electrolyte solution, Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Ni0.2O3-delta (SSCN82) with the optimal Co: Ni molar ratio exhibits good electrocatalytic activity for OER/ORR, affording a low onset potential of 1.39 V, a slight Tafel slope of 123.8 mV dec(-1), and a current density of 6.01 mA cm(-2) at 1.8 V, and the ORR reaction process was four-electron reaction pathway. Combining the morphological characteristic of SSCN nanofibers with the synergistic effect of cobalt and nickel with a suitable molar ratio is beneficial to improving the catalytic activity of SSCN perovskite oxides. SSCN82 exhibits good bi-functional catalytic performance and electrochemical double-layer capacitance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1420-3049		WOS:000764720000001	35209051	
J	GILLERY, P; MONBOISSE, JC; MAQUART, FX; BOREL, JP								AGING MECHANISMS OF PROTEINS								DIABETES & METABOLISM				17	1			1	15						JAN-FEB 1991	1991	All the living molecules appear to suffer from the deleterous effects of aging, but the primary mechanisms of this inexorable evolution are still unknown. In the case of proteins, two major types of chemical reactions participate in the aging phenomena: 1) structural transformations induced by the addition of radicals by enzymic or non-enzymic reactions, 2) proteolytic cleavages.Among the reactions of the first group, the non-enzymatic glycation is the more generalized, not only in diabetic patients but also in non diabetic subjects. This glycation depends on the probabilities of encounters between circulating glucose molecules and free amino groups existing either at the N-terminal end of the polypeptide chains or on the lysyl side chains. These reactions are more frequent in the extracellular spaces and connective tissues because glucose circulates freely in these spaces, because the level of glucose is better controlled inside the cells (and even lower in diabetes mellitus), and finally because the proteins of these regions, such as the collagens, fibronectin and elastin, are relatively long lived, even if their life-span is really shorter than it was precedently believed.The binding of sugar residues to protein amino groups determines frequent modifications of structure that often make the molecule inactive. For instance, when a glucose unit binds to a lysyl radical located in the active center of an enzyme, it suppresses the activity of this enzyme. More generally, in the case of the connective tissue proteins that participate in complex supramolecular assemblies, the presence of additional radicals on some ponctual locations may interfere with the correct association of molecules. This is particularly true for basement membranes whose structure is impaired in diabetes. Glycation might also introduce abnormal cross-links between polypeptides or modify the antigenic power of some proteins and explain the formation of autoantibodies.Another property of glycated proteins is their reaction with oxygen leading to the formation of superoxide. The binding of a reducing sugar on an amino function is followed by an Amadori rearrangement that forms a ketol group. Ketols groups have the property to transmit electrons to molecular oxygen, and to forming superoxide radicals. Superoxide is capable of degrading only one protein: collagen, but it is also able to transform itself into hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals, which are far more toxic than O2-. The result of the formation of these oxygen free radicals from glycated proteins is the initiation of the degradation of several types of proteins, like the collagens.Several experiments conducted in our laboratory demonstrated that superoxide degrades type I collagen molecule and liberates several small peptides which might be isolated and characterized. Then, non specific proteinases may intervene in order to complete the degradation into small peptides or amino acids.When oxygen free radicals penetrate through plasma membranes, particularly in the case of hydrogen peroxide, they may cause degradations of intracellular molecules. For instance, H2O2 induces nicks in DNA molecules. These nicks are repaired through a complex mechanism that comprises the formation of polymers of ADP-ribose bound the some enzyme proteins. This phenomenon of ADP-ribosylation merits to take place among the markers of protein aging.									12	0	0	0	7	0	12			1262-3636	1878-1780		WOS:A1991FH37100001	1651260

Enhancement of photoinhibition by the 'stay-green' mutation cytG								PHYSIOLOGIA PLANTARUM				115	3			468	478		10.1034/j.1399-3054.2002.1150317.x				JUL 2002	2002	The 'stay-green' mutation cytG in soybean (Glycine max ) partially inhibits the degradation of the light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) and the associated chlorophyll during monocarpic senescence. cytG did not alter the breakdown of the cytochrome b 6/f complex, thylakoid ATP synthase or components of Photosystem I. In contrast, cytG accelerated the loss of oxygen evolution activity and PSII reaction-centre proteins. These data suggest that LHCII and other thylakoid components are degraded by separate pathways. In leaves induced to senesce by darkness, cytG inhibited the breakdown of LHCII and chlorophyll, but it did not enhance the loss of PSII-core components, indicating that the accelerated degradation of PSII reaction centre proteins in cytG was light dependent. Illumination of mature and senescent leaves of wild-type soybean in the presence of an inhibitor (lincomycin) of chloroplast protein synthesis revealed that senescence per se did not affect the rate of photoinhibition in leaves. Likewise, mature leaves of the cytG mutant did not show more photoinhibition than wild-type leaves. However, in senescent cytG leaves, photoinhibition proceeded more rapidly than in the wild-type. We conclude that the cytG mutation enhances photoinhibition in senescing leaves, and photoinhibition causes the rapid loss of PSII reaction-centre proteins during senescence in cytG .									36	2	0	0	35	1	39			0031-9317	1399-3054		WOS:000176442100017	12081540

We report the first data on the redox state of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) beneath the Komsomolskaya-Magnitnaya kimberlite pipe (KM), Upper Muna field, central Siberian craton. The oxygen fugacity of the KM peridotites ranges from -2.6 to 0.3 logarithmic units relative to the fayalite-magnetite-quartz buffer ( increment logfO(2)(FMQ)) at depths of 120-220 km. The enriched KM peridotites are more oxidized (-1.0-0.3 increment logfO(2)(FMQ)) than the depleted ones (from -1.4 to -2.6 increment logfO(2)(FMQ)). The oxygen fugacity of some enriched samples may reflect equilibrium with carbonate or carbonate-bearing melts at depths >170 km. A comparison of well-studied coeval Udachnaya and KM peridotites revealed similar redox conditions in the SCLM of the Siberian craton beneath these pipes. Nevertheless, Udachnaya peridotites show wider variations in oxygen fugacity (-4.95-0.23 increment logfO(2)(FMQ)). This indicates the presence of more reduced mantle domains in the Udachnaya SCLM. In turn, the established difference in the redox conditions is a good explanation for the lower amounts of resorbed diamonds in the Udachnaya pipe (12%) in comparison with the KM kimberlites (33%). The obtained results advocate a lateral heterogeneity in the oxidation state of the Siberian SCLM.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5				2075-163X		WOS:000579951000001

However, the structure and composition of the active phase of Ni-Fe compounds are not yet understood. Rational design of Ni-Fe compounds with proper composition and exposed active sites is highly desirable to further improve their performance. Here we reported the synthesis of different Ni-Fe compounds by incorporating Fe into the Ni(OH)(2) lattice with controlled concentrations and obtained several products including Ni-Fe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with different amounts of Fe and NiFe2O4. In addition, beta-Ni(OH)(2) without Fe and alpha-Fe2O3 without Ni have also been synthesized for comparison. Among these four Ni/Fe based compounds, we found that the two-dimensional (2D) Ni0.8Fe0.2-LDH nanosheets with a hexagonal shape manifest a highest OER activity with a lowest overpotential of 235 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a smallest Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1) and excellent stability over 24 h. In situ Raman, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy show that the enhanced activity of Ni0.8Fe0.2-LDH is due to the increased oxidation state of Ni from Ni2+ to Ni3+. Our findings demonstrate that the composition of Ni-Fe compounds influences the oxidizing ability of Ni and consequently their catalytic performance. We also reveal a strong correlation between the structure and oxidizing power of the Ni in Ni-Fe compounds and their OER activity, indicating that the well-engineered structure and Ni-site electronics are the primary origins of their OER activity. This work not only provides a promising guideline for the design and synthesis of Ni/Fe based compounds, but also highlights the crucial role of each component in enhancing the activity of these electrocatalysts.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000537113200028	32388544

It is crucial to clarify the behavior of OH radicals in this process. A time-resolved 2-D OH radial distribution was investigated in a pulsed corona discharge by planar laser-induced fluorescence at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. The OH evolutions under different gas components were studied, and the evolution process was simulated. The OH decay processes were found to be divided into two periods: a fast decay period and a slow decay period. The O, N, and HO2 are dominant radicals for OH generation and decay. The OH radicals are mainly generated near a nozzle electrode. The concentration variations of O-2, NO, and H2O in the background gas led to different OH density evolutions. The OH distribution zones were different as gas components varied. Themaximum area of OH radical distribution after discharge decreased by 20% as O-2 increased from 5% to 8%, and it decreased by 69% as NO (150 ppm) was added into the background gas.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0093-3813	1939-9375		WOS:000316205200011

However, the Cu2O structure encounters complex structure evolution under negative potential conditions, making it difficult to obtain the specific active structures. Here, we found an operando activation strategy for the OD-Cu catalyst based on the cyclic voltammetry (CV) process conducted in CO2- saturated solution. Assisted by an interval eCO2RR, the sluggish octahedral-Cu2O (o-Cu2O) evolves into active Cu/Cu2O-CV, with the formed "metallic Cu" uniformly anchoring on o-Cu2O and accompanied by rich Cu delta+-Cu0 grain boundaries. Combined with in situ and ex situ characterization, compared to o-Cu2O, Cu/Cu2O-CV significantly promoted the formation of C2 products (FEC2 increased from 17.13 to 73.44%). By enhancing the adsorption of CO* and subsequently the formation of O*C*COH intermediates, the Faraday efficiency for ethanol was significantly improved from 5.15% (on o-Cu2O) to 56.56% (on Cu/Cu2O- CV). Our study provides evidence for a previously unexplored function of CO2 in the evolution of o-Cu2O catalysts into highly active structures for the generation of multicarbon products, opening a pathway for the rational design of future catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000868427100001

A series of anode coatings RuxIr1-xO2 (x = 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, and 0) were deposited onto titanium substrate (TA2) by a Pechini method using commercial IrCl3 center dot 3H(2)O and RuCl3 center dot 3H(2)O as source chemicals. The prepared samples were heat treated at 450 degrees C for 1 hr. The phase structures, crystal sizes, microstructures and morphologies were analyzed by XRD and TEM techniques. The diffractograms revealed well defined crystalline structures, showing the different peaks of the rutilic phase that was common to both Ru and Ir oxides for RuxIr1-xO2 (x = 0.7, 0.5, 0.3 and 0) because the lattice parameters for RuO2 and IrO2 are rather similar. A great amount of Metallic Ru could be detected in the coating without Ir (x = 1). The finest average size of roughly 6-7 nm was observed in the coating with RuxIr1-xO2 (x = 0.7, 0.5, 0.3 and 0). The crystal size remained constant for 0 < x < 0.7 whereas the crystallite size of Ru increased to 20 nm and a small quantity of RuO2 increased to 10nm for x = 1.

The formation and evolution of surface nitrogen functional groups of the activated carbon were investigated. Element analysis, Boehm titration and X-ray photoelectric spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to determine the element contents, acid and basic functional groups contents and the types of nitrogen-containing functional groups of activated carbons. The results showed that when the activated carbon were treated at the temperature below 700 ℃, nitrogen functional groups were mostly nitrogen oxides(N-X, such as amides, imides and lactams) generated mainly by combining ammonia and surface oxygen-containing functional groups, and some pyridinic(N-6) and pyrrolic(N-5) groups by the reaction of ammonia and carbon atoms in the carbon matrix. when the temperature increased to 800 ℃, the formation of nitrogen functional groups were contributed to the combination of ammonia and carbon atoms and pyridinic, pyrrolic and quaternary(N-Q) groups were predominantly generated. With the temperature increasing, amides, lactams and imides were progressively converted into pyridinic, pyrrolic groups and eventually into quaternary groups. Besides, there was no quaternary surface group below 800 ℃.			为研究活性炭表面含氮官能团的形成与演变规律,以硝酸氧化预处理后的水蒸气活化椰壳活性炭(ACO)为原料,在300~1 000 ℃范围内采用了3种模式进行氨气改性,制得含有各类含氮官能团的改性活性炭。采用元素分析法、Boehm滴定法和X射线光电子能谱(XPS)技术分析了活性炭的元素含量、酸碱性和表面含氮官能团种类。结果表明:在改性温度700 ℃之前的氨气改性过程中,活性炭表面含氮官能团主要来源于表面含氧官能团与氨气的结合所形成酰胺、酰亚胺和内酰胺等氮氧型(N-X),以及部分氨气与碳原子直接结合形成的吡啶型(N-6)和吡咯型(N-5)等含氮官能团;当氨气处理温度达到800 ℃时,炭表面的含氮基团主要来源于氨气与炭表面的碳原子直接结合形成的N-6、 N-5和季氮型(N-Q)含氮官能团。在热处理温度升高过程中,N-X逐渐转变为N-6、 N-5和N-Q含氮官能团;当温度大于800 ℃时, N-6、 N-5含氮基团能逐渐转化为N-Q含氮官能团。氨气改性温度达到800 ℃之前,活性炭表面没有形成N-Q官能团。						0	2	0	0	0	0	2			0253-2417			CSCD:5973780

Through the analysis of explosion parameters, the influence of the fluctuation of initial ambient temperature on explosion intensity was revealed, and the micro-combustion mechanism of premixed system was discussed. The results show that under the ambient temperature of 273 K, the mixtures with the equivalence ratio from phi 0.8 to 1.0, the oxygen relative ratio gamma<0.30 and phi=1.2, gamma<0.35 could not be ignited, but other premixed systems could, and tulip and non-tulip flames were produced. According to the unique evolution characteristics of the tulip flame, the tulip flame can be divided into T-shaped tulip flame and asymmetric tulip flame. As the magnitude of gamma increases, the evolution of the maximum normalized flame propagation velocity shifts from a two rises-and-two drops mode to a one rise-and-one drop mode. The increase in the initial ambient temperature has no effect on the evolutions of flame propagation velocity and explosion overpressure, but it reduces the maximum explosion overpressure and the maximum flame propagation velocity. It is worth noting that when the equivalence ratio is lower, the initial ambient temperature has stronger influence on the explosion intensity. In addition, compared with the maximum explosion overpressure, the maximum flame propagation velocity displays a closer relationship with laminar burning velocity. The chemical kinetics calculations show that the laminar burning velocity is most positively sensitive to the free-radical chain reaction R38(namely, H+O_2=O+OH)and is most negatively sensitive to R52(namely, H+CH_3(+M)=CH_4(+M)), and is most sensitive to the rate of production of the free radical OH. When the initial ambient temperature increases to 303 K, the sensitivity of the laminar burning velocity to R38(positive)and R52(negative)are reduced. The increase in the total mole fraction of the free radicals H, O and OH weakens the thermal diffusion instability, but enhances the hydrodynamic instability.			为探究甲烷在富氧条件下的火焰动力学规律,以CH_4/O_2/CO_2预混体系为研究对象,在小尺度方形透明管道中进行了一系列爆炸实验,探讨了初始环境温度波动对爆炸参数的影响,并对预混体系的燃烧机理进行分析。结果表明:在273 K的环境温度下,化学当量比phi=0.8~1.0且氧气相对比gamma<0.30和 phi=1.2且gamma<0.35的预混体系不能被点燃,而其他预混体系均可被点燃,最终产生郁金香与非郁金香两种火焰类型,并且根据郁金香火焰独特的演变特征,又划分为T形郁金香火焰和不对称郁金香火焰;随着gamma的增大,无量纲火焰传播速度v/(SLsigma)的变化趋势由"两升两降"转变为"一升一降"。初始环境温度的升高并未对火焰传播速度和爆炸超压的变化趋势产生影响,但是会导致最大爆炸超压p_(max)和最大火焰传播速度降低。值得注意的是,初始环境温度对爆炸强度的影响随化学当量比的减小而增强。另外,与最大爆炸超压相比,最大火焰传播速度与层流燃烧速度之间的关系更紧密。从敏感性分析中可知:层流燃烧速度对自由基链式反应R38(即H+O_2=O+OH)表现出最大的正敏感度,对R52(即H+CH_3(+M)=CH_4(+M))表现出最大的负敏感度,并且对自由基OH的生成速率最敏感,当初始环境温度升高至303 K时,层流燃烧速度对R38(正)和R52(负)的敏感度降低;H、O和OH自由基总摩尔分数的增大会削弱热扩散的不稳定性,增强流体力学的不稳定性。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-1455			CSCD:7135434

The ordered mesostructured Co3O4 shows dramatically increased catalytic activity compared to that of bulk Co3O4. Enhanced catalytic activity was achieved with high porosity and surface area, and the water oxidation overpotential (eta) of the ordered mesoporous Co3O4 decreases significantly as the surface area increases. The mesoporous Co3O4 also shows excellent structural stability in alkaline media. After 100 min under 0.8 V (versus Ag/AgCl) applied bias, the sample maintains the ordered mesoporous structure with little deactivation of the catalytic properties.									243	17	0	0	17	0	245			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000313658800006

Comparison between simplified and complex glasses (high-level nuclear waste glass analogue) was undertaken. Migration and segregation of sodium have been confirmed on simplified irradiated glasses by a polymerization increase and dissolved oxygen presence. Densification under irradiation has also been demonstrated with the increase of three-membered silicate rings in silicate glass and the decrease of the average Si-O-Si angle in the borosilicate glass. In both glasses, Cr3+ crystal field was increased, suggesting a Cr-O length decrease. The complex borosilicate glass responds differently: densification effect and Na segregation were not detected. Under beta-irradiation, electron-trapping processes on Cr6+ occurred, forming Cr4+ and Cr5+ species. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

A new method of electrochemical treatment of wastewater for non-ionic surfactant destruction has been proposed. Effective destruction of both alkoxylated and phenoxylated non-ionic surfactants was performed using beta-Pb1-xBixO2-0.5x anodes prepared by electrodeposition. The method proposed is based on the generation of active oxygen-containing species (e.g., OH center dot, HO2 center dot) at the anode followed by chemical interaction between these radicals and organic molecules, which results in the destruction of pollutants. Oxide materials obtained by electrodeposition contained similar to 4.5 % of bismuth and have the beta-PbO2 lattice. The insertion of bismuth into the composition of lead dioxide prepared by electrodeposition resulted in an increase in their specific surface area from 0.66 to 2.5 m(2) g(-1). Modification of beta-PbO2 by bismuth led to the shift of oxygen evolution potentials toward more positive values. Effective electrooxidation of non-ionic surfactants was achieved in the solutions exposed to electrochemical treatment. There were no accumulations of metabolites in the solutions during electrolysis. Chemical oxygen demand decreased from 80 to 5 mg O-2 dm(-3), and total organic carbon (TOC) decreased from 24 to 1.5 ppm during 1 h of the electrochemical treatment. The electrode material was stable under electrolysis conditions. No accumulation of both lead and bismuth species in the solution under electrochemical treatment was found.									2	0	1	0	1	0	3			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000505364500003

The influence of the level of cobalt doping on different properties of hematite nanorods was investigated. Incorporation of cobalt in the form of low-spin Co3+ ions into the structure of hematite by substitution for high-spin Fe3+ ions was proved by determination of a significant unit cell contraction by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and characteristic positions of the absorption edge in X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra and peaks in X-ray emission (XES) spectra. Cobalt doping caused a gradual elongation and thinning of hematite nanorods - very long and thin 1D nanoparticles (nanoneedles) were formed in the presence of 10 and 12 mol% Co. Magnetic measurements showed a strong increase in low-temperature remanent magnetization and coercivity upon cobalt doping, as well as a disappearance of the Morin transition, which was also confirmed by Mossbauer spectroscopy. Cobalt doping significantly affected optical properties of hematite nanorods - absorption in the visible and NIR ranges increased, which was accompanied by narrowing of the optical band gap. Compared with pure hematite nanorods cobalt-doped hematite nanoneedles showed a significantly better electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000634934300005

Recently, the mononuclear Mn complex [LMnII(H2O)(2)](2+) [1, L=Py2N(tBu)(2), Py= pyridyl] was reported to catalyze water oxidation electro-chemically at an applied potential of 1.23 V at pH 12.2 in aqueous solution. Density functional calculations were performed to elucidate the mechanism of water oxidation promoted by this catalyst. The calculations showed that 1 can lose two protons and one electron readily to produce [LMnIII(OH)(2)](+) (2), which then undergoes two sequential proton-coupled electron-transfer processes to afford [(LMnOO)-O-V](+) (4). The O-O bond formation can occur through direct coupling of the two oxido ligands or through nucleophilic attack of water. These two mechanisms have similar barriers of approximately 17 kcal mol(-1). The further oxidation of 4 to generate [(LMnO)-O-VI-O](2+) (5), which enables O-O bond formation, has a much higher barrier. In addition, ligand degradation by C-H activation has a similar barrier to that for the O-O bond formation, and this explains the relatively low turnover number of this catalyst.									36	2	0	0	3	0	36			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000398182300012	27925413

Coupling the thermo-dynamically favorable electrooxidation of organic alternatives to value-added fine chemicals HER is a promising approach for the simultaneous cost-effective production of value-added chemicals and hydrogen. Here, a new coupling system for the green electrochemical synthesis of organic energetic materials (EMs) plus hydrogen production using single-atom catalysts is introduced. The catalysts are prepared by the facile galvanostatic deposition of ruthenium single atoms on the molybdenum selenide and reveal a low HER overpotential of 38.9 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline medium. Importantly, the cell voltage of water electrolysis can be significantly reduced to only 1.35 V at a current of 10 mA cm(-2) by coupling water splitting with the electrooxidation of 5-amino-1H-tetrazole to synthesize 5,5'-azotetrazolate energetic material. These materials are traditionally synthesized under harsh conditions involving a strong oxidizing agent, high-temperature conditions, and difficult separation of by-products. This study provides a green and efficient method of synthesizing organic EMs while simultaneously producing hydrogen.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000820655500001	35724969

The current design strategies for describing their OER activities are largely derived assuming a static, unchanged view of their surfaces, despite reports of dynamic structural changes to 3d TM-based perovskites during OER. Herein, through variations in the A- and B-site compositions of A(n+1)B(n)O(3n+1) oxides (n = 1 (A(2)BO(4)) or n = infinity (ABO(3)); A = La, Sr, Ca; B = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni), we show that, in the absence of electrolyte impurities, surface restructuring is universally the source of high OER activity in these oxides and is dependent on the initial oxide composition. Oxide surface restructuring is induced by irreversible A-site cation dissolution, resulting in in situ formation of a TM oxyhydroxide shell on top of the parent oxide core that serves as the active surface for OER. The rate of surface restructuring is found to depend on (i) composition of A-site cations, with alkaline-earth-metal cations dominating lanthanide cation dissolution, (ii) oxide crystal phase, with n = 1 A(2)BO(4) oxides exhibiting higher rates of A-site dissolution in comparison to n = infinity ABO(3) perovskites, (iii) lattice strain in the oxide induced by mixed rare-earth- and alkaline-earth-metal cations in the A-site, and (iv) oxide reducibility. Among the in situ generated 3d TM oxyhydroxide structures from A(n+1)B(n)O(3n+1) oxides, Co-based structures are characterized by superior OER activity and stability, even in comparison to as-synthesized Co-oxyhydroxide, pointing to the generation of high active surface area structures through oxide restructuring. These insights are critical toward the development of revised design criteria to include surface dynamics for effectively describing the OER activity of nonstoichiometric mixed-metal oxides.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2691-3704		WOS:000746270600002	34977894

In a practical sense, the parallel chlorine evolution reaction (CER) of DSE opens up an opportunity to hit "two birds with one stone" by the dual values of anode and cathode. However, the biggest challenge is how to control the selectivity of CER to balance its values and drawbacks. Here, we use the different nucleation rates of iridium and barium ions in a weak basic solution and subsequent acid etching to devise an IrOx nanocluster (IrOx-Cs) supported BaCO3. The catalyst-support interaction between IrO-Cs and BaCO 3 enables repelling the Cl- near the electrode interface layer to achieve a controlled CER selectivity. Additionally, the mass activity of the prepared IrOx-Cs@BaCO3 is as high as 1402 A g(Ir)(-1), which is 7.12 times higher than that of IrO, oxides in unbuffered seawater. The photovoltaic-electrolysis device paired by IrOx-Cs@BaCO3 with controlled CER activity and Pt demonstrated that valuable active chlorine and H-2 can be simultaneously obtained, with the flexibility to bind to different ion exchange membranes.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000733815600001	34911293

Over the ranges of ascorbic acid concentration used, no direct effect on the enzyme is found. However, a shortening of the characteristic induction period of the hydroxylation reaction is observed. The evolution of the reaction is dependent on the concentration of ascorbic acid. Low concentrations permit the system to reach the steady state when all ascorbic acid is consumed, whereas high concentrations do not. In the light of these results it is proposed that the influence of ascorbic acid on the reaction is due to its ability to reduce the enzymically generated o-quinones. A relationship between the ascorbic acid concentration, and the induction period generated by it. with the diphenolase activity of tyrosinase is established, which can be used as a basis for the determination of trace amounts of this reducing agent.									119	0	0	0	77	0	119			0264-6021			WOS:A1993MA99600044	8216233	
J	Stemler, AJ; Lavergne, J								Evidence that formate destabilizes the S-1 state of the oxygen-evolving mechanism in Photosystem II								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				51	2			83	92		10.1023/A:1005775417708				FEB 1997	1997	Flash-induced absorption changes at 295 nm and oxygen flash yields were measured in Photosystem II-enriched membranes and thylakoids from spinach. In the presence of formate and reduced 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone (DCBQ), the normal period-4 oscillation in the oxygen-evolving mechanism is shifted one flash, a maximum appearing on the 4th rather than the 3rd flash. Analysis of the flash-induced sequence shows that in 90-100% of the centers, the oxygen evolving complex is present in the most reduced state (S-0), rather than in the singly oxidized state (S-1) as is normally the case. An electron donation to the oxidized states S-2 or S-3 during the flash sequence by reduced tyrosine 'Y-D' cannot account for the data unless the rate of this reaction is dramatically accelerated by formate. Rather, it appears that the normally dark-stable S-1 state of the oxygen-evolving mechanism is modified by formate so that it becomes reducible to S-0. The reduced form of DCBQ is an efficient mediator to promote the shift to So. As in other instances where a chemical reduction of S-1 is achieved, the 'formal S-0' state caused by the formate/DCBQ treatment is not spectroscopically identical with the S-0 state occurring under illumination. Incubation at high redox potential (550 mV) did not reverse the S-state shift caused by the treatment with formate and DCBQ at lower potential, but induced a distortion of the absorption change sequence that could indicate an enhanced yield of oxygen on the second flash.									14	2	0	0	12	0	15			0166-8595			WOS:A1997XG77600001

The process of PEC water splitting is composed of two vital half-reactions: water oxidation to O(2)on photoanode, and proton reduction to H(2)on photocathode. Both in thermodynamics and kinetics, the oxidation of water on photoanode is much more challenging, because the formation of O(2)involves the four-holes reaction process that is more difficult than the two-protons reduction. Accordingly, the oxidation of water into O(2)is the rate-determining reaction for PEC water splitting, which is closely affected by the light harvesting, charge separation and transfer, as well as surface activity of photoanode. In principle, water oxidation is initiated by the photo-excited charge of photoanode. In this review, we took hematite photoanode as a typical example to illustrate the progress in modifying the charge separation and migration property of metal-oxide photoanodes for water oxidation. The typical strategies adopted to facilitate the charge transfer and separation of hematite photoanode were specifically summarized.

However, low electronic conductivity and poor stability still are major defects of 2D organic systems. Herein, we demonstrated ultrathin 2D conductive cobalt-hexaaminobenzene metal-organic coordination polymer nanosheets (Co-HAB-NSs) with a thickness of similar to 4.5 nm. The as-prepared Co-HAB-NSs exhibit a low overpotential (310 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2)) and high durability in 1 M KOH. The experimental and computational results show that the high electrocatalytic activity is ascribed to the enhanced electrochemically active surface area as well as the dense and stable catalytic active sites of Co-HAB-NSs.									31	0	0	0	1	0	31			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000503772400034

These materials could be prepared in household microwave ovens in less than 15 minutes of reaction time with the final materials displaying well-defined structure and morphology. Phase evolution was studied using time-dependent microwave heatings and then compared with the results obtained from thermogravimetric analyses. Materials were confirmed to be phase pure by laboratory and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Substituted Pd is ionic as shown by the binding energy shift from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The short heating periods required for phase purity allow these materials less time for sintering as compared to conventional solid state preparation methods, making relatively high surface areas achievable. These materials have been successfully used as catalyst precursor materials for C-C coupling reactions in which the active species is Pd-0. Pd-substituted LnFeO(3) (Ln = Y, La) provides Pd-0 in solution which can be complexed by the ligand SPhos, allowing for aryl chloride coupling.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000328952500019	24280775

Herein, a cyclic voltammetry oxidation method in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte was employed for carbon electrode to produce electrochemically active oxygen functional groups that are in contact with the conductive substrates, which facilitates the implementation of the pseudocapacitance. Moreover, the influence of potential window and sweep rate on the components and performances of oxidized electrodes in the cyclic voltammetry oxidation process was systematically investigated. The results reveal that a broad potential window of -0.65 similar to 2 V can enhance the oxygen content to 16.4 wt.% (vs. 7.6 wt.% within -0.65 similar to 1.5 V). Additionally, a selective oxygen component dominated with redox active C-OH and C=O groups was achieved by a rapid potentiodynamic sweep at 20 mV s(-1), simultaneously suppressing the -COOH groups with inferior conductivity. The oxidized AC electrodes could substantially improve the specific capacitance (534 vs. 150.3 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)) without sacrifice of rate performance (retained 418 F g(-1) at 20 A g(-1)), accompanying excellent cycling stability of 94 % of initial capacitance after 10000 cycles. Such finding would provide some reference for tailoring oxygen species to fabricate advanced carbon-based supercapacitor electrodes.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2196-0216			WOS:000672941700001

After the vapor phase impregnation of a tungsten hexachloride precursor on a carbon support, a temperature-programmed reduction/carburization was performed. Several parameters were investigated and the evolution of obtained samples was followed by XRD and TEM. The optimization of the reaction parameters led to the preparation of W, W2C and WC particles well dispersed on the support. WC phase however could not be obtained alone with less than 10 nm mean size. This could be explained by the carburization mechanism and the carbon diffusion on the support. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

CLINICAL AUTONOMIC RESEARCH				18	4			170	178		10.1007/s10286-008-0479-7				AUG 2008	2008	Major lines of evidence suggest that classical (emotional and orthostatic) vasovagal syncope (VVS) is not a disease, but rather a manifestation of a non-pathological trait. It is, therefore, reasonable to investigate the possible factors that may explain its origin and evolution. We reviewed the data available in the literature on the vasovagal reaction in humans and animals in order to identify possible similarities that might provide insight into the evolution of VVS. We found two processes which appear relevant to the investigation of VVS evolution: fear and threat bradycardia in animals, and the vasovagal reflex during hemorrhagic shock in humans and animals. We suggest that VVS in humans involves physiological mechanisms similar to those found in other vertebrates, and that this may indicate a common evolutionary root. The available data seem to suggest that VVS evolved as an advantageous response to inescapable predators or to stressful and possibly dangerous heart conditions. The inhibition of the sympathetic system, together with activation of the vagal system, characterizes VVS. The consequent slowing of the heart rate induced by VVS may constitute a beneficial break of the cardiac pump, thereby reducing myocardial oxygen consumption. We suggest that classical VVS did not evolve recently in the modern human lineage; rather, it should be regarded as a selected response, which probably evolved in the ancient past as a "defense mechanism" of the organism within some ancestral group(s) of vertebrates.									63	1	1	0	35	1	65			0959-9851			WOS:000258400900003	18592129

Various fuel moisture content (FMC) values corresponding to four manzanita leaf treatments studied experimentally by others, were considered. The fuel was exposed to an upward stream of hot gases in a computational configuration resembling the experimental setup where leaves were burned. Time evolution of the normalized mass of the leaves was used to validate the simulations against the experimental data. Examining the time history of heat release rate confirmed that increasing FMC delays ignition time. The ignition times in simulations were in good agreement with those determined by empirical correlations for all FMCs. The burnout times were somewhat shorter in simulations than the empirically-determined ones. Simulations showed that thermal, momentum and concentration boundary layers are formed on the leaf faces. The boundary layers played a significant role in heating, and subsequent moisture evaporation and pyrolysis of the leaves. Within the leaves, an evaporation front propagating inward from the edges, was detected. A considerable amount of liquid moisture remained in the leaf after ignition. Accumulation of water and fuel vapor around the leaf, as a consequence of the leaf moisture evaporation and pyrolysis, displaced oxygen, decreasing the oxygen concentration therein. A post ignition time was characterized by a high temperature zone around the leaf. At such times, oxygen consumption by gas phase combustion resulted in a noticeable decrease in oxygen concentration around the leaf. The flaming pattern after ignition was qualitatively in agreement with previously reported experimental observations.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000537626900015

The suitable band matching among WS2, WO3.H2O and g-C3N4 realize the directional separation of electrons and holes from g-C3N4 to WS2 and WO3.H2O respectively, and the holes of WS2 are also quenched with electrons of WO3.H2O in the WS2-WO3.H2O heterostructure. Thereby, photogenerated carrier recombination is efficiently suppressed, and a strong reducibility of WS2-WO3.H2O/gC3N4 catalyst is stabilized. The WS2-WO3.H2O nanodots with a tight contact provide a short diffusion channel to facilitate the rapid migration of the g-C3N4 carriers from the vicinity of the cocatalyst to the target reaction sites, further, the active sites of WS2 edges are heavily exposed to improve the H2 evolution rate. Benefiting from such a dual-Z-scheme heterojunction, the optimized dual-Z-scheme WS2-WO3.H2O/g-C3N4 catalyst shows a high H2 evolution rate (1276.9 mu mol h-1 g 1), which is 57 times higher than that of the original g-C3N4. This work raises a new design approach for heterostructure photocatalyst and provides a valuable reference for future research of photocatalytic H2 production.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000722699300003		
J	Luz, B; Barkan, E; Sagi, Y; Yacobi, YZ								Evaluation of community respiratory mechanisms with oxygen isotopes: A case study in Lake Kinneret								LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY				47	1			33	42		10.4319/lo.2002.47.1.0033				JAN 2002	2002	Gross and net O-2 production between May 1996 and February 1999 was determined in bottle incubation experiments with (H2O)-O-18 spike and from the change in O-2 concentration. Carbon fixation rates were obtained from C-14 incubations. In general, production rates determined using the H,H-2(18)-spike were about twice the primary production determined by the C-14 method, where the latter was close to net oxygen evolution. These relationships are similar to results for the open ocean. During the spring bloom, when the dinoflagellate Peridinium was abundant, the ratio of gross O-2 production to carbon fixation was about 7.5, and net O-2 production was greater than carbon fixation. The difference between O-2 gross production and carbon fixation results, at least in part, from uptake by Mehler reaction and from recycling of the C-14 tracer by dark respiration and the alternative oxidase (AOX). We used the difference in isotopic discrimination against O-18, occurring during O-2 consumption by various biological pathways, to place constraints on the relative engagement of these pathways. We estimated the overall discrimination against O-18 in the lake from O-2 isotopic mass balance as 20.5-29parts per thousand. The only mechanism that can explain the strong overall fractionation in the lake is AOX, which strongly discriminates against O-18 (similar to31parts per thousand). Our results show, for the first time, that uptake by AOX is widespread and quantitatively important to oxygen consumption in aquatic systems.									73	1	0	0	51	0	74			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000173529200004

Herein, we electrooxidize the most abundant natural amino biopolymer chitin to acetate with over 90% yield in hybrid electrolysis. The overall energy consumption of electrolysis can be reduced by 15% due to the thermodynamically and kinetically more favorable chitin oxidation over water oxidation. In obvious contrast to small organics as the anodic reactant, the abundance of chitin endows the new oxidation reaction excellent scalability. A solar-driven electroreforming of chitin and chitin-containing shrimp shell waste is coupled to safe green hydrogen production thanks to the liquid anodic product and suppression of oxygen evolution. Our work thus demonstrates a scalable and safe process for resource upcycling and green hydrogen production for a sustainable energy future. The scale-up of the coupling of water electroreduction (HER) with organic electrooxidation remains challenging. Here the authors address this challenge by coupling HER with electrooxidation of raw biomass chitin, cogenerating acetate and green hydrogen safely at high current density.									46	1	0	0	4	0	47				2041-1723		WOS:000636903700004	33790295

Here we employ Ketjenblack (KB) as a support to create an Fe-based electrocatalyst with high-electrical conductivity and maximal active sites. Moreover, a systematic study on the role of cobalt (Co) dopant was carried out. Electrochemical results show enhancements in HER activity of Co-doped FeS2 [FexCo1-xS2, atomic content of Fe (x) = 0.98-0.32] in comparison to un-doped FeS2 in acidic electrolyte (pH = 0). The overpotential necessary to drive a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) is -0.150 V and only decreases by 1 mV after 500 cycles of a durability test (cycling the potential between 0.0 and-0.15 V), indicating a long-term durability in acidic environment. This work suggests that FexCo1-xS2 offers a viable approach to improve the activity and durability of transition metal-sulfide electrocatalysts. (C) The Author(s) 2017.

In this work, we synthesized silver decorated magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4@PDA/Ag NPs) to activate H2O2 for organic pollutants removal via advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). The catalyst was prepared through in-situ reduction of AgNO3 by the polydopamine (PDA) layer on Fe3O4 NPs. Chemiluminescence results obtained from luminol/H2O2 system revealed that the catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic effect on the decomposition of H2O2 into reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide radical (O2 center dot-) was mainly responsible for the oxidative degradation. Importantly, the fast evolution frequency of oxygen gas bubbles produced in the reaction of Ag NPs and H2O2 could generate vigorous fluid convection and autonomous motion of catalyst when H2O2 concentration reached 1%. Additionally, the catalyst can suspend in solution for several minutes. Therefore, by coupling the vigorous motion with slow sedimentation velocity, the catalyst can realize rapid degradation of organic pollutants without external mixing force. The Fe3O4@PDA/Ag NPs catalysts not only showed a high removal efficiency of malachite green, but also can be applied for the degradation of other dyes, making it to be a promise candidate for environmental remediation. With the merits of excellent catalytic effect, fast degradation speed, and simplicity of operation, the prepared catalysts exhibits great potential in the practical field.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0045-6535	1879-1298		WOS:000845070300003	35872061

Therefore, stable, efficient, and economical water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) are in high demand and cobalt-based nanomaterials are promising targets. Herein, we tackle two key open questions after decades of research into cobalt-assisted visible-light-driven water oxidation: What makes simple cobalt-based precipitates so highly active-and to what extent do we need Co-WOC design? Hence, we started from Co(NO3)(2) to generate a precursor precipitate, which transforms into a highly active WOC during the photocatalytic process with a [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+)/S2O82-/borate buffer standard assay that outperforms state of the art cobalt catalysts. The structural transformations of these nanosized Co catalysts were monitored with a wide range of characterization techniques. The results reveal that the precipitated catalyst does not fully change into an amorphous CoOx material but develops some crystalline features. The transition from the precipitate into a disordered Co3O4 material proceeds within ca. 1 min, followed by further transformation into highly active disordered CoOOH within the first 10 min. Furthermore, under noncatalytic conditions, the precursor directly transforms into CoOOH. Moreover, fast precipitation and isolation afford a highly active precatalyst with an exceptional O-2 yield of 91% for water oxidation with the visible-light-driven [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+)/S2O82- assay, which outperforms a wide range of carefully designed Co-containing WOCs. We thus demonstrate that high-performance cobalt-based OER catalysts indeed emerge effortlessly from a self-optimization process favoring the formation of Co(III) centers in all-octahedral environments. This paves the way to new low-maintenance flow chemistry OER processes.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000700883200014	34499506

To examine the biochemical changes which accompany the process of photoactivation in gymnosperms, a method enabling the preparation of highly active O2-evolving photosystem II (PS II) membranes was applied to light-grown, dark-grown, and photoactivated cotyledons. PS II membranes prepared from light-grown cotyledons exhibited high O2-evolving activity, and contained all the intrinsic proteins as well as the three extrinsic proteins (32, 23 and 17 kDa) associated with PS II. These membranes were also found to contain 4.4 Mn and 0.83 Ca/PS II reaction center. PS II membranes from dark-grown cotyledons contained all the intrinsic proteins, but preserved only 32 kDa extrinsic protein, and zero Mn and 0.85 Ca/PS II reaction center. The two extrinsic proteins (23 and 17 kDa) absent in the PS II membranes from dark-grown cotyledons were, however, present as mature forms in whole thylakoid membranes from the corresponding sample. The PS II membranes isolated from photoactivated cotyledons showed a high activity of O2 evolution and retained the three extrinsic proteins, 5.3 Mn and 1.1 Ca/PS II reaction center, respectively. The results indicated that Mn and the two extrinsic proteins were tightly integrated in the O2-evolving apparatus during the process of photoactivation but integration of Ca preceded the integration of Mn by photoactivation.									16	0	0	0	14	0	16			0032-0781			WOS:A1992HR53800011

Herein, Cu and Cu3P co-modified TiO2 nano sheet hybrid (Cu-Cu3P/TiO2) was fabricated using an in situ hydrothermal method. The ternary composite achieved the superior H2 evolution rate of 6915.7 mmol g-1 h-1 under simulated sunlight, which was higher than that of Cu/TiO2 (4643.4 mmol g-1 h-1) and Cu3P/ TiO2 (6315.8 mmol g-1 h-1) and pure TiO2 (415.7 mmol g-1 h-1). The enhanced activity can be attributed to the collaboration effect of Schottky junction and p-n heterojunction among Cu/TiO2 and Cu3P/TiO2, which can harvest the visible light, reduce the recombination of charge carriers and lower the overpotential of H2 evolution, leading to a fast H2 evolution kinetics. This work develops a feasible method for the exploration of H2 evolution photo catalyst with outstanding charge separation properties. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

J	Ma Rongyao; Zhao Lin; Wang Changgang; Mu Xin; Wei Xin; Dong Junhua; Ke Wei								Influence of Hydrostatic Pressure on the Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Metal Corrosion								ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA				55	2			281	290		10.11900/0412.1961.2018.00215				FEB 11 2019	2019	In recent years, researches on deep sea corrosion have attracted much attention of many researchers. The high hydrostatic pressure is a distinctive feature of deep-sea environment. The hydrostatic pressure affects the corrosive behavior of metallic materials by modifying the composition, structure and compactness of corrosion products, changing the polarization processes of cathode electrode and anode electrode, altering pitting nucleation rate and growth rate, impacting on chemical reaction rate and equilibrium constant, and varying hydrogen diffusion rate and coverage. However, in essence, the influence of hydrostatic pressure on the corrosion behavior of different metal materials is the manifestation of the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of the corrosion electrode process caused by hydrostatic pressure. At present, the mechanism of effect of hydrostatic pressure on the thermodynamics and kinetics of corroding electrode processes is unclear yet. In addition, the concerns about the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the chemical properties of materials and seawater are comparatively low. Based on thermodynamics and kinetics, the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the activities of electrode material and ions in environment, including on the solubility, fugacity or activity of gases in environment are analyzed. The influence of hydrostatic pressure on pH value and chemical equilibrium is also discussed. The relationships between hydrostatic pressure and equilibrium electrode potential, as well as the exchange current density, are analyzed. The theoretical model of the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the corrosion behavior of active metals is established. The studies have shown that hydrostatic pressure would increase the activities of materials, ions and dissolved gas in environments, and this is closely related to their partial molar volume. The hydrostatic pressure would magnify the difference in the activity of heterogeneous materials. The larger the partial molar volume difference of the heterogeneous materials, the more obvious the difference in activity. Increasing hydrostatic pressure reduces the equilibrium electrode potential of iron and aluminum anode dissolution reaction while reducing its exchange current density. Increasing hydrostatic pressure increases the equilibrium electrode potential of oxygen reaction and decreases its exchange current density. Increasing hydrostatic pressure reduces the equilibrium electrode potential of hydrogen evolution reaction and increases its exchange current density.									11	6	0	0	0	0	13			0412-1961			WOS:000455945800013

Transition metal phosphides (TMP) has great potential for alleviating the energy crisis in catalytic applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of nickel phosphides decorated on carbon nanotubes (Ni-P/CNTs) using a porous nickel powder by a simple, traditional and effective method of powder metallurgy. The Ni-P/CNTs catalyst obtained at 700 degrees C for 60 min performs a better catalytic activity than samples prepared under other process conditions in acidic solutions during our experiment. This catalytic activity may be associated with the flower-shaped morphology, electrochemically active surface areas and contents of P of hybrid catalyst. This work will provide a promising pathway for designing various transition metal compounds and exploring the performance in catalysts for energy-related catalysis processes using porous metal materials.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1380-2224	1573-4854		WOS:000604198400004

However, Si NW arrays always suffer from high overpotential, low photocurrent density, and low applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) due to their low surface catalytic activity and intense charge recombination. Here, we report an efficient oxygen evolution cocatalyst of optically transparent, mesoporous ultrathin (2.47 nm thick) In2O3 nanosheets, which are coupled on the top of Si NW arrays. Combined with a conformal TiO2 thin film as an intermediate protective layer, this Si NW/TiO2/In2O3 (2.47 nm) heterostructured photoanode exhibited an extremely low onset potential of 0.6 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The Si NW/TiO2/In2O3 (2.47 nm) photoanode also showed a high photocurrent density of 27 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs RHE, more than 1 order of magnitude higher than that of the Si NW/TiO2 photoanodes. This improvement in solar water splitting performance was attributed to the significantly promoted charge injection efficiency as a result of the In2O3 nanosheet coupling. This work presents a promising pathway for developing efficient Si-based photoanodes by coupling ultrathin 2D cocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000718271300106	34709787

Although various technologies are under development, treatment of the VAM with an efficient and cost-effective approach has been an ongoing challenge due to massive flow rates of the ventilation air and low and variable methane concentrations. Recently a new concept based on the principle of chemical looping combustion (CLC) has been proposed for VAM abatement (Appl. Energy, 2014, 113, 1916), in which oxidation of low-concentration CH4 balanced by N-2 with Fe2O3 or CuO as the oxygen carrier was studied. Here, we thoroughly examined the feasibility of CLC of VAM based on experimental study and theoretical calculations. Reduction of Fe2O3 and CuO and evolution of gas products during CH4 oxidation were investigated using TGA-MS under two reaction atmospheres: 1 vol% CH4 balanced by N-2 and the simulated VAM containing 1 vol% CH4, 20 vol% O-2, 0.4 vol% CO2 and balance N-2. It was found that the CLC of VAM is fundamentally infeasible because the reduced phase of Fe2O3 and CuO cannot be formed for chemical looping when reacting with the simulated VAM containing abundant oxygen. Theoretical calculations revealed that Fe2O3 and CuO remain stable without the transition to the reduced phase as the generated oxygen vacancy on the surface of metal oxides during CH4 oxidation can recover quickly with O-2 adsorption and dissociation. Calculations confirmed that both Fe2O3 and CuO play a role of surface catalyst in VAM oxidation. More importantly, it was found that the low-coordinated metal atoms and oxygen vacancies can stabilize CHx radicals to promote the dissociation of CH4, which is generally the rate-determining step for CH4 oxidation. Such findings are useful for new development and understanding of high-performance and low-cost metal oxide catalysts for CH4 oxidation.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000356396300007	26028316

The description of growth is carried out by means of an unstructured model taking the nitrogen source as the limiting nutrient, employing the logistic equation which fits adequately the experimental data of the increase in biomass concentration as a function of initial concentrations of biomass and nitrogen source. The model proposed is metabolically structured because it takes into account the carbon source metabolism into the cell, describing xanthan production, carbon source, and dissolved oxygen consumption in a structured way according to a reaction network as a simplified scheme of the intracellular metabolism. The limiting nutrient of xanthan production and carbon source consumption is supposed to be dissolved oxygen. The parameter estimation has been performed by Sitting to experimental data, employing an integral method coupling a fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm to a multiple-response nonlinear regression technique. Runs performed at four different temperatures (25, 28, 31, and 34 degrees C) are fitted and described by the model.

Chemical analysis and determination of room-temperature modulus of rupture and Young's modulus, as well as a complete microstructural characterization of the as-received materials, were performed. For high-temperature modulus-of-rupture and Young's modulus data, test samples of the four brick compositions were heated to 1000 degrees, 1200 degrees, and 1450 degrees C in flowing argon (<1000 ppm oxygen at 1000 degrees C) and then loaded mechanically in flexure. Modulus-of-elasticity values ranged from 3.7 to 16.2 GPa and reflected strong effects of aluminum-metal concentration and treatment temperature. Young's modulus evolution with temperature was determined by the evolution of the microstructure in the bulk of the specimens, Modulus-of-rupture values ranged from 6 to 21 MPa, and their evolution with temperature was determined by the evolution of the microstructure in the bulk of the specimens at the lower testing temperatures (T less than or equal to 1200 degrees C) and by phase assemblages in the surface regions of the specimens - essentially by the presence of the dense MgO zone - at 1450 degrees C.									46	0	1	0	1	1	47			0002-7820			WOS:000085763900037

Significant efforts have been made to increase the number of exposed edge sites. However, little attention has been paid to devising edge surface structures of MoS2 sheet stacks to promote the HER kinetics. Herein we report the first demonstration of significantly enhanced HER kinetics by controllably fabricating a stepped MoS2 surface structure. Vertical arrays of MoS2 sheets terminated with such a stepped surface structure have proved to be an outstanding HER electrocatalyst with an overpotential of 104 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), an exchange current density of 0.2 mA cm(-2) and high stability. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the vertical MoS2 arrays is associated with the unique vertically terminated, highly exposed, stepped surface structure with a nearly thermoneutral H-adsorption energy. This work opens a new avenue to designing and developing layered materials for electrochemical energy applications.									240	9	0	0	10	0	242			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000395679100018

Considering that Ni-based selenides possess abundant variable valence states, the Nb/Fe diatomic heterogeneous spin states are purposely introduced to produce LUCFs for improving the electronic coordination environment of the materials. The as prepared Nb/Fe co-doped Ni-Ses (NbFe-NixSey) electrocatalyst exhibits the prominent oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER/HER) properties, with low overpotentials of 237 and 226 mV at 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. The alkaline water electrolyzer with NbFe-NixSey as both anodic and cathodic electrodes only requires a cell potential of 1.7 V to reach 50 mA cm(-2) in a continuous operation of 50 h. This work provides a new insight to regulate the electronic structure of advanced catalyst materials at the atomic level through LUCFs-induced LDV and further push forward the energy conversion technology.

First-discharge data from tens of Li/O-2 cells discharged across four rates are analyzed statistically to inform these connections. In the practically significant superficial current-density range of 0.1 to 1 mA cm(-2), capacity is found to fall as a power law, with a Peukerts-law exponent of 1.6 +/- 0.1. X-ray diffractometry confirms the dominant presence of crystalline Li2O2 in the discharged electrodes. A completely air-free sample-transfer technique was developed to implement scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the discharge product. SEM imaging of electrodes with near-average capacities provides statistically significant measures of the shape and size variation of electrodeposited Li2O2 particles with respect to discharge current. At lower rates, typical toroidal particles are observed that are well approximated as cylindrical structures, whose average radii remain relatively constant as discharge rate increases, whereas their average heights decrease. At the highest rate studied, air-free SEM shows that particles take needle-like shapes rather than forming the nanosheets or compact films described elsewhere. Average particle volumes decrease with current while particle surface-to-volume ratios increase dramatically, supporting the notion that Li2O2 grows by a locally mass-transfer-limited nucleation and growth mechanism.									55	1	0	0	1	0	55			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000353177000030	25775079

Herein, we report an easily scalable electrospinning strategy to construct nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers with porous hierarchical structures and uniformly dispersed Ru nanoparticles (abbreviated as ES-Ru-ZIF-900). Benefiting from the porous fibrous nanoarchitecture caused by the pyrolysis of the zeolitic imidazolate framework-8, the abundant firmly immobilized Ru NPs, and the high conductivity of the N-doped carbon matrix, the resultant ES-Ru-ZIF-900 electrocatalyst exhibits an extraordinary HER performance. ES-Ru-ZIF-900 only needs an overpotential of 21 mV to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and possesses long durability for over 14 h in 1.0 M KOH, superior to Pt/C and most of the non-Pt based electrocatalysts.

Skarns form competent lenses and layers in metamorphosed siliciclastic rocks and preserve some early deformation structures and several equilibrium assemblages representing the products of successive metamorphic reactions. The main rock-forming minerals, garnet and clinopyroxene, are accompanied by less abundant magnetite, amphibole, plagioclase, epidote +/- quartz. In the Svratka Unit the early prograde M-1, prograde/peak M-2, and retrograde M-3 metamorphic stages have been distinguished. Metamorphic conditions in skarns of the Moldanubian Zone are limited to a relatively narrow interval of amphibolite facies. The prograde and retrograde events in the Kutna Hora Complex skarns probably took place under amphibolite-facies conditions. The presence of magnetite and the increasing proportion of the andradite component in the garnet indicate locally increased oxygen fugacity.Skarn geochemistry does not show systematic differences in the skarn composition among the three units. The regional variations are exceeded by differences among samples from individual localities. The Al2O3/TiO2, Al2O3/Zr, TiO2/Nb ratios point to the variable proportion of the detrital material, combined in skarn protoliths with CaO and FeO, the major non-detrital components. The skarns exhibit elevated abundances of Cu, Zn, Sn and As. The Eu/Eu* ratio varies in the range of 0.5-8.6, the total REE contents vary from 8 to 345 ppm. The lowest Sigma REE values (< 100 ppm) occur in skarns with magnetite mineralization. The wide intervals of SREE and Eu/Eu* values are interpreted to indicate variations in the temperature and redox conditions among layers of the same locality and at various localities.The oxygen isotope compositions of garnets, pyroxenes and amphiboles from skarns of the Svratka Unit exhibit a range of delta O-18 = 0.1 to 4.1 parts per thousand. In situ (laser-ablation ICP-MS) U-Pb dating of zircon from one of the Svratka Unit skarn bodies yielded a wide range of ages (0.5-2.6 Ga), supporting the detrital origin of this zircon population.The skarn protoliths were probably rocks of mixed detrital-exhalative origin deposited on the sea floor.The geological position of skarns, with their structural and metamorphic record, probably reflect tectono-metamorphic evolution shared with that of their host rocks. The geochemical characteristics, including oxygen isotopic compositions and the presence of detrital zircons with a wide range of ages exclude metasomatic, and point to a sedimentary-exhalative mode of origin for the studied skarns.									24	1	0	0	0	0	25			1802-6222	1803-1943		WOS:000207802900003

Most notably, the lack of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen means that primordial massive stars must rely on the less efficient p-p chains, thereby requiring the star to contract to reach temperatures high enough to eventually trigger 3 alpha reactions. Even small amounts of the C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 reactions begin feeding the CNO mass range and enable the CNO cycle to generate energy, but this occurs at higher temperature compared to later stellar generations. It is currently controversial if the observed enhanced abundances of Ca in the most metal-poor stars could be a result of the high temperature H-burning conditions in the first massive stars. The level of this enrichment depends on the hot breakout path from the CNO cycles via the F-19(p, gamma)Ne-20 reaction. In this work, the rates of both the F-19(p, gamma)Ne-20 and competing F-19(p, alpha)O-16 reactions are re-evaluated using the phenomenological R-matrix approach, simultaneously considering several F-19(p, gamma)Ne-20, F-19(p, alpha)O-16 and F-19(p, p)F-19 data sets, to better characterize the rate uncertainties. It is found that the rate uncertainty for F-19(p, gamma)Ne-20 reaction is considerably larger than previously reported. This is the result of undetermined interferences between observed resonances, a possible threshold state, possible subthreshold states, direct capture, and background levels. Additional experimental measurements are therefore needed to determine if F-19(p, gamma)Ne-20 CNO breakout is responsible for Ca enrichment in metal-poor stars. Astrophysically, the breakout reaction revision makes it less likely that Ca observed in the most Fe-poor stars can originate in hot CNO breakout H-burning nucleosynthtesis, thereby casting doubt on the prevailing faint supernova scenario to explain the abundances observed in these stars.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2469-9985	2469-9993		WOS:000655862400001

Hong et al., Science 369, 670 (2020)]. Here, using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the potential of two-dimensional (2D) MSi2N4 as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts, and propose two effective ways to trigger their HER activity. Our computations reveal that while the metal vacancies cannot activate the inertia planes for HER, 2D MSi2N4 with N vacancy exhibits excellent HER performance. Especially for 2D WSi2N4, the introduction of N vacancy can yield an ideal value of hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (Delta G(H*) = - 0.02 eV), even superior to that of Pt (Delta G(H*) = - 0.09 eV). Moreover, by high-throughput screening of 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals, we find that introducing V/Fe/Nb/Tc/Ta atom into 2D MSi2N4 can significantly trigger their HER activity. The underlying physics are discussed in detail. Our work not only highlights a family of potential HER electrocatalysts, but also provides feasible strategies for triggering their HER activity.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2475-9953			WOS:000655933700003

Herein, we present a rational strategy to improve the overall HER catalytic performance of Pt, which is known as the best monometallic catalyst for this reaction, by supporting it on a conductive titanium oxynitride (TiONx) dispersed over reduced graphene oxide nanoribbons. Character-ization of the Pt/TiONx composite revealed the presence of small Pt particles with diameters between 2 and 3 nm, which are well dispersed over the TiONx support. The Pt/TiONx nanocomposite exhibited improved HER activity and stabi l i t y with respect to the Pt/C benchmark in an acid electrolyte, which was ascribed to the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) triggered between the TiONx support and grafted Pt nanoparticles. SMSI between TiONx and Pt was evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) through a shif t of the binding energies of the characteristic Pt 4f photoelectron lines with respect to Pt/C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the strong interaction between Pt nanoparticles and the TiONx support. This strong interaction improves the stabi l i t y of Pt nanoparticles and weakens the binding of chemisorbed H atoms thereon. Both of these effects may result in enhanced HER activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000870275600001	36313525

Hydrogen and other clean energy have attracted increasing attention. Electrolysis of water is one of the most promising technologies for hydrogen production compared with other techniques. However, due to the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with slow dynamics, the catalysts such as RuO2 and IrO2 are not only expensive but also limited in reserve. Therefore, it is significant and urgent to develop OER catalysts with low cost and excellent catalytic activity and stability. As a representative transition metal, Ni is abundant on the earth and has excellent corrosion resistance. It is usually combined with Fe to prepare Ni-Fe oxides, hydroxides, sulfides. phosphating compounds and Ni-Fe alloys that can catalyze OER efficiently.From the view of catalytic kinetics, it is beneficial to construct the catalyst structure and reasonably design the specific morphology of nanomaterials. In other words, the activity of the electrocatalyst can be improved by increasing the number of active sites on a given electrode reasonably. In order to improve the catalytic activity of Ni-Fe catalytic system, a variety of processes have been developed to regulate the morphology and increase the number of active sites. Most of these processes focus on hydrothermal or calcination methods, which take a long time. Therefore. a simple and efficient method for preparing Ni-Fe catalysts with high catalytic activity for OER remains to be developed.Unlike the other three states (gas, liquid, and solid), plasma is composed of a mixture of electrons, ions, radicals and neutral particles. Compared with traditional methods, plasma-assisted modification (e.g., plasma etching, doping, and other surface treatments) and plasma-assisted synthesis (e.g., deposition, conversion, and decomposition) are becoming powerful tools for producing catalyst materials. Herein, vertical graphene nanosheets (VG) were prepared by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Then, Ni-Fe alloy nanoparticles were prepared by electrodeposition on the surface of VG as the active materials.The morphology and composition of the Ni-Fe electrocatalyst were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Electrochemical workstation was used to characterize its electrocatalytic performance as OER catalyst. The overpotential of the catalyst for OER was obtained by linear sweep voltanunetry (LSV), and the electrochemical active surface area (ECAS) was assessed by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The stability of the catalyst was also tested. The results show that the prepared nanocatalyst has excellent properties. In the solution of 1 mol L-1 KOH, the overpotential is only 242 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), the slope of Tafel is 43.13 mV dec(-1), and the stability is pretty good. This is mainly due to the open array structure of graphene nanosheets with small size of Ni-Fe nanoparticles, which is beneficial to mass transfer and gas diffusion. The synergistic structure has a large specific surface, so the catalyst exposes more active sites. The efficient method of preparation will provide an important technical basis for the preparation of transition metal-based OER nanocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0023-074X	2095-9419		WOS:000868464500011

The conversion from.-type to Z-scheme heterojunction was achieved due to the formation of build-in electric field from g-C3N4-x to W18O49. Tests results indicated that the LSPR hot electrons of W18O49 could directly drive oxygen reduction reaction to generate center dot O-2(-) species and the partial electrons of g-C3N4-x were captured by O defect states of W18O49 to stabilize its free charge density, resulting in the continuous generation of high-energy hot electrons. The photo-generated carriers had the stronger redox ability compared with g-C3N4-x and W18O49 due to the Z-scheme charge transfer paths. Combined with the promoted exciton dissociation induced by N vacancies, the enhanced light absorption and accelerated carriers' separation induced by near-field enhancement effect in visible-NIR range of oxygen vacancies, W18O49/g-C3N4-x heterojunction exhibited enhanced photocatalytic performance for NO removal and full-solar-spectrum-driven pollutants degradation.

J	Butzke, Daniel; Luch, Andreas					Butzke, Daniel/0000-0002-4800-4655			High-molecular weight protein toxins of marine invertebrates and their elaborate modes of action.								EXS				100				213	32						2010	2010	High-molecular weight protein toxins significantly contribute to envenomations by certain marine invertebrates, e.g., jellyfish and fire corals. Toxic proteins frequently evolved from enzymes meant to be employed primarily for digestive purposes. The cellular intermediates produced by such enzymatic activity, e.g., reactive oxygen species or lysophospholipids, rapidly and effectively mediate cell death by disrupting cellular integrity. Membrane integrity may also be disrupted by pore-forming toxins that do not exert inherent enzymatic activity. When targeted to specific pharmacologically relevant sites in tissues or cells of the natural enemy or prey, toxic enzymes or pore-forming toxins even may provoke fast and severe systemic reactions. Since toxin-encoding genes constitute "hot spots" of molecular evolution, continuous variation and acquirement of new pharmacological properties are guaranteed. This also makes individual properties and specificities of complex proteinaceous venoms highly diverse and inconstant. In the present chapter we portray high-molecular weight constituents of venoms present in box jellyfish, sea anemones, sea hares, fire corals and the crown-of-thorns starfish. The focus lies on the latest achievements in the attempt to elucidate their molecular modes of action.									10	1	0	0	12	0	12			1023-294X			MEDLINE:20358685	20358685

To further understand this material, we report for the first time the synthesis of single-crystalline Co1+xMn2-xO4 thin films using molecular beam epitaxy. By varying sample composition, we establish links between cation stoichiometry and material properties using in-situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and spectroscopic ellipsometry. Our results indicate that excess Co ions occupy tetrahedral interstitial sites at lower excess Co stoichiometries, and become substitutional for octahedrally-coordinated Mn at higher Co levels. We compare these results with density functional theory models of stoichiometric CoMn2O4 to understand how the Jahn-Teller distortion and hybridization in Mn-O bonds impact the ability to hole dope the material with excess Co. The findings provide important insights into CoMn2O4 and related spinel oxides that are promising candidates for inexpensive oxygen reduction reaction catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000607312900001	33438585

The Taiyangshan porphyry Cu-Mo deposit in the northern margin of the Triassic West Qinling Orogenic Belt exhibits a multi-stage, alteration-related quartz sulfide veins that recorded element migration processes during fluid-rock reactions. In this study, we investigated hydrothermal veins in the Taiyangshan deposit focusing on vein compositions and structures as well as the evolution of ore formation, using quantitative evaluation of minerals by scanning electron microscopy (QEMSCAN) and iron isotope analyses. The formation of the early K-feldspar-biotite-quartz-magnetite-apatite veins is closely associated with the early potassic alteration, and during the fluid-rock reactions, Si, S, Fe, and K migrated in, while Mg, Ca and Na migrated out. K-feldspar-chlorite-pyrite-chalcopyrite-quartz veins correlated to the propylitic alteration, dominantly caused the migration of Si, Fe, S, Ca Mg, Al and K. Quartz-sericite-pyrite veins corresponding to the phyllic alteration processes that occurred in a relatively late stage, during the fluid-rock reactions of which, Si, Fe, S, and K migrated into the system. The delta 56Fe whole-rock values of altered porphyries range from 0.08%o to 0.31%o, and delta 56Fe values of pyrite from quartz veins range from 0.30%o to 0.57%o. Iron isotope compositions of both pyrites of the ore-bearing wall rocks and the quartz-sulfide veins of the Taiyangshan Cu-Mo deposit are generally uniform, which indicate the same source origin between the ore-bearing porphyry and the iron isotope compositions of the metal sulfide in the quartz veins, and additionally highlight that the ore-forming source is closely related to the ore-bearing porphyry. Magnetite precipitated in the early stage of potassic alteration, resulting in the enrichment of the light Fe isotope in the early fluids. Crystallization and precipitation of pyrite mainly occurred during processes of propylitic and phyllic alteration, leading to an absorption of the light Fe isotope, and elsewhere, an enrichment of the heavy Fe isotope in the fluids. During the fluid-rock reactions of propylitic and phyllic alteration, a large amount of S migrated into the veins, thereby promoting the fractionation of Fe isotope. Moreover, the development of the ore-forming fluids enriched with heavy Fe isotope from early potassic- to late phyllic alteration, are indicative of isotopic progressions from the early lithostatic pressure to the late hydrostatic pressure. Our research on the Taiyangshan Cu-Mo porphyry deposit helps to explain the evolutionary processes of the magmatic-hydrothermal system, and improves our understanding of the porphyry metallogenic evolution model.									8	3	0	0	0	0	8			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000685518800001

Study on the structure and property of lead tellurium alloy as the positive grid of lead-acid batteries								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				475	1-2			102	109		10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.08.011				MAY 5 2009	2009	A series of novel Pb-Te binary alloys with different contents of tellurium (0.01-1.0 wt.%) were investigated as the positive grid of a lead acid battery. The microstructure of Pb-Te alloys was observed using a polarizing microscope. The morphology of the corrosion layers and corroded surfaces of Pb and Pb-Te alloy electrodes were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) following the corrosion test. The electrochemical properties of Pb-Te alloys and Pb-Te-Sn alloy in sulfuric acid solution were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), open circuit potential (OCP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), alternating current voltammetry (ACV), and linear sweeping voltammetry (LSV). The results indicate that the introduction of tellurium results in grain refinement, increased corrosion resistance, and an accelerated oxygen evolution reaction for the Pb-Te binary alloys. The passive films formed on Pb-Te-Sn alloy shows improved performances in comparison to those on Pb-Ca-Sn alloy. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Cassiopeia A is known to be a type IIb supernova from the optical spectrum of its light echo(2), but the immediate progenitor of the supernova remains uncertain(3). Here, we report results of near-infrared, high-resolution spectroscopic observations of Cassiopeia A, where we detected the pristine circumstellar material of the supernova progenitor. Our observations revealed a strong emission line of iron (Fe) from a circumstellar clump that has not yet been processed by the supernova shock wave. A comprehensive analysis of the observed spectra, together with a Hubble Space Telescope image, indicates that the majority of Fe in this unprocessed circumstellar material is in the gas phase, not depleted onto dust grains as in the general interstellar medium(4). This result is consistent with a theoretical model(5,6) of dust condensation in material that is heavily enriched with carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle nuclear reaction products, supporting the idea that the clump originated near the helium core of the progenitor(7,8). It has recently been found that type IIb supernovae can result from the explosion of a blue supergiant with a thin hydrogen envelope(9-11), and our results support such a scenario for Cassiopeia A.Keen observations of the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant have identified a circumstellar clump that lies outside the supernova shock front. This unprocessed material from the supernova progenitor contains iron in the gas phase, and is consistent with an origin within a blue supergiant star.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2397-3366			WOS:000508323100001

Ascribed to the separation effect of the polypropylene fiber, even suffering from a high-temperature carbonization treatment at 720 degrees C for 90 min, the polypropylene fiber-derived carbon encapsulated Pt nanocrystal maintains a small particle size (3 nm diameter on average). As expected, its ORR mass activity is up to 116.5 mA/mg at 0.9 V. After 8000 cycles, the half-wave potential of the prepared catalyst declines only by 14 mV compared with 43 mV for the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The significantly improved electrochemical properties of the as-prepared catalyst are resulted from the nitrogen-doped carbon-encapsulated Pt nanocrystal structure, which is benefited to adsorption and activation of oxygen due to the presence of nitrogen-doped carbon as the important active site for ORR besides Pt metal. In addition, the migration, aggregation, and growth of Pt nanoparticles are prohibited in terms of the outer nitrogen-doped carbon protection layer, greatly enhancing the stability of the catalyst.									36	3	0	0	1	0	36			0743-7463			WOS:000459642300013	30682889

In this work, 14 kinds of nonmetal (NM) single atom doped 2D Ti2CO2 catalysts were screened by DFT method. It was found that the surface doping of nonmetal single atom can effectively promote the HER activity of Ti2CO2. Among them, Ti2CO2 with rich fluorine termination groups realizing efficient electrocatalytic HER has been successfully verified by recent experiments. Through the analysis of electronic structure, it is found that nonmetal single atom valence electron number and bader electron transfer coupled electron descriptor is suitable to accurately predict the trend of 2D NM-Ti2CO2 catalytic activity for HER. The large-scale screening of this work and the mechanism analysis of nonmetal single atom surface doping enhanced of 2D Ti2CO2 HER activity not only provide a database reference for the experimental synthesis of NM-MXenes HER catalyst, but also provide a electronical mechanism guidance for the extensive design of new NM- MXenes materials.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000651206300003

Herein, Co-free LLO microspheres with Ni/Mn and Al dual concentration-gradients are constructed to mitigate the above obstacles. One concentration-gradient is an electrochemical active gradient (Ni/Mn), and the other is an electrochemical inert gradient (Al). XPS and soft and hard XAS after different cycles prove that the combination of dual concentration-gradients effectively mitigates interfacial reactions, structural evolution, and the generation of lower-valence Mn3+/Mn4+ or Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couples during cycling. As a result, the voltage fading rate of LLO cathode with dual concentration-gradients after 100 cycles is as small as 0.97 mV/cycle at 100 mA g(-1) . Furthermore, its capacity retention ratio is also as large as 84.1% after 400 cycles at 300 mA g(-1) . The combination of dual concentration-gradients in this work provides a way to develop advanced LLO cathodes for practical application in the near future.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2380-8195			WOS:000686077800015

In this work, we report a facile strategy to synthesize ultralow (0.66 wt%) Pt doped FeNi alloy nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in a porous graphene shell architecture (denoted as Pt-FeNi@C). The resulting Pt-FeNi@C catalyst exhibited an efficient specific activity and a small Tafel slope for the HER in 0.5 M H2SO4. Meanwhile, it also possessed an excellent stability, remaining stable at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for 10 h with negligible loss. In particular, the mass activity of Pt-FeNi@C is 63.0 times higher than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst at an overpotential of 50 mV. This work may shed some light on engineering economic and efficient ultralow noble metal-based catalysts for efficient HER and beyond.									24	1	0	0	0	0	24			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000494830400023

Additionally, efficient charge separation and prevention of back reactions are necessary. Here, we report simultaneous H-2 and O-2 evolution by CdS nanorods decorated with nanoparticulate reduction and molecular oxidation co-catalysts. The process proceeds entirely without sacrificial agents and relies on the nanorod morphology of CdS to spatially separate the reduction and oxidation sites. Hydrogen is generated on Pt nanoparticles grown at the nanorod tips, while Ru(tpy)(bpy)Cl-2-based oxidation catalysts are anchored through dithiocarbamate bonds onto the sides of the nanorod. O-2 generation from water was verified by O-18 isotope labelling experiments, and time-resolved spectroscopic results confirmed efficient charge separation and ultrafast electron and hole transfer to the reaction sites. The system demonstrates that combining nanoparticulate and molecular catalysts on anisotropic nanocrystals provides an effective pathway for visible-light-driven photocatalytic water splitting.									228	16	0	0	19	0	229			2058-7546			WOS:000446724600016

However, a demand for lighter, more compact devices and for extended range EVs continues to fuel the need for higher energy density storage systems. Li2VO2F, which is synthesized in its lithiated state, allows two-electron transfer per formula during the electrochemical reaction providing a high theoretical capacity of 462 mAh/g. Herein, the synthesis and electrochemical performance of Li2VO2F are optimized. The thermal stability of Li2VO2F, which is related to the safety of a battery is studied by thermal gravimetric analysis. The structure and vanadium oxidation state evolution along Li cycling are studied by ex-situ X-ray diffraction and absorption techniques. It is shown that the rock-salt structure of pristine Li2VO2F is stable up to at least 250 degrees C, and is preserved upon Li cycling, which proceeds by the solid-solution mechanism. However, not all Li can be removed from the structure upon charge to 4.5 V, limiting the experimentally obtained capacity. (C) 2017 The Electrochemical Society.

Large numbers of Pt-AuNPs were homogenously distributed on the CNFs. A Pt-AuNP/CNF hybrid with low Pt content was utilized as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, exhibiting a higher response current of 116 mu A without an enzyme in the detection of H2O2 and a lower overpotential (j = 10 mA cm(-2) at -235 mV) and Tafel slope (84 mV decade(-1)) for HER than the PtNPs/CNFs and the AuNPs/CNFs. These results were ascribed to the specific nanostructure of the well-dispersed Pt-AuNPs, the favorable electron transport capability, the excellent durability of the CNFs, and the enhanced surface-specific area of the Pt-AuNPs/CNFs. This study offers a green and facile method for constructing a specific bimetallic nanostructure for application in catalytic fields.									20	2	0	0	1	0	20			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000399422000048

In this work, DMA is hybridized with a concentrated nitrate electrolyte [2.5 m Zn(NO3)(2) + 13 m LiNO3 aqueous solution] for better electrochemical stability while using less dissolved salts. The widest electrochemical stability window for this DMA-diluted electrolyte is determined as 3.1 V, the negative critical stability potential of which is -1.6 V versus Ag/AgCl, indicating desirable stability against hydrogen evolution and Zn deposition. The findings can be attributed to the weakened Li+/Zn2+ solvation sheath caused by low permittivity of DMA, as revealed through Raman spectra characterization and molecular dynamics simulation. A Zn//Zn symmetrical cell and Zn//LiMn2O4, hybrid ion batteries are assembled in air directly, attributed to the stability of DMA toward O-2. Zn stripping/ plating with a dendrite-free morphology is delivered for 110 h and 200 charge/discharge cycles under 1 C rate, achieving 99.0% Coulombic efficiency. The maximum capacity of the battery is 121.0 mA h.g(-1) under 0.2 C rate (based on the mass of LiMn2O4), delivering an energy density of 165.8 W h.kg(-1) together with 2.0 V working voltage. This work demonstrates the feasibility and validity of utilizing a relatively dilute electrolyte dissolved in oxygen for a highly stable aqueous rechargeable battery.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000706187100040	34570470

In this work, we reported that BaZrO3 nanocrystals with {001}/{011} facets and corresponding higher reducing capacity could effectively improve the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in pure water. The tuned electronic band structure arising from exposed specific {001}/{011} facets and the higher surface area are the main reasons to promote photocatalytic activity. The conduction band bottom for BaZrO3 nanocrystals with {001}/{011} facets synthesized by solvothermal method (denoted as BZO-HT) is about 0.31eV higher than that of sample prepared by hydrothermal reaction (denoted as BZO-H). During the evaluation of photocatalytic activity in pure water, the H-2 production rate for BZO-HT (27.80mol/g/h) is 9.4 times and six times higher than BZO-H and commercial BaZrO3 (denoted as BZO-C), respectively.

Novel catalysts that can withstand the harsh conditions in case of gross fuel (i.e. H-2) starvation events at the PEFC anode are needed to increase the fuel cell stack's service life and to meet the durability targets set for automotive applications. To make progress in this respect, we have tested an unsupported, bimetallic Pt3Ni alloy (aerogel) catalyst at the PEFC anode and subjected it to a stress test that mimics the high potentials (>= 1.5 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode) encountered upon fuel starvation. In contrast to commercial carbon-supported platinum catalysts (Pt/C), the Pt3Ni aerogel displays excellent durability and performance retention in end-of-life fuel cell polarization curves. Additionally, the aerogel catalyst shows approximate to 35% higher surface-specific activity for the hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction than Pt/C. These results highlight the great potential of using novel unsupported catalysts at the anode of PEFCs. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

Bismuth tungstate (Bi2WO6) is one of the perovskites-based photocatalysts shows a great ability to photodegrade organic dye under solar light irradiation. In this study, Bi2WO6 with different physicochemical properties was synthesized using one-pot solvothermal method by varying the reaction temperature ranging from 120 degrees C to 180 degrees C. The Bi2WO6 synthesized at 140 degrees C (BWO-140) exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity (8.0 x 10(-3) min(-1)) toward Erichrome Black T (EBT) dye. The superiority of Bi-2 WO6 photo-degradation was mainly attributed to a synergistic effects of large surface area, small crystallite size, low electron recombination, and the presence of oxygen vacancies. Moreover, it was interesting to note that the BWO-140 could be reused for six consecutive cycles, without any significant deterioration. It was demonstrated that, photogenerated hole (h(+) ) was the most important active species of Bi2WO6 to initiate the photocatalytic reaction. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

As an efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst, Co/NPC shows a more positive onset potential (0.91 V vs. RHE) with a diffusion-limited current density of 5.46 mA cm(-2) at 0.3 V (vs. RHE). The rotating disk electrode and rotating ring-disk electrode results suggest that the Co/NPC catalyst experiences a nearly 4e pathway with a stronger methanol tolerance and better durability than commercial Pt/C catalyst in 0.1 M KOH. The excellent ORR catalytic activity of Co/NPC can be attributed to the N-doped porous carbon structure with incorporated metallic Co active species. This work affords a new strategy for preparation of non-noble metal ORR catalysts employing MOF as a precursor.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000424874900041

Owing to their favorable catalytic properties, high ionic and electronic conductivity, and chemical and redox stability, MIEC perovskite oxides are promising electrode materials in multiple applications, such as solid oxide fuel/electrolysis cells, oxygen transport membranes, metal-air batteries, electrochemical sensors, and electrocatalysts for water splitting. Here, taking (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)Cr0.5Fe0.5O3-delta (LSCrF8255) as a model MIEC perovskite oxide, we demonstrate that the oxygen mass transport properties are significantly enhanced under a humid reducing water vapor environment (pO(2) < 1 mbar, pH(2)O = 30 mbar) by up to 4 orders of magnitude compared to those measured under dry (pO(2) = 200 mbar) and wet (pO(2) = 200 mbar, pH(2)O = 30 mbar) oxygen atmospheres. A 0.8 eV decrease in the activation energy for oxygen bulk diffusion was also found under water vapor, and a decrease in activation energy of 0.7 eV for water surface exchange compared to oxygen surface exchange was found. The mechanisms underpinning these enhancements were explored. Furthermore, LSCrF8255 has also exhibited a consistent surface composition evolution regarding Sr segregation and phase separation and an excellent bulk stability under both oxidizing and reducing environments at elevated temperatures.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000718181700031

In line with this, we have successfully modified the morphological structure and composition of low cost cobalt based-metal oxides, MCo2O4 (M=Zn and Ni), with the simple and noble use of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as growth modifier and surface stabilizer during the synthesis of nanoparticles in our previous reports, which shown high electrocatalytic activity and strong stability. Due to the good performance of our PVP modified MCo2O4 towards pseudocapacitor and oxygen evolution reaction applications, we decided to extend our research study to methanol oxidation reaction. Remarkably, PVP modified NiCo2O4 electrode directly grown on nickel foam substrate via a simple hydrothermal process exhibited better performance compared with PVP modified ZnCo2O4 and NiCo2O4 without PVP. It had obtained a remarkably low onset potential of 0.285V and high current density of 280mA cm(-2), and shown great stability and high poison tolerance during a continuous CV cycling and Chronoamperometry test, which attained high efficiency of 86.86% and 98.52%, respectively. These positive results of PVP modified NiCo2O4 electrode towards MOR might be attributed to its hierarchical 3D nanostructures with highly mesoporous surface and large surface area which may have provided numerous electroactive sites, and the exceptional corrosion stability of NiCo2O4 electrode in alkaline solution.

J	Chen, Hai-Hang; Ji, Yongfei; Fan, Ting					Ji, Yongfei/0000-0002-6759-7126			Understanding the role of Cl doping in the oxygen evolution reaction on cuprous oxide by DFT								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				24	41			25347	25355		10.1039/d2cp02671f		SEP 2022		OCT 27 2022	2022	Designing highly active and earth-abundant oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for electrochemical water splitting remains a challenge. Recently, Cl-doped Cu2O has emerged as a very promising non-noble-metal electrocatalyst candidate for the OER. However, the mechanism of the OER catalyzed by Cl-doped Cu2O has not been explored systematically. Herein, a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) study is employed to study the role of Cl doping via comparing the OER on pure and Cl-doped Cu2O surfaces with/without Cu vacancies. Our results reveal that Cl doping increases the adsorption ability of Cu2O(111) by providing an excess electron, while a Cu vacancy decreases its adsorption ability by changing the geometric structure of the adsorption sites and the electronic structures. Cl-Cu2O(111) (eta = 0.58 V) and V-Cu-Cl-Cu2O(111) (eta = 0.46 V) have comparable or even better OER activity than those of widely used OER electrocatalysts such as the IrO2 catalyst (eta = 0.56 V). It is facile to have a Cu vacancy when Cu2O(111) is doped with Cl because of a large strain introduced by Cl doping. Thus, V-Cu-Cl-Cu2O(111) should be the most feasible catalyst for the OER catalyzed by Cl-doped Cu2O material. The dual role of Cl doping is that it not only increases the OER activity but also helps to form a Cu vacancy. The results show that Cu2O(111) activity can be greatly enhanced via electronic and geometric structure modulation, which is helpful for the design of more efficient Cu2O-based catalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000867631400001	36239135

In this study, a MOF catalyst CdS@PCN-224(Ni) was fabricated using CdS quantum dots (QDs) and unique PCN-224(Ni) by a simple hydrothermal method. Due to synergetic effect of the CdS QDs and bimetallic porphyrin MOF structure, the special catalyst showed a great electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 120 mV and a current density of 10 mA/cm(2)with a Tafel slope of 90.8 mV/dec, which is approaching to that of the Pt/C (42.8 mV/dec). The double-layer capacitances (C-dl) of CdS@PCN-224(Ni) are 9.75 mF/cm(2)which is distinctly superior to that of the PCN-224 (2.33 mF/cm(2)). Even more to the point, this innovative electrochemical catalyst has a wonderful durability in acid solution, which means it could reach a sustainable utilization. In conclusion, the high activity and low-cost catalyst could be a promising candidate for HER devices in acid media.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000580440400005

The theoretical (E-rev) and experimental discharge (E-exp) potentials for these systems have been determined and the volume of hydrogen gas measured at periods of time. The yield of hydrogen gas was calculated for different temperatures. For this system, alcohol adsorbs on to the platinum surface in alcohol solutions and decreases the overpotential for anodic and cathodic reactions; so that the highest hydrogen yield is obtained in all alcohol solutions.

Density functional theory is used to systematically screen for stability, activity, and selectivity of transition metal dopants in PdH. The transition metal elements Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Ag, Cd, Hf, Ta, W, and Re are doped into PdH(111) surface with six different doping configurations: single, dimer, triangle, parallelogram, island, and overlayer. We find that several dopants, such as Ti and Nb, have excellent predicted catalytic activity and CO2 selectivity compared to the pure PdH hydride. In addition, they display good stability due to their negative doping formation energy. The improved performance can be assigned to reaction intermediates forming two bonds consisting of one C-Metal and one O-Metal bond on the PdH surface, which break the scaling relations of intermediates, and thus have stronger HOCO* binding facilitating CO2 activation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000781063300001	35286748

It was found that the ball milling processing could obviously increase the surface area, decrease the particle and crystallite size, and reduce the crystallinity of beta-Ni(OH)(2), which was advantageous to the improvement of the electrochemical activity of nickel hydroxide powder. Electrochemical performances of pasted nickel electrodes using the ball-milled nickel hydroxide as an active material were investigated, and were compared with those of the electrodes prepared with the un-milled nickel hydroxide. Charge/discharge tests showed that the ball-milled nickel hydroxide electrodes exhibited better performances in the charging efficiency, specific discharge capacity, active material utilization and discharge voltage. The improvement of the performances of beta-Ni(OH)(2) through ball milling could be attributed to the better reaction reversibility, higher coulombic efficiency, higher oxygen evolution potential and lower electrochemical impedance, as indicated by the cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies. Thus, ball milling was an effective method to modify the physical properties and enhance the electrochemical performances of nickel hydroxide powder for the active material of rechargeable alkaline nickel batteries.									29	2	0	0	0	0	30			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000234571000012

The assynthesized composite (denoted as CNT@NiSe/SS) is used as a free-standing and multifunctional electrode for both supercapacitors and overall water splitting applications. For a supercapacitor application, CNT@NiSe/SS exhibits higher specific capacity and improved rate capability compared with individual NiSe and CNTs. A hybrid supercapacitor device consisting of battery-like CNT@NiSe/SS and EDLC-like graphene delivers a maximum energy density of 32.1 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 823 W kg(-1) and has excellent stability after a floating test of 50 h. On the other hand, CNT@NiSe/SS also serves as a bifunctional electrocatalyst with high activity for overall water splitting. The CNT@NiSe/SS electrode displays excellent hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction performance with the lowest overpotential of 174 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 267 mV at 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. The symmetrical two-electrode system requires an operating potential of 1.71 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, this electrolyzer shows a negligible increment in potential after 24 h of continuous water splitting. The outstanding performances of CNT@NiSe/SS can be attributed to the synergistic effect of NiSe and CNTs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The micromorphology, phase composition and elements distribution of the oxide layer formed on Pb-0.6 wt% Ag anode were studied. Additionally, the anodic reaction process, galvanostatic potential and oxygen evolution kinetics in Cl- /Mn2+ ions containing sulfuric acid electrolyte were investigated. Compared with the traditional Pb-0.6 wt% Ag cast-rolled alloy, Pb-0.6 wt% Ag powder-pressed alloy shows much lower anodic potential, self-corrosion current density, cell voltage and higher exchange current density in the same electrolyte. Due to a thin and uniform Mno(2) layer formed on the surface of powder-pressed alloy with the presence of Mn2+ ion in the electrolyte, the powder-pressed alloy presents a stable anodic potential. Consequently, the corrosion of powder-pressed Pb-0.6 wt% Ag anode was suppressed and the anode slime was decreased compared with Pb-0.6 wt% Ag cast-rolled anode.									6	1	0	0	1	0	7			0304-386X	1879-1158		WOS:000436213100028

These three active sites have reactive oxo species with differing degrees of coordination by Co cations - a mu(3)-oxo on the (311) surface, a mu(2)-oxo on the (110)-A surface, and an eta-oxo on the (110)-B surface. The kinetically relevant step on all surfaces over a wide range of applied potentials is the nucleophilic addition of water to the oxo, which is responsible for formation of the O-O bond. The intrinsic reactivity of a site for this step is found to increase as the coordination of the oxo decreases with the mu(3)-oxo on the (311) surface being the least reactive and the h-oxo on the (110)-B surface being the most reactive. A detailed analysis of the electronic changes occurring during water addition on the three sites reveals that this trend is due to both a decrease in the attractive local Madelung potential on the oxo and a decrease in electron withdrawal from the oxo by Co neighbors. Applying a similar electronic structure analysis to the oxidation steps preceding water addition in the catalytic cycle shows that analogous electronic changes occur during this process, explaining a correlation observed between the oxidation potential of a site and its intrinsic reactivity for water addition. This concept is then used to specify criteria for the design of an optimal OER catalyst at a given applied potential.									12	1	0	0	0	0	13			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000380099200012	27108887

The contextual generation of xanthylium pigments has been further evaluated with the aim of deepening our understanding of the kinetics and the mechanisms underlying the oxidative spoilage of flavanols in wine-like conditions. Novel data on the efficacy of gallotannins in controlling the (+)-catechin oxidative decay in model wine solutions are furnished, together with its comparison with the ones offered by SO2 and ascorbic acid.Ascorbic acid was found to promptly reduce the amount of dissolved oxygen in samples, while the presence of SO2 or tannins resulted in a significantly lower consumption. Under our experimental conditions and at least for 30 days, browning rate was best controlled by sulfite and ascorbic acid (even if to a different extent) while gallotannins failed in such a task. However, a longer storage (120 days) under oxidative conditions revealed a large augmentation of browning rate in samples with aa and/or SO2, added which became yellower than untreated samples. The amounts of (+)-catechin declined the fastest in all the solutions with aa added Chemical reactions underlying the obtained results, have been discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	OQUIST, G; HUNER, NPA								COLD-HARDENING-INDUCED RESISTANCE TO PHOTOINHIBITION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN WINTER RYE IS DEPENDENT UPON AN INCREASED CAPACITY FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS								PLANTA				189	1			150	156						JAN 1993	1993	Analyses of chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthetic oxygen evolution were conducted to understand why cold-hardened winter rye (Secale cereale L.) is more resistant to photoinhibition of photosynthesis than is non-hardened winter rye. Under similar light and temperature conditions, leaves of cold-hardened rye were able to keep a larger fraction of the PS II reaction centres in an open configuration, i.e. a higher ratio of oxidized to reduced Q(A) (the primary, stable quinone acceptor of PSII), than leaves of non-hardened rye. Three fold-higher photon fluence rates were required for cold-hardened leaves than for non-hardened leaves in order to establish the same proportion of oxidized to reduced Q(A). This ability of cold-hardened rye fully accounted for its higher resistance to photoinhibition; under similar redox states of Q(A) cold-hardened and non-hardened leaves of winter rye exhibited similar sensitivities to photoinhibition. Under given light and temperature conditions, it was the higher capacity for light-saturated photosynthesis in cold-hardened than in non-hardened leaves, which was responsible for maintaining a higher proportion of oxidized to reduced Q(A). This higher capacity for photosynthesis of cold-hardened leaves also explained the increased resistance of photosynthesis to photoinhibition upon cold-hardening.									125	3	0	0	125	1	131			0032-0935			WOS:A1993KD46000020

Operating conditions are harsher than in a fuel cell system, particularly because the potentials required for the oxygen evolution reaction are significantly higher. In commercial water electrolysis systems, this is compensated by typically using titanium material sets that are often protected against oxidation through coating processes. Such material choices make small scale research hardware and porous transport layers expensive and difficult to source. In this work, we show that the stability of traditional, carbon-based fuel cell materials such as porous transport layers and graphite flow fields can be sufficient for electrolyzer initial performance characterization procedures such as cell conditioning, a limited number of polarization curve measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. We identify and quantify the onset of carbon degradation in porous transport layers with regards to operating length and define a strategy that enables the utilization of standard fuel cell hardware for short-term PEMWE experiments. With the knowledge that existing fuel cell material sets can be applied to conduct electrolyzer research when adhering to such limitations, fuel cell research hardware and experience can be more readily transferred to the younger and rapidly growing electrolysis research field.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000633163700006

In Pt-Pd alloy, O-3 releases highly active oxygen (O*) species (O-3 -> O-2 + O.), which combine with Pd species or Pt species selectively. This com-bination induces a relative migration between Pd and Pt atoms, forming Pt-core@PdO-shell structural catalyst, which meets the thermodynamic stability of Pt-Pd alloy. Core shell structural catalyst displays a better catalytic performance for C-H bond activation. Experimental results indicate core-shell structural catalyst produces more highly active oxygen species than alloy catalyst does. These highly active oxygen species activate C-H bond in alkanes, contributing to a higher catalytic reactivity. In addition, the interaction between Pt-core and PdO-shell lowers the binding energy of ionic Pd species, which facilitates the release of reactive oxygen species.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000782430600005

As a nano crystalline supramolecular semiconductor, SA-TCPP could sufficiently contact with the surface of O-CN nano sheets, resulting in a 0D/2D assembling heterostructure via pi-pi interaction. The full-spectrum responsive property of SA-TCPP could enhance the light-harvesting ability of O-CN to generate more photogenerated carries, which was a driving force for photocatalytic reaction. The well-matched band structures and the pi-pi interaction between SA-TCPP and O-CN could give rise to a built-in electric field and electron delocalization effect to promote the interfacial charge transfer. A large amount of highly oxidative reactive species (h(+), center dot O(2)(-)and O-1(2)) also could make a great contribution to the strong oxidation capacity of the heterojunction system. Compared with OCN and SA-TCPP, SA-TCPP/O-CN exhibited greatly improved visible photocatalytic oxidation performance towards pollutants degradation, oxygen evolution and disinfection. The apparent rate constant (k) of SA-TCPP/O-CN-40% for bisphenol A degradation was 3.7 times as high as that of O-CN, while the corresponding k for phenol degradation were about 2.5 times faster than that of SA-TCPP. The oxygen evolution rate of SA-TCPP/O-CN-40% were 4.7 and 2.7 times higher than those of O-CN and SA-TCPP, respectively. Additionally, the bactericidal efficiency of SA-TCPP/O-CN-40% (62.5 %) against Staphylococcus aureus cells within 8 min was also more outstanding than those of O-CN (negligible) and SA-TCPP (55.6 %). Therefore, the enhanced photocatalytic oxidation activities of SA-TCPP/O-CN heterojunction were ascribe to the synergistic effect between O-CN and SATCPP.									35	0	0	0	3	0	35			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663269200006

This work reports an exceptionally large surface area hybrid catalyst electrode comprising semicrystalline molybdenum sulfide (MoS2+x) catalyst attached on a substrate based on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs), which are directly grown on carbon fiber paper (CP). It is shown here that nitrogen-doping of the carbon nanotubes improves the anchoring of MoS2+x catalyst compared to undoped carbon nanotubes and concurrently stabilizes a semicrystalline structure of MoS2+x with a high exposure of active sites for HER. The well-connected constituents of the hybrid catalyst are shown to facilitate electron transport and as a result of the good attributes, the MoS2+x/N-CNT/CP electrode exhibits an onset potential of -135 mV for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4, a Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1), and high stability at a current density of -10 mA cm(-2).									97	5	0	0	2	0	99			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000384810300006

However, the apparent quantum efficiency of SrTiO3 is typically low, even when functionalized with nanoparticles of Pt or Ni@NiO. Here, we introduce a simple solid-state preparation method to control the incorporation of magnesium into the perovskite structure of SrTiO3. After deposition of Pt or Ni@NiO, the photocatalytic water-splitting efficiency of the Mg: SrTiOx composites is up to 20 times higher compared to SrTiO3 containing similar catalytic nanoparticles, and an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 10% can be obtained in the wavelength range of 300-400 nm. Detailed characterization of the Mg: SrTiOx composites revealed that Mg is likely substituting the tetravalent Ti ion, leading to a favorable surface-spacecharge layer. This originates from tuning of the donor density in the cubic SrTiO3 structure by Mg incorporation and enables high oxygen-evolution rates. Nevertheless, interfacing with an appropriate hydrogen evolution catalyst is mandatory and non-trivial to obtain high-performance in water splitting.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000416158500027	29072368

Here, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the OER electrocatalysis of 2TM-pyridine/amino-nitrogen-decorated graphene (2TM-N(PA)G and 2TM-N(P)G. 2TM represents FeCo, FeNi, Conti) is studied. The electrocatalytic OER mechanism is that 2TM-N(P)G acts as the pre-catalyst, while the real catalysts are 2TM-N(PA)G and 2TM-N(P)G-O. In particular, CoNi-N(PA)G and CoNi-N(P)G-O exhibit higher OER activity compared to state-of-the-art RuO2 at pH = 14. It is confirmed that the potential-determining step is also the rate-determining step. Amino-nitrogen is the main accepter of electrons from CoNi atoms and pyridine-nitrogen is the main acceptor of electrons from nearby C atoms. The role of different N coordination continues to influence the entire electrocatalytic OER process of CoNi-NG. Simultaneously, the overpotential of CoNi-NG is in a volcano-shaped relationship with the electronic properties (oxidation state or d-band center) of the catalytic site of Co. Moreover, CoNi-N(PA)G and CoNi-N(P)G-O are the closest to the center of the OER overpotential (a function of the d-band center and oxidation state) contour plot, implying that they exhibit the best catalytic activity among all the CoNi-NG materials. The optimal electronic properties of CoNi-N(PA)G and CoNi-N(P)G-O contribute towards their excellent OER performance, and provide a new breakthrough in developing high-performance DACs.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000729916700001	34904996

We have synthesized iron-incorporated pure phase alpha-nickel hydroxide, Ni0.8Fe0.2(OH)(2) electrocatalyst utilizing N,N,N ',N '-Tetramethylethane-1,2-diamine (TMEDA) and ethylene glycol (EG) following a simple one-pot synthesis process. PXRD and FTIR data suggest that the intercalation of EG in the interlayer spacing promotes amorphousness of the material. FESEM and TEM analyses suggest that the catalyst possesses hierarchical sheet-like morphology and BET measurements indicated the surface area of 50 m(2) g(-1) with high mesoporosity. Electrochemical studies suggest that Ni0.8Fe0.2(OH)(2) prepared using water-EG mixture is the most efficient electrocatalyst for OER activity as it requires only 258 mV overpotential (considering backward LSV) on a glassy carbon electrode to achieve the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(geo)(-2). Additionally, the catalyst shows remarkable long-term stability for up to 7 days. The efficiency of Ni0.8Fe0.2(OH)(2) electrocatalyst is reflected in its low Tafel slope (43 mV dec(-1)) and high OER faradaic efficiency (93%). The enhanced activity is attributed to the increase in the interlayer spacing due to the intercalation of EG into the material, which facilitates the transport of ions during the OER process. The overall improved catalytic property is due to the enhanced ionic mobility, controllable textural property, higher per-site activity and increased conductivity for the Ni0.8Fe0.2(OH)(2) catalytic network.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000647578400001	33955441

For both materials, polychromatic excitation (1.2 < E < 6.2 eV) produces well-separated electron and hole centers. On MgO, where only surface features such as 3- and 4-coordinated anions are excited with energies < 6.2 eV, very different time evolutions were observed for the EPR signals of trapped electron and hole centers which is explained by secondary reactions stimulated by the low energy part of the radiation spectrum. As in the case of MgO, in TiO2 supra band gap excitation (E > 3.2 eV) generates hole centers which form O- radicals when the holes get trapped at oxygen anions. Only a limited fraction of trapped electrons, however, is localized as Ti3+ states, the majority remains in the conduction band. Different to MgO, this state of charge separation can be kept constant only at temperatures below 200 K, because of thermally driven charge carrier annihilation. The performance of dynamic excitation experiments under high-vacuum conditions and low temperatures allows one to track the process of light induced charge separation on a time scale of seconds and minutes.

RSS were present in evolution long before ROS, and because both are metabolized by catalase it has been suggested that "antioxidant" enzymes originally evolved to regulate RSS and may continue to do so today. Here we examined RSS metabolism by Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) using amperometric electrodes for dissolved H2S, a poly sulfide-specific fluorescent probe (SSP4), and mass spectrometry to identify specific polysulfides (H2S2-H2S5). H2S was concentration- and oxygen-dependently oxidized by 1 mu M SOD to polysulfides (mainly H2S2, and to a lesser extent H2S3 and H2S5) with an EC50 of approximately 380 mu M H2S. H2S concentrations > 750 mu M,4 inhibited SOD oxidation (IC50 = 1.25 mM) with complete inhibition when H2S > 1.75 mM. Polysulfides were not metabolized by SOD. SOD oxidation preferred dissolved H2S over hydrosulfide anion (HS-), whereas HS- inhibited polysulfide production. In hypoxia, other possible electron donors such as nitrate, nitrite, sulfite, sulfate, thiosulfate and metabisulfite were ineffective. Manganese SOD also catalyzed H2S oxidation to form polysulfides, but did not metabolize polysulfides indicating common attributes of these SODs. These experiments suggest that, unlike the well-known SOD-mediated dismutation of two O-2(center dot-) to form H2O2 and O-2, SOD catalyzes a reaction using H2S and O-2 to form persulfide. These can then combine in various ways to form polysulfides and sulfur oxides. It is also possible that H2S (or polysulfides) interact/react with SOD cysteines to affect catalytic activity or to directly contribute to sulfide metabolism. Our studies suggest that H2S metabolism by SOD may have been an ancient mechanism to detoxify sulfide or to regulate RSS and along with catalase may continue to do so in contemporary organisms.									89	1	0	0	73	0	93			2213-2317			WOS:000436226600008	29220697

Here, a S-treated two-dimensional (2D) CoFe bimetallic PBA grown on carbon fiber paper (CFP) (named S-CoFe-PBA/CFP) is assembled and applied as a highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst in 1 M KOH. The resultant S-CoFe-PBA/CFP demonstrates significantly improved OER catalytic activity; overpotentials of only 235, 259, and 272 mV are needed to drive current densities of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a super low Tafel slope of 35.2 mV dec(-1). Even more noteworthy, a current density of 90 mA cm(-2) can be achieved when a potential of 1.5 V vs. RHE is applied, which is 6.4 times higher than that of commercial Ir/C in the same environment. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance can be ascribed to two reasons caused by the S-treatment process. On one hand, H+ from intermediates of *OH and *OOH can be captured by -SOx distributed on the surface of the catalyst, thus accelerating the breaking of O-H; on the other hand, partial phase transformation of CoFe-PBA leads to the in situ formation of amorphous CoSx nanogauze on the surface, and the resultant electronic interactions between the two phases contribute much to the improvement of charge transfer and adsorption for OER intermediates. This work provides a new avenue for the design of highly efficient PCP-based OER electrocatalysts.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000587715700042	33030180

The major challenges that remain in this quest are due to the lack of effective catalytic assemblages operating with optimum efficiency and obtainable following much simpler setups and easily accessible methods. Here, we demonstrate that the robust electrocatalytic activity toward water oxidation can be achieved employing straightforwardly obtainable nanoscale electrocatalysts derived from easily made colloidal-cobalt nanoparticles (Co-CNPs) prepared in clean carbonate systems. Thin-film non-noble metal nanoscale electrocatalysts such as simple Co-CNPs/FTO and annealed Co-CNPs/FTO250 and Co-CNPs/FTO(500 )obtained by depositing Co-CNPs on the FTO substrate are shown to initiate water oxidation at much lower overpotentials such as just 240 mV for Co-CNPs/ FTO(250 )under mildly alkaline conditions while demonstrating an impressive Tafel slope of just 40 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, the robust catalyst demonstrated a high electrochemical surface area of 91 cm(2) and high turnover frequency and mass activity of 0.26 s(-1) and 18.84 mA mg(-1), respectively, just at 0.35 V, and superior durability during long-term electrolysis. These outstanding catalytic outcomes using easily prepared Co-CNPs/FTO250 -type catalytic systems are comparable and even better than other noble and non-noble metal-based nanoscale catalytic assemblages obtained by much difficult methods. Most advantageously, the colloidal route also offers the easiest approach of incorporating carbon contents in the catalytic layer, which can ultimately increase mechanical stability and mass transfer capability of the system.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2470-1343			WOS:000537145000003	32455183

The regulation of the local electronic structure of the active metal sites in polymetallic composites provides a basic idea. Herein, the ultrathin bimetallic molybdate nanosheets are evenly deposited on the CuOx hollow nanotubes on the copper foam substrate to form a hierarchical heterostructure, which can be used as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. Experimental results prove that the introduction of Ni to form a double metal salt molybdate and CuOx heterostructure design can be optimized by Co cation as best electronic structure of electric catalytic activity center, and can effectively promote the generation of CoOOH active phase at the same time, so that can skillfully optimize the binding strength between the Co site and the oxygen-containing intermediate, and enhancing catalytic activity. When it is used in the overall water splitting of a double-electrode alkaline electrolytic cell, the cell voltage of CoNiMoO4-21/CuOx/CF is 1.532 V at 50 mA cm(-2), far exceeding most of the reported conventional bifunctional electrocatalyst.

In contrast to traditional metallic cation doping, anion doping within easyto-prepare conditions usually gives rise to tremendous modulations of physical properties with tunable crystal structures. Here, oxyfluoride BaFeO3-xFy (BFO-F) thin films were successfully synthesized via a low-temperature reaction with polyvinylidene fluoride, which exhibit extremely structural stability over time. The existence of fluorine was confirmed by the combination of X-ray photoelectron depth profile and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The oxyfluoride BFO-F films demonstrate a sequence of structural evolutions with reduced out-ofplane lattices, by means of elevating fluorination temperatures. The valence state of iron in BFO-F is gradually changed from 3(+) to 4(+) for higher fluorination temperatures. Moreover, the resistivity of BFO-F dramatically decreases, compared to that of pristine oxygen-deficient BaFeO3-delta film. Our results provide insight into the modulations on the structures and physical properties of perovskite oxyfluorides through the facile fluorination process and contribute to the fundamental understanding of fluorination.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000528340500182

The influence of Ca(OH)(2) additive on the electrochemical performance of two types of nickel electrode (using spherical Ni(OH)(2) and.-CoOOH@ Ni(OH)(2)) were evaluated. It is interestingly discovered that nano-Ca(OH)(2) additives can efficiently improve the charge acceptance of both nickel electrodes. Especially, the charge acceptance of the 1.0 wt% nanoCa(OH)(2)@.-CoOOH@ Ni(OH)(2) electrode at 70 degrees C at 5C is over 90% and the discharge capacity can reach about 218 mAh g(-1). These performance enhancements of nickel electrode mainly result from the combined coating with Ca(OH)(2) and gamma-CoOOH. The modification of oxygen evolution reaction on the nickel electrode is primarily resulting from the use of Ca(OH)(2) by increasing its potential and suppressing its rate. The observably lower charge transfer resistance of nickel electrode is mainly due to the high conductivity coating of gamma-CoOOH. Consequently, the proposed cathode additive is promising for the high-temperature property enhancement of nickel-based rechargeable batteries.

Developing efficient electrocatalysts with low potentials and high current densities is crucial for the large-scale productions of H-2 and other value-added chemicals. Herein, non-noble metal electrocatalysts Co-doped Ni3S2 self-supported on a Ni foam (NF) substrate are prepared and used as catalysts for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation reaction (HMFOR) under alkaline aqueous conditions. For HMFOR, the Co0.4NiS@NF electode achieves an extremely low onset potential of 0.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and records a large current density of 497 mA cm(-2) at 1.45 V versus RHE for HMFOR. During the HMFOR-assisted H-2 production, the yield rates of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and H-2 in a 10 mL electrolyte containing 10 x 10(-3) M HMF are 330.4 mu mol cm(-2) h(-1) and 1000 mu mol cm(-2) h(-1), respectively. The Co0.4NiS@NF electrocatalyst displays a good cycling durability toward HMFOR and can be used for the electrooxidation of other biomass-derived chemicals. The findings present a facile route based on heteroatom doping to fabricate high-performance catalyses that can facilitate the industrial-level H-2 production by coupling the conventional HER cathodic processes with HMFOR.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2198-3844		WOS:000782586500001	35426484

Herein, we have synthesized a hierarchical nanostructured ZnCo2S4 on reduced graphene oxide (ZCS@rGO) sheet using a cost-effective hydrothermal synthesis method. The prepared ZCS@rGO shows improved hydrogen desorption and adsorption energy of the electrocatalyst surface towards efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a result, ZCS@rGO showed lower HER overpotential (eta(10) = 135 eV) and Tafel slope (47 mV dec(-1)) and superior durability at 10 mA cm(-2) for 36 h, as compared to the benchmark catalyst of Pt-C. Further, the electronic structure and HER mechanism of the ZCS@rGO catalyst were investigated by density functional theory calculations. This work provides a new pathway for the rational design of highly active and durable non-precious STMS-based electrocatalysts for hydrogen production.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000740797100001

The oxidation of propene is an interesting model system as propene can be oxidized in two different positions, allowing for insights into the reaction mechanism. On Pd, a layer of adsorbates formed in situ governs the reaction by steering reactant adsorption to achieve high selectivity for allyl oxidation, albeit largely inhibiting the reaction rate. Through rational catalyst design, we demonstrate that alloying reactive Pd with inert Au influences the adsorbate layer formation, enhancing activity while maintaining high selectivity toward allyl oxidation. We obtain mechanistic insights with a combination of ab initio computational modeling and electrochemical measurements with ex situ product quantification and online mass spectrometry. Using a statistical approach, we explore the correlation of the Au:Pd ratio with Pd surface cluster size and density, which determine the properties of the adsorbate layer and thus the reaction outcome. We report an activity enhancement by a factor 2.4 with 10% Au in Pd and propose that (i) activity is maximized at potentials just before Pd cluster oxidation and (ii) the optimal catalyst surface contains approximately one Au every six Pd atoms, statistically most frequent at the nominal alloy composition Au14Pd86.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000860657600001

The e(g) orbital occupancy of transition metal ions in spinel oxides can determine the oxygen evolution reaction activity. However, the e(g) filling, the catalyzing active sites, and the related UOR mechanisms in spinel catalysts are still unknown. Here, from the perspective of electronic structure and metal redox capability, we explored the composition dependence of urchin-like NixCo3-xO4 (x = 0, 0.75, 0.86, 1, and 1.20) spinel in UOR to investigate the role of octahedral nickel atoms in the spinel structure. The results indicated that the UOR activity could be promoted by embedding more Ni ions into the octahedral sites, allowing the accumulation of a large number of nickel redox equivalents and an increase in the level of the low-spin state of Ni3+. Furthermore, a near-unity occupancy of the eg orbital of Ni ions could enhance the intrinsic UOR activity of spinel catalysts. Urea oxidation proceeds through the electrochemical oxidation mechanism and direct urea electro-oxidation reaction pathway, where NiOOH species act as active sites in catalyzing the process. This work offers a guideline for designing and synthesizing non-precious metal-coupled Ni-based catalysts with appropriate redox properties for urea oxidation applications.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000648873500027

Simply varying the volume of Ce(NO3)(3) solution used tunes the particle size. Experimental observations support direct formation of CeO2 from Ce3+ ions. Both light absorption and band-gap-related photoluminescence bands of these CeO2 octahedra red-shift continuously with increasing particle size. Optical band gap varies from 3.42 eV for 52 nm octahedra to 2.94 eV for 110 nm octahedra, so band gap tunability is possible over a very large size range. Mott-Schottky plots were obtained from electrochemical measurements to yield a band diagram of 52, 85, and 110 nm CeO2 octahedra with different valence band and conduction band energies, showing that particle size of semiconductor nanocrystals can significantly tune their band positions. The notable change in valence band positions for the 52 and 110 nm CeO2 octahedra may contribute to their potential difference in electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction activity.									26	2	0	0	1	0	26			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000526391300043

Metal oxides comprise the most promising class of photoanode materials, but no known material meets the demanding requirements of low band gap energy, photoelectrocatalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and stability under highly oxidizing conditions. Here, the identification of new photoelectroactive materials is reported through a strategic combination of combinatorial materials synthesis, high-throughput photoelectrochemistry, optical spectroscopy, and detailed electronic structure calculations. Four photoelectrocatalyst phases, alpha-Cu2V2O7, beta-Cu2V2O7, gamma-Cu3V2O8, and Cu11V6O26, are reported with band gap energy at or below 2 eV. The photoelectrochemical properties and 30 min stability of these copper vanadate phases are demonstrated in three different aqueous electrolytes (pH 7, pH 9, and pH 13), with select combinations of phase and electrolyte exhibiting unprecedented photoelectrocatalytic stability for metal oxides with sub-2 eV band gap. Through integration of experimental and theoretical techniques, new structure-property relationships are determined and establish CuO-V2O5 as the most prominent composition system for OER photoelectrocatalysts, providing crucial information for materials genomes initiatives and paving the way for continued development of solar fuels photoanodes.									74	3	0	0	6	0	75			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000365271000005

Herein, we report the synthesis of dithiophosphonate complexes of the type [Ni{S2P(OH) (4-CH3OC6H4)}(2)] (1), [Co{S2P(OC4H9)(4-CH3OC6H4)}(3)] (2) and [Fe{S2P(OH)(4-CH3OC6H4)}(3)] (3) and employed them to prepare Ni2P, Co-Ni2P and Fe-Ni2P nanoparticles. Ni2P was formed by a facile hot injection method by decomposing complex 1 in tri-octylphosphine oxide/tri-n-octylphosphine at 300 degrees C. The prepared Ni2P was doped with Co and Fe employing complexes 2 and 3, respectively, under similar experimental conditions. Doping Ni2P with Co and Fe demonstrated synergistic improvement of Ni2P performance as an electrocatalyst in supercapcitance, hydrogen evololution and oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline medium. Cobalt doping improved the Ni2P charge storage capacity with a supercapacitance of 864 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) current density. Fe doped Ni2P recorded the lowest overpotential of 259 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 80 mV dec(-1) for OER, better than the undoped Ni2P and the benchmark IrO2. Likewise, Fe-doped Ni2P electrode required the lowest overpotential of 68 mV with a Tafel slope of 110 mV dec(-1) to attain the same current density for HER. All catalysts showed excellent stability in supercapacitance and overall water splitting reactions, indicating their practical use in energy conversion technologies.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000683055100001	34369503

Determination of the energy losses and development of new ECL-enhancing strategies are still of great value. In this work, we discovered a detrimental nonradiation relaxation pathway by a concurrent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process in a well-known ruthenium(II) tris(2,2'-bipyridyl) (Ru-(bpy)(3)(2+)) aqueous ECL system due to similar surface-sensitive characteristics, and for the first time, a chemical strategy was developed by which carbon nitride quantum dots (CNQDs) could inhibit the surface OER process, alleviate the energy losses by nonradiation relaxation, and enhance the anodic ECL of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+). In the Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) CNQD system, CNQDs could enhance the anodic ECL of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) in a nitrogen stream (10-fold) and ambient air (161-fold). The luminous and nitrogen-rich CNQDs were also confirmed not to serve as ECL luminophores, anodic coreactants, or donor/acceptors in ECL. The coreactant- free Ru(bpy)(3)(2)(+)/CNQD system possesses several advantages over the common coreactant ECL system, such as low dosage (100 mu g/mL CNQDs), favorable regeneration capacity, etc. As an example, ECL on-off detection of dopamine utilizing the Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) /CNQD system was also developed to show prospects in ECL sensing. Besides, CNQDs were introduced into the classical Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)/C2O42- coreactant ECL system, leading to suppressed OER and improved ECL signal. Overall, the proposed new ECL- enhancing strategy is promising for applicable ECL sensing, could be extended to other ECL luminophores with high oxidation potential, and enables an in-depth understanding of the ECL process and mechanism.									11	0	0	0	1	0	10			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000596727600014	33170643

Herein, we, for the first time, prepare FeS2 crystal lattices on WS(2)nanosheets (FeS2CL@WS2NS) by solvothermal methods for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The FeS(2)CLs effectively prevent the oxidation and aggregation of WS(2)nanosheets and increase the electrochemically active surface area. The abundant surface defect in the FeS2CL@WS2NS electrocatalyst reduces the stress between the crystal lattices of FeS2 and that of WS2. The overpotential (260 mV) of the FeS2CL@WS2NS electrocatalyst for the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is superior to those of WS2NS/Ni foam (310 mV) and IrO2/Ni foam (300 mV) in 1.0 M KOH solution. An electrochemical-kinetic study shows that the Tafel slope of 54 mV per decade for the FeS2CL@WS2NS electrocatalyst is lower than those of WS2NS (102 mV per decade) and IrO2/Ni foam (77 mV per decade). In addition, the charge transport resistor (2.3 Omega) of the FeS2CL@WS2NS electrocatalyst for the OER is smaller than that of WS2NS. These faster kinetic properties, in turn, explain the high catalytic activity of the FeS2CL@WS2NS electrocatalyst for the OER. The XPS and HRTEM results of the post stability sample confirm that Fe2+ and W4+ are oxidized after durability measurement. Thus, we think that the FeS2CL@WS2NS electrocatalyst is a promising candidate for efficient, low-cost, and stable non-noble-metal-based OER electrocatalysts.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000550576200027	32633295

We performed batch experiments whereby trichloroethene (TCE) was dehalogenated by nZVI under different environmental conditions that are relevant in practice. The tested conditions include different ionic strengths, addition of polyelectrolytes (carboxymethylcellulose and ligninsulphonate), lowered temperature, dissolved oxygen and different particle contents. Particle properties were determined by Mssbauer spectroscopy, XRD, TEM, SEM, AAS and laser obscuration time measurements.TCE dehalogenation and H-2 evolution were decelerated by reduced ionic strength, addition of polyelectrolytes, temperature reduction, the presence of dissolved oxygen and reduced particle content. The partitioning of released electrons between reactions with the contaminant vs. with water (selectivity) was low, independent of the tested conditions. Basically out of hundred electrons that were released via nZVI oxidation only 3.1 +/- 1.4 were used for TCE dehalogenation. Even lower selectivities were observed at TCE concentrations below 3.5 mg l(-1), hence particle modifications and/or combination of nZVI with other remediation technologies seem to be necessary to reach target concentrations for remediation.Our results suggest that selectivity is particle intrinsic and not as much condition dependent, hence particle synthesis and potential particle modifications of nZVI particles may be more important for optimization of the pollutant degradation rate, than tested environmental conditions.

This is due to the unique characteristics of the hBN-suppressing recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers and hence increase in the redox reactions. In the present work, a hBN-modified Ni2P-containing excess boron composite (B-hBN-Ni2P) was prepared through an electroless plating method. The solid structure, elemental composition, and morphology were investigated via X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The composite coating was tested for solar water splitting, and a hydrogen evolution rate of 883 pmol/h was achieved. The role of excess B was revealed through an electrochemical acidic leaching. By gradually removing boron from the structure, a monotonous drop in the water splitting activity was observed. Our study identifies B as a sacrificial agent/hydrogen production booster. It contributes to the higher catalytic activity with an additional hydrogen generation through the oxidation of its surplus amount from the composite coating. The enhanced hydrogen evolution activity for the composite coating in the present study is highly competitive with the other modern photocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000812982900001

We report the temperature-controlled synthesis of two nickel phosphide polymorphs, Ni2P and Ni5P4, by phosphorization of Ni foil or foam using phosphine gas. The hexagonal phase Ni2P nanowires and Ni5P4 nanosheets were grown on Ni substrates with vertical alignment, and uniformly exposed active (001) planes. The Ni5P4 nanosheets possess significant stacking faults along the [0001] direction. Both Ni2P and Ni5P4 exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Their overpotential for 10 mA cm(-2) was 0.126 and 0.114 V, and the Tafel slope was 42 and 34 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte, respectively. A decrease in HER performance was observed for Ni5P4, but the change was negligible for Ni2P. Strain mapping using a precession-assisted nanobeam electron diffraction technique showed that only Ni5P4 underwent degradation of basal (001) planes during HER, which explains the lower stability of catalytic activity. Furthermore, the Ni2P nanowires demonstrated excellent catalytic activity toward overall water splitting, which could be attributed to the stable surface as well as the highly conductive crystal structures.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1466-8033			WOS:000458429200008

In the present work, the photo-generated electron is readily pulled from the photoactive catalyst by an electron sink (graphene) and transported to a site where the oxygen reduction reactions take place at a higher rate owing to better adsorption of other co-catalyst (gamma-alumina). In this dual electron-cocatalyst modified TiO2-Al2O3-rGO photocatalyst, rGO works as the electron mediator, and Al2O3 surface acts as the electron reduction site. The synergistic effect of rGO, and Al2O3 as bi-cocatalysts showed higher photocatalytic performance than bare TiO2, TiO2-Al2O3 and TiO2-rGO. This emphasizes the importance of both cocatalysts in electron separation and transfers where a single cocatalyst finds it difficult to carry out the crucial functions simultaneously. The modified TiO2-Al2O3-rGO photocatalyst under solar light reported 76% degradation of phenol in 5 h for 100 mg/L initial concentration.

Higher oxidation reactivity and significantly longer service life were achieved for Ti/SnO2-F electrode than Ti/SnO2-X (X= Cl, Br, I, or Sb) electrode, which could decomposed over 99% of PFOA (50 mL of 100 mg L-1) within 30-min electrolysis. The property of Ti/SnO2-F electrode and its electrooxidation mechanism were investigated by XRD, SEM-EDX, EIS, LSV, and interfacial resistance measurements. We propose that the similar ionic radii of F and 0 as well as strong electronegativity of F caused its electrochemical stability with high oxygen evolution potential (OEP) and smooth surface to generate weakly adsorbed (OH)-O-center dot. The preparation conditions of electrode were also optimized including F doping amount, calcination temperature, and dip coating times, which revealed the formation process of electrode. Additionally, the major mineralization product, F-, and low concentration of shorter chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) were detected in solution. So the reaction pathway of PFOA electrooxidation was proposed by intermediate analysis. These results demonstrate that Ti/SnO2-F electrode is promising for highly efficient treatment of PFOA in wastewater. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The Songshugou ultramafic massif located on the northern side of the Shangdan suture provides essential insights into the mantle origin and evolutionary processes during spreading and subduction of the Shangdan oceanic lithosphere. The ultramafic massif comprises harzburgite, coarse- and fine-grained dunites. The spinels from harzburgite exhibit low Cr# and high Mg# numbers, suggesting a mid-ocean ridge peridotite origin, whereas spinels from both coarse- and fine-grained dunites are indicated as resulted from melt-rock reaction due to their systematic higher Cr# and low Mg# numbers. This melt-rock reaction in the dunites is also indicated by the low TiO2 (mostly <0.4 to%) in the spinel and high Fo (90-92) in olivines. Due to its relatively homogeneous nature in the mantle, oxygen isotopic composition is a sensitive indicator for the petrogenesis and tectonic setting of the Songshugou ultramafic rocks. Based on in-situ oxygen isotope analyses of olivines from twenty-six rock samples, most harzburgites from the Songshugou ultramafic massif show low delta O-18 values of 4.54-5.30 parts per thousand, suggesting the olivines are equilibrium with N-MORB magmas and originally formed in a mid-ocean ridge setting. The coarse- and fine-grained dunites exhibit slightly higher olivine delta O-18 values of 4.69-6.00 parts per thousand and 5.00-6.11 parts per thousand, respectively, suggesting they may have been modified by subduction-related boninitic melt-rock reaction. The delta O-18 values of olivines systematically increasing from the harzburgites, to coarse-grained dunites and fine-grained dunites may suggest enhancing of melt-rock reaction. The decreasing of Os concentration, Re-187/Os-188 and Os-187/Os-188 ratios from harzburgite to dunite suggest an Os-187-enriched, subduction zone melt was responsible for creating the melt channel for melt-rock reactions. Together with the high-temperature ductile deformation microstructures, these isotopic and mineral geochemical features suggest that the harzburgites represent mantle residues after partial melting at mid-ocean ridge or supra-subduction zone, while the dunites were probably resulted from reactions between boninitic melt and harzburgites in a supra-subduction zone. Re-Os geochronology yields a maximum Re depletion model age (T-RD) of 805 Ma, constraining the minimum formation age of the harzburgites derived from oceanic mantle. Eight samples of whole rock and chromite yield a Re-Os isochron age of 500 +/- 120 Ma, constraining the timing of melt-rock reactions. Combined with the regional geology and our previous investigations, the Songshugou ultramafic rocks favors a mantle origin at mid-ocean ridge before 805 Ma, and were modified by boninitic melt percolations in a SSZ setting at ca. 500 Ma. This long-term tectonic process from spreading to subduction might imply a huge PanTethyan ocean between the Laurasia (e.g., North China Block) and Gondwana (e.g., South China Block) and/or a one-side subduction.

J	Gwak, Geonhui; Ju, Hyunchul								A rapid start-up strategy for polymer electrolyte fuel cells at subzero temperatures based on control of the operating current density								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				40	35			11989	11997		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.05.179				SEP 21 2015	2015	In a previous study, we numerically described the three distinct stages of ice evolution during the cold start of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC), namely, the freezing, undersaturated, and melting stages. Based on our numerical observations, we propose an efficient start-up strategy for achieving a rapid cell temperature rise while simultaneously mitigating the rate of ice accumulation within a cell. The key to this cold-start strategy involves raising the operating current of the PEFC in the undersaturated stage, which accelerates the cell temperature rise without any further ice accumulation. Using a three-dimensional, transient cold-start model, we numerically demonstrate that raising the cell current in the undersaturated stage is very effective and significantly improves the cold-start behavior of a PEFC. In contrast, increasing the cell current in the freezing stage has a negative impact on the PEFC cold start in that the oxygen reduction reaction causes the water production rate to increase, leading to more rapid ice growth. This ultimately results in cold-start failure and the deterioration of the porous electrode structure. This study clearly illustrates that optimization of the cold-start operation is key to improving the cold-start performance, while also pointing to the importance of the roles played by PEFC cold-start modeling and the simulations used to search for an optimum cold-start strategy.

However, expensive noble metal based electrocatalysts show best electrocatalytic performances which acts as main bottle-neck for commercial application. Therefore, non-precious electrocatalysts have become important for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. Herein, we report the synthesis of high surface area (35 m(2)/g) sodium niobate nanoparticles by citrate precursor method. These nanoparticles were characterized by different techniques like X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Electrocatalytic properties of cost-effective sodium niobate nanoparticles were investigated for HER and OER in 0.5 M KOH electrolyte using Ag/AgCI as reference electrode. The sodium niobate electrode showed significant current density for both OER (approximate to 2.7 mA/cm(2)) and HER (approximate to 0.7 mA/cm(2)) with onset potential of 0.9V for OER and 0.6V for HER. As-prepared sodium niobate nanoparticles show enhanced photocatalytic property (86% removal) towards the degradation of rose Bengal dye. Dielectric behaviour at different sintering temperatures was explained by Koop's theory and Maxwell-Wagner mechanism. The dielectric constants of 41 and 38.5 and the dielectric losses of 0.04 and 0.025 were observed for the samples sintered at 500 degrees C and 700 degrees C, respectively at 500 kHz. Conductivity of the samples was understood by using power law fit.									44	0	0	0	4	0	44			2045-2322			WOS:000461151800072	30872617

A zero-order (degrees Brix, fructose, glucose), a first-order (vitamin C), a second-order (sucrose) and a fractional conversion model (oxygen) were selected to model the evolution of the parameters between parentheses. Activation energies ranged from 22 to 136 kJ mol(-1), HMF formation being the most temperature sensitive. High correlations were found between sugars, ascorbic acid, their degradation products (furfural and HMF) and total colour difference (Delta E*). Based on PLS regression, the importance of the quality parameters for colour degradation was ranked relatively among each other: the acid-catalysed degradation of sugars and ascorbic acid degradation reactions appeared to be important for browning development in pasteurised orange juice during ambient storage.

Characteristic results show that the Fe doping improves the match of redox potentials, and SBA-16 is the best support of La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 when referring to the oxidation ability(e.g., the Co3+/Co2+ molar ratio). A mechanism for oxygen desorption from perovskite oxides is proposed based on O-2-TPD experiments, showing the evolution process of oxygen released from oxygen vacancy and lattice framework. Catalytic tests indicate that La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 is the best for CO oxidation, and La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 is the best for CO+NO reduction. The mechanism of CO+NO reduction changes as the reaction temperature increases, with X-NO/X-CO value decreases from 2.4 at 250 degrees C to 1.0 at 400 degrees C. As for the surface morphology, La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 supported on SBA-16 possesses the highest surface Co3+/Co2+ molar ratio as compared to the other two, and shows the best activity for CO oxidation.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			1005-9040	2210-3171		WOS:000429362900021

Its reaction cycle is composed of five intermediate (S-i) states, where the index i indicates the number of oxidizing equivalents stored by the cofactor. After formation of the (S-4) state, the product dioxygen is released and the cofactor returns to its lowest oxidation state, S-0. Membrane-inlet mass spectrometry measurements suggest that at least one substrate is bound throughout the catalytic cycle, as the rate of O-18-labeled water incorporation into the product O-2 is slow, on a millisecond to second time scale depending on the S state. Here, we demonstrate that the Mn4O5Ca complex poised in the S-0 state contains an exchangeable hydroxo bridge. On the basis of a combination of magnetic multiresonance (EPR) spectroscopies, comparison to biochemical models and theoretical calculations we assign this bridge to O-5, the same bridge identified in the S-2 state as an exchangeable fully deprotonated oxo bridge [Perez Navarro, M.; et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013, 110, 15561]. This oxygen species is the most probable candidate for the slowly exchanging substrate water in the S-0 state. Additional measurements provide new information on the Mn ions that constitute the catalyst. A structural model for the S-0 state is proposed that is consistent with available experimental data and explains the observed evolution of water exchange kinetics in the first three states of the catalytic cycle.									45	2	0	0	14	0	45			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000413503300020	28921983

The renewable, safe, and reliable alternative energy resources and storage systems are thus very much required for modern society. In this context, H-2, O-2 and CO2 involving electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems can be regarded as the sustainable way to meet the future energy demand. Nonetheless, the sluggish kinetics of these electrochemical reactions at electrode surface in their corresponding devices is one of the biggest challenges for the development of such technologies. Among various classes of electrocatalysts, MN4-type molecular electrocatalysts, particularly, metal phthalocyanines (MPcs) were found to be potential models to enhance the electrode kinetics of above mentioned electrochemical reactions. In this review article, first of all, the electronic and redox chemistry of phthalocyanine was discussed to understand the existed activity descriptors for H-2, O-2 and CO2 electrocatalysis. Then, we emphasized the potential candidature of MPcs as electrode materials in various energy conversion and storage devices along with their reaction mechanisms. Furthermore, several specific challenges related to activity and durability and future aspects with MPcs based materials are also discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The activated chemisorption of methane, followed by reaction of the carbon adspecies with hydrogen was conducted in pulse and continuous modes, in the temperature range of 473-673 K. It was observed by using pulse mode that evolutions of H-2, CO and CO2 occurred simultaneously with the pulses of methane without the formation of higher hydrocarbons. The reactivity, regarding the CH4 conversion, with or without MoO3, follows the sequence Pt/Al2O3 approximate to Pt/ZrO2 > Pt/SiO2. Also the hydrogenation of carbon residues produced only methane. The presence Of MoO3 had a positive influence concerning the reactivity of carbon residues, on zirconia and especially on alumina supported catalysts. In the flow mode operation, methane chemisorption is followed by the evolution of H-2, Plus C-2(=), C-2, C-3(=), and C-3, depending on the nature of the support. The hydrogenation of carbon residues produced mainly methane, but ethane and propane were also detected specially in the presence Of MoO3 which improves the mobility of CHx adspecies, favoring the C-C nucleation.

And the precursors of Sr-doped NiCoMnO4 NTC ceramics were attained by solid state reactions at room temperature, with no intermediate compounds. Its formation and the structural evolutions were characterized by thermo-gravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy. Related electrical analyses were also performed. The values of R-298K, B-298/323 constant and the temperature coefficient of resistance alpha(298K) of the thermistors are in the range of 168-1,738 Omega, 3,257-3,359 K and -3.64 to -3.78 % K-1, respectively. Complex impedance analysis shows, for x = 0.2, single semicircular arc whose shape does not have any change with temperature. The grain boundary properties exhibit thermistor parameters with a negative temperature coefficient characteristic. The conduction for the grain boundary could be explained by oxygen vacancies. The results show that the ceramics exhibits a good electrical property because of narrow grain size distribution, controlled morphology, and high purity. This suggests that the electrical properties can be adjusted to desired values by controlling the Sr cation content. This series of materials could be considered as practical materials for NTC thermistor. Most importantly, this new approach greatly simplifies the preparation processes.									8	3	0	0	0	0	8			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000313799700032

Its structure has been determined by X-ray diffraction. A Bond-Valence Sum (BVS) model calculation was performed to assign the oxidation state of the iron center in Fe-III(TAMP)Cl. Fe-III(TAMP)Cl can electrocatalyze hydrogen evolution from a neutral electrolyte solution (pH 7.0) with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 2.43 mol of hydrogen per mole of catalyst per second (mol (mol cat)(-1) s(-1)) at an overpotential (OP) of 837 mV. Water oxidation occurs at an overpotential of 791 mV to give O-2 with a TOF of similar to 124.06 mol O-2 (mol cat)(-1) s(-1).

When acetate is used as the carbon source, the current density of the MEC based on the non-immobilized anode is 10.95 A m(-2) , 15% higher compared to the immobilized bacterial anodes. When WW is used, the AC-1 bacterial anode yields the highest current density: 11.52 A m(-2) at a potential of 0.2 V, 11% and 29% higher than the A-1 and the nonimmobilized anodes, respectively. The AC-1 anode leads to a HER rate of 0.56 m(3)m(-3) d(-1) (at 0.5 V), COD removal of 75%, and a composition of 92% G. sulfurreducens. SEM analysis shows a biofilm covered with a layer of (presumed) alginate. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating an MEC based on an immobilized bacterial anode using alginate.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000523640000018

Herein, we fabricated a three-dimensional (3D) self-supported electrode based on N-doped, carbon-coated Co3O4 nanosheets grown on carbon cloth (i.e., NC-Co3O4/CC) through electrochemical deposition and carbonization. When used as a binder-free electrode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the NC-Co3O4/CC electrode demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic activity with an overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 79.6 mV dec(-1). In the Zn-air battery test, the electrode delivered a small charge/discharge voltage gap (0.87 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) and exhibited high durability without degradation after 93 cycles at the large current density of 25 mA cm(-2). The durability of our electrode was superior to that of a commercial Pt/C+RuO2 catalyst. The excellent performance of NC-Co3O4/CC could be attributed to the presence of 3D structures that promoted electron/ion transfer. By the absence of a binder, the carbon coating improved electron conductivity and promoted electrochemical stability. Moreover, N doping could be used to adjust the C electron structure and accelerate electron transfer. The present study provides a facile and effective route for the synthesis of various self-supported electrodes that fulfill the requirements of different energy storage and conversion devices.									25	8	0	0	0	0	25			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000461366000002

This paper describes findings of an investigation into this type of structural effect for carbon-supported bimetallic gold-platinum nanoparticles as cathode catalysts in a rechargeable lithium-oxygen battery. The nanoscale structural characteristics in terms of size, alloying and phase segregation were shown to affect the catalytic properties of the catalysts in the Li-O-2 battery. In addition to the composition effect, the catalysts with a fully alloyed phase structure were found to exhibit a smaller discharge-charge voltage difference and a higher discharge capacity than those with a partial phase segregation structure. This finding is significant for the design of alloy nanoparticles as air cathode catalysts in rechargeable lithium-air batteries, demonstrating the importance of the control of the nanoscale composition and phase properties.									33	1	0	0	0	0	34			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000306333500016	22781275

Herein, combining hydrothermal and low temperature phosphidation methods, V-doped Ni2P nanosheet arrays grown on carbon cloth (V-Ni2P NSAs/CC) were successfully prepared for the HER. It is found that the prepared V-Ni2P NSAs/CC exhibits preeminent performance for the HER. Specifically, it only requires an overpotential of 85 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution. Moreover, the V-Ni2P NSAs/CC shows superior electrochemical stability, maintaining its HER performance up to 3000 cyclic voltammetry cycles. This work affords a guiding strategy for the synthesis of a high-performance and stable electrocatalyst for the HER.									99	5	0	0	3	0	100			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000465410200005	30806413

In this study, we examine the impact of initial solution pH on H-2 production using an Ru/(CuAg)(0.15)In0.3Zn1.4S2 photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. In addition, the reaction mechanism was analyzed by examining the oxidation products of the electron donor (I-) at different solution pH values. The results show that the initial pH significantly influenced the rate of H-2 production and quantum yield (QY). In particular, the photocatalyst yielded the highest apparent QY (similar to 12.8%) at 420 +/- 5 nm and highest H-2 production rate (similar to 525 mu mol h(-1)) at pH 2; with increasing pH, the H-2 production and QY decreased significantly. The oxidation product of I- at pH <6 was mainly I-3(-), whereas at pH >6 water splitting did not occur at all, so no IO3- or I-2 were observed. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

J	Ma, X.; Zangmeister, C. D.; Zachariah, M. R.								Soot Oxidation Kinetics: A Comparison Study of Two Tandem Ion-Mobility Methods								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				117	20			10723	10729		10.1021/jp400477v				MAY 23 2013	2013	The oxidation kinetics of laboratory-generated soot particles has undergone extensive studies because of its importance in combustion-generated emissions and their control. In this study, we employed and compared two tandem ion-mobility methods, a tandem differential mobility analyzer (TDMA) and a differential mobility analyzer aerosol particle mass analyzer (DMA-APM), to resolve the oxidation kinetics of soot. Whereas the TDMA method measures changes in particle mobility (i.e., size) from which a mass-based reaction rate can be inferred, the DMA-APM is a direct determination of particle mass change. We monitored the structure evolution of soot during oxidation by determining the mass-mobility scaling exponent of the particle population and found that soot structural changes due to oxidative sintering can perturb and corrupt the apparent reaction kinetics extracted from the TDMA method and suggest that the DMA-APM method probably is a more reliable approach to pursue such measurements. By combining the mass change data from DMA-APM with size change data from TDMA, we obtained the material density and primary particle size of soot aggregates during oxidation. Two reaction regimes were identified with oxidation fully penetrating the particle at low temperatures and partial penetration at high temperatures. The activation energies were determined for the two reaction regimes to be 79 and 201 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The results should be useful in designing soot oxidation abatement units.									22	0	0	0	0	1	22			1932-7447			WOS:000319649400057

Herein, CdS quantum dots (QDs) were anchored onto a tremella-like N-doped carbon (NC) support with trace ruthenium dispersed, to store and consume photo-excited electrons. The Ru/NC cocatalyst significantly enhances the interfacial transfer of electrons and facilitates proton reduction, leading to a decrease in the photoinduced charge recombination. The optimal Ru/NC/CdS-5 catalyst has a low Ru loading of 0.59 wt%, and it exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity with an H-2 evolution rate of up to 73.6 mmol g(-1) h(-1), which is 21 times higher than that of bare CdS QDs (3.38 mmol g(-1) h(-1)). The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of Ru/NC/CdS-5 under the same experimental conditions was found to be 3.6% under irradiation at 420 nm. The catalytic recycling test of Ru/NC/CdS-5 demonstrates its excellent stability. This work provides insight into the enhancement of the activity of semiconductors by dispersing a trace noble metal in a porous carbon support as a cocatalyst for proton reduction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000840442900001

However, this strategy is subjected to the low activity of electrocatalysts. In this work, a Co-N-x-C hybrid derived from the metal-organic framework with built-in Co-N-x active sites was fabricated. A high NH3 yield (37.6 mu g mg(-1) h(-1) at -0.9 V vs a reversible hydrogen electrode) and favorable faradaic efficiency (17.6% at -0.3 V vs a reversible hydrogen electrode) were achieved in a 0.05 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The dominating coordination environment of Co-N-x was finally determined by combining X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and theoretical calculation. Co-N-3 demonstrated pivotal active centers that facilitated N-2 adsorption, lowered the free energy of the rate-determining step, inhibited hydrogen evolution reaction, and promoted the N-2 reduction reaction (N2RR). The hierarchical pore structure of catalysts also promoted N-2 adsorption, and the produced high pressure contributed to the further reaction of N-2 fixation. This work also provides a new strategy for developing cost-effective electrocatalytic materials for N2RR.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2168-0485			WOS:000571390000033

However, the inert basal planes of transition metal dichalcogenides severely suppress their practical applications. Herein, we developed ultrathin ternary molybdenum sulfoselenide (MoSexS2-x) nanosheets by using the cathodic electrochemical exfoliation approach in non-aqueous electrolytes. The exfoliated MoSexS2-x nanosheets demonstrated high structural integrity with lateral dimensions up to similar to(1).5 mu m and an average thickness of about 3 nm. Owing to the unique ultrathin structure and immensely exposed active sites, the ternary MoSexS2-x nanosheets supported on Ni foam demonstrated a greatly enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the HER in 1.0 M KOH with an overpotential of 123 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and high stability, superior to majority of the previously published MoS2-based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the ternary MoSexS2-x nanosheets as a highly active bifunctional electrocatalyst contributed to enhanced energy-efficient hydrogen production and electrocatalytic synthesis of ammonia.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000485971900056	31289796

In this work, MoS2 nanoflowers with the majority being octahedral MoS2 (1T-MoS2) and doped with FeS2 were prepared and applied to HER. The as-prepared catalysts were characterized by X-ray absorption fine structure at the K-edge of Mo, S, and Fe to probe the local electronic structures. The resulting nanomaterial was identified to be FeS2 doped MoS2 nanoflower (denoted as Fe-MoS2NF) with 66% 1T-MoS2 which was the metallic phase and could drastically boost the HER properties. The Fe-MoS2NF exhibited high HER performance with a Tafel slope of 82 mV dec(-1) and it needs 136 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The synthesis of Fe-MoS2NF with refined morphology and active electronic structure is expected to open a new era for improving the catalytic activity and stability of MoS2. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Microbial iron (Fe) reduction generates reduced iron [Fe(II)] under anaerobic conditions, which oxidizes to Fe(III) under subsequent aerobic conditions. We demonstrate that Fe (II) oxidation stimulates organic matter decomposition via two mechanisms: (i) organic matter oxidation, likely driven by reactive oxygen species; and (ii) increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) availability, likely driven by acidification. Phenol oxidative activity increased linearly with Fe(II) concentrations (P < 0.0001, pseudo R-2 = 0.79) in soils sampled within and among five tropical forest sites. A similar pattern occurred in the absence of soil, suggesting an abiotic driver of this reaction. No phenol oxidative activity occurred in soils under anaerobic conditions, implying the importance of oxidants such as O-2 or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in addition to Fe(II). Reactions between Fe(II) and H2O2 generate hydroxyl radical, a strong nonselective oxidant of organic compounds. We found increasing consumption of H2O2 as soil Fe(II) concentrations increased, suggesting that reactive oxygen species produced by Fe(II) oxidation explained variation in phenol oxidative activity among samples. Amending soils with Fe(II) at field concentrations stimulated short-term C mineralization by up to 270%, likely via a second mechanism. Oxidation of Fe(II) drove a decrease in pH and a monotonic increase in DOC; a decline of two pH units doubled DOC, likely stimulating microbial respiration. We obtained similar results by manipulating soil acidity independently of Fe(II), implying that Fe(II) oxidation affected C substrate availability via pH fluctuations, in addition to producing reactive oxygen species. Iron oxidation coupled to organic matter decomposition contributes to rapid rates of C cycling across humid tropical forests in spite of periodic O-2 limitation, and may help explain the rapid turnover of complex C molecules in these soils.									151	7	0	0	114	1	157			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000322758000019	23606589

We report on the preparation, characterization and activity regarding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) of these Pt/diamond electrodes. Two kinds of diamond layers with boron doping above 10(20) cm(-3) were grown epitaxially on (100)-oriented diamond substrates; post-treatments of wet chemical oxidation and radio frequency (rf) oxygen plasma treatments were applied. Electrochemical deposition of Pt was performed using a potentiostatic double-pulse technique, which allowed variation of the particle size in the range between 1 nm and 15 nm in height and 5 nm and 50 nm in apparent radius, while keeping the particle density constant. Higher nucleation densities on the plasma processed surface at equal deposition parameters could be related to the plasma-induced surface defects. Electrochemical characterization shows that the platinum particles act as nanoelectrodes and form an ohmic contact with the diamond substrate. The catalytic activity regarding HER and HOR of the platinum nanoparticles exhibits no dependence on the particle size down to particle heights of similar to 1 nm. The prepared Pt on diamond(100) samples show a similar platinum-specific activity as bulk platinum. Therefore, while keeping the activity constant, the well-dispersed particles on diamond offer an optimized surface-to-material ratio.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000293460400025	21687867

In this study, based on the lab-scale experiments and thermodynamic analyses, the reaction mechanism of aluminum increase during PESR was revealed, and the effects of atmosphere, slag and steel compositions on aluminum content were investigated to restrain aluminum increase. The results show that aluminum pickup was accompanied with noticeable silicon loss in steel and SiO2 increase in slag. The aluminum content in the ingots was dominated by the thermodynamic equilibrium of [Si] + (Al2O3) reaction between slag and steel. The high-temperature condition in electroslag metallurgy process promoted aluminum increase, and the reaction temperature was determined as approximately 1973 K. Due to the severer silicon loss that induced by the electrode oxidation in air, the aluminum content in ESR ingot was relatively lower than that in PESR. Increasing the SiO2 content in slags to 4.5 to 6 mass pct was an effective way to achieve low-aluminum content, but excessive SiO2 led to the high oxygen content and burning loss of alloying elements in ingots. Moreover, reducing the initial silicon content in electrodes from 0.45 to 0.18 mass pct further decreased the aluminum content in ingots. Through the process optimization, the restriction on aluminum increment in HNSBSs during PESR was well realized and the AlN inclusions almost disappeared.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000754127400003

Among them, defect engineering of electrocatalysts is considered a significant way to improve electrocatalytic efficiency by regulating the electronic state and providing more active sites that can give electrocatalysts better physicochemical properties. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), along with their derivatives, have captured immense interest in electrocatalytic reactions owing to not only their large surface area and high porosity but also the ability to create rich defects in their structures. Hence, they can provide plenty of exposed active sites for electron transfer, N(sic)N cleavage, and N-2 adsorption to enhance NRR performance. Herein, the concept, the in situ characterizations techniques for defects, and the most common ways to create defects into MOFs have been summarized. Furthermore, the recent advances of MOF-based electrocatalysts towards NRR have been recapitulated. Ultimately, the major challenges and outlook of defects in MOFs for NRR are proposed. This paper is anticipated to provide critical guidelines for optimizing NRR electrocatalysts.									27	1	0	0	0	0	27			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000620223500001		
J	Shen, Xiaowen; Wu, Yujian; Xu, Xiwei; Su, Jingfeng; He, Zhen; Jiang, Enchen; Ren, Yongzhi; Sun, Yan								Torrefaction enhanced biomass chemical-looping gasification coupled with CO2-splitting via half doped LaFe0.5M0.5O3 perovskites								FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY				234						107314	10.1016/j.fuproc.2022.107314				SEP 2022	2022	In order to explore the oxidation and reduction properties of the LaFe0.5M0.5O3 (M = Mn, Co, Ni, Cu) perovskites, torrefied biomass (TB) gasification and CO2 splitting were coupled as a whole chemical looping reaction, while the doped LaFe0.5M0.5O3 were prepared and employed as oxygen carriers(OCs) in the chemical looping. An proper torrefaction temperature was screened first for producing more syngas, then the effect of doped perovskites on the chemical looping reaction were evaluated via thermogravimetric analyzer and fixed-bed reactor in terms of the syngas yield and CO formation rate. The results showed that the doped perovskites exhibited higher activity in the gasification process, which promoted the conversion of TB and improved the yield of H-2 and CO. Specifically, the CO yield of LaFe0.5M0.5O3 and the H-2 yield of LaFe0.5M0.5O3 was improved by about 4 times and 1.3 times respectively compared with original LaFeO3. Moreover, LaFe0.5M0.5O3 exhibited better performance in both TB gasification and the CO2 splitting reaction, and the yield of H-2 and CO reached 3.71 mmol.g(-1) and 1.80 mmol.g(-1), respectively. Furthermore, the composition and surface topography evolution of doped perovskite were analyzed via TEM, SEM and XRD, and the results of XPS, EPR and TGA were combined to reveal the reaction mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000832739700002		
J	Zhao, Yu-Hang; Zhang, Tao; Wang, Xiao-Feng; Li, Shao-Jie; Pan, Yu; Wang, Yihan; Song, Xue-Zhi; Tan, Zhenquan								Plant polyphenol-involved coordination assembly-derived Mo3Co3C/Mo2C/Co@NC with phase regulation and interface engineering for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalysis								NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				46	27			13030	13036		10.1039/d2nj01810a		JUN 2022		JUL 11 2022	2022	The rational exploration of highly active and low-cost materials for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution is extremely imperative, but remains challenging as well. Transition metal carbides (TMCs) as highlighted electrocatalysts usually exhibit unsatisfactory activity and stability. In this work, we demonstrate a two-step strategy for electrocatalyst synthesis involving biomass-derived tannic acid (TA) and coordination assembly preparation followed by subsequent high-temperature carbonization. Interestingly, by simply controlling the feed amount of TA, heterostructured nitrogen-doped graphene-coated Mo3Co3C-based tri- and bi-component electrocatalysts (Mo3Co3C/Mo2C/Co@NC and Mo3Co3C/Co@NC) can be obtained with phase regulation and interface engineering. It is observed that the heterostructured materials possess more active sites than that of the TMC-excluding sample (Co@NC). Moreover, the tri-component Mo3Co3C/Mo2C/Co@NC may enhance the intrinsic activity at each active site due to the strong interaction at the Mo3Co3C/Mo2C interface. These advantages allow the Mo3Co3C/Mo2C/Co@NC catalyst to deliver superior electrocatalytic activity and favorable kinetics towards the HER, with a low overpotential of 211 mV and a Tafel slope of 96.0 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, it has good long-term stability. This work provides new inspiration for heterostructured TMC-based electrocatalysts with high performance towards promising catalytic applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000813545700001

The Journal of biological chemistry				295	16			5377	5389		10.1074/jbc.REV119.007741				2020-04-17	2020	Aldehyde oxidases (AOXs) are a small group of enzymes belonging to the larger family of molybdo-flavoenzymes, along with the well-characterized xanthine oxidoreductase. The two major types of reactions that are catalyzed by AOXs are the hydroxylation of heterocycles and the oxidation of aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids. Different animal species have different complements of AOX genes. The two extremes are represented in humans and rodents; whereas the human genome contains a single active gene (AOX1), those of rodents, such as mice, are endowed with four genes (Aox1-4), clustering on the same chromosome, each encoding a functionally distinct AOX enzyme. It still remains enigmatic why some species have numerous AOX enzymes, whereas others harbor only one functional enzyme. At present, little is known about the physiological relevance of AOX enzymes in humans and their additional forms in other mammals. These enzymes are expressed in the liver and play an important role in the metabolisms of drugs and other xenobiotics. In this review, we discuss the expression, tissue-specific roles, and substrate specificities of the different mammalian AOX enzymes and highlight insights into their physiological roles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1083-351X		MEDLINE:32144208	32144208

Herein, monoclinic NaVO3 exhibits good cycle performance with high capacity as a cathode material for NIBs. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies show that the material structure is virtually invariant during Na+ ( de)intercalation, with the a and b lattice parameters changing only by 0.13 and 0.19%, respectively. The material undergoes an oxygen redox reaction during initial charge while delivering a remarkable specific capacity of 245 mAh g-1 (1.2-4.7 V) with contributions from cationic (V4+/V5+) and anionic (O2-/O-) redox couples during discharge. The stable VO4 tetrahedral framework also enables the material to give superior rate and cycle capabilities, with a capacity of 164 mAh g(-1) (67% utilization) at a current of 1000 mA g(-1) (about 5C) and a capacity retention of 90% after 50 cycles. Density functional theory calculations further verify the stability of the material and the charge-discharge mechanism. This work can broaden the horizon for designing high-energy cathode materials with enhanced structural stability for sodium-ion batteries.									6	2	0	0	0	0	6			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000586787900009

Herein, we report synthesis of snap bean-like multi-dimensional core/shell Ni/NiCoP nano-heterojunctions (NHs) by adopting a solid phase transformation strategy. In the special structure, Ni nanoparticles are enclosed and strung by single phased NiCoP, forming strings of Ni/NiCoP core/shell heterojunctions, which showed improved stability and activity for both hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveal that interactions at the interface of Ni/NiCoP greatly changed electronic structures, which is a key intrinsic factor to underpin the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate Ni/NiCoP interface provide more optimal binding strength for H adatom and H2O molecule for HER, strong capture of hydroxyl, high valence Ni/Co species for OER. All these peculiarities facilitate the electrocatalytic process: only 1.57 V was needed to reach the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) for the overall water splitting using Ni/NiCoP NHs as both electrodes. This work demonstrates a facile strategy for synthesis of sophisticated catalytic interface at nano level and endows nano-heterojunction catalysts with enhanced performance for catalytic applications.									76	7	0	0	3	0	76			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000488308800034

Herein, an efficient and stable electrocatalyst with CoNi nanoalloy (10-20 nm) uniformly embedded in porous N-doped carbon framework (CoNi-NCF) for neutral and alkaline primary Al-air batteries is prepared and studied. The CoNi-NCF electrocatalyst shows superior ORR performance in terms of half-wave potential of 0.91 V in 0.1 M KOH solution and 0.64 V in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution, outperforming those of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Supported by in situ electrochemical Raman spectra and density functional theory calculations, the rich dual active sites of CoNi nanoalloy and porous N-doped carbon contributes to the outstanding ORR performance. Impressively, when employed as a cathode catalyst in both aqueous and solid flexible Al-air batteries, the CoNi-NCF-based Al-air batteries show the highest discharge performance, long-time durability and high flexibility, demonstrating the promising potential for practical application.									37	2	0	0	2	0	37			2405-8297			WOS:000521992800011

Using a Ti/Ru0.1Sn0.6Ti0.3O2 electrode, a quartz reaction device and an artificial ultraviolet light, decoloration ratios higher than 70%, and reductions of 51% and 83% in TOC and total phenol products, respectively, were observed for a reaction time of 6 h. Comparing these values with the sum of the decoloration ratios (or TOC and total phenol reductions) obtained by separate measuring of electrochemical and photochemical procedures, a significant synergetic effect between these two processes was observed. Furthermore, the degradation capacity of the photoelectrochemical process increases as the SnO2 content is increased.									54	6	0	0	23	5	58			0021-891X			WOS:000089127000008

Here, a disordered mesoporous and highly defected titanium dioxide (dom-TiO2) electrocatalyst for the oxidation of hydroxide ion was prepared via ligand-assisted evaporation-induced self-assembly. The (dom-TiO2) electrocatalyst showed significant electrocat-alytic performance for the oxidation of hydroxide ion compared to that of non-porous TiO2 (bare-TiO2) and highly-ordered hexagonal mesoporous (hm-TiO2) electrodes. The chemical and electrochemical parameters of the diffusion (D), concentration in the bulk (C-b), the number of trans-ferred electrons (n), rate constant of heterogeneous electron transfer (k(s)), redox potential (E degrees), and homogeneous chemical rate constant (k(c)) for the oxidation of hydroxide ion reaction at the porous TiO2 electrodes were determined via the convolution-deconvolution voltammetry and competed against that of non-porous (bare-TiO2) and hm-TiO2 and catalysts. In addition to the effect of dom-TiO2 film thickness and the type of supporting electrolytes on the electrochemical parameters of the electrocatalytic oxidation of OH- ions have been estimated. The convolutive-deconvoluted results show that the dom-TiO2 electrode catalyst exhibits a superior reaction rate constant among the studied electrodes that depend on the film thickness and type of supporting electrolyte.

Spectrophotometry and voltammetry of the initial solutions allowed us to establish the redox interaction of ruthenium hydrochlorides and Ir(IV) complexes with the formation of mixed (RuIV RuIV IrIII) complexes. In the range A (0 < x less-than-or-equal-to 0.3) aggregates of partially hydrated Ru and Ir complexes coexist with the mixed 'molecular' forms. As a result the rutile type solid solutions formed in the coatings of the A region are more microheterogeneous and contain microregions enriched by Ru or Ir oxides. Another type of microheterogeneity is associated with incomplete crystallinity of the films and the presence of hydrated amorphous oxide phases on the surface of the crystallites of rutile solid solutions (Ru,Ir)O2. All RuxIr1-xO2 electrodes demonstrate lower activity in O2 evolution reactions and lower rates of charge storage processes in comparison with RuO2 and IrO2 electrodes. This may be associated with the peculiarities of the interaction of Ir and Ru ions on the surface of hydrated phases, and at the same time may explain higher corrosion stability of the RuO2-component under O2 evolution conditions.									39	0	0	0	1	0	39			0254-0584			WOS:A1991HE06400004

Herein, N/S co-doped carbon was prepared using kappa-carrageenan and melamine as precursors, in which melamine can be decomposed into nitrogen-containing gas for realizing nitrogen doping, and the sulfate groups in kappa-carrageenan can be converted for sulfur doping. Such an N/S doping strategy enables a carbon catalyst with a large specific surface area, hierarchical porous structure, and rich defective sites to be achieved, displaying a high positive onset potential (E-onset = 0.98 V) and half wave potential (E-1/2 = 0.89 V), excellent stability, and methanol tolerance. More importantly, S doping could increase the positive charge density of the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen, which is favorable for enhancing the chemisorption of O-2 and weakening the O-O bond, thereby promoting the reaction from O-2 to OH- and improving electron transfer. Furthermore, with this catalyst as the air cathode, the assembled aqueous Zn-air battery exhibits a high open-circuit potential of 1.53 V and a remarkable peak power density of 166.05 mW cm(-2), outperforming the Pt/C catalyst. This work gives a facile and effective strategy to construct high-performance ORR catalysts with four electron transfer for Zn-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000815215800001

Highly active and stable Pt/Graphene electrocatalysts for the application of direct methanol fuel cells were developed. The oxygen/carbon ratio of graphene supports were tuned by various chemical methods. Pt nanoparticles with a narrow distribution of particle sizes were well dispersed on graphene. An increased catalytic activity and stability were achieved due to an increased graphitization degree of graphene when the Pt/Graphene was deoxidized during Ar/H-2 reduction. The activity of Pt/Graphene towards methanol oxidation reaction and its stability was higher compared to Pt/Carbon. This study suggests a bi-functional effect of both graphitization and the oxygenated groups on the catalytic activity.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000365555000055	26682407

The characterization of the doped films was carried out by means of Auger electron spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in combination with argon bombardment. The dopant concentration profiles and the valence states of the elements present within the films were also determined. The predominant species present is metallic platinum, although oxidized species probably make some contributions. Titanium changed from TiO2 to lower oxidation states in going from the surface to the film depth. XPS indicates the presence of hydrated oxides at the surface. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses indicate that platinum deposition occurs preferentially on grain boundaries. At high platinum content, clusters are evident and the substructure of titanium substrate is reproduced. At low platinum content, SEM cannot detect its presence at the surface in spite of the electrochemical evidence. The electrochemical behaviour of modified oxide films was also analysed. The potentiodynamic response correlates with the response of a polycrystalline platinum electrode. Electron transfer reactions reveal a catalytic effect due to the platinum incorporated into the TiO2 layer. The oxygen evolution reaction was investigated using impedance as a function of both the platinum content and the thickness of the TiO2 layer. Finally, an approximate physical model for the system is proposed.									67	6	0	0	3	2	71			0040-6090			WOS:A1992JZ12400003

However, the phase equilibria within the quasiternary Bi2O3-CaO-CoOx system is not described in detail what can be problematic during the synthesis of the phase. Several quasibinary Bi-rich oxides have been described exhibiting moderate melting temperature, which can be tricky for the solid-state preparation of [Bi1-xCaO2](2)[CoO2](1.7) (moreover which melts incongruently). Therefore, it is very important to map the phase evolution in the context of the precursor used and final thermoelectric properties. Such a study has not been described in literature for [Bi1-xCaO2](2)[CoO2](1.7) yet. Two precursors were prepared using a solid state reaction and a sol-gel process and their phase evolution within 4-step calcination was observed. Then, final samples were sintered ending with either fast or slow cooling. The phase composition, microstructure and thermoelectric characteristics of the final samples are presented. The results show that the phase and microstructure evolution differs from the one published for the BiSrCoO structure analogue. The thermoelectric characteristics varied depending on the used precursors.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000777830500005

However, because of the inert nature of nitrogen, current attempts at synthesizing ammonia under aqueous conditions result in low selectivity and yield rates. The poor electrocatalytic performance is mainly attributed to competing hydrogen evolution, underexposed active sites, inadequate electrode contact, and poor stabilization/destabilization of key reaction intermediates. Herein, we present a catalyst composed of MoO2 with surface vacancies dispersed over conductive carbon nanowires that mitigates these obstacles for NRR by providing a high surface area with stable catalytic sites and an underlying conductive support, where a variety of X-ray spectroscopy techniques are used to characterize the MoO2 catalyst. This uniquely engineered catalyst exhibits exceptional Faradaic efficiencies of over 30% and yields of 21.2 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) at a low potential of -0.1 V vs RHE under ambient aqueous conditions.									22	2	0	0	0	0	22			2380-8195			WOS:000580586400017

During the ORR, the O-2* and O* intermediates principally combine with protons to form OOH* and OH* species, respectively, which are the proton-coupled electron transfer processes. Unfortunately, under alkaline conditions, the protons are essentially generated from the sluggish water dissociation process, which unavoidably limits the ORR kinetics. Herein, we design and synthesize a nitrogen-doped hierarchically porous carbon with homogeneously distributed ultrafine alpha-MoC nanoparticles (alpha-MoC/NHPC) as a model electrocatalyst. Theoretical investigations unveil that alpha-MoC on NHPC could efficiently reduce the energy barrier of the water dissociation process to generate protons, eventually promoting the proton-coupled ORR kinetics. In a 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution, alpha-MoC/NHPC exhibits excellent ORR performance with a high half-wave potential of 0.88 V (vs.reversible hydrogen electrode), which outperforms those for NHPC and commercial Pt/C. Moreover, as the air electrode in a zinc-air battery, alpha-MoC/NHPC presents a large peak power density of 200.3 mW cm(-2)and long-term stability. Thereby, our approach to engineering proton-feeding centers paves a new avenue towards the understanding of ORR kinetics and the development of high-performance ORR electrocatalysts.									54	5	0	0	4	0	55			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000570224500007

This one-pot coreduction colloidal synthesis results in a monodisperse population of single-crystal nanoparticles of rhombic dodecahedral morphology with Pt-enriched edges and compositions close to Pt1Ni2. We use nanoscale 3D compositional analysis to reveal for the first time that oleylamine (OAm)-aging of the rhombic dodecahedral Pt1Ni2 particles results in Ni leaching from surface facets, producing aged particles with concave faceting, an exceptionally high surface area, and a composition of Pt2Ni1. We show that the modified atomic nanostructures catalytically outperform the original PtNi rhombic dodecahedral particles by more than two-fold and also yield improved cycling durability. Their functionality for the ORR far exceeds commercially available Pt/C nanoparticle electrocatalysts, both in terms of mass-specific activities (up to a 25-fold increase) and intrinsic area-specific activities (up to a 27-fold increase).									17	1	0	0	2	0	18			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000651773600038	33899489

Over the last decades, advancements in manufacturing technology, computational tools, and synthesis techniques have led to a range of sophisticated electrocatalysts, mostly based on expensive platinum group metals. To further improve their design, and to reduce overall cost, inspiration can be derived from nature on multiple levels, considering nature's efficient, hierarchical structures that are intrinsically scaling, as well as biological catalysts that catalyze the same reactions as in electrochemical devices. In this review, we introduce the concept of nature-inspired chemical engineering (NICE), contrasting it to the narrow sense in which biomimetics is often applied, namely copying isolated features of biological organisms irrespective of the different context. In contrast, NICE provides a systematic design methodology to solve engineering problems, based on the fundamental understanding of mechanisms that underpin desired properties, but also adapting them to the context of engineering applications. The scope of the NICE approach is demonstrated via this comparative state-of-the-art review, providing examples of bio-inspired electrocatalysts for key energy conversion reactions and nature-inspired electrochemical devices.									46	1	0	0	3	0	46			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000537849300005	32239067	
J	Zheng, Zexiao; Man, Justin H K; Lo, Irene M C								Integrating Reactive Chlorine Species Generation with H2 Evolution in a Multifunctional Photoelectrochemical System for Low Operational Carbon Emissions Saline Sewage Treatment.								Environmental science & technology											10.1021/acs.est.2c04139				2022-Nov-03	2022	Conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) suffer from high carbon emissions and are inefficient in removing emerging organic pollutants (EOPs). Consequently, we have developed a low operational carbon emissions multifunctional photoelectrochemical (PEC) system for saline sewage treatment to simultaneously remove organic pollutants, ammonia, and bacteria, coupled with H2 evolution. A reduced BiVO4 (r-BiVO4) photoanode with enhanced PEC properties, ascribed to constructing sufficient oxygen vacancies and V4+ species, was synthesized for the aforementioned technique. The PEC/r-BiVO4 process could treat saline sewage to meet local WWTPs' discharge standard in 40 min at 2.0 V vs Ag/AgCl and completely degrade carbamazepine (one of EOPs), coupled with 633 mumol of H2 production; 93.29% reduction in operational carbon emissions and 77.82% decrease in direct emissions were achieved by the PEC/r-BiVO4 process compared with large-scale WWTPs, attributed to the restrained generation of CH4 and N2O. The PEC system activated chloride ions in sewage to generate numerous reactive chlorine species and facilitate OH production, promoting contaminants removal. The PEC system exhibited operational feasibility at varying pH and total suspended solids concentrations and has outstanding reusability and stability, confirming its promising practical potential. This study proposed a novel PEC reaction for reducing operational carbon emissions from saline sewage treatment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1520-5851		MEDLINE:36326170	36326170

Herein, for the first time, we report that readily available stainless steel can be transformed to competent electrocatalysts for both H-2 and O-2 evolution reactions (HER and OER, respectively) after facile surface modification. Specifically, our sulfurized stainless steel foil (SSFS) could achieve a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 136 and 262 mV for HER and OER, respectively, in 1.0 M KOH. When SSFS served as the electrocatalysts for both the cathode and the anode, an overall water splitting current density of 10 mA cm' was obtained at 1.64 V with robust durability. Such a superior performance can rival those of many recently reported water splitting catalysts that consist of expensive elements, contain high cost supports, or require sophisticated synthesis. In addition, excellent water splitting activity was also achieved by SSFS in neutral media, largely expanding its working conditions. Finally, we further demonstrated that analogous phosphorization and nitridation treatments also could substantially enhance the electrocatalytic performance of stainless steel for water splitting, suggesting the great versatility of our surface modification strategy.									60	4	0	0	2	0	61			2168-0485			WOS:000402950000034

This is the first report of fluid inclusions containing major amounts of N-2 in mantle xenoliths. The nitrogen-rich fluid inclusions predate at least one generation of nitrogen-free carbon dioxide inclusions; textural evidence indicates that the inclusions were trapped within the upper mantle. Some of the nitrogen-rich fluid inclusions are intimately associated with solid inclusions of spinel.The nitrogen-rich was most likely produced in-situ, by oxidation-dehydration reactions destabilizing ammonium-bearing silicate minerals (phlogopite, amphibole), increasing oxygen fugacity or, possibly, increasing temperature of the mantle. This process could be related to an event of CO2 and silicate melt injection at 6-8 kbar (Neumann et al., in press), or to some earlier event in the evolution of the mantle beneath Lanzarote. The existence of a N-2-rich fluid phase in at least some mantle litholoy(ies) at certain conditions is demonstrated by these data. This discovery has consequences for the understanding of the evolution of the mantle below the Canary Islands, as well as for the global nitrogen budget.									51	3	0	0	2	0	52			0010-7999			WOS:A1995RB41800002

Advanced trimetallic Pt-based electrocatalysts have contributed to their catalytic performance and stability. In this work, we propose and analyse a novel quaternary octahedral (oh-)Pt nanoalloy concept with two distinct metals serving as stabilizing surface dopants. An efficient solvothermal one-pot strategy was developed for the preparation of shape-controlled oh-PtNi catalysts doped with Rh and Mo in its surface. The as-prepared quaternary octahedral PtNi(RhMo) catalysts showed exceptionally high ORR performance accompanied by improved activity and shape integrity after stability tests compared to previously reported bi- and tri-metallic systems. Synthesis, performance characteristics and degradation behaviour are investigated targeting deeper understanding for catalyst system improvement strategies. A number of different operando and on-line analysis techniques were employed to monitor the structural and elemental evolution, including identical location scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (IL-STEM-EDX), operando wide angle X-ray spectroscopy (WAXS), and on-line scanning flow cell inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SFC-ICP-MS). Our studies show that doping PtNi octahedral catalysts with small amounts of Rh and Mo suppresses detrimental Pt diffusion and thus offers an attractive new family of shaped Pt alloy catalysts for deployment in PEMFC cathode layers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000835598500001	36093024

The evaluation of rutile-, anatase-, and rutile-anatase TiO2 catalysts, exhibiting the variable specific surface areas, revealed that anatase phase is also active in this reaction. Nonetheless, in contrast to photocatalytic processes in which anatase is typically more active than rutile, rutile exhibits ca. 2-5 times higher intrinsic rates of HBr oxidation than anatase. Thereby, the apparent activation energies and reaction orders with respect to HBr, O2, and H2O display similar values for the two polymorphs. The activity differences were rationalized by density functional theory analysis, which showed that HBr oxidation follows a similar defect-driven mechanism over the most stable rutile (110) and anatase (101) surfaces. Herein, HBr activates the catalyst through a self-doping mechanism that involves the substitution of surface oxygen by bromine with the concomitant reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ centers. This forms a defect level that is placed in the band gap and allows for the O2 activation on the catalyst surface. While the HBr adsorption and H2O desorption display a similar energy profiles on both polymorphs, the O2 activation and Br2 evolution are more facile over rutile compared to anatase surface due to shorter distances between the coordinatively unsaturated Ticus sites and easier reduction of Ti4+ centers upon product desorption, respectively.									3	0	0	0	1	1	3			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000648646100008

A first-order dependence of the rate on both P(N2O) and the concentration of [Rh2(CO)4Cl2] was established. The activation parameters DELTA-H-double-ended dagger and DELTA-S-double-ended dagger obtained from an Eyring plot are 59.0 kJ mol-1 and -149.4 J K-1 mol-1 respectively. During the course of catalysis [Rh2(CO)4Cl2] was mainly reduced to [Rh(CO)4]-. Two other rhodium species [Rh4(CO)11]2- and [Rh4(CO)11(N2O)].3- were also detected by ultraviolet-visible and EPR spectroscopies, respectively. The reaction of [Rh(CO)4]- with N2O yielding N2 and CO2 simultaneously is believed to be the process responsible for the product formation. Isotopic labelling studies suggest that a direct oxygen transfer from N2O to CO takes place in the observed catalysis. No reaction of [Rh(CO)4]- with N2O and no catalysis occurs if [Rh4(CO)11]2- is completely absent from the solution. A catalytic cycle including an electron transfer between [Rh(CO)4]- and N2O to give N2O.-, the trapping of this radical by [Rh4(CO)11]2- to form [Rh4(CO)11(N2O)].3- and the evolution of CO2 and N2 from the latter radical species is proposed to account for the observed catalysis.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			0300-9246			WOS:A1991GB33400011

We demonstrate that, by formation of an ordered local structure both in Ni oxide and Pd regions, the ORR performance of such an NC can be substantially enhanced eightfold as compared to that of NiOx/Pd nanocomposites (control sample) without a local ordering structure. By cross-referencing results of physical and electrochemical inspections, we revealed that the control sample has a complex cluster-in-cluster structure of Ni oxides/NiPd alloy/Pd nanocrystals when Ni ions are deposited on the carbon support (acid-treated carbon nanotubes) at 25 degrees C and then turns to a highly mismatched Pd to NiO2 epitaxial structure by increasing the deposition temperature to 70 degrees C. In this event, a strong lattice mismatch and electronegative difference preserve the metallic characteristics of Pd. Such a scenario reduces the energy barrier and kinetics for O-2-splitting, therefore boosting the ORR activity. With such a unique structure, the mass activity (MA) is 231.2 mA mg(-1) and specific activity is 0.492 mA cm(-2) for the NiO2/Pd epitaxial structure. Those properties are 3.5- and 2-times improved as compared to that of commercial Johnson Matthey [J.M.-Pt/C (20 wt % Pt)], which shines light on Ni-based catalysts to be potential candidates against expensive and limited Pt-based catalysts in fuel-cell applications.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000510529400006

Biofilm is closely related to the occurrence of microbiologically influenced corrosion, and its structural composition and formation process have a great influence on the type and rate of corrosion reaction of metals. Due to the complexity of microbial activities and the lack of in-depth understanding of the interaction between biofilm and metal interface, the mechanism of microbiologically influenced corrosion is still unclear. Based on this, the mechanism of microbiologically influenced corrosion was discussed from the perspective of biofilm. The common bacteria that cause corrosion of materials, such as sulfate-reducing bacteria,sulfide-oxidising bacteria, iron-oxidizing bacteria, nitrate-reducing bacteria and other corrosive bacteria, were introduced, and their corrosion mechanisms were summarized. The characteristics, formation steps and dynamic evolution with time and external environment of the biofilm were comprehensively discussed. The factors affecting the formation and development of biofilms were emphatically discussed, including material factor and environmental factors, such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, Cl~-, Fe~(2+), flow velocity, nutrient media and magnetic field. Finally, considering the complexity of external factors,the problems in the process of biofilm research were expounded, and the importance of rational design of experimental schemes in the process of simulating biological environment was prospected.			自然界中,微生物常常附着在材料表面形成生物膜,影响金属表面的电化学过程,从而诱发微生物腐蚀。生物膜与微生物腐蚀的发生密切相关,其结构组成、成膜过程对金属的腐蚀反应类型与速率有着很大的影响。由于微生物活动的复杂性以及缺乏生物膜与金属界面之间交互作用的深刻认识,微生物腐蚀的发生和发展机制尚不清晰。基于此,从生物膜的角度阐述了金属微生物腐蚀的作用机制。介绍了易引起材料腐蚀的常见菌种,如硫酸盐还原菌、硫氧化菌、铁氧化菌、硝酸盐还原菌及其他腐蚀菌,并对它们的腐蚀机理进行了概述。综合论述了生物膜的特征、生成步骤,以及它是如何随时间和外部环境进行动态演变的。着重讨论了影响生物膜生成和发展的因素,包括材料因素以及环境因素,如温度、溶解氧、pH值、 Cl~-、Fe~(2+)、水体流速、营养介质、磁场。最后,针对外界影响因素的复杂性,阐述了生物膜研究过程中存在的问题,同时对模拟生物环境过程中合理设计实验方案的重要性进行了展望。						1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1001-3660			CSCD:6625668

Yet, synthesis of well-defined yolk-shell structures with controllable composition remains a major challenge. Here, we report a general method to fabricate Au NP @ Ni(OH)(2) yolk-shell NPs. Au cores with various diameters and shapes can be successfully encapsulated into the Ni(OH)(2) shells by a similar approach. When the diameter of the core Au NPs changed from similar to 15 to similar to 90 nm, the size of the yolk-shell NPs accordingly grew from similar to 110 to similar to 380 nm, however, the shell thickness of the final yolk-shell NPs is in the narrow range of 18-20 nm. The synergistic contribution from both Au and Ni(OH)(2) has endowed the yolk-shell heterostructure with enhanced catalytic activity. As shown in the oxygen-evolution reactions (OER) tests, the OER activity of Au NP @ Ni(OH)(2) yolk-shell NPs is 8.7 and 86-fold higher than that of hollow Ni(OH)(2) NPs alone and Au NP @C (5%) (Au NPs (5%) mixed with Carbon Black), respectively. In general, our method provides a simple and novel strategy towards the fabrication of yolk-shell structures with superior catalytic activity for OER.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000530670200031

In this work, a Ni-Fe Prussian blue analogue is grown on MOF-Ni by two steps. First, carnation-shaped MOF-Ni is directly grown on the nickel foam. Second, nanocube-like Prussian blue analogue is grown on a MOF-Ni template. After phosphating reaction in a tube furnace, Ni2P/Fe2P (denoted as MNPBA-P) is obtained. MNPBA-P can still maintain the initial structure of nanocubes on a carnation-shaped MOF-Ni, which causes it to have better conductivity and larger electrochemical active surface area. As a bifunctional catalyst, MNPBA-P has a good performance in the catalytic reaction of cathode and anode. It is worth noting that when 0.5 M urea was added to the electrolyte, the high anode overpotential is greatly improved. Compared with overall water-splitting, MNPBA-P assembled into an electrolyzer requires smaller cell voltage in urea electrolysis. MNPBA-P parallel to MNPBA-P electrolyzer only needs 1.50 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2) in urea electrolyte and has a good stability for 12 h.									30	0	0	0	0	0	30			2168-0485			WOS:000586722300025		
C	Aita, CR						Sudarshan, TS; Jeandin, M; Khor, KA		Reactive sputter deposition of ceramic oxide nanolaminates: Zirconia-alumina and zirconia-yttria model systems								SURFACE MODIFICATION TECHNOLOGIES XI								468	479						1998	1998	We review the growth of ceramic nanolaminate films by reactive sputter deposition. We investigate phase formation in nanolaminates with the same nominal architecture but with different chemical constituents. Two model systems, zirconia-alumina and zirconia-yttria, allow us to compare the effects of chemical reactivity between constituents at their interface. In zirconia-alumina nanolaminates, each component is a separate entity and their interface is incoherent. Phase evolution in zirconia layers of decreasing thickness is predicted by the finite crystal size effect. Tetragonal zirconia is produced in layers whose thickness is less than the critical thickness for stabilization of monoclinic zirconia, the STP phase. The amorphous structure of alumina is a consequence of its structural flexibility. Overall morphological roughness of the film arises from the polycrystalline nature of the zirconia layers. In zirconia-yttria nanolaminates, an interfacial reaction between components completely obliterates yttria as a separate entity. The reaction product, cubic zirconia-yttria, forms needle-like crystallites and accentuates the overall morphological roughness due to the polycrystalline nature of the deposit. As zirconia layer thickness increases, monoclinic zirconia is produced along with interfacial cubic zirconia-yttria. This research clearly demonstrates the ability to form interfacial oxide solid solutions at low temperature in a system in which the bulk equilibrium phase diagram predicts reaction between oxide components. Thus, thin films consisting entirely of interface reaction products can be fabricated if the bilayer spacing is small enough.					11th International Conference on Surface Modification Technologies11th International Conference on Surface Modification Technologies	SEP 08-10, 1997SEP 08-10, 1997	Soc Francaise Met & Materiaux; Federat European Mat Soc; Inst Mat, London; Minerals, Met & Mat Soc; ASM IntSoc Francaise Met & Materiaux; Federat European Mat Soc; Inst Mat, London; Minerals, Met & Mat Soc; ASM Int	PARIS, FRANCEPARIS, FRANCE	0	0	0		0	0	0					1-86125-055-X	WOS:000081833400055

Herein, we present a dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D3) insight into HER activity on the (111), (110), (001), and (100) surfaces of metallic nickel nitride (Ni3N). A combination of water and hydrogen adsorption was used to model the electrode interactions within the water splitting cell. Surface energies were used to characterise the stabilities of the Ni3N surfaces, along with adsorption energies to determine preferable sites for adsorbate interactions. The surface stability order was found to be (111) < (100) < (001) < (110), with calculated surface energies of 2.10, 2.27, 2.37, and 2.38 Jm(-2), respectively. Water adsorption was found to be exothermic at all surfaces, and most favourable on the (111) surface, with E-ads = -0.79 eV, followed closely by the (100), (110), and (001) surfaces at -0.66, -0.65, and -0.56 eV, respectively. The water splitting reaction was investigated at each surface to determine the rate determining Volmer step and the activation energies (E-a) for alkaline HER, which has thus far not been studied in detail for Ni3N. The E-a values for water splitting on the Ni3N surfaces were predicted in the order (001) < (111) < (110) < (100), which were 0.17, 0.73, 1.11, and 1.60 eV, respectively, overall showing the (001) surface to be most active for the Volmer step of water dissociation. Active hydrogen adsorption sites are also presented for acidic HER, evaluated through the Delta G(H) descriptor. The (110) surface was shown to have an extremely active Ni-N bridging site with Delta G(H) = -0.05 eV.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2073-4344		WOS:000665498300001

However, the effect of the structural evolution of ionomer binder on the micromorphology and catalytic activity of CL is yet to be clarified. In this study, pyrrolidinum and quaternary ammonium cations are attached to the polyphenylene oxide (PPO) backbone through flexible spacer units (five, seven, or nine carbon atoms) with different terminal alkyl groups. The Van der Waals force and electrostatic repulsion between the ionomer binder and catalyst are regulated through the flexible spacer units and terminal alkyl groups to alleviate the agglomeration of catalyst particles and acquire a high catalytic activity. To evaluate the electrochemical stability of the cationic groups, the alkaline stability of the ionomer binder is tested under a constant voltage to simulate the true operational environment of the fuel cells. The results reveal that the degradation of the cation groups of ionomer binder is accelerated under a constant voltage condition. This phenomenon in neglect earlier, may serve as a useful reference for the synthesis and performance enhancement of ionomer binders.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8				2198-3844		WOS:000680068600001	34339101

Here, we synthesized Ag/La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta, (Ag/LSC) composites by decorating LSC with Ag using the electroless technique. As a result, the LSC was homogenously overlaid with Ag nanoparticles. The derived Ag/LSC composites possessed a relatively higher specific surface area than pure LSC and Ag. The Co-O-Ag bonds in the composites contribute substantial electrons transferred from Ag to Co element, resulting in the unique electronic structures and strong electronic interaction between Ag and LSC. The significant improvements of ORR activity in alkaline solution at room temperature can be observed in Ag/LSC composites compared to the pure Ag and LSC. The composites with optimal Ag loading (50 wt%) showed best ORR activity among all the composites according to the half-wave potential and diffusion limiting current density. The presented strategy of silver surface modification via electroless process can provide effective routes for designing high performance metal oxide (e.g. perovskite) composite electrocatalysts.

The sensor was constructed using yttria-stabilized zirconia as the oxygen ion conductor, silver sulfate based salts as the auxiliary phase, a silver sensing electrode and a platinum reference electrode. When sulfur dioxide was detected, the potential of the sensing electrode changed to negative with the new working mechanism. The 90% response time of the sensor to 100 ppm SO2 was ca. 40 s at 600 degrees C, and the electromotive force (EMF) value obtained was perfectly Linear to the logarithm of SO2 concentration over a wide range (1 to 1000 ppm). The Nernst's slope corresponded exactly to the theoretical value based on a two-electron electrochemical reaction. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The adsorption state of surface species is the key factor in modulating the conversion of functional groups, which is correspondingly determined by the uniformity of active sites. However, the non-identical number of metal atoms, geometric shape, and morphology of conventional nanometer-sized metal particles/clusters normally lead to the non-uniform active sites with diverse geometric configurations and local coordination environments, which causes the distinct adsorption states of surface species. Hence, it is highly desired to modulate the homogeneity of the active sites so that the catalytic transformations can be better confined to the desired direction. In this review, the construction strategies and characterization techniques of the uniform active sites that are atomically dispersed on various supports are examined. In particular, their unique behavior in boosting the catalytic performance in various chemical transformations is discussed, including selective hydrogenation, selective oxidation, Suzuki coupling, and other catalytic reactions. In addition, the dynamic evolution of the active sites under reaction conditions and the industrial utilization of the single-atom catalysts are highlighted. Finally, the current challenges and frontiers are identified, and the perspectives on this flourishing field is provided.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2198-3844		WOS:000822320200001	35808964

This surface was electrochemically characterised for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by cathodic polarisation (at different pH); and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). The kinetics of HER on this coated surface was then compared with that on pristine (uncoated) Mg, pristine Fe, coated Fe and Mg-Fe alloy surfaces. The kinetics of the HER (inferred from both the electrochemical tests) on the Mg (OH)(2) covered surface was significantly higher than that on the pristine Mg surface. The HER kinetics were also found to be the highest in a pH 11 solution, implying that conditions which favour Mg(OH)(2) precipitation enhance the HER. A model was proposed relating the enhanced HER upon the Mg(OH)(2) covered surface to the enhanced self-dissociation of water, which arises from the disruption of the local ionic equilibrium, as dissolved Mg2+ ions undergo precipitation forming Mg(OH)(2) under supersaturated conditions. This result is also in agreement with recent DFT-based calculations by other researchers on hydroxyl covered Mg surfaces (akin to Mg(OH)(2) covered Mg surfaces) activating the self-dissociation of water.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with well-defined pore structures and various metal sources provide feasible platforms for the design of efficient electrocatalysts. However, MOFs as crystalline materials are mostly in crystal or powder form, which would hinder their practical application. Herein, polyoxometalate-based MOFs (POMOFs) were synthesized on carbon cloth (CC) through a facile and general solid-phase hot-pressing method for the first time. The thus-obtained POMOFs/CC can be converted into three phase bimetallic phosphides coated with porous carbon on CC through a phosphidation process, show high electrocatalytic stability over a wide pH range (pH, 0-14) and possess excellent HER performance with low overpotential (e.g., 90.5 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH). Moreover, the POMOFs/CC derived phosphides present high selectivity for H-2 production (nearly 100% faradaic efficiency) and ultra-low charge-transfer resistance (0.96 Omega) in alkaline medium, which hold promise for practical applications. This work provides a powerful strategy for the facile production of fast nucleating MOF-derived electrodes with potential for industrial-scale application in energy storage and conversion.									34	3	0	0	0	0	34			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000456724800026

We present a novel type II heterojunction semiconductor based on mixed WS2 and MoS2 nanosheets on WO3 nanoflakes hydrothermally grown on highly porous W skeletons. The chemically exfoliated transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) sheets with submicrometric lateral sizes were deposited on the surface of WO3 nanoflakes by the electrophoretic technique to fabricate a staggered gap heterojunction. The photoanode exhibited an impressive current density of 14.9 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 VRHE which comprised-1.7 mA cm(-2) photocurrent under 100 mW cm(-2) simulated sunlight. Co-deposition of MoS2 and WS2 sheets on WO3 nanoflakes improved the current density of porous W\WO3 electrodes by about 340%, while only about 36% improvement is achieved by deposition of single TMD (WO3\MoS2 or WO3\WS2) demonstrating the synergetic effects of TMDs. The high stability of the photoanode in highly acidic media is shown. The synergetic effects of TMDs on active sites, charge transfer resistance, and charge transport properties are elaborated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Mott-Schottky analyses. The composite electrode has a great potential to be used for diverse electrochemical applications including water splitting. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The particle densities were in the order of 10(9)cm(-2); the radius of the deposited Pd NPs (2-20nm) was proportional to the 1/3 power of the growth pulse duration (t(g)(1/3)). The open-circuit potential measured during potentiodynamic potential scans of hydrogen evolution/oxidation (HER/HOR) at Pd/HOPG electrodes (average radii of Pd NPs larger than 8nm) was more negative than at a bulk Pd electrode; this was caused by the different phases of palladium hydride (PdHx) formed in the latter case. Pd/HOPG samples showed an increased specific current density with decreasing particle size in HER. The activity of Pd NPs for HER is primarily affected by the absorbed-hydrogen-atom content in the Pd lattice. The electrochemical activity of Pd NPs for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic media decreased for smaller particle sizes. The stability of the Pd NPs was significantly influenced by the pH of the electrolyte. Pd NPs had a higher dissolution rate in solution with lower pH. The degeneration mechanisms seen for Pd NPs on HOPG were the dissolution of metal atoms, detachment of particles, and particle agglomeration. Corrosion of the graphite substrate after the potential cycles was also observed in AFM images.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			2196-0216			WOS:000353063900011

From the chemistry point of view, a typical crystalline cellulose is composed of linear chains of hundreds of beta-1,4-linker glucose units. Therefore, inter and intra hydrogen bonding interactions play a decisive role of the structure-property relationship of cellulose based materials. Despite research progress from past decades, the fundamental mechanism of how cellulose structure transforms under pyrolysis conditions and the practical guideline of how cellulose properties are fined tuned accordingly are still incomplete. In this work, a series of reactive molecular dynamics calculations has been designed to reveal the structural evolution of crystalline cellulose under pyrolysis treatments. Through the detailed analysis of cellulose configuration change, hydrogen bonding network variation, reaction and redistribution of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen elements, and Young's modulus, a molecule level insight of crystalline cellulose and its structural evolution under pyrolysis conditions has been constructed via reactive molecular dynamics simulations. We anticipate those theoretical results could effectively promote the design, the manufacture, and the optimization of cellulose based materials for relevant emerging applications.

The model allows for time-varying sedimentation rate, porosity, chemical diffusivity, and temperature-dependent O-18 fractionation factors. Reaction is modeled as solution-precipitation of calcite in the carbonate sediment and as modified solution-precipitation (basalt dissolves, smectite precipitates) in the basalt layer. Generic models, using input parameters that are typical of those measured in DSDP-ODP cores, and constant sedimentation rates, illustrate the behavior of the system sufficiently well to allow first-order effects to be discerned that have important implications for paleotemperature and ocean floor weathering studies.The solution-precipitation reactions allow oxygen to be exchanged between the low-delta-O-18 basalt layer and the high-delta-O-18 carbonate sediment through the medium of the pore fluids. This results in delta-O-18 increasing upwards in the basalt and decreasing downwards in the sediment. Pore fluid delta-O-18 values decrease with depth from zero to values of -1 to -3 parts per thousand at the basalt-sediment interface, and to values of -7 to -15 parts per thousand, within the basalt. Because reaction rates are slow relative to diffusion in the pore fluid, high-frequency delta-O-18 variations in the solid are preserved indefinitely, but the amplitude of the variations decreases as e(-Rt) where R is the reaction rate (fraction reacted per unit time). The results suggest that the diagenetic shifts of the delta-O-18 values of benthic and high-latitude planktonic foraminifera samples younger than Oligocene age are typically negligible. For samples older than 50 Ma, diagenetic effects are typically significant, and generally cause estimates of bottom and high-latitude surface ocean temperatures in the Cretaceous and early Tertiary to be too high. On the other hand, the model suggests that diagenesis will shift the delta-O-18 values of low-latitude planktonic foraminifera to higher values, and that paleotemperature estimates of low-latitude surface waters, particularly in the Eocene and Oligocene, may be too low. Using a synthetic delta-O-18 record for DSDP Site 167, we demonstrate how numerical models can be used to correct specific measured records for diagenesis. This approach could provide a means of extracting paleotemperature information from heavily altered Late Cretaceous and older samples, and for quantifying the subtle effects of diagenesis on the delta-O-18 record at all sites.									47	1	0	0	9	0	48			0012-821X			WOS:A1992JH92200007

By inspecting these trends, we obtain precious information on stellar nucleosynthesis, the stellar mass spectrum, the timescale of structure formation, the efficiency of star formation, as well as any inward or outward flows of gas. In this paper, we analyse recent determinations of carbon-to-iron and carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratios in different environments (the Milky Way and elliptical galaxies), using our latest chemical evolution models that implement up-to-date stellar yields and rely on the tight constraints provided by asteroseismic stellar ages, whenever available. A scenario where most carbon is produced by rotating massive stars, with yields largely dependent on the metallicity of the parent proto-star clouds, allowed us to simultaneously fit the high-quality data available for the local Galactic components (thick and thin discs) and for microlensed dwarf stars in the Galactic bulge, as well as the abundance ratios inferred for massive elliptical galaxies. Nevertheless, more efforts are needed from both observers and theoreticians in order to base these conclusions on firmer ground.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000549961400011

Herein, a hierarchical core-shell ORR catalyst (Co2N/CoP@PNCNTs) is developed by embedding cobalt phosphides and/or cobalt nitrides as the core into N, P-doped carbon nanotubes (PNCNTs) as the shell via one-step carbonization, nitridation, and phosphorization of pyrolyzing Co-MOF precursor. The globally N, P-doped structure of Co2N/CoP@PNCNTs demonstrates an outstanding electrocatalytic activity in the alkaline solution with the onset and half-wave potentials of 1.07 and 0.85 V respectively. Moreover, a Zn-air battery assembled from Co2N/CoP@PNCNTs as the air cathode delivers an open circuit potential of 1.49 V, a maximum power density of 151.1 mW cm(-2) and a specific capacity of 823.8 mAh kg(-1). It is reflected that Co2N/CoP@PNCNTs provides a long-term durability with a slight decline of 15 h in the chronoamperometry measurement and an excellent charge-discharge stability with negligible voltage decay for 150 h at 10 mA cm(-2) in Zn-air batteries. The results reveal that Co2N/CoP@PNCNTs has superiority over most Co-N-x-C or CoxP@C catalysts reported so far.

In this work, Co-Mo phosphide nanosheets with the adjustable ratio of Co and Mo were fabricated on carbon cloth by a facile hydrothermal-annealing method. Owing to the unique nanostructures, abundant active surfaces and small resistance were achieved. Excellent electrocatalytic performances are obtained, such as the small overpotential of similar to 67.3 mV to realize a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 69.9 mV dec(-1). Rapid recovery of the current response under multistep chronoamperometry is realized and excellent stability retained after the CV test for 2000 cycles. The change of electronic states of different elements was carefully studied which suggested the optimal electrochemical performance can be realized by tuning phosphorous and metal interactions.

J	Say, WC; Tsai, YY								Surface characterization of cast Ti-6Al-4V in hydrofluoric-nitric pickling solutions								SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY				176	3			337	343		10.1016/S0257-8972(03)00747-3				JAN 15 2004	2004	Hydrofluoric acid offers a fast etching rate for removing 200 mum-thick alpha-cases from the surfaces of cast Ti-6Al-4V. The acid picks up hydrogen gas into substrate of the cast, which can be limited by introducing an oxidizing acid. This study proposes the optimal ratios of hydrofluoric/nitric acid as the pickling solutions. The cast Ti-6Al-4V in these solutions is monitored with chemical etching and electrochemical polarization. The mechanisms of etching procedures are initiated by generating oxygen vacancies that lead to several products from a series of quasi-chemical steps. The final product of the reactions may deduce as the form of H2TiF6 that is peeled out by the evolution of produced gases. Polarized curves are performed to illustrate passive behaviors of the alpha-case removed Ti-6Al-4V. The amounts of charge transference increase with increasing hydrofluoric acid concentrations. The newly formed passive film was estimated to be 20 nm in thickness with non-stoichiometric arrangements in the 4% HF electrolyte. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Herein, we propose a facile and cost-effective strategy to synthesize a ZrO2/doped-N carbon (ZrO2/NC) catalyst with high N and Zr contents (8.78 and 4.4 atom%, respectively). The ZrO2/NC catalyst exhibits comparable electrocatalytic activity with a half-wave potential of 0.815 V and better durability in the ORR compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The ORR proceeds via a 4e(-) transfer pathway under alkaline conditions in the presence of this catalyst. The excellent catalytic performance is attributed to the high densities of the active sites, namely, pyridinic-N, graphitic-N, and Zr. The high Brunner-Emmett-Teller surface area (787.4 m(2)/g) and an amorphous-crystal morphology of the ZrO2/NC catalyst favored the rapid mass transfer and exposed the active sites of the electrolyte and reactants. The strategy presented herein can be used for the large-scale production of metal-air batteries.

PsbO allows correct water splitting and oxygen evolution by stabilizing the reactions driven by the manganese cluster. Despite its important role, its structure and detailed functional mechanism are still unknown. In this article we propose a structural model based on fold recognition and molecular modeling. This model has additional support from a study of the distribution of characteristics of the PsbO sequence family, such as the distribution of conserved, apolar, tree-determinants, and correlated positions. Our threading results consistently showed PsbO as an all-beta (beta) protein, with two homologous beta domains of approximately 120 amino acids linked by a flexible Proline-Glycine-Glycine (PGG) motif. These features are compatible with a general elongated and flexible architecture, in which the two domains form a sandwich-type structure with Greek key topology. The first domain is predicted to include 8 to 9 beta -strands, the second domain 6 to 7 beta -strands. An Ig-like beta -sandwich structure was selected as a template to build the 3-D model. The second domain has, between the strands, long-loops rich in Pro and Gly that are difficult to model. One of these long loops includes a highly conserved region (between P148 and P174) and a short a-helix (between E181 and N188)). These regions are characteristic parts of PsbO and show that the second domain is not so similar to the template. Overall, the model was able to account for much of the experimental data reported by several authors, and it would allow the detection of key residues and regions that are proposed in this article as essential for the structure and function of PsbO.

Thus, they are considered one of the most potential next-generation energy storage devices. Nevertheless, the lithium (Li) dendrites at the anodic side and the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics at the cathodic side of Li-O-2 batteries greatly limit their practical applications. Herein, we put forward a dual-functional carbon nanofibrous skeleton decorated with Co nanoparticles and Co-N-x sites to ameliorate the electrochemical behavior of both anode and cathode in Li-O-2 batteries. The synergistic effect of Co nanoparticles and Co-N-x sites could convert carbon fibers from lithiophobic to lithiophilic, which is beneficial to decrease polarization and moderate the dendritic formation at the Li metal anode. Moreover, Co nanoparticles and Co-N-x sites as active sites can promote the ORR and OER processes (especially the OER process) at the cathodic side. Accordingly, Li-O-2 batteries composed of Co/CNF-750 cathodes and Co/CNF-750 interlayer-modified Li metal anodes displayed a low discharge-charge gap of 1.004 V and long cycle life of 160 cycles under a limited capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 200 mA g(-1). This work offers an effective strategy to simultaneously deal with barriers both in the O-2 cathode and Li anode for the application of Li-O-2 batteries.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000802558600001		
J	Kim, Jin-Woo; Yoo, Tae-Sic; Kim, Eung Soo; Yoon, Su-Jong								Smoothed particle hydrodynamics modeling and analysis of oxide reduction process for uranium oxides								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE				261						117974	10.1016/j.ces.2022.117974				NOV 2 2022	2022	A common kinetic feature for oxide reduction chemical/electrochemical processes is oxygen transport via a porous metallic layer, which has been considered as a rate-determining step for reducing uranium oxi-des to metallic uranium. Accounting this kinetic behavior must involve the resolution of the moving reac-tive interface between shrinking oxide and expanding metal phases. This study presents a numerical model using smoothed particles hydrodynamics (SPH) to effectively deal with the evolution of the shrink-ing core reaction interface and oxygen transport via mass transfer of lithium oxide (Li2O) species in mul-tiple mass transfer domains. We successfully validated the proposed model against a theoretical derivation for the oxide reduction process handling a shrinking oxide core with molten salt and metal ash medium on a simple planar geometry. Armed with successful validation results, the model examined a realistic reactant geometry to extend the arguments beyond the one-dimensional analyses, allowing the proposed model to apply to general application scenarios with multi-dimensional geometry. This study demonstrated that the proposed model could simulate and evaluate an arbitrary reaction basket design without iterative experimental trials, which is prohibitive for a scaled high-temperature molten salt study in an inert environment. The construct potentially provides not only deep insights on multiphysics behaviors governing the process dynamics but also a robust framework for evaluating and screening can-didate basket designs in the most cost-effective manner.

However, Ni dissolution deteriorates their catalytic activity and stability during the ORR. Here, we report a strategy that improves the ORR activity and stability of the PtNi octahedral nanoparticle catalyst through the incorporation of a novel dopant. Computational screening with seven different elements (Bi, In, Ru, Sn, Te, Zn, and Zr) suggests In as the most promising candidate based on the metal doping energy and the OH* adsorption energy. Consideration of the OH* coverage and Ni diffusion energy demonstrates the superior ORR activity and stability of the In-doped PtNi(111) structure. The calculation results were validated by synthesizing In-doped PtNi octahedral nanoparticles on a carbon support (In-PtNi/C). In-PtNi/C demonstrated excellent ORR performance outcomes (1.36 A mg(Pt)(-1) and 2.64 mA cm(-2)@0.9 V-RHE), which were 2.1 and 7.9 times higher in terms of the mass activity and 2.4 and 13.4 times higher in terms of the specific activity compared to PtNi/C and Pt/C, respectively. After 12k potential cycles, In-PtNi/C showed excellent stability with high Ni retention; 2.4 and 43% of Ni were lost from In-PtNi/C and PtNi/C, respectively. Computational and experimental investigation demonstrates that surface-doped In creates a new active site toward the ORR and blocks Ni diffusion to the surface by making Pt less oxophilic.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000753951600033

The influences of solution pH (3, 7 and 11) and the type of supporting electrolyte (0.05 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M NaCl) on the electrocatalytic activity of the three anodes were investigated. The anodes exhibited remarkably different behavior for BPA oxidation, due to their different surface morphology, oxygen evolution potential and ability in the hydroxyl radical generation. Both BDD and the modified SnO2-Sb anodes could degraded BPA effectively in 0.05 M Na2SO4 at pH 3 and 7. However, in 0.1 M NaCl, TiO2-NTs/SnO2-Sb-PTFE and Ti/SnO2-Sb/SnO2-Sb-CNT showed better electrocatalytic activity for BPA oxidation than BDD with less Cl loss and ClO3- generation. On the contrary, a considerable amount of chlorinated intermediates and polymer byproducts were observed with BDD, resulting in its ineffective TOC removal (46.8%). It indicates that the modified SnO2-Sb anodes are more environmentally benign for the treatment of wastewater containing chloride ion. LC-MS/MS and ion chromatography revealed the aromatic intermediates and aliphatic acids produced during BPA oxidation. Finally, the reaction pathways of BPA oxidation in Na2SO4 and NaCl supporting electrolytes are proposed. [All rights reserved Elsevier].									43	3	1	0	15	0	45			2213-3437			INSPEC:16514605

For comparison, Co3O4 nanoparticles were also deposited on multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Both the nitrogen-free platelet-type carbon nanofibers (pCNFs) and the nitrogen-containing analogue (N-pCNFs) exhibited better dispersion and higher amount of deposited Co3O4 nanoparticles compared to the MWCNTs. In addition, many individual Co3O4 nanoparticles were deposited separately on pCNF and N-pCNF, whereas aggregated deposition was commonplace on MWCNTs. The results indicated that the side wall of the pCNFs, which consisted of carbon edge planes, was the preferential nucleation site of Co3O4 nanoparticles rather than the basal planes of carbon that predominated the surface of the MWCNTs. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of the Co3O4/pCNF composite in 0.1 mol dm(-3) KOH solution was better than that of Co3O4/MWCNTs. The N-pCNF further enhanced the ORR activity of the Co3O4/pCNFs even though the dispersion and supported amount of Co3O4 nanoparticles were negligibly affected by the presence of the nitrogen species. Synergistic interactions of the Co3O4 nanoparticles with N-doped CNFs contributed to the increased ORR activity.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8				2046-2069		WOS:000457727800025	35518117

In this study, we report the design of a hierarchical carbon/metal nanostructure (Co@CNFs) with the combination of 0D cobalt metal nanoparticles, 1D carbon nanofibers, and 2D carbon nanosheets as a bifunctional oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) catalyst. The Co@CNF catalysts are prepared by using a facile approach of combining electrospinning, impregnation growth of ZIF-67 nanosheets, and high-temperature carbonization. Through rationally optimizing the synthesis conditions, including the chemical concentration and carbonization temperature, the optimal catalyst of Co@CNFs-50-800 features a hierarchical structure of continuous carbon nanofibers (CNFs)-anchored carbon nanosheets wrapping Co nanoparticles, which holds decent catalytic activities in term of a half-wave potential of 0.8 V for the ORR and a potential of 1.54 V for the OER at 10 mA cm(-2). A rechargeable Zn-air battery is set up using the catalyst as the air cathode, which exhibits a high specific capacity of 809 mAh g(-1) and a peak power density of 165.5 mW cm(-2), as well as a good durability up to 1000 charging-discharging cycles (>160 h), which is even better than the benchmark Pt/C+RuO2 catalyst. This study provides a rational strategy to design hierarchically nanostructural catalysts to boost the mass transportation and electron transfer of electrocatalytic reactions.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2196-0216			WOS:000632941200011

Nitrogen coordinated Fe or Co site atomically dispersed into carbons (M-N-C) containing bulk- and edge hosted M-N-4 coordination were prepared by using Fe-or Co doped metal-organic framework precursors, respectively, which were further studied as ideal model catalysts. Fe is intrinsically more active than Co in M-N4 for the reduction of CO2 to CO, in terms of a larger current density and a higher CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) (93% vs. 45%). First principle computations elucidated that the edge-hosted M-N2+2-C-8 moieties bridging two adjacent armchair-like graphitic layers is the active sites for the CO2RR They are much more active than previously proposed bulk-hosted M-N-4-C-10 moieties embedded compactly in a graphitic layer. During the CO2RR, when the dissociation of *COOH occurs on the M-N2+2-C-8, the metal atom is the site for the adsorption of *CO and the carbon atom with a dangling bond next to an adjacent N is the other active center to bond *OH In particular, on the Fe-N2+2-C-8 sites, the CO2RR is more favorable over the hydrogen evolution reaction, thus resulting in a remarkable FE.									315	25	0	0	11	0	319			2155-5435			WOS:000430154100056

A well-defined alpha-Keggin polyoxometalate, H5PV2Mo10O40, can be viewed as an analogue of discrete structure that reacts via the Mars van Krevelen mechanism both in solution and in the gas phase. Guided by previous experimental observations, we have studied the key intermediates on the reaction pathways of its reduction by various compounds using high-level DFT calculations. These redox reactions of polyoxometalates require protons, and thus such complexes were explicitly considered. First, the energetics of outer-sphere proton and electron transfer as well as coupled proton and electron transfer were calculated for seven substrates. This was followed by identification of possible key intermediates on the subsequent reaction pathways that feature displacement of the metal atom from the Keggin structure and coordinatively unsaturated sites on the H5PV2Mo10O40 surface. Such metal defects are favored at vanadium sites. For strong reducing agents the initial outer-sphere electron transfer, alone or possibly coupled with proton transfer, facilitates formation of metal defects. Subsequent coordination allows for formation of reactive ensembles on the catalyst surface, for which the selective oxygen-transfer step becomes feasible. Weak reducing agents do not facilitate defect formation by outer-sphere electron and/or proton transfers, and thus formation of metal defect structures prior to the substrate activation is suggested as an initial step. Calculated geometries and energies of metal defect structures support experimentally observed intermediates and demonstrate the complex nature of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.									48	2	0	0	5	0	49			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000313154200021	23210519

Although electrochemical water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen is extensively studied, it suffers from kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reactions at extreme pH conditions. In this work, we investigated the oxidation of soluble redox species as an alternative anodic reaction, the kinetics of which have highly reversible characteristics on various electrode surfaces. The redox potential can be readily tuned by the ligand upon the formation of metal complexes, which provides various voltage options to develop electrochemical devices. The facile kinetics lead to diffusion overpotential being a major contribution of the electrochemical performance. Near-neutral pH region was effectively chosen because it allows the versatile and safe operation with a reasonable voltage option. To overcome the diffusion issue, the solubility of redox species and the diffusion coefficient determined by temperature and the supporting buffer were considered. Fe2+/(3+)-(hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetic acid) (HEDTA) was identified as a suitable redox candidate due to its high solubility (>1 mol kg(-1)) in a near-neutral pH range from 4 to 6. In the optimized conditions with a malonate buffer, the diffusion-limiting current density could reach over 100 mA cm(-2) on a glassy carbon rotating disk electrode. The detailed insight presented in this paper will help to design an efficient electrochemical system for redox-mediated energy storage/conversion.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2168-0485			WOS:000463462100086

Graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) have attracted intensive focus due to their unique properties and impressive performance in challenging the widely accepted nitrogen-doped carbon materials in electrocatalytic fields. However, the relatively poor conductivity limits further improvement of g-C3N4-based electrocatalysts. Thus, this Review is primarily focused on recent progress in the functionalization of g-C3N4 materials for oxygen reduction and water splitting reactions. Especially, an innovative and in-depth understanding of g-C3N4 materials is presented by systematically summarizing the function of g-C3N4 materials, such as serving as active sites, coordination complexes, and supporter/protective coatings, in contributing to the catalytic performance. Finally, the main challenges and future perspectives of g-C3N4-based nanomaterials in electrocatalytic fields are also discussed. It should be noted that in the text we acknowledge that "many" (in fact, most) of the g-C3N4 materials have been polymeric amorphous phases within the C-N-H system. To avoid debate and confusion on the naming of previously reported "graphitic carbon nitride" materials in our Review, we decided to call all these of materials "g-C3N4" in accordance with previous reports.									102	6	0	0	11	0	102			2380-8195			WOS:000450374600022

Accounting this kinetic behavior must involve the resolution of the moving reactive interface between shrinking oxide and expanding metal phases. This study presents a numerical model using smoothed particles hydrodynamics (SPH) to effectively deal with the evolution of the shrinking core reaction interface and oxygen transport via mass transfer of lithium oxide (Li2O) species in multiple mass transfer domains. We successfully validated the proposed model against a theoretical derivation for the oxide reduction process handling a shrinking oxide core with molten salt and metal ash medium on a simple planar geometry. Armed with successful validation results, the model examined a realistic reactant geometry to extend the arguments beyond the one-dimensional analyses, allowing the proposed model to apply to general application scenarios with multi-dimensional geometry. This study demonstrated that the proposed model could simulate and evaluate an arbitrary reaction basket design without iterative experimental trials, which is prohibitive for a scaled high-temperature molten salt study in an inert environment. The construct potentially provides not only deep insights on multiphysics behaviors governing the process dynamics but also a robust framework for evaluating and screening candidate basket designs in the most cost-effective manner.

The RhO2 cocatalyst was loaded on the BiVO4 thin film photoanode by impregnation method, and the photoelectrochenucal performance of the BiVO4 photoanode with different RhO2 loadings was studied. RhO2 with grain size of 10-25 nm was uniformly loaded on the BiVO4 film with grain size of 100-250 nm and thickness of 400 nm. The BiVO4 photoanode with 1.65% RhO2 (mass percent) showed the best comprehensive performance, of which the visible-light photocurrent density reached 3.81 mA.cm(-2) under 1.23 V (vs. RHE) in 1.0 mol/ L Na2SO3 (pH8.5) electrolyte, which was 10.58 times higher than that of bare BiVO4. In the absence of any sacrificial agent, the photoanodes produced hydrogen and oxygen at the same time at the ratio of close to 2 : 1, and the oxygen production rate was 8.22 mu mol/(h.cm(2)). RhO2 loading effectively improved the surface water oxidation kinetics, so that photogenerated holes could undergo water oxidation reaction more quickly. Meanwhile, the photogenerated carrier recombination was inhibited, significantly improving the photoelectrocatalytic performance. In addition, since holes were more easily extracted from the surface of photoanode into electrolyte solution in the presence of RhO2 cocatalyst, reducing accumulation on the surface of the photoanode, the BiVO4/RhO2 (1.65%) photoanode achieved excellent stability for more than 10 h.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-324X			WOS:000841496500006

In this work, we report the synthesis of high-surface-area mesoporous networks of CoO NPs through a polymertemplating self-assembly method and demonstrate their potential application in the reductive detoxification of aqueous Cr(VI) solutions under UV and visible light irradiation. Electron microscopy images and N-2 adsorption measurements corroborate the presence of a porous network of interconnected CoO NPs (ca. 18 nm in size) with large internal surface area (up to 134 m(2) g(-1)) and narrow pore-size distribution (ca. 4.4-4.8 nm in diameter). Conjunction of optical absorption and electrochemical impendence spectroscopy results indicates that the band edge positions of constituent CoO NPs meet the electric potential requirements for reducing Cr(VI) and splitting water to oxygen. We show that mesoporous assemblies of hexagonal CoO NPs effectively overcome the kinetic barriers for the oxidation reaction, manifesting a remarkably photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction activity at acidic pH with an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 1.61% and 0.17% at wavelengths of 375 and 440 nm, respectively. We demonstrate that, apart from oxygen evolution reaction, photoconversion of harmful Cr(VI) into non-toxic Cr (III) involves also a hydroxyl radical-mediated oxidation process by intercepting oxidation products with on-line mass spectrometry and fluorescence spectroscopy in control catalytic experiments.									72	2	0	0	23	0	73			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000414109700062		
J	Wang, L; Haworth, DC; Turns, SR; Modest, MF				Modest, Michael F/F-7679-2010				Interactions among soot, thermal radiation, and NOx emissions in oxygen-enriched turbulent nonpremixed flames: a computational fluid dynamics modeling study								COMBUSTION AND FLAME				141	1-2			170	179		10.1016/j.combustflame.2004.12.015				APR 2005	2005	Many combustion applications benefit from the use of oxygen-enriched air or pure oxygen as oxidizer. Oxygen enrichment increases the flame temperature, promotes soot formation and oxidation, and c,an decrease pollutant emissions compared with hydrocarbon-air systems. Adequate and simultaneous accounting for soot, radiation, and pollutant emissions poses challenges in modeling of oxygen-enriched turbulent flames. Here a comprehensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed by integrating state-of-the-art models for detailed chemistry, soot formation and oxidation, and thermal radiation into a three-dimensional unstructured CFD code. Detailed hydrocarbon oxidation, soot, and NOx chemistry are represented using a mechanism that contains 122 chemical species and 677 elementary reactions. The soot model includes a detailed description of soot formation and oxidation, and employs the method of moments to describe the evolution of the soot particle size distribution. Two radiation models are implemented, one that accounts for nongray-gas properties and one that does not; both radiation models include self-absorption effects and treat soot radiation as gray. The model is applied to an oxygen-enriched, propane-fueled, turbulent, nonpremixed jet flame. Results show that soot and spectrally radiating gas-phase species are distributed separately in the flame, and this segregation of radiating media strongly affects the radiant heat flux, flame structure, flame temperature, and NOx emissions. Soot radiation decreases flame temperature and NOx emission substantially, especially in the flame-tip region. The effects of nongray-gas-phase radiation are important even in the presence of strong gray soot radiation and must be included to capture the correct distribution of radiative heat flux. Nongray-gas effects are stronger downstream than upstream and, therefore, are particularly important for the burnout of soot. Both soot radiation and nongray-gas radiation are required for accurate predictions of soot and NOx formation within and upstream of the flame zone. (c) 2005 The Combustion Institute.

J	Li, Wangcai; Wu, Yongjian; Chen, Mengyu; Dai, Peng; Jiang, Tongtong; Zhou, Sheng								Ultrathin nitrogen-doped defective carbon layer embedded with NiFe for solid zinc-air batteries								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				925						166658	10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166658				DEC 5 2022	2022	Developing a simple oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) bifunctional catalyst construction strategy for zinc-air batteries (ZABs) has been a major challenge. Therefore, this study synthesized an ultrathin nitrogen-doped defective carbon layer embedded with nickel-iron (NiFe) (ZGNiFe@ NG) by introducing zinc gluconate to the precursor. In situ generated NiFe nanoparticles facilitated the OER catalyzation kinetics process, nitrogen-doped graphene demonstrated a large specific surface area, providing more active sites to boost electron transfer and mechanical support for the NiFe nanoparticles. Additionally, the introduction of Zn ions can enrich carbon vacancies in the structure of composite catalyst, which is beneficial to the further improvement of catalytic activity. The investigations revealed that the obtained ZGNiFe@NG catalyst possessed a higher ORR half-wave potential of 0.81 V and a lower OER potential of 1.65 V of 10 mA cm-2, presenting a bifunctional catalytic activity toward ORR and OER than that of catalysts lacking the Zn ion precursor. Moreover, as expected, the fabricated solid-state flexible ZAB with ZGNiFe@NG catalyst delivered a high power density of 84.95 mW cm-2 at a current density of 112 mA cm-2 and could operate 65 h steadily. In summary, this work paves a way for designing a carbon matrix with dopants and defects to load NiFe nanoparticles as superior cathode materials of ZABs.

However, one of the major challenges is to improve the efficiency of involved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which requires stable and highly effective electrocatalysts that may work with air as O2 supplier. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a group of ultrathin 2D electrocatalysts (8.2 to 18.5 nm) from a new metal-organic framework (MOF) ([Co2(TCPP)(DABCO)], named NTU-70) that can be facilely prepared in large-scale. Compared with its block counterpart and other ultrathin electrocatalysts, Co@N-C700 exhibits superior ORR activity (E1/2 = 0.78 V) and outstanding durability, which originates from the synergistic effect of N-coordinated single Co atom outside Co cluster and ultrathin porous carbon support. Encouragingly, a rechargeable ZAB assembled with Co@N-C700 air cathode delivers a steady discharge voltage plateau of 1.22 V and a low discharge/charge polarization (0.80 V) within 240 h, outperforming Pt/C catalysts. The current strategy for finely design and synthesis of MOF-derived ultrathin electrocatalysts provides a prospect in developing metal-air batteries with a higher power density and may also pave the way for the feasible application of these ultrathin catalysts in energy conversion/storage devices.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664187700002

However, the sintering from the migration and aggregation of metal species during pyrolysis would compromise the catalytic activity or even lead to the deactivation of the catalyst. Herein, taking advantage of polydopamine (PDA) and silane (3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, APTS), one novel organic-inorganic hybrid strategy was firstly employed to synthesize highly dispersed Fe species embedded in N-doped porous carbon nanosheet (Fe,N-PCN). Thereinto, organic PDA can provide universally robust adhesion, inner porous structure with enlarged surface area can be achieved from inorganic SiO2, the mutual confinement from PDA-derived carbon and SiO2 facilitates the formation of highly dispersed, exposed active sites. Consequently, the newly-prepared Fe,N-PCN displays excellent alkaline ORR activity matching with Pt/C together with better stability and selectivity. Theoretical computations unclose the C atoms close to N (CN) on carbon as active sites with the optimized adsorption/desorption strength towards ORR intermediates, tailored by the interfacial electron transfer between Fe2C and N-doped carbon. Meanwhile, the assembled rechargeable zinc-air battery exhibits large peak power density (119.7 mW cm = 2), specific capacity (775 mAh gZn = 1) and robust charge-discharge durability (250 h, 1500 cycles), overmatching Pt/C and previously studied Fe-based materials.

Herein, we develop a facile and efficient Thermal-Vaporization-Transformation (TVT) approach to prepare a highly active BP directly grown on carbon paper as the electrode for Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), showing a low onset potential of 1.45 V versus RHE. Simultaneously, the current density of BP-CP illustrates the excellent electro-catalysis stability only decreases by 3.4% after continuous operation for 10000 s. Meanwhile, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations further illustrates the P-doped carbon layer in the upper side of BP layer is actually responsible for its enhanced OER property, and the adjacent carbon atoms of the embedded P atoms are actually the active sites due to the induced local change distribution by intramolecular change transfer. Considering the facile, but efficient and scalable, TVT approach can directly synthesize BP-CP with excellent OER performance, which is promising for BP electrocatalysts used for OER in metal-air batteries, fuel cells, water-splitting devices, even other key renewable energy.

The results show that, after pyrolysis, the small size char favored more pores and specific surface area. No significant variations of the intrinsic reactivity of O-2 and NO with char particle size were measured. By increasing char particle size, more NO conversion from nitrogen in char (char-N) was found regardless of the combustion temperature and bulk oxygen concentration. This can be explained as follows. By increasing char particle size, less O-2 penetrated into the pores and then more NO formed which was attributed to a less accessible pore surface area and a decreased NO reduction time. The effects of reaction temperature and bulk oxygen concentration were also discussed. A quantified description using a first-order reaction model shows that the char particle size will finally influence the accessible pore surface area and depth of O-2 diffusion, which will directly determine the char-N/NO conversion. The evolution of nitrogen functionality with particle size and bumoff were also presented to demonstrate migration tendency of the char-N. The larger ratio of O/C in smaller size particle as determined using XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) further confirmed higher pore diffusion. In addition, nitrogen was found to be preferentially retained in the char when carbon is oxidized.									14	3	0	0	0	0	16			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000418783800033

The electro-catalytic performance of the prepared electrodes for the electrochemical degradation of phenol in aqueous solution was investigated. The COD removal of phenol simulated wastewater followed pseudo-first-order rate kinetics. The rate constant with [Emim]BF4-modified PbO2 electrodes was 0.007 39 min(-1), higher than 0.003 83 mind obtained with non-modified PbO2 electrodes. The microstructure of the electrodes was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrochemical properties were investigated by Mott-Schottky, steady-state polarization and linear sweep voltammetry techniques. Results indicate that PbO2 coatings with compact and regular morphology, a higher degree of crystallinity and higher content of oxygen in crystal lattice are anodically grown on Ti substrate from electrolyte containing [Emim]BF4. Steady-state polarization tests show that oxygen evolution overpotential on modified electrodes is significantly higher than that on non-modified ones. Mott-Schottky tests reveal a markedly lower content of oxygen vacancy in modified PbO2 samples as compared with the non-modified ones. It is suggested that the enhanced electro-catalytic activity of the [Emim]BF4-modified PbO2 electrodes towards phenol degradation arises largely from its lower content of oxygen vacancy, which decreases the probability of oxygen transferring from more effective center dot OH into less desirable O-lat at the electrode surface.									4	2	0	0	0	0	5			1002-185X			WOS:000407092900015

Various electrochemical measurements (performed in distinct modes and under different conditions) have been utilized to comment about the catalyst performance and the reactionmechanism, in particular about the reaction products and the relative contribution from hydrogen evolution. At low overpotentials, the carbon dioxide reduction is favored over the hydrogen evolution reaction. Combination of conventional (stationary) stripping-type and hydrodynamic (rotating ring-disk electrode) voltammetric approaches has been demonstrated to function as an unique electroanalytical tool here. The CO2-reduction products can be identified as adsorbates (oxidative stripping voltammetry) or monitored continuously (electrooxidation) at the Pt ring electrode. Finally, the results of both electrochemical diagnostic and parallel gas chromatographic analytical measurements are consistent with the view that, in the examined range of the potentials, CO is the main CO2-reduction product.

In this work, we study the thermodynamic and redox properties of graphene functionalized with carbonyl and hydroxyl groups, and the evolution of these properties with the number, types and distribution of functional groups by employing the density functional theory method. It is found that the redox potential of the functionalized graphene is sensitive to the types, number, and distribution of oxygen functional groups. First, the carbonyl group induces higher redox potential than the hydroxyl group. Second, more carbonyl groups would result in higher redox potential. Lastly, the locally concentrated distribution of the carbonyl group is more beneficial to have higher redox potential compared to the uniformly dispersed distribution. In contrast, the distribution of the hydroxyl group does not affect the redox potential significantly. Thermodynamic investigation demonstrates that the incorporation of carbonyl groups at the edge of graphene is a promising strategy for designing thermodynamically stable positive electrode materials with high redox potentials.									28	2	0	0	0	0	29			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000381428600064	27412373

We considered the sequence steps of electron reduction followed by the proton addition process to observe the hydrogen evolution process. An experimental study of the catalyst showed that the increase in the acetic acid concentration triggers catalytic current and reduction of Co(II) to Co(I), and protonation occurred, yielding a Co(III)-H intermediate. Therefore, we used water and acetic acid as the proton sources. We compare the proton transfer kinetics from both the water and acetic acid. The reduction potentials and proton transfer kinetics from water or acetic acid to the reaction center were studied in a DMF solvent through the implicit solvent model. The first proton transfer from the acetic acid is more favorable, forming a Co-III-H complex and further reducing to Co-II-H. The second proton transfer from water to the Co-II-H moiety requires less free energy than acetic acid and is the rate-limiting step. The nature of the reduction process is also examined through the charge analysis, which reveals that the ligand becomes softer due to the C=O groups.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000773650300001	35172100

Using an inert intermetallic anode, the CO2 evolution can be eliminated altogether with acceleration in the electroreduction kinetics. In the presence of a carbon anode, the cathodic dissociation of TiO2 suffers from slow reduction kinetics of TiO2 to Ti metal, which can be enhanced significantly by the incorporation of alkali species in the TiO2 pellet at the cathode and in the CaCl2 bath in the presence of an intermetallic inert anode. With inert anode and incorporation of K+-ion in the TiO2 matrix and in the salt bath, nearly full metallization with greater than 99% of Ti metal containing 1500 ppm of oxygen was possible to achieve in less than 16 h of electro-reduction. The microstructural and chemical analysis of the metallic phase and its morphology revealed the presence of a layer of titanium metal that forms in the fast reduction reaction step in less than 5 h, after which the reaction rate slows down significantly before terminating in 16 h. The investigation showed that two different types of microstructures of metallic titanium were evident-a thin sheet-like material on the outer periphery of the reduced pellet and the dendritic core which was found to be under the peripheral sheet of the metallic layer. The mechanism of morphological and microstructural changes in the reduced form of titanium metal is explained.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0970-4140	0019-4964		WOS:000765674900001

Selecting between two transition states by which water oxidation intermediates on an oxide surface decay [arXiv]								arXiv								20 pp.	20 pp.						5 March 2019	2019	While catalytic mechanisms on electrode surfaces have been proposed for decades, the pathways by which the product's chemical bonds evolve from the initial charge-trapping intermediates have not been resolved in time. Here, we discover a reactive population of charge-trapping intermediates with states in the middle of a semiconductor's band-gap to reveal the dynamics of two parallel transition state pathways for their decay. Upon photo-triggering the water oxidation reaction from the n-SrTiO3 surface with band-gap, pulsed excitation, the intermediates' microsecond decay reflects transition state theory (TST) through: (1) two distinct and reaction dependent (pH, T, Ionic Strength, and H/D exchange) time constants, (2) a primary kinetic salt effect on each activation barrier and an H/D kinetic isotope effect on one, and (3) realistic activation barrier heights (~0.4 - 0.5 eV) and TST pre-factors (~1011 - 1012 Hz). A photoluminescence from midgap states in n-SrTiO3 reveals the reaction dependent decay; the same spectrum was previously assigned by us to hole-trapping at parallel Ti-O*(dot)-Ti (bridge) and perpendicular Ti-O*(dot) (oxyl) O-sites using in situ ultrafast vibrational and optical spectroscopy. Therefore, the two transition states are naturally associated with the decay of these respective intermediates. Furthermore, we show that reaction conditions select between the two pathways, one of which reflects a labile intermediate facing the electrolyte (the oxyl) and the other a lattice oxygen (the bridge). Altogether, we experimentally isolate an important activation barrier for water oxidation, which is necessary for designing water oxidation catalysts with high O2 turn over. Moreover, in isolating it, we identify competing mechanisms for O2 evolution at surfaces and show how to use reaction conditions to select between them.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						INSPEC:18802004

The structural and chemical characteristics of the powders were analysed by scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. The defect formation reactions relevant to Gd doping are discussed based on the change in the electron energy structure as well as the density functional theory calculations. Ba(OH)(2)center dot H2O, TiO2 center dot 4H(2)O and Gd(NO3)(3)center dot 6H(2)O were used as Ba, Ti and Gd precursors, respectively. A Ba/Ti mole ratio of 1.2 in the precursor at a reaction temperature of 300 degrees C was determined to be the optimal synthetic conditions for preparing the Gd:BTO solid solution. Gd evidently occupied the Ti sites (denoted as Gd-Ti) of BaTiO3 structure, and the substitution of Ti with Gd was accompanied by a change in the oxidation state of the Ti ions and the generation of oxygen vacancies. The magnetic susceptibility of the Gd:BTO powders increased with increase in concentration of Gd-Ti with unidirectional electron spins. In contrast, the relative dielectric constant varied inversely with the Gd concentration owing to the evolution of oxygen vacancies and lattice distortion of the Gd:BTO powders with the increase in the Gd concentration.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0250-4707	0973-7669		WOS:000698107800001

How they control the balance of substrates/products binding and activities is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the human adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (hAPRT) that produces AMP in the purine salvage pathway. We show that a single oxygen atom from the Tyr105 side chain is responsible for selecting the active conformation of the 12 amino acid long catalytic loop. Using in vitro, cellular, and in crystallo approaches, we demonstrated that Tyr105 is key for the fine-tuning of the kinetic activity efficiencies of the forward and reverse reactions. Together, our results reveal an evolutionary pressure on the strictly conserved Tyr105 and on the dynamic motion of the flexible loop in phosphoribosyltransferases that is essential for purine biosynthesis in cells. These data also provide the framework for designing novel adenine derivatives that could modulate, through hAPRT, diseases-involved cellular pathways.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			2451-9448			WOS:000436822100004	29576532

The experimental set-up consisted of a miniaturised solid stare galvanic cell with yttria stabilised zirconia as solid electrolyte and a solid oxide reference electrode. The oxygen activity at the working electrode was changed by controlling the electrode potential versus the reference electrode consisting of a metal/metal oxide system Me/MeO (with Me = Pd or Fe). The electrode surface was investigated by XPS and UPS under cathodic polarisation with low oxygen activity as well as under anodic polarisation with steady-state oxygen evolution. The measurements have been performed between 720 K and 1100 K.With XPS, several oxygen species have been detected at the silver surface. Their concentration depends on the applied electrode potential. A species with low XPS binding energy was found whose intensity increased with anodic polarisation. It is attributed to oxygen species at the surface and at subsurface sites. The latter corresponds to oxygen atoms dissolved in the bulk. Under cathodic polarisation, the oxygen species at low binding energy disappeared, but a second oxygen species at higher XPS binding energy grew in intensity with increasing cathodic polarisation. In view of the reducing conditions and the presence of water, this latter oxygen signal is attributed to a steady state concentration of hydroxyl species at the surface. With UPS, the work function of electrons at the silver surface was determined as a function of the applied overpotential. The work function of silver increased by about 1.6 eV in changing from a cathodic polarisation of -1.5 V to an anodic polarisation of +1.5 V. This pronounced change is caused by a concentration decrease of adsorbed OH and a corresponding increase of adsorbed O atoms leading to a higher surface electron affinity. Applying high cathodic as well as anodic polarisation led to the formation of insulated silver particles within open pores of the silver layer on the surface of the zirconia. These particles which are electronically coupled to the Fermi level of the underlying zirconia cause a superposed but slightly shifted second UPS spectrum with the shift depending on the effective overvoltage. The as determined overvoltage at the silver electrode depends linearly on the cell voltage.					94th Annual Meeting of the Deutsche-Bunsen-Gesellschaft-fur-Physikalische-Chemie94th Annual Meeting of the Deutsche-Bunsen-Gesellschaft-fur-Physikalische-Chemie	MAY 15-27, 1995MAY 15-27, 1995	Deut Bunsen Gesell Phys ChemDeut Bunsen Gesell Phys Chem	BREMEN, GERMANYBREMEN, GERMANY	70	0	0	0	1	0	70			0005-9021			WOS:A1995TH34700021

The 3DSG further treated by Ar plasma (3DSG-Ar) was demonstrated as a free-standing and binder-free electrocatalyst without any polymeric binders for electrode fabrication. Particularly, 3DSG-Ar can be used as highly effective and stable electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It delivers a very low Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1), which is superior or comparable to most metal-free carbon-based electrocatalysts ever reported; moreover, it shows superior long-term electrocatalytic stability even after 2000 cycles. The excellent HER performances of 3DSG-Ar can be attributed to its well-designed porous, conductive and flexible 3D sulfur-doped graphene structure. Sulfur doping combing with plasma treatment cause a synergistic effect to effectively provide many more electrocatalytic active sites, resulting in significantly improved HER performance. In addition, the conductive, porous and flexible 3D graphene skeleton can not only act as free-standing and binder-free electrocatalytic electrode, but also guarantee the interconnected conductive paths in the whole electrode, leading to facilitate the charge transportation between the electrocatalyst and electrolyte and thus enhance its HER performances.									28	0	0	0	1	0	28			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000426298900054

It is generally accepted that from similar to 1.85 Ga oxic shallow marine waters were widespread while the deep ocean remained dominantly ferruginous (Fe(ID-rich), with episodic euxinia confined to productive continental margins and intracontinental basins. The geochemical record that informs this picture, however, is currently sparse, and further studies are required to adequately evaluate temporal and spatial variability in ocean redox conditions across this vast expanse of time. Here, we report Fe-S-C systematics, alongside major (Al, Mn) and trace metal (Mo, U) data for similar to 1.6-0.8 Ga marine sediments from the Bashkir Meganticlinorium (BMA), Southern Urals, Russia. Our Fe speciation data reveal a water column dominated by ferruginous conditions, no evidence for euxinia, and oxygenated waters confined to only the shallowest, near coastal settings. Trace metal data support these findings, with Mo and U enrichment factors in anoxic sediments implying the operation of a particulate Fe (oxyhydr)oxide shuttle under ferruginous conditions as the main mechanism for generating moderate authigenic Mo enrichments. Sulfur isotope systematics imply that predominantly low dissolved sulfate concentrations prevailed throughout the deposition of the BMA succession, which, in combination with a low organic carbon loading, promoted the development of ferruginous, rather than euxinic, water column conditions. The restriction of oxic conditions to the shallowest, near-coastal depositional settings within the Bashkir basin contrasts to other redox studies from this period. Such discrepancies highlight major uncertainty in our understanding of the temporal and spatial evolution of water column redox chemistry across the Mesoproterozoic Era, and signify the need for further detailed work to constrain the chemical evolution of the oceans during this crucial time period.									24	2	1	0	4	0	26			0301-9268	1872-7433		WOS:000449125900012

In this paper we characterize the underlying mechanism of Cu(II) inhibition. Cu(II)-inhibition effect was more sensitive with high pH values. Double-reciprocal plot of the inhibition of oxygen evolution by Cu(II) is shown and its corresponding inhibition constant, K(i), was calculated. Inhibition by Cu(II) was non-competitive with respect to 2,6-dichlorobenzoquinone and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea and competitive with respect to protons. The non-competitive inhibition indicates that the Cu(II)-binding site is different from that of the 2,6-dichlorobenzoquinone electron acceptor and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea sites, the Q(B) niche. On the other hand, the competitive inhibition with respect to protons may indicate that Cu(II) interacts with an essential amino acid group(s) that can be protonated or deprotonated in the inhibitory-binding site.									33	4	1	0	28	1	38			0166-8595			WOS:A1992JV09700005	24408666

Herein, we report an electrode made of Al and Co co-doped NiO nanosheets, which are directly grown on the surfaces of carbon cloth without the addition of binders, facilitating the transport of electrons. Additionally, the hierarchical structure shortens the length for species transport and provides abundant active sites for reactions. In the alkaline solution, the Al and Co co-doped NiO electrode exhibits higher activity in both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions than the pristine NiO electrode without doping and superior stability. When assembled in a Zn-air battery, impressively, this electrode results in stable charge-discharge voltage gaps and energy efficiency of 62% over 1000 cycles (330 h) at 5mA cm(-2). In comparison, a battery with the electrode made of Pt/C and Ir/C shows large voltage gaps and can only be operated for 400 cycles. The characterization of the electrode after cycling illustrates that both the nanosheet morphology and the NiO phase are well maintained. The results demonstrate that the carbon cloth with Al and Co co-doped NiO nanosheets is a promising air electrode to enable the high cycling stability of rechargeable Zn-air batteries.

Our study shows that Cu mers (monomer, dimer and trimer) with no N coordination adsorb H too strongly, whereas Cu mers with complete N coordination adsorb H too weakly, indicating that neither is catalytically active for HER. However, these results imply that Cu mers with partial N coordination may exhibit a better catalytic performance. Thus, we further explored all the Cu2Nx complexes with different atomic coordination numbers and spatial distributions and find that one of the Cu2N4 atomic configurations possesses a Delta G(H*) of -0.09 eV, exhibiting a superior catalytic performance for HER. The possible reason might be that this configuration tunes the p-band center to an optimum level. Our study here reveals a promising catalyst for HER and presents a practical route to design catalysts by introducing metal mers and tuning their coordination with high-valence non-metal elements.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2516-0230			WOS:000684592800001	36132635

This TiO2 is composed of TiO2 ultrathin nanosheets (2 nm in thickness) with 95% of exposed {100} facet, which is considered to be the active facet for photocatalytic reaction. This percentage (95%) is the highest among previously reported {100} facet exposed anatase TiO2. More importantly, due to this high ratio, our developed TiO2 nanosheets showed marked photocatalytic activity, about 5 times higher activity in both H-2 evolution and CO2 reduction than the reference sample, TiO2 cuboids with 53% of exposed {100} facet. For the TiO2 nanosheets, both the higher percentage of exposed {100} facets and larger surface area can offer more surface active sites in the photocatalytic reaction. On the other hand, the superior electronic band structure which results from the higher percentage of {100) facet is also beneficial for the higher activity. This study exemplifies that the facet engineering of semiconductors is one of the most effective strategies to achieve advanced properties over photofunctional materials for solar energy conversion.									167	12	0	0	9	1	172			1944-8244			WOS:000315619100024	23360579

Nevertheless, high metal-loading would lead to the severe agglomeration and nonuniformity of nanoparticles, imposing an enormous challenge on efficient synthesis. Herein we present a cobalt oxide aided structural evolution strategy to controllably synthesize high-loaded (44.7 wt%) sub-6 nm Pt1Co1 intermetallic compounds with a Pt-rich shell (Pt1Co1-IMC@Pt). Experiments and theory explicitly reveal that the ordered arrangement of Pt-Co atoms endows surface Pt with a lowered d band centre and enhanced oxidation-resistance of Pt/Co sites, thus simultaneously boosting the ORR activity and durability. The preeminent intrinsic ORR activity on an optimized catalyst reaches a mass activity as high as 0.53 A mg((Pt))(-1)@0.90 V RHE-1 (MA@0.9 V) in rotating disk electrode measurements. PEMFCs with such a catalyst deliver record-high power density (2.30/1.23 W cm(-2) under H-2-air/O-2 conditions at 80 degrees C) and extraordinary stability, ranking the highest fuel cell performance among the Pt-based electrocatalysts. Significantly, the MA@0.9 V calculated from fuel cell attains 0.46 A mg((Pt))(-1), exceeding the 2020 DOE target (0.44 A mg((Pt))(-1)) and very close to the intrinsic value, definitely confirming the superiority of high-loaded Pt1Co1-IMC@Pt/C in activity expression under fuel cell conditions. This study paves a new way for the future practical application of low-Pt catalysts in PEMFCs.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000727762300001		
J	Tzvetkoff, T; Gencheva, P								Mechanism of formation of corrosion layers on nickel and nickel-based alloys in melts containing oxyanions - a review								MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS				82	3			897	904		10.1016/j.matchemphys.2003.08.001				DEC 20 2003	2003	A review of the corrosion of Ni and Ni-based alloys in melts containing oxyanions (nitrate, sulphate, hydroxide and carbonate) is presented, emphasising the mechanism of growth, the composition and structure of the passivating oxide films formed on the material in such conditions. First, the thermodynamical background involving solubility and point defect chemistry calculations for oxides formed on Ni, Cr and Ni-Cr alloys in molten salt media is briefly commented. The main passivation product on the Ni surface has been reported to be cubic NiO. In the transition stage, further oxidation of the compact NiO layer has been shown to take place in which Ni(III) ions and nickel cation vacancies are formed. Transport of nickel cation vacancies has been proposed to neutralise the charges of the excess oxide ions formed in the further oxidation reaction. Ex situ analysis studies reported in the literature indicated the possible formation of Ni2O3 phase in the anodic layer. During the third stage of oxidation, a survey of the published data indicated that oxygen evolution from oxyanion melts is the predominant reaction taking place on the Ni/NiO electrode. This has been supposed to lead to a further accumulation of oxygen ions in the oxide lattice presumably as oxygen interstitials, and a NiO phase formation has been also suggested. Literature data on the composition of the oxide film on industrial Ni-based alloys and superalloys in melts containing oxyanions are also presented and discussed. Special attention is paid to the effect of the composition of the alloy, the molten salt mixture and the gas atmosphere on the stability and protective ability of corrosion layers.

We characterize distinct orange- and red-emitting forms (lambda(abs)/lambda(em)= 490/565 nm; lambda(abs)/lambda(em)= 535/600 nm) arising during the Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) photoconversion under low-oxygen conditions in the presence of reductants. These forms spectroscopically differ from that observed previously in oxidative redding (lambda(abs)/lambda(em)= 575/607 nm). We also report on a new green-emitting state (lambda(abs)/lambda(em)= 405/525 nm), which is formed upon photoconversion under the low-oxygen conditions. Based on the spectral properties of these forms, their light-independent time evolution, and the high-level computational studies, we provide a structural basis for various photoproducts. Under the low-oxygen conditions, the neutral quinoid-like structure formed via a two-electron oxidation process is found to be a key intermediate and a most likely candidate for the novel green-emitting state of the chromophore. The observed large Stokes shift is traced to the formation of the zwitterionic form of the chromophore in the excited state. Subsequently, this form undergoes two types of cyclization reactions, resulting in the formation of either the orange-emitting state (lambda(abs)/lambda(em)= 490/565 nm) or the red-emitting form (lambda(abs)/lambda(em)= 535/600 nm). The T65G mutant lacks one of the proposed cyclization pathways and, indeed, the photoconverted T65G EGFP exhibits a single orange-emitting state. In oxidative redding, the red-emitting state resembles the structure of the chromophore from asFP595 (lambda(abs)/lambda(em)= 572/595 nm), which is directly formed upon two-electron oxidation and deprotonation bypassing the formation of the quinoid-like structure. Our results disclose a general "oxidative" mechanism of various green-to-red photoconversions of EGFP, providing a link between oxidative redding and the photoconversion under low-oxygen conditions.									6	0	0	0	4	0	6				2296-889X		WOS:000561533800001	32850965

However, it is a limitation that these releases must be in sunlight where the photoionization can take place. In recent years, the lanthanide metals, such as samarium, have been released to produce electrons in reaction with atomic oxygen in the upper space. The reaction could proceed without sunlight so that the restriction on experimental periods is broken. Unfortunately, any sophisticated models even preliminary ones are unavailable yet in the literature. A temporal three-dimensional model is presented for the samarium release in detail with respect to various altitudes and mass. Especially, the plasma diffusion equation is remarkably extended from 2-D to 3-D by importing the influence of geomagnetic declination, which could be also useful for other chemical releases. The field-aligned terms are brought so as to the presented model can describe the diffusion along the geomagnetic field subtly. On the basis of the presented model, behaviors of radio waves propagating through the release area are simulated by using ray tracing. This model could be as the theoretical support for samarium releases, and it also helpful for the research on the generation and evolution of the ionosphere irregularities.									10	2	0	0	0	0	10			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000388965900078

Nookala, Munichandraiah/ABI-3889-2020				NiFe-layered double hydroxides: a bifunctional O-2 electrode catalyst for non-aqueous Li-O-2 batteries								RSC ADVANCES				6	105			103106	103115		10.1039/c6ra19054e				2016	2016	Ascertaining an appropriate cathode material for the Li-O-2 battery system is one of the main tasks at present. To deal with this, in this study, a highly active and stable NiFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) is synthesized via a hydrothermal method. The characterisation results showed the presence of LDH nanoplates covered with Ni and Fe nanoparticles. In addition to the as prepared NiFe-LDH, its calcinated products at three different temperatures, 300, 500 and 800 degrees C are also studied for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in a non-aqueous electrolyte by using cyclic voltammetry and rotating disc electrode (RDE) techniques. The as prepared NiFe-LDH exhibits a comparatively greater catalytic activity for ORR than its calcinated products. Li-O2 battery tests are then carried out to further evaluate the catalytic activity of the products in 1.0 M LiPF6 in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME). NiFe-LDH exhibited superior catalytic performance with a specific discharge capacity of similar to 3218 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 mA cm(-2). The discharge plateau appears at 2.75 V which is close to theoretical potential (2.9-3.1 V) for Li2O2 formation. A stable specific discharge capacity of similar to 1728 mA h g(-1) is obtained even after 30 cycles at 0.1 mA cm(-2). The discharge-recharge voltage gap is about similar to 0.9 V.									24	1	0	0	1	0	24			2046-2069			WOS:000387726500033

The following results were obtained: (a) Within the range of 0 < theta < 35-degrees-C, the ratio of the oxygen yield induced by the 4th and 3rd flashes of the train, Y4/Y3, and the oxygen yield induced by the 2nd flash, Y2, exhibit similar dependencies on the temperature in isolated thylakoids, PS II membrane fragments, and inside-out vesicles. (b) Below a characteristic temperature theta(c) of 20-25-degrees-C, the values of Y4/Y3 and Y2, which reflect (at constant S0 dark population) the probabilities of misses and double hits, respectively, remain virtually independent of temperature, whereas above theta(c) these parameters increase. (c) The dark decays of S2 and S3 via fast and slow kinetics due to reduction of the water oxidase by Y(D) and other endogenous electron donor(s), respectively, exhibit comparatively strong temperature dependencies in thylakoids with the following activation energies: E(A)(S2fast) = 55 kJ/mol, E(A)(S3fast) = 50 kJ/mol, E(A)(S2slow) = 85 kJ/mol, and E(A)(S3slow) = 75 kJ/mol. The activation energy of S0 oxidation to S1 by Y(D)ox was found to be markedly smaller with a value of E(A)(S0) = 30 kJ/mol. (d) Incubation with chaotropic agents at concentrations which do not significantly impair the oxygen evolution capacity leads to modifications of the oscillation pattern with remarkable differences for various types of agents: Tris and urea are practically without effect; guanidine hydrochloride affects Y4/Y3 in a similar way as elevated temperature but without significant changes of Y2 and the decay kinetics of S2 and S3; and anions of the Hofmeister series (SCN-, ClO4-, I-) cause a drastic destabilization of Y(D)ox. Possible structure-function relations of the PS II complex are discussed on the basis of these findings.									73	0	0	0	60	0	73			0006-2960			WOS:A1993LV43500009	8347576	
J	Gadala, Ibrahim M.; Ha, Hung M.; Rostron, Paul; Alfantazi, Akram								Formation and Evolution of Oxide/Oxyhydroxide Corrosion Products on Low-Alloy Steel During Exposure to Near-Neutral pH Solutions Containing Oxygen and Nitrate								CORROSION				73	3			221	237		10.5006/2070				MAR 2017	2017	The evolution of corrosion product and the transient behavior of corrosion during the first 24 h of low-alloy steel exposure to near-neutral pH solutions containing O-2 and NO3- are investigated in this work through periodic electrochemical polarization, spectroscopy, and characterization techniques. The formation of porous FeOOH products occurs a few hours following immersion, with morphologies distinctly dependent on O-2 concentration. O-2 diffusion is less in the FeOOH tubercle formations formed in 20 ppm O-2 conditions, whereas the presence of Fe2O3 is exclusive to corrosion products of 6 ppm O-2 environments. Charge transfer on the compounds involved governs corrosion protectiveness trends of the overall multilayered product and reaction kinetics at sub-tubercle surface sites. Atypical 0.005 M and 0.015 M NO3- presence in the environment minimizes the cathodic potential range of O-2 reduction and intensifies the corrosion of the low-alloy steel specimen. The chronology of corrosion product evolution is corroborated with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction, while critical interactions of dissolved species with developed surface layers are quantified with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0010-9312	1938-159X		WOS:000394445300003

Herein, an iron-nickel phosphide (Fe2P/Ni2P) heterostructure, constructed by Fe2P nanoparticles embedded on Ni2P nanosheets, is strategically fabricated on nickel foam via a facile process. As a bifunctional electrocatalyst, the Fe2P/Ni2P heterostructure delivers a very low overpotential of 64 mV (or 185 mV) to reach current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen (or oxygen) evolution reaction. When simultaneously employed as both the anode and cathode electrodes, it demonstrates an ultralow cell voltage of 1.49 V@10 mA cm(-2) for full water splitting with nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency, and superior long-term stability even over 100 h. Density functional theory calculations manifest that a strong heterointerface interaction could cause electron redistribution near the Fe2P/Ni2P heterointerface and optimize the Delta G(H). of P sites, thus enhancing catalytic activity. Additionally, the 3D porous heterostructure is benefit to expose rich active sites and facilitate ion diffusion and gas bubble release, thus promoting the catalytic performance. This work opens up a new strategical approach for rational design of metal phosphide-based heterostructures as highly efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting.

Herein, we have successfully synthesized FeN-doped hierarchically porous carbon (FeN-HPC) materials with 3D honeycomb-like structure by NaCl-assisted pyrolysis method, which uses green and cheap glucose and dicyandiamide as organic precursors. Due to the extremely high percentage (93.7%) of graphitic-N & pyridinic-N in ultra-thin carbon nanosheets-assembled hierarchical structure with macro-meso-micro pores and large specific surface area, FeN-HPC exhibits excellent ORR activity, which surpasses commercial Pt/C manifested in higher half-wave potential (0.888 V vs. 0.845 V) and kinetic current density (23.2 mA cm(-2) vs. 3.6 mA cm(-2)@0.85 V). The primary zinc-air battery using FeN-HPC electrocatalyst exhibits a peak power density of 241 mW cm(-2) at a high current density of 344 mA cm(-2). Moreover, after coupling with non-precious NiFe-hydroxides nanosheets, the rechargeable Zn-air battery exhibits a narrow potential gap of 0.61 V between charging and discharging. Significantly, the battery exhibits excellent durability with a negligible decrease (0.76%) of discharging potential after 1000 cycles, demonstrating significantly better performance than that of Zn-air batteries previously reported. Our work provides a promising way for building highly efficient electrocatalyst and high performance rechargeable zinc-air batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

At the extreme of this trend, the crown group of Antarctic icefishes (Channichthyidae) lost both components of oxygen transport. Under the decreased selection scenario, we hypothesized that the Antarctic dragonfishes (Bathydraconidae, the red-blooded sister clade to the icefishes) evolved lower blood hemoglobin concentrations because their globin gene complexes (alpha- and beta-globin gene pairs linked by a regulatory intergene) transcribe globin mRNAs less effectively than those of basal notothenioids (e.g., the Nototheniidae [notothens]). To test our hypothesis, we 1) sequenced the alpha/beta-intergenes of the adult globin complexes of three notothen and eight dragonfish species and 2) measured globin transcript levels in representative species from each group. The typical nototheniid intergene was similar to 3-4 kb in length. The bathydraconid intergenes resolved into three subclasses (long [3.8 kb], intermediate [3.0 kb], and short [1.5-2.3 kb]) that corresponded to the three subclades proposed for the taxon. Although they varied in length due to indels, the three notothen and eight dragonfish intergenes contained a conserved similar to 90-nt element that we have previously shown to be required for globin gene transcription. Using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we found that globin mRNA levels in red cells from one notothen species and from one species of each dragonfish subclade were equivalent statistically. Thus, our results indicate that the bathydraconids have evolved adult globin loci whose regulatory intergenes tend to be shorter than those of the more basal nototheniids yet are equivalent in transcriptional efficacy. Their low blood hemoglobin concentrations are most likely due to reduction in hematocrit.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0737-4038	1537-1719		WOS:000300496800017	22075115

The asprepared 3D ternary composite displays superior catalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which outperforms most binary or ternary carbon-based composites in the literature. The HER overpotentials are 65 mV and 86 mV when the current densities reach 10 mA cm (- 2) and 20 mA cm (-2), respectively, and the exchange current density reaches 0.503 mA cm (-2). Also, it demonstrates good stability reflected from the negligible activity decrease after 1000 consecutive cycles. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of the Co9S8/NSG-UCNT ternary composite is attributed to the co-effect of the abundant HER active sites induced by Co9S8 nanoparticles, structural defects existing in the carbon support caused by N and S co-doping and outstanding conductivity resulting from the 3D structure.									81	4	0	0	1	0	81			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000394430800019

The data obtained clearly indicate that among the tested acceptors PPBQ is the best at high flash frequencies. If present at high enough concentration, the PSII turnover efficiency is unaffected by flash frequency of up to 30 Hz, and at 40 Hz and 50 Hz only a slight decrease by about 5-7% is observed. In contrast, drastic reductions of the O-2 yields by about 40% and 65% were found at 50 Hz for DCBQ and FeCy, respectively. Comparison with literature data reveals that PPBQ accepts electrons from Q(A)(-) in PSII membrane fragments with similar efficiency as plastoquinone in intact cells. Our data also confirm that at high flashing rates O-2 evolution is limited by the reactions on the electron-acceptor side of PSII. The relevance of these data to the evolutionary development of the water-splitting complex in PSII and with regard to the potential of artificial water-splitting catalysts is discussed.

Employing chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for NiO necessitates suitable nickel precursors that are volatile and stable. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a series of new nickel beta-ketoiminato complexes with different aliphatic and etheric side chain substitutions, namely, bis(4-(isopropylamino)-pent-3-en-2-onato)nickel(II) ([Ni(ipki)(2)], 1), bis(4-(2-methoxyethylamino)-pent-3-en-2-onato)nickel (II) ([Ni(meki)(2)], 2), bis(4-(2-ethoxyethylamino)pent-3-en-2-onato)nickel(H) ([Ni(eeki)(2)], 3), bis(4-(3-methoxy-propylamino)-pent-3-en-2-onato)nickel(II) ([Ni(mpki)(2)], 4), and bis(4-(3-ethoxypropylamino)pent-3-en-2-onato)nickel(II) ([Ni(epki)(2)], 5). These compounds have been thoroughly characterized with regard to their purity and identity by means of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and electron impact mass spectrometry (EI-MS). Contrary to other transition metal beta-ketoiminates, the imino side chain strongly influences the structural geometry of the complexes, which was ascertained via single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD). As a result, the magnetic momenta of the molecules also differ significantly as evidenced by the magnetic susceptibility measurements employing Evan's NMR method in solution. Thermal analysis revealed the suitability of these compounds as new class of precursors for CVD of Ni containing materials. As a representative precursor, compound 2 was evaluated for the CVD of NiO thin films on Si(100) and conductive glass substrates. The as-deposited nanostructured layers were stoichiometric and phase pure NiO as confirmed by XRD, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS), and nuclear reaction analysis (NRA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated the formation of slightly oxygen-rich surfaces. The assessment of NiO films in electrocatalysis revealed promising activity for the oxygen evolution reactions (OER). The current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) achieved at overpotentials ranging between 0.48 and 0.52 V highlight the suitability of the new Ni complexes in CVD processes for the fabrication of thin film electrocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000552287100060	32589409

A high-enthalpy (M = 2.35, T = 1330 K, P = 40 kPa) crossflow representative of Mach 7 flight combustor entry conditions was generated and maintained for all test cases. The PD provided a brief, high temperature, high momentum flux ratio, radical-rich, plume of gas to the wake of the jet. The temporal evolution of the blowdown process and interaction between the two plumes was studied using high-speed schlieren and OH* chemiluminescence imaging. OH planar laser-induced fluorescence of the center-plane at various times of the blowdown process was used to image the instantaneous reaction zone. The jetto-crossflow momentum flux ratio (Jj) was varied between values of 0.5, 2.7, and 5 to span a range of jet flame stabilization regimes.					54th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting54th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting	4-8 Jan. 20164-8 Jan. 2016		San Diego, CA, USASan Diego, CA, USA	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-1-62410-393-3	INSPEC:15761474

A vast set of experimental data on the ignition delay time, laminar flame propagation velocity, and time evolution of mole fractions of the basic species, which were obtained in shock tubes and in a flow reactor, is used for verification of the kinetic model. Based on a sensitivity analysis, it is shown that the role of reactions determining the basic characteristics of ignition and combustion depends on the composition of the fuel-air mixture and the syngas proper.									41	0	0	0	0	0	41			0010-5082			WOS:000282428900001

In this work, nickel-cobalt oxides were formed on Bekipor ST 20AL3 3D stainless steel mesh, achieving a large surface area and high electric conductivity. Layer-by-layer potentiostatic electrodeposition was carried out in one solution by applying different potential values for individual cobalt and nickel oxide layer formation to ensure uniform distribution on each mesh filament. Hydroxide coatings were then thermally treated at 473-1073 K to obtain spinel-type oxides. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated three oxides-NiO, Co3O4 and NiCo2O4-as the main products obtained after annealing at 473-773 K. Surface morphology investigated by scanning electron microscopy showed a uniform coverage of each filament with lamellar nickel-cobalt oxides. The electrochemically active surface area of the films was determined by employing cyclic voltammetry of a ferricyanide/ferrocyanide redox system, which revealed a significant impact of annealing on the surface activity. Electrocatalytic performance tests indicated that annealing at 673 K significantly enhanced nickel-cobalt activity in OER, with overpotential of 536 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), while further treatment had a detrimental effect. The coating was able to maintain this activity during long-term stability tests with no signs of surface damage. Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements revealed a complex charge storing mechanism of nickel-cobalt oxide coatings, combining properties of batteries and supercapacitors. The highest energetic parameters achieved in this work were demonstrated by a coating annealed at 473 K (specific capacitance 769 F g(-1), specific energy 312 W h kg(-1), and specific power 750 W kg(-1)), along with great stability, maintaining 98% of its initial specific capacitance after 300 cycles.Graphic Abstract[GRAPHICS].									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0361-5235	1543-186X		WOS:000521899400003

The thickness of Ni shells can be finely controlled from 50 to 150 nm by adjusting the initial Ni to Ag atomic ratios. The electrocatalytic performance of the Ag-Ni core-shell NWs can be adjusted by tuning their compositions, and the optimized Ag to Ni atomic ratio is 1:1. The Ag-Ni coreshell nanowires exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity to pure Ni nanoparticles and Ag NWs, showing a strong synergistic effect toward alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A morphological effect was demonstrated by comparing with Ag-Ni core-shell nanoparticles. The enhanced HER activity of Ag-Ni core-shell NWs can be attributed to the synergetic effect between Ag and Ni, the larger number of surface active sites and the fast charge transport. This approach provides a reasonable attempt for designing and developing 1D electrocatalysts based on Ag nanowires.									24	0	0	0	2	0	24			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000407641200020		
J	Tang, Taotao; Liu, Min; Chen, Ying; Du, Ye; Feng, Jieling; Feng, Haoran								Influence of sulfamethoxazole on anaerobic digestion: Methanogenesis, degradation mechanism and toxicity evolution								JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS				431						128540	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128540				JUN 5 2022	2022	Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), one of the most widely used sulfonamides antibiotics, is frequently detected in the livestock wastewater. Currently, the focus needs to shift from performance effects to understanding of mecha-nisms and intermediate toxicity analysis. Our study found that SMX (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/L) stimulated methane production by promoting the process of acetogenesis and homo-acetogenesis. Since 1 mg/L SMX could inhibit the transformation of butyric acid, thus, the stimulation of methane was weak under this condition. Under anaerobic conditions, acetate kinase (AK) and cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP450) continued to participate in SMX degradation. The increase in SMX concentration affected the release of metabolic enzymes, causing changes in SMX degradation pathways. Based on the main biotransformation products, five biotransformation pathways were proposed, the major transformation reactions including hydroxylation, hydrogenation, acetylation, deamination, oxidation, the elimination of oxygen atoms on sulfonyl, isoxazole ring and N-S bond cleavage. Toxicity prediction analysis showed that the toxicities of most SMX transformation products were lower than that of SMX.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000762640500005	35220120

In this work, phosphorization treatment has been developed to enhance the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), including both the activity and the durability. By treating Pt with tri-n-octylphosphine at 300 degrees C for 3 h, Pt nanoparticles can transform to Pt2P nanoparticles with slightly increased sizes. After the phosphorization treatment, the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts can be enhanced markedly, with a factor of 10.3 enhancement in mass activity and a factor of 10.2 enhancement in specific activity, respectively. More importantly, long-term stability tests (30 000 cycles of accelerated durability tests) demonstrated that the excellent durability could be obtained after the phosphorization treatment, with a drop of 9.1% in mass activity, showing another advantage of the method reported in this work. Given the highly improved catalytic performance, one can anticipate that the nanocrystals composed of Pt and P atoms would shed new light on next-generation energy conversion and storage devices, and offer an efficient phosphorization treatment strategy for promoting activity and durability of Pt electrocatalysts.									18	5	0	0	1	0	19			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000489678800043

Doped carbons have attracted wide attention and have become one of the hottest topics in new energy fields due to their high ORR performance and low cost. In this work, uniform nitrogen and sulphur co-doped hollow carbon nanospheres with an ultra-high surface area (1060 m(2) g(-1)) were fabricated by using polyacrylonitrile and sulphur as the precursors. The catalyst exhibits outstanding ORR performance, excellent stability, methanol tolerance, as well as high selectivity toward the four-electron catalytic pathway. By analyzing the effects of sulphur addition, we found that the sulphur addition is crucial for the formation of uniform nanospherical morphologies, as well as highly porous structures and high surface areas. Besides, sulphur addition was also found to be able to modify the catalysts' atomic compositions effectively by increasing the total and pyridinic N contents while reducing oxidized N contents. Sulphur addition induced unique features in the catalysts' structures and compositions. We believe that this should be themain origins of our catalyst's outstanding ORR performance.									41	2	0	0	1	0	42			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395072800049

The term "self-sustained" implies a set of chemical reactions capable of harnessing energy from the environment, using it to carry out programmed anabolic and catabolic functions. We briefly present our opinion on the general validity of this definition.Running anabolic and catabolic functions entails complex chemical information whose stability, reproducibility and evolution constitute the core of what is dubbed genetics.Life as-we-know-it is made of the intimate interaction of metabolism and genetics, both built around the chemistry of the most common elements of the Universe (hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon). Other elements like phosphorus and sulphur play important but ancillary and potentially replaceable roles.The reproducible interaction of metabolic and genetic cycles results in the hypercycles of organization and de-organization of chemical information that we consider living entities. In order to approach the problem of the origin of life it is therefore reasonable to start from the assumption that both metabolism and genetics had a common origin, shared a common chemical frame, were embedded in physical-chemical conditions favourable for the onset of both.The most abundant three-atoms organic compound in interstellar environment is hydrogen cyanide HCN, the most abundant three-atoms inorganic compound is water H2O. The combination of the two results in the formation of formamide H2NCOH. We have explored the chemistry of formamide in conditions compatible with the synthesis and the stability of compounds of potential pre-genetic and pre-metabolic interest. We discuss evidence showing (i) that all the compounds necessary for the build-up of nucleic acids are easily obtained abiotically, (ii) that essentially all the steps leading to the spontaneous generation of RNA are abiotically possible, (iii) that the key compounds of extant metabolic cycles are obtained in the same chemical frame, often in the same test tube.How close are these observations to a plausible scenario for the origin of life?

The structure, composition, morphology, thermal stability, and textural and redox properties of the Mo-K-OMS-2 materials were characterized by various experimental techniques. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the electronic properties of K-OMS-2 materials, including the influence of molybdenum on such properties. The catalytic activity of K-OMS-2 towards CO oxidation dramatically increased with Mo dopant concentration, until an optimum incorporation of 5 mol% was reached, giving full CO conversion at 120 degrees C (1 vol% CO, 1 vol% O-2). More importantly, the activity of the 5% Mo-K-OMS-2 catalyst was (reversibly) inhibited by water vapour (3%) in the feed only at low temperatures and exhibited better tolerance and stability during long-run experiments (28 h) as compared to undoped K-OMS-2. The superior performance of Mo-K-OMS-2 catalyst for CO oxidation can be attributed to the following factors: (1) morphological evolution from nanofibers to nanospheres, as well as the slightly distorted structure, generated a sharp increase in the specific surface area up to 258 m(2) g(-1), hence, increased the number of surface active sites; (2) improved mobility of reactive oxygen species at the surface and enhanced redox properties; and (3) tailored electronic properties promoted more active sites for oxidation reactions, which is supported by DFT calculations.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000453549100018

The cornerstone of this development was laid by the widely used computational hydrogen electrode method which involves a posteriori correction of standard constant charge first principles studies in solvent environment. The description of this technique and its contribution to our effort to understand electrocatalytic reactions on the active sites of metal-based nanoparticles are reviewed. The pathways and energetics of the relevant elementary reactions are presented. We also discussed a recent attempt in the literature to account for the inflow and outflow of electrons from the electrode as electrochemical reactions proceed, which has been greatly assisted by the development of density functional theory within the grand canonical framework. Going beyond the computational hydrogen electrode method by explicit incorporation of electrode potential within the calculations permits access to more detailed insights without requiring extra computational burden.									20	0	0	0	0	0	19			2073-4344			WOS:000448543300020

In this article, a method of synthesizing nitrogen-doped graphene is proposed. Few-layered graphene sheets (FL-graphene) were prepared by electrochemical exfoliation of commercial graphite in a Na2SO4 electrolyte with added calcium carbonate as a separator of newly-exfoliated FL-graphene sheets. Exfoliated FL-graphene was impregnated with a suspension of green algae used as a nitrogen carrier. Impregnated FL-graphene was carbonized at a high temperature under the flow of nitrogen. The N-doped FL-graphene was characterized through instrumental methods: high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Electrochemical performance was determined using cyclic voltamperometry and linear sweep voltamperometry to check catalytic activity in ORR. The N-doped electroexfoliated FL-graphene obeyed the four-electron transfer pathways, leading us to further test these materials as electrode components in rechargeable zinc-air batteries. The obtained results for Zn-air batteries are very important for future development of industry, because the proposed graphene electrode materials do not contain any heavy and noble metals in their composition.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10				1996-1944		WOS:000535941100109	32370239

Therefore, ORR catalysts with superb electrocatalytic activity and durability are becoming a necessity but still remain challenging. Herein, we report C/NiCo2O4 nanocomposite fibers fabricated by a straightforward electrospinning technique followed by a simple sintering process as a promising ORR electrocatalyst in alkaline condition. The mixed-valence oxide can offer numerous accessible active sites. In addition, the as-obtained C/NiCo2O4 hybrid reveals significantly remarkable electrocatalytic performance with a highly positive onset potential of 0.65 V, which is only 50 mV lower than that of commercially available Pt/C catalysts. The analyses indicate that C/NiCo2O4 catalyst can catalyze O-2-molecules via direct four electron pathway in a similar behavior as commercial Pt/C catalysts dose. Compared to single NiCo2O4 and carbon free NiCo2O4, the C/NiCo2O4 hybrid displays higher ORR current and more positive half-wave potential. The incorporated carbon matrices are beneficial for fast electron transfer and can significantly impose an outstanding contribution to the electrocatalytic activity. Results indicate that the synthetic strategy hold a potential as efficient route to fabricate highly active nanostructures for practical use in energy technologies.									26	1	0	0	2	0	26			1996-1944			WOS:000384668700008

These properties can be manipulated by modifying the basal plane chemistry. Here, mixed transition metal nitride MXenes, M-Ti4N3Tx (M = V, Cr, Mo, or Mn; T-x = O and/or OH), are developed by modifying pristine exfoliated Ti4N3Tx MXene with V, Cr, Mo, and Mn salts using a simple solution-based method. The resulting mixed transition metal nitride MXenes contain 6-51% metal loading (cf. Ti) that exhibit rich electrochemistry including highly tunable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalytic activity in a 0.5 m H2SO4 electrolyte as follows: V-Ti4N3Tx > Cr-Ti4N3Tx > Mo-Ti4N3Tx > Mn-Ti4N3Tx > pristine Ti4N3Tx with overpotentials as low as 330 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) with a charge-transfer resistance of 70 omega. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) reveals the electrochemical activity of individual MXene flakes. The SECM data corroborate the bulk HER activity trend for M-Ti4N3Tx as well as provide the first experimental evidence that HER results from catalysis on the MXene basal plane. These electrocatalytic results demonstrate a new pathway to tune the electrochemical properties of MXenes for water splitting and related electrochemical applications.									45	4	0	0	1	0	45			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000533597000001

In this work, we reported a simple and efficient strategy by introducing mechanical agitation into a low powered ultrasonic system to facilitate the production of cavitation bubbles. The coupled system remarkably intensifies the evolution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for degradation of refractory organic pollutants. We in-situ monitored the generation of hydroxyl radicals ( center dot OH) by selective scavenging tests and chemical trapping experiments. The operational factors such as rotation speed, gas atmosphere, solution temperature and pH were carefully evaluated for their impacts on the degradation of a plastic microcontaminant, diethyl phthalate (DEP). It was found that the degradation efficiency is closely related to the population of cavitation bubbles in the solution, which was collaboratively governed by the aforementioned factors. A high mechanical agitation speed (600 rpm), great solubility of inert gas atmosphere (Argon), and low reaction temperature (15 & ordm;C) are beneficial to the generation of cavitation bubbles and the associated production of ROS. This work shows a facile strategy to intensify the mechanical energy-to-chemical conversion and provides new mechanistic insights into the ultrasound-based advanced oxidation without external chemical inputs.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, a novel 0D/2D MoS3 quantum dots (QDs)/C-doped atomically thin TiO2(B) nanosheet composite (MoS3/TiO2(B)-C) was fabricated for H-2 evolution. The simultaneous loading of the highly-efficient cocatalyst MoS3 and carbon and oxygen vacancy co-doping into an atomically thin TiO2(B) nanosheet was achieved by an annealing process. This unique nanostructure of the MoS3/TiO2(B)-C exhibits remarkable photocatalysis of H-2 in the full spectrum. We obtain a yield of 2.47 mmol.g(-1).h-1, 30 times higher than pure TiO2(B) nanosheet, and even higher than MoS2 and Pt loaded TiO2(B) nanosheets (2.23 and 2.36 mmol.g(-1).h(-1), respectively). In-depth characterization shows that notably MoS3 is a superior cocatalyst than MoS2 for H-2 evolution and stability. We note MoS2 is an earth-abundant robust cocatalyst previously recognized as an ideal substitute for Pt. Importantly, this research work also provides new insights for the design and practical manufacture of low-cost highly efficient H-2 generating photocatalysts by ultra-thin 2D materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000841995200005

In this work, iron-nitrogen and phosphorus codoped carbon nanorod-layer composites (N, P-CNL) derived from phosphorus-doped polyaniline (P-PANI) by phytic acid (PA) and iron salt were successfully obtained after high-temperature pyrolysis. As a result, the N, P-CNL materials exhibited good electrocatalytic performance due to abundant active sites.

One of these new methods is chemical looping combustion (CLC). In this work, the required heat for the endothermic steam reforming process is provided by coupling the CLC as an unprecedented technique with the steam reforming process. Endothermic reactions of methane steam reforming and reduction of Fe-based oxygen carriers in a fuel reactor (FR) are coupled with exothermic reaction of oxygen-carrier oxidation in an air reactor (AR) of thermally double coupled reactors. In this novel configuration, the AR and FR operate in fast and bubbling fluidization, respectively, and steam reforming occurs in vertically fixed bed catalytic tubes. The results show that, by application of CLC, not only the amount of produced synthesis gas is the same as the conventional method but also the process whereby CO2 is separated from flue gas inherently. This is the most obvious advantage of the CLC technique. Although the CO2 separation process is very costly, it is necessary for the conventional method. In this study, temperature, mole fraction, methane and air conversion, combustion efficiency, and hydrogen yield have been investigated. Results indicate that the methane conversion and hydrogen yield obtained in this novel method are 29% and 1.04, respectively. Also, the combustion efficiency and gas conversion (O-2 and CH4) in both of the CLC reactors (air and fuel reactors) are nearly 100%.					13th International Conference on Petroleum Phase Behavior and Fouling13th International Conference on Petroleum Phase Behavior and Fouling	JUN 10-14, 2012JUN 10-14, 2012		St. Pete Beach, FLSt. Pete Beach, FL	46	1	0	0	0	0	46			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000317950900065

Herein, the theoretic predications and experimental investigations that non-electroactive Zn behaves as an effective promoter for CoP-catalyzed hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both acidic and alkaline media is reported. Density function theory calculations reveal that Zn doing leads to more thermal-neutral hydrogen adsorption free energy and thus enhanced HER activity for CoP catalyst. Electrochemical tests show that a Zn0.08Co0.92P nanowall array on titanium mesh (Zn0.08Co0.92P/TM) needs overpotentials of only 39 and 67 mV to drive a geometrical catalytic current of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 m H2SO4 and 1.0 m KOH, respectively. This Zn0.08Co0.92P/TM is also superior in activity over CoP/TM for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), driving 115 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V in 1.0 m KOH with 0.5 m urea. The high HER and UOR activity of this bifunctional electrode enables a Zn0.08Co0.92P/TM-based two-electrode electrolyzer for energy-saving hydrogen production, offering 10 mA cm(-2) at a low voltage of 1.38 V with strong long-term electrochemical stability.									460	28	0	0	19	0	463			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000407275300014		
J	Koj, Matthias; Qian, Jingcan; Turek, Thomas				Turek, Thomas/E-1592-2011	Turek, Thomas/0000-0002-7415-1966			Novel alkaline water electrolysis with nickel-iron gas diffusion electrode for oxygen evolution								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				44	57			29862	29875		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.09.122				NOV 15 2019	2019	In the present work, a novel electrolyzer concept for alkaline water electrolysis (AEL) with a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) as anode, a conventional immersed porous cathode and a state-of-the-art Zirfon (TM) separator is presented and compared with a conventional electrolyzer setup. Due to the utilization of a GDE in this configuration, the electrolyte is only circulated through the cathode compartment which greatly simplifies the process. The influence of the catalyst composition and the enhanced electrode surface owing to the three-dimensional porous structure of the GDE are characterized and investigated regarding the electrode performance. Furthermore, process parameters like contact pressure and differential pressure are examined and optimized. The novel process concept with a GDE as anode reveals a similar cell potential compared to a classical electrolysis cell with a Ni/Fe-coated nickel foam anode up to 400 mA cm(-2) at 353 K and 32.5 wt% KOH and also exhibits relatively good electrochemical stability over time.

Agardh) (Phaeophyta). Mass spectrometric measurements of gross O-2 evolution and gross O-2 uptake were combined with simultaneous measurement of pulse-modulated chl fluorescence under a range of irradiances and inorganic carbon (C-i) concentrations. At light-limiting irradiance, a good correlation between gross O-2 evolution and the electron transport rate (ETR) calculated from chl fluorescence ((F-m' - F-s)/ F-m') was found in the optically thin species (Ulva and Porphyra). The calculated ETR was equivalent to the theoretical electron requirement in these species but overestimated gross O-2 evolution in the thicker species Zonaria. In saturating light, especially when C-i availability was low, ETR overestimated gross O-2 evolution in all species. Excess electron flow could not be accounted for by an increase in gross O-2 uptake; thus neither Mehler-ascorbate-peroxidase reaction nor the photosynthetic carbon oxidation cycle were enhanced at high irradiance or low C-i. Alternative explanations for the loss of correlation include cyclic electron flow around PSII that may be engaged under these conditions or nonphotochemical energy quenching within PSII centers. The loss of correlation between ETR and linear photosynthetic electron flow as irradiance increased from limiting to saturating or at low C-i availability and in the case of optically thick thalli limits the application of this technique for measuring photosynthesis in macroalgae.									81	5	0	0	79	3	87			0022-3646	1529-8817		WOS:000171736300012

The oxide powders were synthesised using an aqueous hydrolysis method, followed by thermal oxidation. With the cell operating at 80 degrees C, the cell voltage at low current densities was dependant on the anode composition. At higher current densities the performance differences were less, most likely due to competing factors such as mass transport, electrical conductivity and surface area. A minimum in cell voltage was found at ruthenium contents around 40mol%, which is explained as being the optimum between specific activity and active surface area. Overall the best cell voltage we achieved was 1.567 V at 1 A cm(-2) and 80 degrees C, equating to an energy consumption of 3.75 kWh N m(-3) H-2 and an efficiency of 94% (epsilon(Delta H)). This was achieved using a Ir0.6Ru0.4O2 anode and 20% Pt/C cathode, with the total noble metal loading less than 2.04mg cm(-2). (C) 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

The resistant plants have a mutation of serine for glycine at position 264 of the D1 protein. The measurement of oxygen evolution and chlorophyll a fluorescence induction indicated a 2-4-fold stronger inhibition by the 6-trifluoromethyl analogues of Photosystem II-dependent electron flow than atrazine. Analogues having a 6-methyl-, 6-monofluoromethyl or 6-difluoromethyl substitution were weak inhibitors, indicating that the 6-trifluoro group is very important for strong inhibition. All the nine novel 2-benzylamino-1,3,5-triazines were almost as active in wild-type as in atrazine-resistant thylakoids, indicating that the benzylamino substitution may be important for the lack of resistance in the atrazine-resistant plants.									12	0	0	0	10	0	12			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000167315200003	16228478

This ternary material was synthesized by a novel and low-cost solventless route using simple ethyl xanthate complexes of silver and bismuth. p-XRD analysis indicates that the synthesized ternary material is highly crystalline and belongs to the cubic phase (schapbachite). The electrochemical properties of the material were tested; the potential of the synthesized material for application in charge storage shows a high specific capacitance of 460 F g(-1) at 2 mV s(-1). A capacitance retention of 83% with a 100% coulombic efficiency was observed after 3000 cycles. The charge storage potential, analysed by fabricating actual symmetrical devices, shows a specific capacitance of 14 F g(-1) at 2 mV s(-1). An energy density of 26 W h kg(-1) and a power density of 3.6 kW kg(-1) were observed. Besides, the potential for the oxygen evolution reaction was also studied. An overpotential of 414 mV and a Tafel slope of 134 mV dec(-1) were obtained for water oxidation. The fabrication of an electrolyzer cell using the synthesized material as the cathode indicates that a current of 10 mA cm(-2) can be achieved at a potential of 1.63 V.									31	0	0	0	3	0	31			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000461088700023	30806439

However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process must be energetically catalyzed over a long period at high output, leading to challenges for efficient and stable processing of electrodes for practical purposes. Here, we first prepared Fe-MOF nanosheet arrays on nickel foam via rare-earth erbium doping (Er-0.4 Fe-MOF/NF) and applied them as OER electrocatalysts. The Er-0.4 Fe-MOF/NF exhibited wonderful OER performance and could yield a 100 mA cm(-2) current density at an overpotential of 248 mV with outstanding long-term electrochemical durability for at least 100 h. At large current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2), overpotentials of only 297 mV and 326 mV were achieved, respectively, revealing its potential in industrial applications. The enhancement was attributed to the synergistic effects of the Fe and Er sites, with Er playing a supporting role in the engineering of the electronic states of the Fe sites to endow them with enhanced OER activity. Such a strategy of engineering the OER activity of Fe-MOF via rare-earth ion doping paves a new avenue to design other MOF catalysts for industrial OER applications.									3	2	0	0	1	0	4				2079-4991		WOS:000676809400001	34361231

However, the competition between light absorption and electrocatalysis at a restrained cocatalyst area on conventional planar-type photo electrodes could limit their conversion efficiency. Here, we demonstrate a new monolithic photoelectrode architecture that eliminate the optical-electrochemical coupling by forming locally nanostructured cocatalysts on a photoelectrode. As a model study, Ni inverse opal (IO), an ordered three-dimensional porous nanostructure, was used as a surface-area-controlled electrocatalyst locally formed on Si photoanodes. The optical-electrochemical decoupling of our monolithic photoanodes significantly enhances the PEC performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by increasing light absorption and by providing more electrochemically active sites. Our Si photoanode with local Ni IOs maintains an identical photolimiting current density but reduces the overpotential by about 120 mV compared to a Si photoanode with planar Ni cocatalysts with the same footprint under 1 sun illumination. Finally, a highly efficient Si photoanode with an onset potential of 0.94 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a photocurrent density of 31.2 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs RHE in 1 M KOH under 1 sun illumination is achieved with local NiFe alloy IOs.									39	1	0	0	1	0	39			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000411043500035	28800240

Understanding rapid transformations is challenging in a laboratory setting, where phase and defect populations may change with sub-second time scales. In this work, we apply in situ Raman spectroscopy to investigate defect complexes and phase transformations during flash sintering. We demonstrate that the oxygen vacancy complexes in Ce0.85Gd0.15O1.925 and the evolving phases in a SrCO3 + V2O5 reaction can be probed with acquisition times sufficient to monitor stage II of flash sintering. We establish how thermal effects can be separated from effects of the electric field and determine the resolution of the defect concentration. The fast characterization we demonstrate here can be combined with well-developed models of thermal and phase evolution to elucidate the mechanism of densification during flash sintering.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000640609200001

This paper shows that salts such as Na2SO4 and K2SO4, which are often used as supporting electrolytes for electrochemical reactions, cause significant effects on the H2O2 reduction. A new potential oscillation, named oscillations H, appears in the H2O2-H2SO4-Pt system when Na2SO4 or K2SO4 is added to the solutions. Oscillation H is induced by the cations originating from the salts, Na+ and K+, though they do not react on Pt electrode. In the presence of Na+ or K+, the local pH at the electrode surface becomes basic, and consequently the oxidation of HO2-, formed via a dissociation of H2O2 (H2O2 -> HO2- + H+), occurs on the electrode surface. Oxygen bubbles due to the HO2-oxidation evolve from the electrode synchronously with the potential oscillation. Detailed studies, including electrochemical impedance measurements and numerical simulation, reveal that oscillation H can be explained by an interplay of the HO(2)(-)oxidation and an autocatalytic effect involved in the H2O2 reduction.

J	Zhang, LY; Oeters, F								Post-combustion and heat transfer at blowing of oxygen into a carbon monoxide containing slag foam								STEEL RESEARCH				70	10			373	385		10.1002/srin.199905656				OCT 1999	1999	A combined post-combustion model (CPM) for smelting reduction processes was developed in a multi-national research project supported by the European Coal and Steel Commission. The project partners were CSM, Rome, Hoogovens, Ijmuiden, MPI, Dusseldorf, and TUB, Berlin. This paper reports about a heat transfer model developed by TU Berlin within this project. The batch-type smelting reduction reactor has a two-layered slag: an upper foamy and a lower less foamy slag. A bubble stream of (CO+H-2) gas originating from the iron oxide reduction reaction with coal in the lower slag flows upwards. The rising (CO+H-2) gas is post-combusted by three oxygen jets blown horizontally into the upper part of the slag. A flame zone, and above the flame a mixing and a bubble zone form, in which post-combustion reaction and transfer of the post-combustion heat to the slag take place. The modelling of the flame zone was the subject of a previous paper. The present report describes models of the mixing and the bubble zone and of the occurrences in the gas space above the slag. The macro-kinetics of the overall heat transfer process including slag recirculation and heat transfer from the upper foamy to the lower dense slag are presented further. The model calculations provide information about the distribution of the post-combustion and the heat transfer processes over the single zones as functions of the important internal process parameters. Further, the oxygen utilisation, the heat efficiency and the temperatures at various locations of the process are described as functions of the ratio of post-combustion oxygen flow rate to (CO+H-2) evolution rate. In all the calculations a specific gas through-put of carbon monoxide of 3 mol/t . s is assumed. This value corresponds to 510 mol/s for the assumed melt of 170 t. The model shows that heat transfer efficiencies of more than 90 % and slag temperatures of less than 1700 degrees C are possible, if the slag circulation rate is 300 kg/s. Lower circulation rates lead to higher slag temperatures and worse heat transfer efficiencies. Controlled slag circulation is thus an important process tool.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0177-4832			WOS:000085096800001

Therefore, it is emergency to explore for much cheaper and superior active scalable materials in making this technology to be more promising. The perovskite oxides, with rich constitutions and structures, can be easily to tune of the electrocatalytic applications by tailoring compositions. Herein, a highly efficient catalyst composed of nitrogen-doped carbon coated multi-metals core decorated Ruddlesden-Popper type structure (Pr0.4Sr0.6)(3)(Fe0.85Nb0.15)(2)O-7 (NC-CF-PSFN) compounds is synthesized via a in situ growth of carbon nanotubes treatment that trigger their catalytic activities. The optimal electrocatalyst exhibits a significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by affording an overpotential of 124 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), an onset potential of -12 mV vs. RHE, accompanied by an outstanding durability in acidic media, outperforming that of perovskite-based catalysts. The optimized internal/external interaction between the complex carbon and perovskite phases would contribute to modify its electrochemical performance. This protocol highlights a novel strategy to prepare excellent perovskite materials for applications in energy generation and storage.									15	1	0	0	2	0	15			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000561595100002

The conventional photocatalysts with their issues such as rapid charge recombination are considered unfavorable candidates for practical applications. Herein, a novel direct Z-scheme based photocatalyst composed of Bi2O3/Bi2MoO6 hetrojunction is proposed for efficient photo-degradation of phenol and hydrogen (H-2) production reaction. The hetrojunction comprises of ultra-thin (2D) Bi2O3 nanosheets, in-situ grown over 3D Bi2MoO6 microspheres via simple alkali treatment of Bi2MoO6 succeeded by air calcination step. The relative mass ratio of Bi2O3 and Bi2MoO6 could be fine-tuned by controlling the alkali dosage (i.e. NaOH or KOH). Unlike the conventional Bi2O3/Bi2MoO6 hetrojunction, the proposed catalyst follow a direct Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism which permits superior photocatalytic activity with 96.4% phenol degradation efficiency and high hydrogen evolution rate of 52 mu mol.g(-1) under visible light irradiation. The exuberant performance is accredited to the spatially separated redox charge carriers, excellent light harvesting capability and fast-charge transportation characteristics of the proposed photocatalyst. The present work serves as a primary pathway to design and develop efficient Bi2MoO6-based direct Z-scheme photocatalysts with promising applications in environmental remediation and solar fuel production.

Use is made of detailed pre-supernova and explosion models. Special attention is also paid to the evaluation of the abundances of the s-process seeds, while the p-process nucleosynthesis is computed with the aid of an extended reaction network. In addition, the impact of some key nuclear physics and astrophysics uncertainties on the p-process yields is also investigated.This unprecedented effort to model the p-process allows us to set the stage of a reliable model for the evolution of the galactic content of the p-nuclides. In particular, integrated p-process yields are obtained from a convolution of the production from the individual star explosions with an Initial Mass Function. In addition, a first quantitative evaluation of the metallicity dependence of the amount of ejected p-nuclides is provided.It is found that the p-process abundance patterns do not depend drastically on the stellar mass. In all the considered cases, about 60 % of the p-nuclides are nicely co-produced (with respect to solar). The relative underproduction of the Mo and Ru p-isotopes found in previous studies is confirmed. Another problem is identified, and its extent is evaluated quantitatively for the first time. It concerns the relative global underproduction of the p-nuclides with respect to oxygen by a factor of about 4, when normalized to the solar system values. However, it is claimed that various uncertainties of an astrophysical or nuclear physics nature that can affect both the p-process and oxygen yields do not allow one to rule out the SNII model without further scrutiny.Our predictions are also confronted with anomalies attributed to p-isotopes found in various meteoritic materials. It is found in particular that our calculated Xe isotopic composition fails to reproduce the special pattern of Xe-L loading interstellar diamonds. On the other hand, the radionuciides Nb-92 and Sm-146 that are inferred to have been present in the early solar system are synthesized in the SNII p-process at a level that is considered to be too uncertain to allow the development of a reliable p-process chronometry.									278	1	2	0	1	0	281			0004-6361			WOS:A1995RE75200022

Acetone/water-soluble fractions (70/30, v/v) of three lager beers of the same batch, differently stabilized before bottling in glass or poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) bottles, were monitored by normal-phase HPLC-ESI(-)-MS/MS over a 1-year period of storage at 20 degrees C. In parallel, beer color was monitored by the European Brewery Convention assay. The evolution of color was similar in the silica gel-filtered beer to that in identically bottled and stored poly(vinylpolypyrrolidone)treated samples, despite the high flavanoid dimers content of the former. On the other hand, color evolved more rapidly in the PET bottle, suggesting a key role of oxygen. The kinetics was still increased in model media containing (+)-catechin, while no color was detected when normal-phase HPLC-fractionated dimers or trimers were investigated. (+)-Catechin emerged as the precursor of less polar products, characterized by a yellow-brown color. MS/MS enabled us to identify these products as issued from the oxidation and intramolecular additions of clehydrodicatechin B4. Similar structures were found. in aged beers spiked with (+)-catechin. Beer storage in the absence of oxygen and at low temperature is recommended so as to minimize the synthesis of such pigments.									42	1	1	0	26	0	44			0021-8561			WOS:000250479500035	17924702

Although the noble metals are better catalyst, the effect of noble metal interlayer doping on 2H-MoS2 is unclear. To this end, we apply first-principles method to investigate the structural stability of the noble metal interlayer doped 2H-MoS2. In particular, we investigate the influence of noble metal interlay doping on the catalytic hydrogen evolution activity of 2H-MoS2. The result shows that the noble metal interlayer doping is beneficial to improve the electronic transport near Fermi level. Moreover, it is found that the Ru-doped 2H-MoS2 has better thermodynamic stability compared to the Au-doping, Pd-doping and Pt-doping. Importantly, the noble metal interlayer doping strengthens the interaction between single layers in comparison with the weak van der Waals force between single layers of the pristine 2H-MoS2. Finally, it is found that four noble metals interlayer doping increase the catalytic hydrogen evolution activity of 2H-MoS2. In particular, the Ru-doped 2H-MoS2 has better catalytic activity because the transfer of the Ru-4d state from low energy region to high energy region, which weakens the interaction between Mo and S.

The ultrathin 2D structure of TMPs can offer abundant adsorption sites to boost HER performance. Herein, an ice-templating strategy is developed to prepare CoP aerogels composed of 2D ultrathin CoP nanosheets (<1.5 nm) using sustainable alginate biomass (seaweed extract) as the precursor. The highly porous aerogel structure can not only deliver facile mass transfer, but also prevent aggregation of the nanosheets into layered structures. As expected, the obtained CoP nanosheet aerogels exhibit remarkable stability and excellent electrocatalytic HER performance at all pH values. For instance, the sample CoP-400 presents a low overpotential of 113, 154, and 161 mV versus RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M KOH, and 1 M phosphate buffer solution, respectively. In addition, CoP-400 displays low Tafel slopes at all pH values due to the interconnected highly porous structure of the aerogel, indicating that the sample can provide low-resistance channels for mass transport. Density functional theory calculations reveal that P-top and Co bridge on (011) facet of CoP are more favorable sites during the process of HER in acid and alkaline solutions, respectively.									82	8	0	0	4	0	83			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000446998200013	30350551

Solar-driven water splitting into oxygen and hydrogen is one of those advanced strategies. Researchers have studied various semiconductor materials to achieve potential results. However, it encountered multiple challenges such as high cost, low photostability and efficiency, and required multistep modifications. The conjugated polymers (CPs) have emerged as promising alternatives for conventional inorganic semiconductors. The CPs offer low cost, sufficient light absorption efficiency, excellent photo and chemical stability, and molecular optoelectronic tunable characteristics. Furthermore, organic CPs also present higher flexibility to tune the basic framework of the backbone of the polymers, amendments in the sidechain to incorporate desired functionalities, and much-needed porosity to serve better for photocatalytic applications. This review article summarizes the recent advancements made in visible-light-driven water splitting covering the aspects of synthetic strategies and experimental parameters employed for water splitting reactions with special emphasis on conjugated polymers such as linear CPs, planarized CPs, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and conjugated polymer-based nanocomposites (CPNCs). The current challenges and future prospects have also been described briefly.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1527-8999	1528-0691		WOS:000765754500001	35257485

The decomposition of 4,4'-bpy under high temperature produces thin carbon coating for Fe3N NPs. Also, the CNT template anchors the Fe3N NPs to avoid aggregation. The sample (denoted as Fe3N-C N) exhibits excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) behavior even with a small molar ratio of Fe3N (Fe: 4.9 at. %), which can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 218 mV with a Tafel slope of 84 mV dec(-1) and long-term OER activity during 60 h electrolysis at 20 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the sample after 20 h electrolysis, denoted as Post-Fe3N-C N (20 h), displays enhanced OER activity with a smaller Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1) and overpotentials of 195 and 327 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, which is mainly due to the partial transformation of Fe3N into FeOOH. The OER mechanism is investigated by density functional theory calculations, and it is found that the surface partial oxidation of Fe3N leads to the effective OER electrolysis, which changes the electron density of the superficial atoms and induces the moderate adsorption for the intermediates.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000687044700049	34309376

The degradation is accelerated when oxygen and water invade the composite through matrix microcracks and react with fiber coatings and the fibers themselves. We review micromechanical models of the main rate-determining phenomena involved, including the diffusion of gases and reaction products through matrix microcracks, oxidation of SiC (in both matrix and fibers) leading to the loss of stiffness and strength in exposed fibers, the formation of oxide scale on SiC fiber and along matrix crack surfaces that cause the partial closure of microcracks, and the concomitant and synergistic loss of BN fiber coatings. The micromechanical models could be formulated as time-dependent coupled differential equations in time, which must be solved dynamically, e.g., as an iterated user-defined material element, within a finite element simulation. A paradigm is thus established for incorporating the time-dependent evolution of local material properties according to the local environmental and stress conditions that exist within a material, in a simulation of the damage evolution of a composite component. We exemplify the calibration of typical micromechanical degradation models using thermodynamic data for the oxidation and/or volatilization of BN and SiC by oxygen and water, mechanical test data for the rate of stress rupture of SiC fibers, and kinetic data for the processes involved in gas permeation through microcracks. We discuss approaches for validating computational simulations that include the micromechanical models of environmental degradation. A special challenge is achieving validated predictions of trends with temperature, which are expected to vary in a complex manner during use.									49	0	0	0	0	0	49			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000419096700001

Molecular light absorbers offer flexibility in fine tuning of orbital energetics, and metal oxide nanoparticles have emerged as robust oxygen evolving catalysts. Hence, these material choices offer a promising approach for the development of photocatalytic systems for water oxidation. However, efficient charge transfer coupling of molecular light absorbers and metal oxide nanoparticle catalysts has proven a challenge. Recent new approaches toward the efficient coupling of these components based on synthetic design improvements combined with direct spectroscopic observation and kinetic evaluation of charge transfer processes are discussed.

However, the fundamental understanding of the cathode reactions in SWBs is not yet fully elucidated; hence, an investigation of their mechanisms is imperative for future development. Herein, parasitic cathode reactions other than the previously identified oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OERs/ORRs) are identified for the first time using activated carbon cloth (ACC) as the cathode current collector. In this study, carbon fibers of the current collector were observed to undergo cathode side-reactions such as fiber-fracturing carbon corrosion during charging and surface-insulating CaCO3 precipitation via carbon dioxide capture during discharging, both resulting in cathode performance failure. Moreover, carbon corrosion was determined to be the dominant factor behind performance degradation under normal charge-discharge cycling conditions in comparison to CaCO3 precipitation, which was found to be a reversible phenomenon during the operation of the SWB. These results provide insight for future work into enhancing the longevity of SWBs by identifying carbon corrosion as the main cathode performance degradation mechanism.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000536095500038

This requires OER catalysts to resist serious corrosion and undesirable chloride oxidation. We introduce a 5d transition metal, Ir, to develop a monolayer NiIr-layered double hydroxide (NiIr-LDH) as the catalyst with enhanced OER performance for seawater splitting. The NiIr-LDH catalyst delivers 500 mA/cm(2) at only 361 mV overpotential with similar to 99% O-2 Faradaic efficiency in alkaline seawater, which is more active than commercial 402 (763 mV, 23%) and the best known OER catalyst NiFe-LDH (530 mV, 92%). Moreover, it shows negligible activity loss at up to 650 h chronopotentiometry measurements at an industrial level (500 mA/cm(2)), while commercial IrO2 and NiFe-LDH rapidly deactivated within 0.2 and 10 h, respectively. The incorporation of Ir into the Ni(OH)(2) layer greatly altered the electron density of Ir and Ni sites, which was revealed by X-ray absorption fine structure and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Coupling the electrochemical measurements and in situ Raman spectrum with DFT calculations, we further confirm that the generation of rate-limiting intermediate *O and *OOH species was accelerated on Ni and Ir sites, respectively, which is responsible for the high seawater splitting performance. Our results also provide an opportunity to fabricate LDH materials containing Sd metals for applications beyond seawater splitting.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000820104500001	35535584

PLANT SIGNALING & BEHAVIOR				16	1						10.1080/15592324.2020.1831792		DEC 2020		JAN 2 2021	2021	Plant resilience to oxidative stress possibly operates through the restoration of intracellular redox milieu and the activity of various posttranslationally modified proteins. Among various modes of redox regulation operative in plants cys oxPTMs are brought about by the activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and hydrogen peroxide. Cysteine oxPTMs are capable of transducing ROS-mediated long-distance hormone signaling (ABA, JA, SA) in plants. S-sulphenylation is an intermediary modification en route to other oxidative states of cysteine. In silico analysis have revealed evolutionary conservation of certain S-sulphenylated proteins across human and plants. Further analysis of protein sulphenylation in plants should be extended to the functional follow-up studies followed by site-specific characterization and case-by-case validation of protein activity. The repertoire of physiological methods (fluorescent conjugates (dimedone) and yeast AP-1 (YAP1)-based genetic probes) in the recent past has been successful in the detection of sulphenylated proteins and other cysteine-based modifications in plants. In view of a better understanding of the sulfur-based redoxome it is necessary to update our timely progress on the methodological advancements for the detection of cysteine-based oxPTM. This substantiative information can extend our investigations on plant-environment interaction thus improving crop manipulation strategies. The simulation-based computational approach has emerged as a new method to determine the directive mechanism of cysteine oxidation in plants. Thus, sulfenome analysis in various plant systems might reflect as a pinnacle of plant redox biology in the future.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1559-2316	1559-2324		WOS:000597366600001	33300450

Herein, we report that the local electronic structure of Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH) could be favorably modulated through strong interfacial interactions with FeOOH nanoparticles (NPs). The biphasic and multiscale composites FeOOH/LDH demonstrated an increasingly pronounced synergy effect for OER catalysis when the average size of FeOOH NPs decreases from 18.0 to 2.0 nm. Particularly, the composite with average size of FeOOH NPs of 2.0 nm exhibited an overpotential of 174 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a tafel slope of 27 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH, outmatching all the noble and non-noble OER catalysts reported so far; it also operates smoothly in various stability tests. A mechanistic study based on XANES and EXAFS analysis, d.c. voltammetry and large amplitude Fourier Transformed a.c. voltammetry proved the presence of high-oxidation-state Fe((3+delta)+)sites with relatively short Fe(3+delta)+-O bond from the highly unsaturated ultrafine FeOOH NPs which could reform the local electronic structure and favorably manipulate the electronic oxidation and thus electrocatalytic behaviors of the Ni2+ species in the Ni-Fe LDH, hence leading to the easy formation, excellent OER activity, and extraordinary structural and catalytic stability. Our work puts an emphasis on the role of the solid-solid interfacial chemistry between a Ni-Fe LDH and a non-noble-metal component in engineering the local electronic structure of the active metal sites, which successfully pushed forward the catalytic activity of the well-studied Ni-Fe LDH far beyond its current limit in OER catalysis and opened up an avenue for rational design of OER electrocatalysts.									253	9	0	0	17	0	255			2155-5435			WOS:000453491100036

The area-specific HER activity of Pt-xAL-PtFe/C was found to be ca. 2 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C at 80 degrees C and -0.02 V vs. RHE. Pt-xAL-PtFe/C exhibited the additional important advantage of suppressed H2O2 production during the HER in the presence of O-2, which inevitably diffuses from the anode in PEMWE. Both the excellent HER performance and low H2O2 production are attributed to the lower adsorption energies of atomic hydrogen on Pt-skin surfaces, as revealed by DFT calculations.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000459584900003	30681092

If the energy required to drive catalytic processes could be harvested directly from sunlight, the possibility of replacing contemporary processes based on terrestrial fuels by the conversion of light into chemical energy could become a step closer to reality. Plasmonic catalysis is currently at the forefront of photocatalysis, enabling one to overcome the limitations of "classical" wide bandgap semiconductors for solar-driven chemistry. Plasmonic catalysis enables the acceleration and control of a variety of molecular transformations due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excitation. Studies in this area have often focused on the fundamental understanding of plasmonic catalysis and the demonstration of plasmonic catalytic activities towards different reactions. In this feature article, we discuss recent contributions from our group in this field by employing plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) with controllable features as model systems to gain insights into structure-performance relationships in plasmonic catalysis. We start by discussing the effect of size, shape, and composition in plasmonic NPs over their activities towards LSPR-mediated molecular transformations. Then, we focus on the effect of metal support interactions over activities, reaction selectivity, and reaction pathways. Next, we shift to the control over the structure in hollow NPs and nanorattles. Inspired by the findings from these model systems, we demonstrate a design-driven strategy for the development of plasmonic catalysts based on plasmonic-catalytic multicomponent NPs for two types of molecular transformations: the selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene and the oxygen evolution reaction. Finally, future directions, challenges, and perspectives in the field of plasmonic catalysis with designer NPs are discussed. We believe that the examples and concepts presented herein may inspire work and progress in plasmonic catalysis encompassing the design of plasmonic multicomponent materials, new strategies to control reaction selectivity, and the unraveling of stability and reaction mechanisms.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000744156500001	35044391

However, gel electrolytes that improve the freezing tolerance and energy efficiency of ZABs are rarely explored. Herein, an organohydrogel electrolyte (OHE) is fabricated by soaking poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid)/polyacrylamide (PAM PS/PAAm) double-network hydrogel in aqueous KOH electrolyte with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) additive. The prepared OHE exhibits high mechanical strength and excellent ionic conductivity. In addition, the introduction of DMSO effectively improves freezing tolerance and electrochemical performance especially in energy efficiency of ZABs due to that DMSO can break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules and alter the path of the conventional oxygen evolution reaction in ZAB simultaneously. Compared with the control hydrogel electrolyte, the optimized OH E enables flexible ZABs to not only exhibit an exceptionally low charge voltage of 1.63 V, high energy efficiency of 74.2%, and long cycling life of 177 cycles, but also to operate with an excellent specific capacity of 562 mAh g(-1) and energy density of 523.4 Wh kg(-1) at -40 degrees C. Moreover, the obtained flexible ZABs keep a stable output under deformations and extreme low temperature, manifesting a great potential for functional wearable devices.									10	0	0	0	2	0	9			2366-9608			WOS:000720734200001	35041284

Theoretical calculations and experimental evidence favors a preferential binding of biotin molecule to Ag nanoparticles through the carboxylate group.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000239780500041	17037870

The structural, morphological and thermal properties of as-prepared MnO2@mpg-C3N4 electrocatalyst were characterized by TEM, SEM, XRD, XPS, Raman, ICP-MS, and TGA. The results clearly revealed the formation of 3D-hierarchical heterostructures consisting of 1D MnO2 nanowires anchored on mpg-C3N4. Next, the electrocatalytic performance of MnO2@mpg-C3N4 nanocomposite was tested in OER wherein it exhibited substantially enhanced activity than pristine 1D MnO2 nanowires. In particular, the turnover frequency (TOF) of MnO2@mpg-C3N4 (0.84 s(-1)@480 mV) was found almost three times higher than that of ID MnO2 nanowires (0.32 s(-1)@480 mV). Moreover, the overpotential and Tafel slope values were successfully lowered down by using MnO2@mpg-C3N4 nanocomposite compared to those of 1D MnO2 nanowires. It was experimentally demonstrated that the superior OER performance of the MnO2@mpg-C3N4 is attributed to the effective stabilization of Mn3+ species (Mn2O3) in the electrocatalyst via the help of nitrogen functional groups of mpg-C3N4 and the formation of 3D heterostructure that offers the following three major contributions; i) enhanced aerophobicity due to orientation modifications of growing 1D MnO2 nanowires, ii) open structure facilitating the rapid detachment of gas bubbles from the electrode surface, iii) a large number of transport channels for the penetration of electrolyte, ions and electrons.

J	Havaux, M; Malkin, S								Studies on photoacoustic uptake signals in tobacco leaves under high carbon dioxide levels								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				58	3			293	302		10.1023/A:1006184626089				DEC 1998	1998	Photoacoustic signals were measured in expanded tobacco leaves, exposed to a controlled atmosphere by being only partly enclosed within the photoacoustic cell. It was aimed to corroborate the conjecture of Reising and Schreiber (Photosynthesis Research 42: 65-73, 1994) that under exceptionally high CO2 levels (ca. 1-5%) the photobaric uptake contribution reflects CO2 uptake induced by light dependent stromal alkalinization. This is shown here by: (1) the shallower damping of the uptake signal vs. the modulation frequency, compared to a normal oxygen evolution signal; (2) the partial inhibition of the uptake signal under 5% CO2 by nigericin; (3) the complete absence of uptake signals under 5% CO2 in a carbonic-anhydrase-deficient mutant, which gave rather a normal oxygen evolution signal. The photoacoustic signals from the wild type and the transgenic tobacco in air could not be distinguished, indicating that the CO2 uptake signal is negligible under this condition. Uptake photobaric signals were also measured in modulated far-red light (ca. 715-750 nm), following addition of white background light (in light limiting intensity). In normal tobacco under 5% CO2, the background light induced an uptake transient, lasting about a minute, then declining to a low steady level. Significantly smaller transients were obtained under normal air, and in the carbonic-anhydrase deficient mutant also under 5% CO2. Extrapolation to zero frequency of the signal damping vs. modulation frequency, in both tobacco genotypes, suggests however similar magnitudes of the uptake transients. On the other hand, no proportional steady-state uptake was observed for the last two cases. Presumably, the steady uptake under 5% CO2 in modulated far-red light reflects CO2 solubilization, while it is an open question whether the transient could be partly contributed also by oxygen photoreduction by PS I (Mehler reaction). It is reasoned that, under conditions of low light, the respiratory activity results in accumulation of CO2 in the photoacoustic cell, which is sufficient to induce an uptake phenomenon, giving a more satisfactory interpretation for the so-called 'low light state' [Cananni and Malkin (1984) Biochim Biophys Acta 766: 525-532].									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			0166-8595			WOS:000080262600008

In this work, the surface of metallic manganese was investigated in situ and operando in potentiodynamic cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments and potentiostatic chronoamperometry (CA) experiments in NaOH. In both cases, the surfaces were initially reduced. At corresponding potentials, no oxide species can be detected by Raman spectroscopy, though electrochemical data and the absence of dissolution above the reversible potential for reactions of type Mn -> Mn-II indicate that the material is passive. The CV shows anodic peaks at potentials in line with expectations on the basis of thermodynamic data for the oxidation to Mn3O4 and Mn2O3; the thickness of the surface layer increases by a few nm during these peaks, as evidenced by spectroscopic ellipsometry. Dissolution of Mn as evidenced by downstream electrolyte analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in a scanning flow cell (SFC-ICP-MS) of the electrolyte is negligible in the range of electrode potential vs. Ag|AgCl|3 M KCl, E-Ag|AgCl, up to 0.3 V. Remarkably, Raman spectra already show the occurrence of alpha-MnO2 at E-Ag|AgCl > -0.25 V, which is ca. 0.5 V below the potential at which oxidation to MnO2 is expected. This observation is attributed to disproportionation above a certain level of Mn-III. For E-Ag|AgCl > 0.4 V, dissolution sets in, at a constant layer thickness. Above the onset potential of the OER, at E-Ag|AgCl approximate to 0.6 V, SFC-ICP-MS analysis shows fast dissolution, and the oxide layer thickness is constant or increases. CA experiments during the OER show strong dissolution, and the re-formation of a strongly disordered, beta-MnO2-like oxide, which exists in a quasi-stationary state at the interface. Several CV cycles increase the dissolution per cycle and the fraction of alpha-MnO2 on the surface which cannot be reduced. The high dissolution currents show that metallic Mn is hardly suitable as an OER catalyst, however, at least the Mn-IV oxides remain stationarily present in the system.									14	0	1	0	0	0	15			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000476561000021	31070222

Current application of TMPs as electrodes is restricted by their limited electrochemical reaction activity and electrical conductivity. Herein, we report an effective strategy for fabricating highly porous oxygen doped NiCo-phosphides (O-NiCoP) immobilized in reduced graphene oxide network (O-NiCoP@rGO). The control of phosphorization degree is studied in this paper. Abundant interior and surface channels are created in O-NiCoP particles, leading to easy electrolyte infiltration and facilitated redox reaction kinetics. In addition, the rGO nanosheets functioned in providing continuous electron pathways and buffering interior stress of the electrode during redox reactions. The Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveals that the band gap can be eliminated during phosphorization, and the charge accumulation can be produced at the interface gap between graphene and O-NiCoP (001) plane after the introduction of graphene. The O-NiCoP@rGO electrode demonstrates superior capacitive performance with a remarkable capacitance of 1663.2 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and high capacitance retention of 89.3% after 5000 cycles at 5 A g(-1). Asymmetrical supercapacitors (ASCs) are also prepared demonstrating a high energy density of 21 Wh.kg(-1) at a power density of 775 W kg(-1) and predominant cycling performance (91.0% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 2 A g(-1)). The ASCs are used to light up LED bulbs and a mobile phone, further demonstrating its superior performance.									39	0	0	0	1	0	39			1359-8368	1879-1069		WOS:000509629400020

Herein, a hybrid of porous Co3O4 anchoring on MnO2, then interpenetrating with CNTs (Co3O4/MnO2-CNTs) is synthesized via facile hydrothermal process, and an AEM (CS/EMImC-Co-EP/GO) employing semi-interpenetrating network structure is fabricated with a simple solution-casting method. The porous nanoparticles and chrysalis-like hybrid as well as strong bi-metallic coupling effect build highways and buffer zones for reactant and electrons transfer for ORR/ OER. In addition, due to the competition of bottom Co atoms, the density functional theory (DFT) proves that the neighbor Mn sites (Mn1 and Mn2) of the MnO2(110) surface are evidently activated, which prompts the catalytic activity of hybrids by making the Mn1, Mn2 3d density of states move forward lower energy entirely. As a result, Co3O4/MnO2-CNTs exhibit superior ORR/OER activities with the low potential difference (Delta E) of 0.85 V and impressive performances in rechargeable aqueous zinc-air batteries (power density: 534 mW cm(-2)). Moreover, combining AEM integrated into rechargeable flexible all-solid-state zinc-air batteries and stack, the enhancement natures of wearable devices are achieved even under different bending angles benefiting from high hydroxyl anion conductivity and remarkable flexibility of AEM semi-interpenetrating network, which accelerates ion transport by the synergy of hopping and vehicle mechanisms. Furthermore, the flexible all-solid-state zinc-air batteries show excellent tolerance toxicity of CO2.									44	3	0	0	1	0	46			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000496445600043

Infrared spectroscopy was used to follow the photochemical evolution of the polymer either for solid films of PVP or for PVP irradiated in an aqueous solution. Chemical treatments (NH3, SF4) were carried out on the photooxidized samples, and aqueous solutions of PVP were characterized by viscometry and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Based on photooxidation results obtained in both the solid state and in an aqueous solution, a general mechanism that accounts for the main routes of oxidation is proposed. It was shown that the rates of oxidation and the stoichiometries of the reactions were strongly influenced by the physical state of the polymer (solid state or aqueous solution).

Association was the most commonly encountered primary product channel seen in the reactions of C60(2+): in keeping with earlier studies, there was a clear dependence of the efficiency of association (and of reactivity in general) upon the size of the neutral. Other product channels evident in the reactions of the dication were charge transfer (the major product channel seen in the reaction with diethyl ether) and hydroxide abstraction to form the ion C60OH+ (in the reactions with ethanol and 2-propanol). Charge transfer and hydroxide abstraction were seen in several reactions of the trication, C-60(.3+): association was observed as a minor channel in the reactions with methanol, ethanol, and 1 -propanol. A clear difference was observed in the reactivity of the polycationic adducts of alcohols and ethers: alcohol adducts were observed to react further by efficient proton transfer to the parent alcohol, whereas the adducts of ethers did not display subsequent proton transfer to the parent ether. This difference in reactivity is interpreted in terms of the difference in ease of proton loss from the structures ascribed to the fullerene polycation adducts of alcohols and ethers. The monocation C60.+ was unreactive with all of the species studied here: monocationic product ions (C60OH+, C60OR+) were also observed to be unreactive with the neutrals from which they were produced. The implications of the non-reactivity of C60.+ and the reactivity of C-60(2+) for the chemical evolution of interstellar clouds and circumstellar shells are briefly discussed.									52	0	0	0	1	0	52			0002-7863			WOS:A1993LT17300051

Understanding Structure-Property Relationships in Nanoparticle Electrocatalysts through Correlated Electron Microscopies								Microscopy and Microanalysis				27	suppl.1			52	3		10.1017/S1431927621000775				2021	2021	Summary form only given. Renewable energy-powered electrocatalytic conversion of simple, environmentally-abundant molecules, such as H2O and CO2, into useful fuels and chemicals is an important strategy for moving our society's towards sustainable development. However, many of these approaches are not economically viable yet because of the limitations of current electrocatalysts. Nanoparticles are attractive candidates for electrocatalytic applications owing to their high surface area to volume ratios and unique structure-derived properties. However, obtaining catalysts that are optimized in terms of activity, selectivity and stability is also challenging due to our incomplete understanding of the structure of catalysts that exists under reaction conditions. Although there have been significant advances in operando techniques that allow us to investigate the transformations that take place during reaction, most of these techniques are ensemble-averaging and thus, provide little insight into the local heterogeneities that can be found in nanoparticle catalysts. Electrochemical liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (EC-TEM) has seen rapid growth in recent years and is a promising approach for studying the dynamic behavior of nanoparticle electrocatalysts. Nevertheless, to rationalize the structure-property relationships in these materials, it is necessary that we extend the in situ observations across the length scales and develop methods that can measure the performance of the catalysts within the microfabricated electrochemical cells used for EC-TEM. In this presentation, I will describe the correlated electron microscopy approaches that we are exploring at the Fritz Haber Institute to address these challenges.To obtain detailed insight into the behavior of electrocatalysts across different length scales, we use a combination of in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) setups with similar electrochemical configurations. TEM provides the high-resolution image sequences that describe the behavior of catalysts under applied potential, whereas SEM provides comparable image sequences at lower spatial resolution but encompass a larger field-of-view with many catalyst nanoparticles. These holders also incorporate inlets for regular reference and counter electrodes to enable an accurate comparison with the results from benchtop electrochemical experiments. An additional ex situ TEM holder further allows us to perform detailed identical location characterization of the samples on the electrochemistry chips before and after reaction . The potential of such an approach for illuminating the dynamics that are present under reaction conditions is illustrated with experiments looking at the behavior of model electrocatalysts for carbon dioxide reduction and oxygen evolution. Opportunities for using the larger chamber of the SEM for adding complementary characterization capabilities will also be discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1431-9276			INSPEC:20807560

In the potential region of oxygen evolution, anodic oxidation resulted in electrode passivation (as evidenced by voltammetric measurements) allegedly due to the formation of a polymeric film on its surface. Phenol degradation increased with increasing temperature in the range investigated 30-80 degrees C and it was affected by the addition of Cl- and Br- anions in the supporting electrolyte. Complete conversion of 10 mM phenol was achieved after 37 Ah L-1 of charge passed at 80 degrees C under galvanostatic conditions (50 mA cm(-2)) in absence of Cl-. In contrast only 10 Ah L-1 were needed in the presence of 35 mM Cl-. The presence of chloride can induce reactions involving chlorohydroxyl radicals and electrogenerated oxidants such as free chlorine. On the other hand, addition of Br- slightly inhibited degradation possibly due to bromide scavenging of electrogenerated active species. Phenol degradation proceeded through the formation of three dominant, aromatic intermediates, namely 1,4-benzoquinone, hydroquinone and pyrocatechol, while total oxidation to CO2 was not significant unless harsh conditions (i.e. high temperatures and charges) were employed.

Its evolution through time is commonly reconstructed using the oxygen isotope and the clumped isotope compositions of carbonate archives. However, reaction kinetics involved in the precipitation of carbonates can introduce inaccuracies in the derived temperatures. Here, we show that dual clumped isotope analyses, i.e., simultaneous (47) and (48) measurements on the single carbonate phase, can identify the origin and quantify the extent of these kinetic biases. Our results verify theoretical predictions and evidence that the isotopic disequilibrium commonly observed in speleothems and scleractinian coral skeletons is inherited from the dissolved inorganic carbon pool of their parent solutions. Further, we show that dual clumped isotope thermometry can achieve reliable palaeotemperature reconstructions, devoid of kinetic bias. Analysis of a belemnite rostrum implies that it precipitated near isotopic equilibrium and confirms the warmer-than-present temperatures during the Early Cretaceous at southern high latitudes. Some palaeotemperature proxies suffer from inaccuracies related to kinetic fractionations occurring during carbonate mineral growth. Here, the authors show that dual clumped isotope thermometry can identify the origin of these kinetic biases and allows for the reconstruction of accurate environmental temperatures.									30	1	0	0	5	0	31			2041-1723			WOS:000561071600010	32778658

Materials generated via harsh random processes lose desirable physical characteristics. Loss of sp(2) conjugation inhibits long-range electronic transport and the potential for electronic band manipulation. Here, we present a nanopatterned holey graphene material electronically hybridized with metal-containing nanoparticles. Oxidative plasma etching of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite via previously developed covalent organic framework (COF)-5-templated patterning yields bulk-scale materials for electrocatalytic applications and fundamental investigations into band structure engineering of nanocomposites. We establish a broad ability (Ag, Au, Cu, and Ni) to grow metal-containing nanoparticles in patterned holes in a metal precursor-dependent manner without a reducing agent. Graphene nanoparticle compounds (GNCs) show metal-contingent changes in the valence band structure. Density functional theory investigations reveal preferences for uncharged metal states, metal contributions to the valence band, and embedding of nanoparticles over surface incorporation. Ni-GNCs show activity for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media (1 M KOH). Electrocatalytic activity exceeds 10,000 mA/mg of Ni, shows stability for 2 h of continuous operation, and is kinetically consistent via a Tafel slope with Ni(OH)(2)-based catalysis.									3	1	0	0	1	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000562182900075	32672929	
J	Shi, Kefei; Yang, Haojing; Lian, Yuebin; Peng, Yang								Hierarchical structure N-CoFe-C@NF derived from MOF for rechargeable zinc-air battery								CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE				64	32			3378	3384		10.1360/TB-2019-0539				2019	2019	Zinc-air battery is a high-efficient energy storage system with many advantages such as low-cost, high capacity and environmental-friendly. Theoretically, zinc-air battery has an energy density of about 1084 Wh/kg, which is much higher than that of traditional lithium ion battery. The performance of zinc-air battery is limited by sluggish reaction kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of air electrode, which requires the intense explore for the both activities. The well-known catalyst for ORR and OER is Pt/C and RuO2 individually, which are hindered by their high cost and scarcity. Recently, nitrogen doped metal carbide catalyst has emerged as a promising candidate for replacing Pt/C. Usually, the OER activity of nitrogen doped metal carbide structure is not as good as that of ORR, and the traditional bulk structure of catalyst on substrate electrode hinders the gas diffusion process, which can easily accumulated bubbles on the air electrode, and may lead to leakage of electrolyte solution. So hierarchical nitrogen doped metal carbide structure material is needed to accelerate the diffusion of both O-2 and electrolyte.Metal organic framework (MOF) is a kind of organic polymer generated by coordination between metal ions and organic ligand. So far, researchers have obtained MOF with various topological structures by using different metal ions and ligands to assemble it. MOF with ligands containing nitrogen can be converted to nitrogen doped metal carbide structure using annealing method under specific conditions. Moreover, the net-like structure of MOF contributes to a defect-rich and porous carbon structure of the product, which is essential to promote catalytic activity, and makes MOF ideal precursor for synthesizing nitrogen doped metal carbide catalyst. Prussian blue analogue (PBA) used in this research is a typical kind of MOF. PBA is generated by coordination between transition metal ions (Fe3+ and Co2+) and cyanide ion. With a simple cubic crystal structure, PBA is the first discovered MOFs, and has a history of being used as precursor for producing catalysts. However, because of ripening and other reasons, PBA usually collapse and achenes during the annealing process, which may reduce the surface area and hinder catalytic activity.Herein, we designed the nickel-foam-based Fe, Co bimetallic nanorod array structure, which was synthesized by in-situ conversion from cobalt hydroxide to PBA. It was used as a precursor for preparing the bimetallic nitrogen-doped catalyst. The material was analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-rays diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) etc. And the electrochemical performance of the catalyst was evaluated using rotating disk electrode (RDE) and electrochemical workstation. The as-prepared catalyst demonstrated decent ORR/OER activity, with an ORR half-wave potential of 0.81 V, and an OER overpotential of 300 mV under 10 mA/cm(2) current density in 1.0 mol/L KOH electrolyte. A zinc-air battery was also assembled using this material as the catalyst for air electrode, which possesses an open-circuit voltage of 1.29 V, as well as good stability and cyclicity.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			0023-074X	2095-9419		WOS:000503249700012		
J	Neamtu, M. C.; Parvu, Alina; Parvanescu, H.; Neamtu, L. R.; Vrabete, Maria								Could stored blood transfusions (SBT) alter the mechanisms implied in wound healing, in burned patients?								ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY AND EMBRYOLOGY				52	2			599	604						2011	2011	Several years ago, researchers reported several complications produced after blood transfusions such as transfusion reactions, the transmission of a variety of infectious agents, etc. Recently, many authors appreciate that the stored blood transfusions (SBT) create an important damage for patients' life, because of oxygen metabolism disturbances, induced earlier, after three repeated transfusions and maintained longtime after. Our study proposed to note the consequences of SBT on wound healing, in burned patients, who were submitted to skin grafting and remained in hospital for a long period. We tried estimate the pathophysiological mechanisms implied in microcirculation's failure, microvascular systemic deficiency and death. Results: Critically patients receiving SBT repeated frequently (six times/monthly for skin grafting) have an oscillatory outcomes depending by the reactivity of their biological terrain, as reflected by a several parameters we have measured. Conclusions: SBT administered as a restrictive transfusions to the patients with hemoglobin values < 8 g% and hematocrit < 35% has good effects on wound healing evolution.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1220-0522			WOS:000291871300011	21655649

Glutathione transferases (GSTs, EC 2.5.1.18) are ubiquitous and multifunctional conjugating proteins, which play a major role in stress responses by preventing oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Currently, understanding of their function(s) during different biochemical and signaling pathways under cold stress condition remain unclear. In this study, using combined computational strategy, we identified 65 Brassica oleracea glutathione transferases (BoGST) and characterized them based on evolutionary analysis into 11 classes. Inter-species and intra-species duplication was evident between BoGSTs and Arabidopsis GSTs. Based on localization analyses, we propose possible pathways in which GST genes are involved during cold stress. Further, expression analysis of the predicted putative functions for GST genes were investigated in two cold contrasting genotypes (cold tolerance and susceptible) under cold condition, most of these genes were highly expressed at 6 h and 1 h in the cold tolerant (CT) and cold susceptible (CS) lines, respectively. Overall, BoGSTU19, BoGSTU24, BoGSTF10 are candidate genes highly expressed in B. oleracea. Further investigation of GST superfamily in B. oleracea will aid in understanding complex mechanism underlying cold tolerance in plants.									31	2	1	0	25	0	35				1422-0067		WOS:000382337900025	27472324

Transition-metal sites with aqueous accessibility and local coordination flexibility are highly desirable in CPs for use as coordination-polymer-based electrocatalysts, but the challenge of structural assembly has limited their development. By analogy with the hydrogen bond cluster around the water-splitting center in photosystem II, the polycarboxylate aryl ether ligand and first-row transition-metal (Co and Ni) salts were employed to assemble CP-based electrocatalysts for water splitting. The obtained monometallic CPs, Co-HL (1) {[Co-2(HL)(H2O)(5)]center dot 3H(2)O}(n), Ni-HL (2) {[Ni-2(HL)(H2O)(5)]center dot 3H(2)O}(n), and bimetallic CPs, Co/Ni-HL, with different ratios of Co/Ni ions had semirigid isostructural frameworks and carboxylate-water hydrogen bond clusters around the transition-metal sites. The susceptibility of the hydrogen bond cluster and response of the local coordination environment to stimuli were examined by investigating the thermo-/solvatochromism performance of the CPs. The local hydrogen bond system within the CPs contributes to electron injection and the synergistic bimetallic effect to support electrochemical applications. Among the mono- and bimetallic CP materials, Co/Ni-HL(5:5), with a Co/Ni ratio of 5:5, exhibited the optimal water splitting performance. This bimetallic CP was grown in situ on FeNi foam to improve the conductivity, and the composite material exhibited excellent performance, with overpotentials of 258 mV for the OER and 90 mV for the HER at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope, and high faradaic efficiency. Overall water splitting generated a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.52 V with excellent durability; its performance was comparable to that of state-of-the-art materials for this application.									7	1	0	0	1	0	7			2574-0962			WOS:000595488500026

There is, however, a limited understanding of how vacancies influence charge storage properties. Here, using tungsten oxide as a model system, an extensive study of the effects of structure, electrical properties, and charge storage properties of oxygen vacancies is carried out using both experimental and computational techniques. The results provide direct evidence that oxygen vacancies increase the interlayer spacing in the oxide, which suppress the structural pulverization of the material during electrolyte ion insertion and removal in prolonged stability tests. Specifically, no capacitive decay is detected after 30 000 cycles. The medium states and charge storage mechanism of oxygen-deficient tungsten oxide throughout electrochemical charging/discharging processes is studied. The enhanced rate capability of the oxygen-deficient WO3-x is attributed to improved charge storage kinetics in the bulk material. The WO3-x electrode exhibits the highest capacitance in reported tungsten-oxide based electrodes with comparable mass loadings. The capability to improve electrochemical capacitance performance of redox-active materials is expected to open up new opportunities for ultrafast supercapacitive electrodes.									16	0	0	0	1	0	15			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000594773300001	33289327

Production of activated carbons with desired properties was accomplished by modification of surf ace functional groups and introduction of acidic[basic properties. Modification of an activated carbon was performed using partial oxygen gasification, nitric acid treatment, urea impregnation followed by pyrolysis and pyrolysis in a urea saturated stream. The surface properties of the produced samples were estimated by the multibasic titration method of Boehm and by the CO/CO2 gas evolution profiles, while pore structure development was measured by the N-2 and CO2 gas adsorption isotherms. Oxygen gasification resulted in samples with surface area slightly lower that the raw activated carbon; the introduction of surface functional groups depended upon the severity of the treatment: carbonylic and phenolic type groups were introduced in all partially gasified samples, while low temperatures and short reaction times enhanced the basic character of the carbon. However, nitric acid treatment resulted in the introduction of high nitrogen amounts in the samples, the reduction of surface area and the development of a surface containing carboxylic, lactonic, phenolic and carbonylic groups with negligible HCl neutralization capacity. Treatment of activated carbon by urea supported the formation of basic groups and carbonyls. The presence of surface functional groups affected the adsorption capacity of the produced samples for the removal of specific pollutants such as phenols. Urea treated samples with a basic character and high nitrogen content presented the highest phenol uptake capacity; nitric acid treated carbons and oxygen gasified samples presented an acidic surface functionality and a low phenol adsorption capacity. The beneficial role of nitrogen on phenol adsorption was attributed to adsorbate-adsorbent interactions. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We report here density functional theory (DFT) based first principles investigation of this novel system, where the C-atom at a particular site in the heterojunction region serves as active site. A systematic study has been carried out by changing the position and number of C-C and B-N units in the hetero nanoribbon of fixed width. Both odd and even number of width ribbons have been taken into consideration, in order to study the HER catalytic ability as a function of the ribbon width. Finally the catalyzing effect of various ribbons with different composition of C-C and B-N units has been demonstrated by free energy profile analysis.					63rd DAE Solid State Physics Symposium (DAE-SSPS)63rd DAE Solid State Physics Symposium (DAE-SSPS)	DEC 18-22, 2018DEC 18-22, 2018	Dept Atom Energy; Bhabha Atom Res Ctr; Govt India, Dept Atom Energy, Board Res Nucl SciDept Atom Energy; Bhabha Atom Res Ctr; Govt India, Dept Atom Energy, Board Res Nucl Sci	Guru Jambheshwar Univ Sci & Technol, Hisar, INDIAGuru Jambheshwar Univ Sci & Technol, Hisar, INDIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0094-243X		978-0-7354-1851-6	WOS:000504650100106

Intensive research has been embarked to study the thermal behavior and the decomposition patterns of the potential feedstock materials. Palm plantation waste, empty palm fruit's bunches (EFB) are used as a biomass source in this experiment. A comparison study was made using basic lignocellulosic model compounds such as hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin. The thermal stability of each compound in both oxygen and nitrogen environments was investigated. The degradation of model compounds were categorized into primary (200-400 degrees C) and secondary (500-800 degrees C) stages based on structural collapse and liquid/solid decompositions. Besides, the influence of inorganic substances in EFB degradation was reported whereby the mineral contents act as a catalyst by enhancing the decomposition at lower temperatures compared to demineralized EFB. In addition, the product gas evolutions from the gasification reaction of the components were analyzed using online mass spectrometer. The gas production patterns indicate the nature of the compounds in terms of thermal stability, functional group cleavages and catalytic reactions.

The silica-coated PANI colloidal nanospheres were further subjected to pyrolysis treatment at different temperatures (400-950 degrees C) to fabricate the nitrogen-doped carbon shells (NCSs). The NCSs so obtained were found to have controllable morphologies and pore sizes (13.4-23.2 nm). A possible structural evolution of the PANI colloids during pyrolysis process is proposed based on results obtained from a variety of characterization techniques. Upon loading Pt metal, the supported Pt/NCS catalysts were found to exhibit superior catalytic performance during electrooxidation of methanol, surpassing that of the conventional Pt/Vulcan XC-72 catalyst. The effects of nitrogen doping and carbon shell structure on Pt dispersion, tolerance of CO poisoning, and electrochemical properties are also examined and discussed.									89	2	0	0	4	1	91			0959-9428	1364-5501		WOS:000268885900018

Given reduced condition in lower part of the upper mantle, taking redox budget from lithospheric mantle into consideration is crucial in redefining redox state there. To constrain to which extent subducted slab modified redox state of the uppermost mantle and how much oxygen budget slab carried into deep Earth, we investigated redox kinetics of olivine adopting diffusion couple method at 1 GPa and 1,373-1573 K in a piston cylinder apparatus. It is found that redox process in olivine is diffusion-controlled, and diffusing on the order of 10(-12) m(2)/s at 1473 K. Oxidation process in reduced part is oxygen fugacity (fO(2))-independent with activation enthalpy of 235 +/- 56 kJ/mol, while reduction process in oxidized part is fO(2)-dependent with an fO(2) exponent of 2/5. Diffusion profile analysis reveals that for magnetite-free couple, redox process is controlled by oxygen grain boundary diffusion (GBD) below Delta FMQ + 1, and rate-limited by faster species which might be hydrogen related Mg vacancy above Delta FMQ + 1. However, for magnetite-bearing couple, oxygen GBD dominates redox process across wide fO(2) range. The extremely slow rate limits the homogenization of the slab with surrounding mantle so that redox state of the uppermost mantle remains unchanged in the past 3.5 Gyrs. A highly underestimated oxygen reservoir may have formed in deep Earth, when subducted slab transports oxidized components to region deeper than the mantle transition zone.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-9313	2169-9356		WOS:000765643700021

Herein, a unique anode-cathode interchangeable electrocatalysis strategy is proposed for methanol upgrading reaction (MUR) and hydrogen co-generation in membrane-free electrolyzer. A periodical electrolysis is taken place for the Ni3S2/CNTs electrode at positive/negative currents over time. Compared with the traditional chronopotentiometry mode, the MUR-HER coupled reactions by periodically switching anode/cathode per hour present an excellent long-term stability at high current densities of & PLUSMN; 100 mA cm(-2), in which the Faradaic efficiencies for both H-2 and value-added formate are greater than 95%. Substantial experimental results and deep theoretical DFT studies signify that the successful application of this strategy is mainly due to the reversible modulation of oxidation/hydroxylation status on Ni3S2 surface, which effectively prevent the surface active structures of electrocatalysts from over-oxidation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000783004100002

In this study a new oxygen scavenger called cobalt (II) oxalate nanoparticles powder was in the incorporated in glass and PET bottle screw-caps. It improves the shelf life of retailed olive oil packaging during storage. The effect of oxygen scavenger system on olive oil acidity, peroxide value and spectrophotometric indices (K232, K270) was evaluated at 6 intervals (monthly) at 25 degrees C in light conditions. Chemical and physical properties of cobalt (II) oxalate nanoparticles adsorbent were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscope and X-ray Diffraction analyses. The results showed that 1 g of cobalt (II) oxalate nanoparticles powder decreased packaged olive oil peroxide value and acidity by about 30%. Olive oil packaged in glass containers (sealed with cobalt (II) oxalate nanoparticles), significantly, showed less peroxide value and acidity by 95% more likely than in PET containers. Physical properties of synthesized cobalt (II) oxalate nanoparticles approved the pure beta-cobalt oxalate formation. This study showed that cobalt (II) oxalate nanoparticles have potential to be used in the food packaging industry as a new oxygen scavenger.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2193-4126	2193-4134		WOS:000784851600005

CoSe2, as one of transition-metal chalcogenides, has attracted particular attention because of its abundant resource, low cost, high efficiency and stability. However, further enhancing catalytic activity of CoSe2 to meet the large-scale application requirements of hydrogen energy remains an important challenge. Herein, three-dimension (3D) Mo-doped porous CoSe2 nanosheet array was directly formed on commercial Ni foam (Mo-CoSe2 NS@NF) electrode through a three-step process including electrodeposition, hydrothermal and subsequent selenylation. Systematically experimental research and density functional theory calculations confirmed that, based on active site and intermediate modulation effect of Mo doping, the obtained 3D Mo-CoSe2 NS@NF electrodes were provided with enlarged electrochemical active surface area, improved charge transport capability and significantly optimized binding energy for active intermediates of the potential-limiting step, thus exhibiting remarkably boosted bifunctional electrocatalytic ability with a low overpotential of 89 and 234 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, respectively. When the Mo-CoSe2 NS@NF electrode was employed as both a cathode and an anode, an advanced water electrolyzer was fabricated, and a 10 mA cm(-2) water splitting current density in 1 M KOH solution could be acquired at a minimal cell voltage of 1.54 V. In addition, we also inferred that the active surface for the OER was O* covered CoSe2, and OER occurred through direct recombination mechanism according to the present first-principles simulation. This work offers an atomistic understanding on the boosted HER and OER electrocatalytical activity of CoSe2 by Mo doping, and develops a promising strategy for exploring advanced low-cost and earth-abundant water splitting electrocatalysts to substitute for the precious-metallic catalysts as well.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000653229500093

Fe2+ ion-exchanged resin serves as a precursor for both FeOOH nanocubes and carbon ribbons, which are formed simultaneously. The as-prepared FeOOH cubes are proposed to have a core-shell structure, with FeOOH as the shell and Prussian blue as the core, based on information from XPS, TEM, and EDS mapping. As a cathode material for Li/O-2 batteries, FeOOH delivers a specific capacity of 14816mAhg(cathode)(-1) with a cycling stability of 67 cycles over 400h. The high performance is related to the low overpotential of the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction on FeOOH. The cube structure, the supporting carbon ribbons, and the -OOH moieties all contribute to the low overpotential. The discharge product Li2O2 can be efficiently decomposed in the FeOOH cathode after a charging process, leading to higher cycling stability. Its high activity and stability make FeOOH a good candidate for use in non-aqueous Li/O-2 batteries.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000460678500028	30618062

Ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) based Li-air cell using this double-layer electrode as air cathode exhibits significant improvement in discharge/charge electrochemical performance but suffers from electrolyte decomposition as proved by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurements. In 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) based electrolyte, CoOx/DLC double layer electrode shows high catalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Furthermore, over 30 cycles is achieved with a capacity of more than 2000 mAh g(-1) by using CoOx/DLC double layer electrode, which makes it a promising air electrode for Li-air batteries.

However, excess light can be harmful for the photosynthetic apparatus because it produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause photoinhibition. Oxygenic organisms evolved photoprotection mechanisms to counteract light-dependent ROS production, including preventive dissipation of excited states of chlorophyll ((1)Chl*) into heat in the process termed non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). This consists in the activation of (1)Chl* quenching reactions when the thylakoid luminal pH drops below 5.2. In turn, acidification occurs when the rate of the CO2 reducing cycle is saturated and cannot regenerate ADP+P-i, thus inhibiting ATPase activity and the return of protons (H+) to the stromal compartment. The major and fastest component of NPQ is energy quenching, qE, which in algae depends on the Light-Harvesting Complex Stress-Related (LHCSR) proteins. In mosses, LHCSR proteins have remained the major catalysts of energy dissipation, but a minor contribution also occurs via a homologous protein, Photosystem II Subunit S (PSBS). In vascular plants, however, LHCSR has disappeared and PSBS is the only pH-sensitive trigger of qE. Why did PSBS replace LHCSR in the later stages of land colonization? Both PSBS and LHCSR belong to the Light Harvesting Complex superfamily (LHC) and share properties such as harboring protonatable residues that are exposed to the chloroplast lumen, which is essential for pH sensing. However, there are also conspicuous differences: LHCSR binds chlorophylls and xanthophylls while PSBS does not, implying that the former may well catalyse quenching reactions while the latter needs pigment-binding partners for its quenching function. Here, the evolution of quenching mechanisms for excess light is reviewed with a focus on the role of LHCSR versus PSBS, and the reasons for the redundancy of LHCSR in vascular plants as PSBS became established.									21	3	1	0	15	0	23			0022-0957	1460-2431		WOS:000503022600003	31424076	
J	Gantt, Elisabeth								Oxygenic photosynthesis and the distribution of chloroplasts								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				107	1			1	6		10.1007/s11120-010-9605-1				JAN 2011	2011	The integrated functioning of two photosystems (I and II) whether in cyanobacteria or in chloroplasts is the outstanding sign of a common ancestral origin. Many variations on the basic theme are currently evident in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms whether they are prokaryotes, unicellular, or multicellular. By conservative estimates, oxygenic photosynthesis has been around for at least ca. 2.2-2.7 billions years, consistent with cyanobacteria-type microfossils, biomarkers, and an atmospheric rise in oxygen to less than 1.0% of the present concentration. The presumptions of chloroplast formation by the cyanobacterial uptake into a eukaryote prior to 1.6 BYa ago are confounded by assumptions of host type(s) and potential tolerance of oxygen toxicity. The attempted dating and interrelationships of particular chloroplasts in various plant or animal lineages has relied heavily on phylogenomic analysis and evaluations that have been difficult to confirm separately. Many variations occur in algal groups, involving the type and number of accessory pigments, and the number(s) of membranes (2-4) enclosing a chloroplast, which can both help and complicate inferences made about early or late origins of chloroplasts. Integration of updated phylogenomics with physiological and cytological observations remains a special challenge, but could lead to more accurate assumptions of initial and extant endosymbiotic event(s) leading toward stable chloroplast associations.									6	1	0	0	4	0	6			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000286199300001	21190136

We examined the use of the 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H(2)DCFDA) fluorescent dye to detect ONOO-/ONOOH in plasma activated non-buffered water (PAW) or buffered solution (PAPB) generated by DC-driven self-pulsed transient spark discharge at atmospheric pressure in ambient air. The diagnostic selectivity of H(2)DCFDA to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) typical of plasma activated aqueous solutions was examined by using various scavengers of RONS. This cross-reactivity study showed the highest sensitivity of the H(2)DCFDA dye to ONOO-/ONOOH. However, besides ONOO-/ONOOH, H(2)DCFDA also exhibited sensitivity to hypochlorite anions/hypochlorous acid (OCl-/HOCl), showing that for a selective study it is important to have an idea about the possible constituents in the studied solutions. The sensitivity of H(2)DCFDA to other RONS even in much higher concentrations was negligible. The presence of nitrites (NO2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in PAW led predominantly to the production of peroxynitrous acid with a strong fluorescence response of H(2)DCFDA in PAW. Plasma treatment of buffered solutions led to the weak response of H(2)DCFDA. The fluorescence induced in PAW decreased after scavenging individual reactants, namely NO2- and H2O2, as well as by scavenging the product of the peroxynitrite forming reaction, proving that the fluorescence response of H(2)DCFDA is primarily due to the formation of ONOO-/ONOOH. A chemical kinetics analysis of post-discharge processes and the pseudo-second order reaction between H2O2 and NO2- confirms formation of peroxynitrous acid in PAW with a rate in the order of tens of nM per second. The post-discharge evolution of the ONOOH formation rate was clearly correlated with the parallel detection of ONOO-/ONOOH by fluorescence spectroscopy using the H(2)DCFDA dye.									31	0	0	0	10	0	31			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000474599300025	30982833

Perovskite-related oxides containing Fe and Co ions, Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta, Ca2FeCoO5, and CaFe0.5Co0.5O3, have been reported as potential OER catalysts, and the Fe-Co mixing in these oxides has been found to synergistically enhance OER activity. However, this effect has not been verified in quadruple perovskite oxides, including CaCu3Fe4O12, which exhibits the highest OER catalytic activity among perovskite oxide catalysts. We therefore synthesized CaCu3Fe4-xCoxO12 with 0 <= x <= 4 using a high-pressure/high-temperature method and investigated their catalytic properties for the OER and HER. Rietveld analyses based on synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements revealed that all the CaCu3Fe4-xCoxO12 samples crystallized into almost single-phase solid solutions between x = 0 and 4 with a homogeneous distribution of Fe/Co cations over the entire x range. At x > 0.5, Fe-Co mixing improved the overpotentials and specific activity for both the OER and HER relative to those of the parent compounds, reaching broad maxima at 2 <= x <= 3, thus resulting in the first appearance of synergistic effects on the catalytic activities of quadruple perovskite catalysts. In contrast, at x <= 0.5, this positive synergistic effect disappeared for the OER and even became negative for the HER. Bond valence sum analyses and X-ray absorption spectroscopy clarified that the positive effects were caused by the isovalent substitution of Co similar to 3+ by Fe similar to 3+ on the CaCu3Co4O12 side at x > 0.5, whereas the negative effect was triggered by the aliovalent substitution of Fe similar to 4+ by Co similar to 3+ on the CaCu3Fe4O12 side at x <= 0.5. This information provides an effective strategy for further enhancing the catalytic activities of complex transition metal oxides in multiple valence-variable elements.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000740459700001

This technique relies on the quantitative detection of O-2 generated at the NiOx(hydr.) \ Au disk electrode during a linear potential scan, by the concentric, bare Au-ring electrode, which can then be used to determine contributions to the disk current (I-disk) derived solely from O-2 evolution. Subtraction of such contributions from I-disk in the potential range positive to the trailing edge of the peak ascribed to the oxidation of the NiOx(hydr.) film revealed a constant, positive current when the voltage was scanned in the positive direction, and a constant. negative current, albeit of smaller magnitude, in the subsequent scan in the negative direction. This observation suggests that once account is made for O-2 evolution, the NiOx(hydr.) \ Au-electrolyte interface in that potential range (0.5-0.65 V vs. Hg\HgO,OH-), behaves as a (pseudo) capacitor, a model that was further confirmed by monitoring the current as a function of the scan rate. The actual values of this pseudocapacitance were found to be on the order of ca. 80 kF mol(-1) Ni sites in the film (or equivalently, ca. 0.1 e(-) per Ni site within the potential range specified above) and, thus, very similar to those reported earlier based on current interruption-potential decay and impedance measurements for O-2 evolution on NiOx(hydr.) grown on Ni electrodes. Implications of these results to the mechanism of self-discharge of NiOx(hydr.) electrodes for alkaline secondary batteries are discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

We demonstrate here that this technique is not innocent. Polarization of the electrode against an Ag/AgCl electrode leads to a time-dependent formation of hydrogen peroxide by two-electron reduction of dissolved oxygen continuously supplied by the flow buffer. While the miss and double hit parameters are almost unaffected by H2O2, a time dependent reduction of S-1 to S-1 occurs over a time period of 20 mm. The S-1 reduction can be largely prevented by adding catalase or by removing O-2 from the flow buffer with N-2. Importantly, we demonstrate that even at the shortest possible polarization times (40 s in our set up) the S-2 and S-0 decays are significantly accelerated by the side reaction with H2O2. The removal of hydrogen peroxide leads to unperturbed S-2 state data that reveal three instead of the traditionally reported two phases of decay. In addition, even under the best conditions (catalase + N-2; 40 s polarization) about 4% of S-1 state is observed in well dark-adapted samples, likely indicating limitations of the equal fit approach.

Generally, the effects of magnetic field enhanced electrocatalysis are complex including magnetothermal, magnetohydrodynamic and spin selectivity effects. However, the exploration of magnetic field effect on the structure regulation of electrocatalyst is still unclear whereas is also essential for underpinning the mechanism of magnetic enhancement on the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process. Here, it is identified that in a mixed NiFe2O4 (NFO), a large magnetic field can force the Ni2+ cations to migrate from the octahedral (O-h) sites to tetrahedral (T-d) sites. As a result, the magnetized NFO electrocatalyst (NFO-M) shows a two-fold higher current density than that of the pristine NFO in alkaline electrolytes. The OER enhancement of NFO is also observed at 1 T (NFO@1T) under an operando magnetic field. Our first-principles calculations further confirm the mechanism of magnetic field driven structure regulation and resultant OER enhancement. These findings provide a strategy of manipulating tetrahedral units of spinel oxides by a magnetic field on boosting OER performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000853913600001	36108133

The protonated g-C3N4 combines with the sheet-like Co MOF to form a 2D/2D heterojunction via electrostatic self-assembly. The protonated g-C3N4 and 2D Co-MOF directionally adsorb Eosin Y (EY) and triethanolamine (TEOA) molecules through hydrogen bond and complexation to achieve a whole photocatalytic system. The integral structure effectively facilitates the utilization of dye sensitizer and hole sacrificial agent to achieve the effective and stable photocatalytic H-2 evolution capacity. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of g-C3N4 after protonation is 1.88 times as high as that of the original g-C3N4. On the basis of 2D/2D heterojunction, Co MOF is doped with rare earth element Sm. The 4f electrons and the difference valences (Sm3+ and Co2+) further suppress the reorganization of photogenerated excitons to achieve highly efficient photocatalytic HER. The directional coupling of sensitizer and electron sacrificial agent combined with rare earth element doping makes the photocatalytic HER rate of the composite material reached 73.42 mu mol.h(-1) within 5 h under simulated sunlight.

The synthesis of the LDH compounds has been accomplished either directly by coprecipitation of the respective hydroxides with sulfonate anions or by ion-exchange of the chloride-containing LDH with sodium dodecylsulfate. Exfoliation of the bulk material in formamide yields colloidal suspensions of positively charged nanosheets with lateral dimensions of tens to hundreds of nanometers and thicknesses down to 1.3 nm, ascertained by TEM and AFM. Flocculation of the LDH nanosheets with an aqueous graphene oxide suspension yields a hybrid material that can be converted to a reduced graphene oxide/LDH composite by hydrazine reduction. The hybrid materials were tested for pseudocapacitive electrochemical storage capacity and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reactions and showed significant increases compared to the pristine materials.									35	4	0	0	0	0	37			0743-7463			WOS:000322416700021	23790139

Microwave loss evolutions of Ba0.6Sr0.4La4Ti4O15 were investigated emphatically utilizing thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC). The sintering behavior, crystal structure and microwave dielectric properties were contrasted mutually. X-ray diffraction confirms that single phase solid solutions are achieved with a hexagonal perovskite structure. And the addition of the sintering aid causes the movement of diffraction peaks to low angles. Due to the incorporation into lattice, the sintering characteristic has not been improved by the sintering aid. With ZnO and WO3, BSLT sintered at 1500 A degrees C demonstrates microwave dielectric properties of epsilon(r) = 46, Qf = 21,100 GHz and tau (f) = - 4.6 ppm/A degrees C. Especially, the Qf value displays an obvious drop from 48,600 to 21,100 GHz, thus a near zero tau (f) value may be achieved. The extrinsic loss mechanism associated with defects chemistry is explored and TSDC spectra indicate a distinct difference induced by the sintering aid. It can be manifested that the Qf variation originates in the different concentration of oxygen vacancies in host dielectrics.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000441296500055

The obtainedhierarchical nanowire array architecture affords abundant surface-active sites and is conducive to permeate electrolytes. The surfaceadsorption/desorption behavior of the heterostructure catalyst wasoptimized through regulating MoS2concentration. Owing to the synergistic effect of metal Ni and Co and the interaction of the(NiCo)S2@MoS2heterostructure, (NiCo)S2@MoS2/CC-2 delivers a relatively low overpotential of 74 mV at a current density of 10mA cm-2and displays a small Tafel slope of 54 mV dec-1for HER catalysis, surpassing that of the recently reported MoS2-basedelectrocatalysts.

Our results show that, although it undertakes many structural transitions under pressure, CO2 is quite resistive to structures with C beyond 4-fold coordination. For the first time, we are able to identify two 6-fold structures of solid CO2 with Pbcn and Pa (3) over bar symmetries that become stable at pressures dose to 1 TPa. Both structures consist of a network of C-O octahedra, showing hypervalence of the central C atoms. The C-O bond length varies from 1.30 to 1.34 angstrom at the 4-fold to 6-fold transition, close to the C-O distance in the transition state of a corresponding S(N)2 reaction. It has been a longstanding and challenging objective to stabilize C in a hypervalent state, particularly when it is bonded with nonmetallic elements. Most of the work so far has focused on synthesizing organic molecules with a high coordination number of C. Our results provide a good measure of the resistivity of C toward forming hypervalent compounds with nonmetallic elements and of the barrier of reaction involving C-O bonds.									107	6	0	0	8	0	108			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000330162900036	24004352

Herein, Ni-M-MOF (M=Fe, Al, Co, Mn, Zn, and Cd) NSs are reported with a thickness of only several atomic layers, prepared by a large-scale, bottom-up solvothermal method. The solvent mixture of N,N-dimethylacetamide and water plays key role in controlling the formation of these two-dimensional MOF NSs. The MOF NSs can be directly used as efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction, in which the Ni-Fe-MOF NSs deliver a current density of 10mAcm(-2) at a low overpotential of 221mV with a small Tafel slope of 56.0mVdec(-1), and exhibit excellent stability for at least 20h without obvious activity decay. Density functional theory calculations on the energy barriers for OER occurring at different metal sites confirm that Fe is the active site for OER at Ni-Fe-MOF NSs.									285	17	0	0	16	0	287			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000476423300038	30913361

Its efficiency depends on the well-defined interfaces between two semiconductors for the charge kinetics and their exposed surfaces for chemical reactions. Herein, we report a facile cation-exchange approach to obtain compounds with both properties without the need for noble metals by forming Janus-like structures consisting of gamma-MnS and Cu7S4 with high-quality interfaces. The Janus-like gamma-MnS/Cu7S4 structures displayed dramatically enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production rates of up to 718 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) under full-spectrum irradiation. Upon further integration with an MnOx oxygen-evolution cocatalyst, overall water splitting was accomplished with the Janus structures. This work provides insight into the surface and interface design of hybrid photocatalysts, and offers a noble-metal-free approach to broadband photocatalytic hydrogen production.									141	7	0	0	17	0	141			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000397599500020	28296159

Among the earth-abundant first-row transition metal-based catalysts, mixed Ni-Fe oxides have shown promising performance for effective and low-cost catalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, but the synergistic roles of Fe and Ni cations in the OER mechanism remain unclear. In this work, we report how addition of Ni changes the reactivity of a model iron oxide catalyst, based on Ni deposited on and incorporated in a magnetite Fe3O4(001) single crystal, using a combination of surface science techniques in ultra-high vacuum such as low energy electron diffraction (LEED), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), as well as atomic force microscopy (AFM) in air, and electrochemical methods such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in alkaline media. A significant improvement in the OER activity is observed when the top surface presents an iron fraction among the cations in the range of 20-40%, which is in good agreement with what has been observed for powder catalysts. Furthermore, a decrease in the OER overpotential is observed following surface aging in electrolyte for three days. At higher Ni load, AFM shows the growth of a new phase attributed to an (oxy)-hydroxide phase which, according to CV measurements, does not seem to correlate with the surface activity towards OER. EIS suggests that the OER precursor species observed on the clean and Ni-modified surfaces are similar and Fe-centered, but form at lower overpotentials when the surface Fe:Ni ratio is optimized. We propose that the well-defined Fe3O4 (001) surface can serve as a model system for understanding the OER mechanism and establishing the structure-reactivity relation on mixed Fe-Ni oxides.

The volume of oxygen produced from the reaction of the enzyme catalase with hydrogen peroxide was followed. A linear correlation was demonstrated between total O-2 evolution and H2O2 concentration in the range 0.25-1.5% for on-line assays and 25-500 mg/l and 0.38-3% for the off-line method. A response time of 17 min was obtained for the off-line for hydrogen peroxide concentrations of 25-500 mg/l. The response time of an on-line version of the method was approximately 5 min for hydrogen peroxide concentrations of 0.25-1.5%. The technique was not significantly temperature sensitive in the range 25-45 degrees C. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Finding a proper inert anode active in oxygen evolution has been a research topic for electrochemists to have a green process of aluminum electrolysis. A thin layer of diamond coating on silicon substrate has shown some promises.

J	Ruan, Man; Zhao, Yan-Xia; He, Sheng-Gui				zhao, yanxia/G-8679-2011				Study on the Reaction of Nanosized Yttrium Oxide Cluster Anions with n-Butane in the Gas Phase								ACTA CHIMICA SINICA				79	4			490	499		10.6023/A20110511				APR 15 2021	2021	Investigation on the reactions of atomically precise transition metal oxide nanoparticles with small molecules can not only identify the property evolution of nanoparticles with respect to the continuum change of size and composition, but also improve our understanding of the formation mechanism of reactive oxygen species [e.g., atomic oxygen radical anions (O-center dot radicals)] over oxide surface. Yttrium oxide cluster anions YxOy- (x <= 50, y <= 76) with different oxygen deficiencies (Delta equivalent to 2y-1-3x, Delta=0 similar to 5) and YxOyF- ( x <= 49, y <= 74) with Delta=1 [Delta equivalent to(2y+1)-1-3x] have been prepared by laser ablation in an O-2 background and reacted with alkane molecules (n-butane) in a fast flow reactor. The reactions of mass-selected small-sized YxOy- (x <= 8) clusters with n-butane were investigated in a linear ion trap reactor. Time-of-flight mass spectrometer was used to detect the cluster distribution before and after the reactions. The observation of (Y2O3)(N)OH- (N=1 similar to 25), (Y2O3)(N)YO4H- (N=1, 3 similar to 24), and (Y2O3)(N)YO2FH- (N=1 similar to 24) products suggest that (Y2O3)(N)O- (Delta=1; N=1 similar to 25), (Y2O3)(N)YO4- (Delta=4; N=1, 3 similar to 24) and (Y2O3)(N)YO2F- (Delta=1; N=1 similar to 24) can bring about hydrogen-atom abstraction (HAA) from n-butane. The reactivity of (Y2O3)(N)O-, (Y2O3 Delta NYO2F- and (Y2O3)NYO4- clusters are significantly size-dependent and the highest reactivity was observed for N=3 (Y6O10-, Y7O11F-, and Y2O13-). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the geometrical structures and unpaired spin densities of (Y2O3)N-O- (N=1 similar to 4), (Y2O3)(N)YO2F- (N= 1 similar to 3), and (Y2O3)(N)YO4- (N=1, 3, 4) clusters that were found to contain O-center dot radicals as active centers to abstract hydrogen atoms from n-butane, in agreement with the experiments. The results imply that the O-center dot radicals which had been proved to be present in the small yttrium oxide clusters with Delta=1 or 4 are well preserved in the yttrium oxide nanoparticles. (Y2O3)(N)YO4- (Delta=4; N=1, 3 similar to 24) and (Y2O3)(N)YO2F- (Delta=1; N=1 similar to 24) can be considered to be generated by the adsorption of an O-2 molecule or F onto the unreactive singlet (Y2O3)(N)YO2- (Delta=0; N=1 similar to 24). The studies on gas-phase clusters suggest that adsorption of O-2 molecule or F atom onto unreactive metal oxide clusters will result in the generation of O-center dot radical (O-2(-) + O-2 -> O-center dot+O2- and O-2(-)+F -> O-center dot+F-).This work not only reveals the new mechanisms of the formation of O-center dot radical on metal oxide surfaces, but also provides new insights into the design of novel transition metal oxide- based catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7351			WOS:000693682700011

A highly concentrated Fe-38 atm.% Y2O3 ODS model alloy was processed by reactive ball milling and annealing of YFe3 and Fe2O3 powders so as to induce the chemical reaction 2YFe(3) + Fe2O3 -> 8Fe + Y2O3. The model alloy was characterised after milling and annealing by complementary techniques, including atom probe tomography. Ball milling up to the stationary state results in the formation of two metastable nanometric interconnected phases: super-saturated alpha-iron and an yttrium and oxygen rich phase. Annealing leads the system towards equilibrium through: (i) a chemical evolution of each phase to nearly pure alpha-Fe and Y2O3 oxide slightly sub-stoichiometric in oxygen; and (ii) growth of the phases. A pure iron matrix reinforced by nanometric Y2O3 particles was successfully synthesised by reactive ball milling and annealing. (C) 2009 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

One-pot solvothermal synthesis of highly catalytic Janus transition metal phosphides (TMPs) for high performance OER								FUEL				331						125913	10.1016/j.fuel.2022.125913				JAN 1 2023	2023	Green hydrogen is a highly efficient and affordable energy carrier for imminent energy supply. First time, this work demonstrates the crystalline TMPs synthesized by one-pot solvothermal method. M12P5 (M = Ni, Co, Ni-Co) nanoparticles deposited on conducting surface of nickel foam (M12P5@NF) serving as highly auspicious oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrode. Our findings demonstrate that the M12P5@NF electrodes can be cast-off as capable Janus catalysts for OER. The onset potential for OER of Janus Co12P5 befalls at 1.29 VRHE and possesses a current density of 10 mAcm- 2 just at overpotential of only 160 mV. Intriguingly, Co12P5 reveals the low Tafel slope value of 33 mVdec- 1. The onset potential for Ni12P5, (Ni-Co)12P5 electrodes are 1.30 and 1.46 VRHE, decade current density obtained just at bias of 300 and 340 mV, respectively. These electrocatalysts unveil the worthy electro-active zone, as compared to that of other reported nickel and cobalt based materials. These electro-catalysts also sustain an amazing stability during long-term stability experiments. Ni, Co and (Ni-Co)-phosphides show high TOF value of 8.5, 11.37 and 5.1 s-1 and mass activity of 119, 68 and 48 A g-1 respectively at over potential of 350 mV which is an indicative of rapid electrochemical reaction and charge transfer kinetics of electrocatalyst. The catalytic enactment of Co12P5 is several folds superior than avant-garde catalysts (RuO2 and IrO2) under the similar set of conditions. The greater OER activity of M12P5 at such low overpotential is attributed to the mutual consequence of high electroactive sites at exterior of catalytic surface and auspicious interaction generated among intrinsically dynamic 3d-transition metal i.e. Ni, Co and phosphorous. TMPs are efficient and non-precious metal centered materials, which unwraps new prospects to exploit water electrolysis for green hydrogen fuel.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000868700200003

Herein, cobalt molybdenum suboxides (Co2Mo3O8) supported on Ni foam are reduced from their corresponding oxide precursors and first used as efficient electrocatalysts for the HER in alkaline electrolyte. The catalytic activity is further improved through the construction of a unique hierarchical Co2Mo3O8/Co/NF nanostructure. With a very low onset overpotential (approximate to 9 mV), this electrocatalyst only requires overpotentials of 50 mV and 137 mV to drive current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. After 5000 cycles, a slight increase of approximate to 6 mV in the overpotential to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) verifies the excellent stability of Co2Mo3O8/Co/NF during the alkaline HER process.									43	5	0	0	2	0	44			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000428089500032

Interestingly, Sirh7/Ldoc1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited abnormal placental cell differentiation/maturation, leading to an overproduction of placental progesterone (P4) and placental lactogen 1 (PL1) from trophoblast giant cells (TGCs). The placenta is an organ that is essential for mammalian viviparity and plays a major endocrinological role during pregnancy in addition to providing nutrients and oxygen to the fetus. P4 is an essential hormone in the preparation and maintenance of pregnancy and the determination of the timing of parturition in mammals; however, the biological significance of placental P4 in rodents is not properly recognized. Here, we demonstrate that mouse placentas do produce P4 in mid-gestation, coincident with a temporal reduction in ovarian P4, suggesting that it plays a role in the protection of the conceptuses specifically in this period. Pregnant Sirh7/Ldoc1 knockout females also displayed delayed parturition associated with a low pup weaning rate. All these results suggest that Sirh7/ Ldoc1 has undergone positive selection during eutherian evolution as a eutherian-specific acquired gene because it impacts reproductive fitness via the regulation of placental endocrine function.									42	0	0	0	36	0	44			0950-1991	1477-9129		WOS:000346431900012	25468940

The objectives of the research program named COMEDI, initiated at LMPM-ENSMA, in collaboration with CCR-EADS, LIM ENSAM and supported by the - French - Research National Agency ANR, are to better understand these couplings and to develop a numerical tool capable to predict the evolution of the mechanical behavior of a composite laminate subjected to a thermal ageing. In this paper, on one hand the expression of the interactions between mechanics, oxygen diffusion and chemical reaction will be deduced from thermodynamics concepts for a neat resin material. On the other hand, interest will be put on the development of a 'user' finite element involving the first disposable couplings: matrix shrinkage and evolution of the elastic modulus with oxidation. An application will be presented in the case of a unidirectional CFRP composite model, which gives the stress field around carbon fibers induced by the oxidation of the matrix. At last, a specific experimental device developed at the laboratory will be presented. This heated and pressurized vessel will allow performing accelerated thermal aging tests of samples submitted to constant deformation in order to put coupling effects under evidence, as well as to improve and validate the modeling approach.

Its rate is controlled by a number of low-energy resonances and a slowly varying nonresonant component. Three new resonances at E-p = 156.2, 189.5, and 259.7 keV have recently been observed and confirmed. However, significant uncertainty on the reaction rate remains due to the nonresonant process and to two suggested resonances at E-p = 71 and 105 keV. Here, new Ne-22(p,gamma)Na-23 data with high statistics and low background are reported. Stringent upper limits of 6 x 10(-11) and 7 x 10(-11) eV (90% confidence level), respectively, are placed on the two suggested resonances. In addition, the off-resonant S factor has been measured at unprecedented low energy, constraining the contributions from a subthreshold resonance and the direct capture process. As a result, at a temperature of 0.1 GK the error bar of the Ne-22(p,gamma)Na-23 rate is now reduced by 3 orders of magnitude.									24	1	0	0	0	0	24			0031-9007	1079-7114		WOS:000448059200003	30411966

First, composite NFs consisting of RuO2 fibrous mainframes adorned with tiny Au nanoparticles are synthesized by electrospinning and calcination. The following heat treatment of these composite NFs under H2 gas flowing induces the reduction of RuO(2 )mainframes to metallic Ru within which Au atoms are dispersed to form homogeneous AuRu alloy NFs regardless of their immiscibility. The OWS activities of prepared AuRu alloy NFs are investigated in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution; and compared to those of RuO2, Ru, Au, and commercial catalysts, M/C (20 wt% metal loading on Vulcan XC-72 with M = Pt, Ru and Ir). In particular, AuRu alloy NFs show outstanding activity for OER: the lowest overpotential at 10 mA cm-2 and the smallest Tafel slope among the tested catalysts. Of great importance, AuRu alloy NFs also present an excellent long-term stability in a sharp contrast to easily deteriorated Ru-based catalysts (e.g., Ru NFs and Ru/C). AuRu alloy NFs also exhibit good HER activity and stability better than most of tested materials. In a two-electrode system, AuRu NFs divide divide AuRu NFs is confirmed to have a lower overpotential for OWS than Ir/C divide divide Pt/C, a commercial standard. The OWS performance of AuRu alloy NFs is superior to those of Ru-based bifunctional catalysts found in the literature. HER at AuRu alloy is further studied with density functional theory calculation. The current study reveals Ru alloyed with a small amount of Au having a robust nanofibrous morphology improves the electroactivity and stability for both OER and HER in acidic environments. Given that stable bifunctional catalysts for acidic water splitting have been rarely reported, AuRu alloy NFs exhibit an outstanding feasibility as a practical electrocatalyst for overall water splitting with the high activity and stability.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000691513600002

The effects of catalyst load (0.2-1.5 g L-1) and pH (7.5-11) were evaluated and optimized using the surface response methodology and the Pareto diagram. In the range of variables studied, low pH values and 1.0 g L-1 of TiO2 favoured the efficiency of the process. Under optimal conditions the evolution of the substrate, chemical oxygen demand, dissolved organic carbon, toxicity and antimicrobial activity on Escherichia coli cultures were evaluated. The results indicate that, under optimal conditions, after 30 min, the TiO2 photocatalytic system is able to eliminate both the substrate and the antimicrobial activity, and to reduce the toxicity of the solution by 60%. However, at the same time, similar to 53% of both initial DOC and COD remain in solution. Thus, the photocatalytical system is able to transform the target compound into more oxidized by-products without antimicrobial activity and with a low toxicity. The study of OA by-products using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, as well as the evaluation of OA degradation in acetonitrile media as solvent or in the presence of isopropanol and iodide suggest that the reaction is initiated by the photo-Kolbe reaction. Adsorption isotherm experiments in the dark indicated that under pH 7.5, adsorption corresponded to the Langmuir adsorption model, indicating the dependence of the reaction on an initial adsorption step.

Therefore, it is desirable to design catalysts that only require minimal amounts of Pt to function, but that are still highly active. Here we report hydrogen production in acidic water using a multicomponent catalyst with an ultralow Pt loading (1.4 mu g per electrode area (cm(2))) supported on melamine-derived graphitic tubes (GTs) that encapsulate a FeCo alloy and have Cu deposited on the inside tube walls. With a 1/80th Pt loading of a commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst, in 0.5 M H2SO4 the catalyst achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 18 mV, and shows a turnover frequency of 7.22 s(-1) (96 times higher than that of the Pt/C catalyst) and long-term durability (10,000 cycles). We propose that a synergistic effect between the Pt clusters and single Pt atoms embedded in the GTs enhances the catalytic activity.									355	17	0	0	24	0	359			2058-7546			WOS:000444608200001		
J	BUHN, B; OKRUSCH, M; WOERMANN, E; LEHNERT, K; HOERNES, S								METAMORPHIC EVOLUTION OF NEOPROTEROZOIC MANGANESE FORMATIONS AND THEIR COUNTRY ROCKS AT OTJOSONDU, NAMIBIA								JOURNAL OF PETROLOGY				36	2			463	496						APR 1995	1995	Manganiferous chemical sediments of Neoproterozoic age in Namibia were subjected to high-T-low-P metamorphism during the Damara Orogeny and display unique phase assemblages. The, manganese formations are embedded in iron formations and siliciclastic country rocks. This sequence is petrographically subdivided into restricted lithotypes which bear specific mineral assemblages and compositions depending on their protolith type. In pure manganese ores the critical assemblage braunite + haematite + jacobsite + rhodonite is frequently developed, whereas interlayered impure silicate ores bear various proportions of spessartine, Mn3+-bearing andradite-calderite and andradite garnets, rhodonite, manganoan aegirine-augite, aegirine, Ba-K-Na-feldspars, barite and rare kinoshitalite. Petrological constraints derived from country rock lithologies indicate Peak metamorphic conditions of 660-700 degrees C at estimated pressures of 3.5-4.5 kbar. Numerous Ba-rich pegmatitic veins restricted to the ore horizons testify to the Production of partial melts from siliciclastic strata within the manganese formations. They are correlated with peak pressure conditions between 5 and 6 kbar, accompanying the main deformation event and pre-dating the thermal peak. An early H2O-rich generation of fluid inclusions is interpreted as a manifestation of prograde dehydration reactions in the ore horizons. This caused hydraulic fracturing of the ores and, subsequently, triggered the formation of partial melts which intruded the fracture planes in situ. Peak metamorphism then occurred under strain-free conditions allowing equilibrium recrystallization of all minerals to develop. Phase relationships of manganese oxides and silicates modelled in the system Mn-Fe-Si-O reveal variable chemical compositions of braunites, jacobsites and haematites depending on their paragenesis. They indicate very restricted oxygen reservoirs within specific strata of the manganese ores and eliminate a prominent mass exchange even on a small scale. This is supported by delta(18)O analyses of silicate assemblages which further exclude mass transfer between manganese ores and country rocks, and indicate preservation of the exchange equilibria during cooling. The uplift path of the sequence can be constrained using different decrepitation patterns of H2O fluid inclusions and a syn- to late-metamorphic CO2-rich fluid inclusion population, which indicate high geothermal gradients of 70 degrees C/km and more. The P-T-D evolution of this high-T-low-P metamorphic belt conforms with the palaeotectonic setting of the study area at the southernmost part of the Congo Craton, representing the continental buttress colliding with the Kalahari Craton during the Pan-African orogeny.									33	0	0	0	0	0	33			0022-3530			WOS:A1995RC45800008

In this paper, 14 a novel female-specific hemocyanin (FSH) in the mud crab, Scylla olivacea (Crustacea: Portunidae), is reported. FSH occurs in the hemolymph of adult females with maturing ovaries, but not in the hemolymph of juveniles of either sex or in adult males. FSH was purified from the hemolymph of females with maturing ovaries by liquid chromatography. Further analysis revealed that FSH is a carbohydrate-rich protein; no cross-immune reaction was found between FSH and vitellin; furthermore, it does not resemble vitelloprotein molecules. It has characteristics in common with other better-known hemocyanins, such as its copper content and oxygen-binding ability. The P-50 of FSH is 28.3 mmHg O2, and its oxygen saturation point is 152 mmHg. From evidence of its oxygen-binding ability, it is certain that FSH is a unique hemocyanin of female crabs with maturing ovaries, and its functions are supposedly correlated with reproduction in female crabs.									6	0	0	0	6	0	7			1021-5506			WOS:000245907900009

In this study, we found that rational design of novel nanostructures is able to increase the number of active sites, conductivity and accelerate electron transfer, thus promoting enhanced performance of the catalyst. We successfully synthesized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) containing a hollow polyhedral (CNTHPs) structure through annealing, etching and phosphating. The unique hollow shape not only provides a stable structure but also facilitates mass and charge transfer. Thus, CoP/CNTHPs can catalyze the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions effectively with overpotentials of 147 and 238 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Simultaneously, CoP/CNTHPs only needs a voltage of 1.54 V to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the electrocatalytic water splitting process, demonstrating its bifunctional activity. Furthermore, the electrolytic catalytic performance does not weaken significantly after 12 hours of electrolysis, demonstrating excellent stability. Overall, this research offers useful insights into rational design of high-performance non-noble metal catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000790419700001	35507832

O2-oxidation of individual graphite and graphene nanoparticles in the 1200 to 2200 K range: particle-to-particle variations and the evolution of the reaction rates and optical properties [arXiv]								arXiv								50 pp., sup. 33 pp.	50 pp., sup. 33 pp.						11 Aug. 2020	2020	The kinetics for O2 oxidation of individual graphite and graphene platelet nanoparticles (NPs) were studied as a function of temperature (1200 to 2200 K) at varying oxygen partial pressures, using a single nanoparticle mass spectrometry method. NP temperature (TNP) was measured by measuring the NP thermal emission spectra during the kinetics studies. The initial oxidation efficiency is found to peak in the 1200 to 1500 K range, dropping by an order of magnitude as TNP was increased above 2000 K. There were large NP-to-NP variations in the oxidation rates, attributed to variations in the NP surface structure. In addition, the oxidation efficiencies decreased, non-monotonically, as the NPs reacted, by factors of between 10 and 300. This evolution of reactivity is attributed to changes in the NP surface structure due to the combination of oxidation and annealing. The optical properties, including wavelength dependence of the emissivity, and the absorption cross section for the 532 nm heating laser, also tend to evolve as the NPs oxidize, but differently for each individual NP, presumably reflecting differences in the initial structures, and how they evolve under different reaction conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						INSPEC:20462200

In this report, a spatially resolved, real-time synchrotron X-ray diffraction technique was applied to study the cyclic formation/decomposition of Li2O2 crystallites in an operating Li-O-2 cell. The evaluation of Li2O2 grain size, concentration, and spatial distribution inside the cathode is demonstrated under the actual cycling conditions. The study not only unambiguously proved the reversibility of the Li2O2 redox reaction during reduction and evolution of O-2, but also allowed for the concentration and dimension growths of the peroxide nanocrystallites to be accurately measured at different regions within the cathode. The results provide important insights for future investigation on mass and charge transport properties in Li2O2 and improvement in cathode structure and material design.									27	1	0	0	1	0	27			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000336804000026	24399807

In this work, Ni2P/Ni nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated in carbon/g-C3N4 hybrids derived from in situ pyrolysis and phosphidation of Ni-based metal-organic frameworks/g-C3N4 (NiMOF/g-C3N4) precursor were used as photocatalysts for H-2-evolution under visible-light irradiation. The highest H-2-evolution rate over optimized Ni2P/Ni@C/g-C3N4-550 was 18.04 mmol g(-1) h(-1) with 1.0 mmol L-1 of Eosin Y (EY)-sensitization (compared to 0.21 mmol g(-1) h(-1) without EY-sensitization), 13 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4 (1.33 mmol g(-1) h(-1)). The apparent quantum efficiency at 420 nm was 58.1%. This enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to an efficient and rapid separation of the photo-generated charges from excited EY and g-C3N4 to Ni2P/Ni with carbon as an electron transport bridge, intimate contact of each components, staggered band alignment among g-C3N4, Ni and Ni2P, as well as accelerated proton reduction reaction by Ni2P/Ni NPs.

J	Boehm, Daniel; Beetz, Michael; Gebauer, Christian; Bernt, Maximilian; Schroeter, Jonas; Kornherr, Matthias; Zoller, Florian; Bein, Thomas; Fattakhova-Rohlfing, Dina								Highly conductive titania supported iridium oxide nanoparticles with low overall iridium density as OER catalyst for large-scale PEM electrolysis								APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY				24						101134	10.1016/j.apmt.2021.101134		AUG 2021		SEP 2021	2021	To enable future large-scale generation of hydrogen via proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis, utilization of scarce iridium-based catalysts required for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has to be significantly lowered. To address this question, the facile synthesis of a highly active TiO2 supported iridium oxide based OER catalyst with reduced noble metal content and an Ir-density of the catalyst powder as low as 0.05-0.08 g(Ir) cm(-3) is described in this work. A high surface area corrosion-resistant titania catalyst support homogeneously coated with a 1-2 nm thin layer of amorphous IrOOHx is oxidized in molten NaNO3 between 350-375 degrees C. This procedure allows for a controllable phase transformation and crystallization to form a layer of interconnected IrO2 nanoparticles of approximate to 2 nm on the surface of the TiO2 support. The increase in crystallinity is thereby accompanied by a significant increase in conductivity of up to 11 S cm(-1) for a 30 wt% Ir loaded catalyst. Oxidized samples further display a significantly increased stability with less detectable Ir dissolution under OER conditions. With a mass-based activity of 59 A g(-1) at an overpotential of 300 mV, the electrocatalytic activity is maintained at the level of the highly active amorphous IrOOHx phase used as precursor and outperforms it at higher current densities through the increased conductivity. MEA measurements with catalyst loadings of 0.2-0.3 mg cm(-2) further confirm the high catalytic activity and initial stability at industrially relevant current densities. The introduced synthesis approach therefore shows a path for the fabrication of novel highly active and atom-efficient oxide supported catalysts with complex nanostructures and thin homogenous nanoparticle coatings that allows a future large-scale application of PEM electrolysis technology without restrictions by the natural abundance of iridium.

In this green hydrothermal synthesis, the resin played dual roles as oxygen source and as structure directing stabilizing agents, which followed the facile one-step process, and it is suitable for scaling up to large-scale synthesis. Various techniques were used to investigate the physicochemical properties such as structural, morphological, surface area, thermal, magnetic, band gap and lifetime properties of the green synthesised G-Fe2O3 NRs. Investigations of G-Fe2O3 NRs by electron microscopes showed the average length and girth of the NRs were ranging from 528 +/- 173 nm and 72 +/- 21 nm. Significant impact on the physicochemical properties by this green synthetic approach yielded concrete results in their catalytic activities overcoming major environmental concerns. Especially, our green catalyst showed better redox kinetics with the lesser over potential than the commercially available bulk counterparts upon evaluating the photoelectrochemical water splitting ability such as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Moreover, the photocatalytic efficiency of G-Fe2O3 NRs was evaluated by solar induced photoreduction of dichromate [toxic hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) to sustainable harmless trivalent chromium Cr(III)] and degradation of malachite green (MG). Both the processes involve the photocatalytic conversion by sequential adsorption of analytes on mineral surface and the overall efficiency was achieved mainly due to the high surface area (59.87 m(2)/g) of the catalyst. The cytotoxicity studies indicate that G-Fe2O3 NRs possesses much potential to work against A-549 (lung cancer) cell line. (C) 2019 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

Observational evidence for high neutronization in supernova remnants: implications for Type Ia supernova progenitors [arXiv]								arXiv								11 pp.	11 pp.						24 Jan. 2017	2017	The physical process whereby a carbon-oxygen white dwarf explodes as a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) remains highly uncertain. The degree of neutronization in SN Ia ejecta holds clues to this process because it depends on the mass and the metallicity of the stellar progenitor, and on the thermodynamic history prior to the explosion. We report on a new method to determine ejecta neutronization using Ca and S lines in the X-ray spectra of Type Ia supernova remnants (SNRs). Applying this method to Suzaku data of Tycho, Kepler, 3C 397, G337.2-0.7 in the MW, and N103B in the LMC, we find that the neutronization of the ejecta in N103B is comparable to that of Tycho and Kepler, which suggests that progenitor metallicity is not the only source of neutronization in SNe Ia. We then use a grid of SN Ia explosion models to infer the metallicities of the stellar progenitors of our SNRs. The implied metallicities of 3C 397, G337.2-0.7, and N103B are major outliers compared to the local stellar metallicity distribution functions, indicating that progenitor metallicity can be ruled out as the origin of neutronization for these SNRs. Although the relationship between ejecta neutronization and equivalent progenitor metallicity is subject to uncertainties stemming from the 12C+16O reaction rate, which affects the Ca/S mass ratio, our main results are not sensitive to these details.									0	0	0		0	0	0						INSPEC:16778955

Here, we show that electrocatalytic reactions relevant for water splitting can be boosted by the charged excited state generated from tip-induced localized electron. Using intentionally fabricated acicular NiCo2S4-xPx nanowire array, on which charged H2O molecules are driven to metastable excited state to efficiently reduce activation barrier and enhance carrier transfer, the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) required for hydrogen evolution was decreased to 75 mV and the Tafel slope was lowered to 42.3 mV per decade. This work, distinct from conventional doping and defecting strategy, provides a new insight into the underlying catalytic mechanism and functionalities of material's catalytic properties via simple structural engineering.									18	3	0	0	3	0	19			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000501613700030

With increasing the thickness of the Ni layer to 5 nm, the 5 nm Ni/2 nm Ti/nSi photoanodes show 50 mV lower onset potential than 5 nm Ni directly coated on native SiOX/nSi photoanodes and exhibit a very stable photoelectrochemical performance, which keep 100% activity (10 mA cm (2) at 0.8 V vs. SCE) for similar to 6.5 days. These results can be comparable to those of the typical NiOX coated nSi photoanodes with n-p(+) buried homojunctions. Using a Ti layer to replace the native SiOX of the nSi photoanodes increases the conductivity of the sample and helps the charge transfer process. In addition, the interlayer Ti film absorbs the oxygen from nearby layers or from the atmosphere, making the Ti layer partially oxidized. The in situ TiOX layer formed from evaporated Ti has more electron defects than the ALD deposited TiO2, and could be responsible for the improved hole conduction process.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395074300022

In this process, the reduction stage is undertaken in a first reactor in which the framework oxygen of a reducible inorganic oxide is used, instead of the usual atmospheric oxygen, for the combustion of a carbonaceous compound, for instance, methane. The outlet gas from this reactor is mostly composed Of CO2 and steam as reaction products and further separation of these two components can be carried out easily by simple condensation of steam. Then, the oxygen carrier found in a reduced state is transported to a second reactor in which carrier regeneration with air takes place at relatively low temperatures, consequently preventing the formation of thermal NO, Afterward, the regenerated carrier is carried to the first reactor to reinitiate a new cycle and so on for a number of repetitive cycles, while the carrier is able to withstand the severe chemical and thermal stresses involved in every cycle. In this paper, the performance of titania-supported nickel oxides has been investigated. in a fixed-bed reactor as oxygen carriers for chemical-looping combustion of methane. Samples with different nickel oxide contents were prepared by successive incipient wet impregnations, and their performance as oxygen carriers was investigated at 900 degrees C and atmospheric pressure in five-cycle fixed-bed reactor tests using pure methane and pure air for the respective reduction and regeneration stages. The evolution of the outlet gas composition in each stage was followed by gas chromatography, and the involved chemical, structural, and textural changes of the carrier in the reactor bed were studied by using different characterization techniques. From the study, it is deduced that the reactivity of these nickel-based oxygen carriers is in the two involved stages and almost independent of the nickel loading. However, in the reduction stage, carbon deposition, from the thermal decomposition of methane, and CO emissions, mainly derived from the partial reduction of titania as support acting as an additional oxygen source, may impose some constraints to the efficiency of the overall chemical-looping combustion process in CO2 capture.									49	2	0	0	4	0	50			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000230919800048	16124317

The time evolutions of the Sin+ (n = 1-4) components in the Si 2p spectrum indicate that the Si2+ state is suppressed on high-index surfaces compared with Si(001). The O 1s state consists of two components, a low-binding-energy component (LBC) and a high-binding-energy component (HBC). It is suggested that the O atom in strained Si-O-Si contributes to the LBC component. The reaction rates are slower on high-index surfaces compared with that on Si(001). (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

For this study, we compared the electrochemical behaviors of Pt and IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti electrodes as CEs in 0.5 M H2SO4. To study the effects of various surface areas, a smooth glassy carbon electrode with a small geometric surface area (GSA) of 0.07 cm(2) (GCE-s), a smooth medium GCE with a GSA of 0.38 cm(2) (GCE-m), and carbon cloth (CC) with a large GSA of 2.00 cm(2) were employed as working electrodes (WEs). When Pt was used as the CE, the current of the GCE-s was slowly enhanced after 1000 cycles, while a notable current increase at the GCE-m was seen after 800 cycles. For the CC electrode, a prominent increase in the current was observed after 400 cycles. The increased HER activity was initiated through the deposition of Pt dissolved from the CE during cyclic voltammetric cycles in the potential range between -0.40 and 0.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. In contrast, no notable current increase was observed for any of the GCE-s, GCE-m, and CC electrodes during 2000 cycles when the IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti electrode was employed as the CE.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000633162800003

The first series of such isomorphous compounds containing the transition metals Mn, Co, and Ni, {(H2O)(2)K-mu-(H2O)(3)Mn(H2O)(3)}(2n)[V10O28](n) (1), {(H2O)(2)K-mu-(H2O)(3)Co(H2O)(3)}(2n)[V10O28](n) (2) and {(H2O)(2)K-mu-(H2O)(3)Ni(H2O)(3)}(2n)[V10O28](n) (3), have been synthesized and structurally characterized. In these polymeric compounds, the [V10O28](6-) clusters are interlaced and inter-connected by {(H2O)(2)K-mu-(H2O)(3)-M(H2O)(3)}(+3) units leading to a linear chain-like arrangement. Each of such chains is further interconnected to adjacent chains by bonding K+ ions with a [V10O28](6-) cluster of the adjacent chain leading to a two-dimensional (2D) sheet-like arrangement. Hydrogen bonding interactions between the coordinated water molecules and the cluster oxygens further interconnect the adjacent sheets. All these compounds 1-3 are shown to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline (0.1 M KOH) conditions. Among the three, the Ni-based catalyst 3 exhibited the best OER activity with a moderate overpotential of 270 mV at onset, a low Tafel slope of 89 mV dec(-1), and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 7.5 s(-1), which is comparable to similar Keggin POM-based systems reported so far. The CPs were not highly stable under the OER conditions employed. The post-catalytic analyses indicated the 'precatalyst' nature of these compounds in alkaline media forming V-doped metal oxyhydroxides as the OER active species under the turnover conditions. Thus, this study provides a new and facile strategy for synthesizing [V10O28](6-)cluster and transition metal-based all-inorganic CPs and insights into their OER electrocatalytic activities for the first time.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000750670500001

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the main source of oxidized lipid in the arterial wall. Oxidation of LDL alters its properties in a number of ways, making it more atherogenic, but oxidation of other lipoprotein classes may also be important. Common mechanisms are likely to contribute to the oxidation of all lipoprotein classes, with enzyme-mediated oxidation likely to be most important. Antioxidant content, fatty acid composition, particle size and the presence of seeding hydroperoxides also influence oxidative reactions. Larger triglycericle-rich lipoproteins are less likely to enter the arterial wall than LDL, but when oxidized will deliver a greater oxidant load to the arterial wall.

Understanding the mechanism of the structure transition and atom rearrangement via synthesis or processing is key to expediting the exploration of excellent energy materials. In this work, in situ neutron scattering is employed to reveal the real-time structure evolution, including the TM-O bonds, lattice, TM valence and the migration of the high-voltage spinel cathode LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4. The transition-metal mediated spinel destabilization under the annealing at the oxygen-deficient atmosphere is pinpointed. The formation of Mn3+ is correlated to the TM migration activation, TM disordered rearrangement in the spinel, and the transition to a layered-rocksalt phase. The further TM interdiffusion and Mn(2+)reduc-tion are also revealed with multi-stage thermodynamics and kinetics. The mechanisms of phase transition and atom migrations as functions of temperature, time and atmosphere present important guidance on the synthesis in various-valence element containing oxides.

In these cells, a semiconductor photoelectrode is immersed in a liquid and, when illuminated, hydrogen and/or oxygen can be generated on its surface by electrolysis. Metal catalysts are often used to enhance the activity of the semiconductor, but the lifetime of the semiconductor photoelectrode is still the main bottleneck of this technology. In this manuscript we report the ageing mechanisms of silicon photoanodes coated with nickel films of different thicknesses (under the light-driven oxygen evolution reaction, OER). The n-Si photoanodes coated with 2 nm-thick, 5 nm-thick and 10 nm-thick nickel layers showed lifetimes of similar to 18 h, similar to 150 h and >260 h, respectively. While the 2 nm-thick sample degraded due to the formation of a thin SiOX layer at the metal-silicon interface, the performance of the thicker samples decreased due to the formation of holes. The 5 nm-thick and 10 nm-thick nickel films turned into homogeneous potassium-free NiOX films suitable for water splitting, and this conversion markedly enhanced the performance of the cells. The density/size of holes in the surface decreased/increased with the metal thickness. The potassium contamination in the 2 nm-thick Ni sample took place in the form of nanofilaments, and we demonstrated that the widely used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy tests are blind to these features, which may have been ignored in all previous reports. These results could be useful for understanding the degradation and enhancing the yield of water-splitting solar cells.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000378102400009

The cleavage of D1 was studied by using a PS II inhibitor, N-octyl-3-nitro-2,4,6-trihydroxybenzamide (PNO8), as a molecular probe. The following results were obtained. (i) D1 was selectively cleaved into 23-kDa N-terminal and 9-kDa C-terminal fragments in complete darkness by PNO8 at a single site in a D-E loop connecting membrane-spanning helices D and E, (ii) The cleavage was markedly enhanced when PS II was illuminated for a brief period before the addition of PNO8 in darkness. (iii) The effect of preillumination was slowly lost during incubation in the dark, with a decay half-time of similar to 1 h at 25 degrees C. (iv) The light intensity of preillumination required for the cleavage was much lower than that required for O-2 evolution. (v) The light-triggered cleavage of D1 was observed in thylakoids, PS II membranes, and PS II core particles, but not in purified PS II reaction centers. More than 60% of D1 was cleaved into the two fragments with no other by-products. (vi) The cleavage reaction revealed a marked pH dependence that was considerably different from that for inhibition of PS II activity. The results are interpreted as indicating that the binding of PNO8 to the Q(B)-binding pocket triggers proteolytic cleavage of D1 that has been previously modified during illumination.									14	0	0	0	14	0	14			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:A1996UX94300063	8663245

In this research, the combined effect of a high energy electron beam (1.2 MeV), heavy tensile stress (50 MPa) and constant high temperature (150 degrees C) was taken into account to study the surface modification and degradation behavior of polyimide films. By analyzing surface morphology, microstructural evolution and mechanical behavior of polyimide films after coupling treatment, the results indicated that the coupling treatment led to severe breakage of chemical bonds and decrease of surface quality. Meanwhile, new chemical bonds of C-C, CH2-O and C N formed after coupling treatment. Additionally, a high dose of electron beam during coupling experiments contributed to the formation of an oxide layer, surface defects and even volatile gases in the outer layer of the polyimide film. This was attributed to the significant scissioning of molecular chains in polyimide films and corresponding chemical reactions between free radicals and oxygen in air. Consequently, the irradiation-load-heating coupling treatment led to a remarkable drop in viscoelastic properties and mechanical performance of polyimide films.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			2046-2069			WOS:000442078800055	35542697

Designing and fabricating electrocatalysts with low cost, high catalytic activity and robust stability is desirable. In response, we prepared carbon shells encapsulating ultrafine beta-Mo2C nanoparticles with N and P dual-doping as advanced electrocatalyst used for HER in both acidic and alkaline mediums. This paper gives a discussion on element doping and porosity which have influence on the HER performance. As introducing heteroatoms into carbon matrix to create active sites and enhance electron transfer capacity, the as-prepared electrocatalyst exhibits high catalytic activity with low overpotential of 117 mV and 121 mV to achieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic and alkaline solutions. Due to the strategy of carbon shells encapsulating, the catalyst presents robust stability for a long time at various applied potential. Furthermore, the design idea of using multiple strategies preparing catalysts may serve some inspiration to fabricate advanced electrocatalysts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Both the hydrolysis of weak acid ions and the decarboxylation reaction of carboxylate can make the LiCO2CH3 produce a passivation film to inhibit the water decomposition to a certain extent. As for the LiCO2CF3 without hydrolysis of weak acid ion, it can be highly possible to facilitate the introduction of CO2 via its carboxylate specific decarboxylation reaction, and further produce lithium carbonate passivation film as well. However, the water decomposition voltage in the oxygen-producing process is more dependent on the properties of lithium salt anions. Those with strong electron-absorbing groups such as the trifluoromethyl are more likely to effectively endue the aqueous electrolyte with a high oxidative decomposition potential. Moreover, the concentration of LiCO2CF3 aqueous electrolyte can reach up to 28 mol kg(-1), and hence the electrochemical stability window of this water-base electrolyte can be expanded to about 3.0 V. This work provides a new idea for the selection of high concentration lithium salt.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000530838000015

Various phenomena such as CO gas evolution and slagmaking by gangue oxides in DRI were experimentally observed at each reaction step. Thermodynamic behaviors of phosphorus, oxygen, and carbon were strongly dependent on DRI content. Basicity, which is the thermodynamic driving force of dephosphorization, decreased with the increasing DRI content because SiO2 concentration in the slag was proportional to DRI addition. The excess free energy of P2O5 increased with the increasing SiO2 content in slag. A higher DRI content made dephosphorization difficult by decreasing the basicity and stability of P2O5 in the slag. Therefore, when using DRI in EAF process, it is very important to control the basicity of slag.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000451647900037

Herein, we report the stability and promising optoelectronic properties of a few previously unexplored periodates A(2)BIO(6) (A = alkali metal; B = Bi, Sb, In, Tl, Ga). Our compositional phase diagram analysis reveals two compounds Na2BIO6 (B = Bi, In) that stabilize in monoclinic phase at thermodynamic equilibrium, showing band gaps (E-g) in the visible region. Band engineering via alloying Bi in Na2InIO6 introduces Bi 6s lone pair bands above the valence band maxima (VBM), while alloying Tl in Na2BiIO6 introduces an intermediate band (Tl s character) below the conduction band minima. These alloys, Na2Bi0.25In0.75IO6 and Na2Tl0.25Bi0.75IO6, acquire E-g's of 1.66 and 1.78 eV, respectively. Apart from band gap, the antibonding VBM, favorable optical absorption, highly dispersive band edges, and well-positioned VBM (for efficient oxygen evolution reaction) make these compounds highly promising for PV and PEC applications.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1948-7185			WOS:000547468400033	32510223

Herein, we report the modulation effect on the Gibbs free energy (Delta G(H)*) of hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) Ru resulting from heteroatom Mo doping. In particular, for the first time the hcp MoRu3 crystal structure is theoretically predicted with pretty high intrinsic HER activity. Meanwhile, the Mo hetero-dopant could act as a new active site with Pt-like Delta G(H)*. Motivated by the prediction, we report a novel metal organic framework (MOF)-assisted synthetic strategy to prepare a Mo-doped hcp Ru electrocatalyst. Accordingly, the hcp MoRu3 catalyst exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 30.5 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), ensuring excellent Pt-like intrinsic HER activity. More importantly, the excellent electrochemical performance measured with a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer further highlights the promising potential of the hcp MoRu3 catalyst for hydrogen production.									35	3	0	0	0	0	35			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000457893400039		
J	Halabi, G.M.; El Eid, M.								Exploring masses and CNO surface abundances of red giant stars [arXiv]								arXiv								12 pp.	12 pp.						6 July 2015	2015	A grid of evolutionary sequences of stars in the mass range 1.2-7Modot, with solar-like initial composition is presented. We focus on this mass range in order to estimate the masses and calculate the CNO surface abundances of a sample of observed red giants. The stellar models are calculated from the zero-age main sequence till the early asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Stars of M les 2.2Modot are evolved through the core helium flash. In this work, an approach is adopted that improves the mass determination of an observed sample of 21 RGB and early AGB stars. This approach is based on comparing the observationally derived effective temperatures and absolute magnitudes with the calculated values based on our evolutionary tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. A more reliable determination of the stellar masses is achieved by using evolutionary tracks extended to the range of observation. In addition, the predicted CNO surface abundances are compared to the observationally inferred values in order to show how far standard evolutionary calculation can be used to interpret available observations and to illustrate the role of convective mixing. We find that extra mixing beyond the convective boundary determined by the Schwarzschild criterion is needed to explain the observational oxygen isotopic ratios in low mass stars. The effect of recent determinations of proton capture reactions and their uncertainties on the 16O/17O and 14N/15N ratios is also shown. It is found that the 14N(p,gamma)15O reaction is important for predicting the 14N/15N ratio in red giants.

J	Pinchasov, Y; Kotliarevsky, D; Dubinsky, Z; Mauzerall, DC; Feitelson, J								Photoacoustics as a diagnostic tool for probing the physiological status of phytoplankton								ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES				53	1			1	10		10.1560/4DVV-JT78-G7VW-QTFM				2005	2005	In nature, conditions for the growth of phytoplankton rarely support their maximal potential doubling rates. The main rate-limiting factor determining the doubling rates of phytoplankters is photosynthesis. This key process is ill turn controlled, and frequently limited, by the available light, by lack of essential nutrients, or by the presence of noxious pollutants. Any decrease in the rates of photosynthesis is associated with a reduction in the efficiency of light utilization in that process. We present here the decreased photosynthetic efficiency of phytoplankton upon depletion of nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron as measured by photoacoustics. Such effects have been documented extensively by other methods, such as fluorescence yield, growth rate, carbon assimilation, and oxygen evolution. However, photoacoustics measures directly the energy efficiency of the photosynthetic process. We determined that efficiency by this method in three phytoplankton species belonging to different taxa. Our results illustrate the power of photoacoustics as a tool in aquatic ecology and in the physiological research of phytoplankton.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0792-9978	2223-8980		WOS:000231563200001

Process modeling and optimization were performed using an orthogonal central composite design (OCCD) and genetic algorithm (GA), respectively. Ti/SnO2-Sb/beta-PbO2 anode was prepared by electrochemical deposition method and then its properties were studied by FESEM, EDX, XRD, Linear sweep voltammetry and accelerated lifetime test techniques. The results showed that lead oxide was precipitated as highly compact pyramidal clusters in the form of beta-PbO2 on the electrode surface. In addition, the prepared anode had high stability (170 h) and oxygen evolution potential (2.32 V). A robust quadratic model (p-value < 0.0001 and R-2 > 0.99) was developed to predict the 2,4-DCP removal efficiency in the 3DER-GAC system. Under optimal conditions (pH = 4.98, Na2SO4 concentration = 0.07 M, current density = 35 mA cm(-2), GAC amount = 25 g and reaction time = 50 min), the removal efficiency of 2,4-DCP in the 3DER-GAC system and the separate electrochemical degradation process (without GAC particle electrode) were 99.8 and 71%, respectively. At a reaction time of 80 min, the TOC removal efficiencies in the 3DER-GAC and the separate electrochemical degradation system were 100 and 57.5%, respectively. Accordingly, the energy consumed in these two systems was calculated to be 0.81 and 1.57 kWh g(-1) TOC, respectively. Based on the results of LC-MS analysis, possible degradation pathways of 2,4-DCP were proposed. Trimerization and ring opening reactions were the two dominant mechanisms in 2,4-DCP degradation.

Herein, we propose the preparation strategy of effectively using a bifunctional electrocatalyst (Fe-N-x/C) based on the zeolite imidazole organic framework-8 (ZIF-8) as the template agent, with surface modification coated by ferrocene (Fc) molecules followed by pyrolysis at high temperature under inert atmosphere. Benefiting from the surface modification of ZIF-8 with Fc molecules, more abundant multiple catalytic Fe/Fe-N-x/FeCx sites with high intrinsic activity are derived, the resultant Fe-N-x/C exhibits excellent potential gap (Delta E = 0.63 V) and durability, which is obviously superior to the Pt/C + IrO2 benchmark (Delta E = 0.77 V) and other state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the assembled rechargeable ZABs employing the Fe-N-x/C as an air-electrode show a reduced charging-discharging potential difference of 0.603 V, high power density of 214.8 mW cm(-2), and long-term cycling stability of more than 290 h at 2.0 mA cm(-2). Therefore, this work presents a feasible strategy to prepare a high-efficiency and durability ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst toward high performance ZABs and next-generation energy storage devices.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000726617600003	34739216

The modificatin of a photocatalyst with defects provides an effective way to adjust the light absorption properties, but it may lead to the loss of kinetic factors. Herein, a strategy of constructing dual-defects is demonstrated to address this challenge. Bulk N doping and surface oxygen vacancies are introduced into black TiO2 nanotube array in hierarchies through the introduction of N source during anodization process and secondary aluminothermic reduction, respectively. The co-existing of dual-defects reduces the band-gap through p orbital modulation, and the constant conduction band position ensures the preservation of thermodynamic capabilities. Moreover, a built-in electric field is formed owing to the different electrical properties between hierarchical distributions of dual-defects, which establishes the channels for efficient charge transfer. The thermodynamic and kinetic factors of the tradeoff are realized by the broadening of light absorption induced by "correct concentration " of dual-defects and the acceleration of photogenerated charge transfer induced by "correct distribution " of dual-defects, respectively. As a result, the hierarchically modified black TiO2 exhibits robust hydrogen evolution activity of 3183 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1), roughly a 21-fold improvement with respect to pristine TiO2 under visible light illumination.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773002600005		
J	Pennazio, S								Photosynthesis: A short history of some modern experimental approaches								RIVISTA DI BIOLOGIA-BIOLOGY FORUM				96	1			73	86						JAN-APR 2003	2003	This paper presents a personal interpretation of a chapter of plant physiology beginning from the early 1930s to the early 1940s, when plant physiologists tried to find the missing link between the two (dark and light) phases of photosynthesis. As initially inferred by Richard Willstatter and Arthur Stoll in the 1910s, and then stated by Robert Emerson and William Arnold in 1932, the most accredited theory proposed that carbon dioxide must combine with chlorophyll in the dark. Successive light flashes activated the complex chlorophyll-carbon dioxide with oxygen evolution, and carbon dioxide was reduced to formaldehyde and successively polymerised into hexose. Arthur Stool in 1932 and Cornelius v. Niel in 1935 gave the first stroke to this theory suggesting that carbon dioxide must be reduced and assimilated by means of a process of water oxidation. Robert Hill showed the existence Of an indissoluble link between the light phase, water oxidation and possibly oxygen evolution. Two physicists, Sam Ruben and Martin Kamen proposed the assembly of photosynthesis into a unitary process occurring as a sequence of several steps in the first 1940s. By utilising for the first time radioactive carbon (C-11), they elaborated a new theory according to which carbon dioxide reduction was a repeated "cyclic" mechanism. This "heretical" view abolished the old, but still considered, theory of formaldehyde. Hill, Ruben and Kamen were able to exploit at best the possibility offered by a very advanced technology, thus confirming once again that ideas stand upon the powerful legs of technology.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0035-6050	1825-6538		WOS:000183622100004	12852175

The discharge is generated in atmospheric pressure air by the application of a positive high voltage pulse of 35 kV to pin-to-pin electrodes and a rise time of 5 ns. The generated discharge consists of a streamer phase with high voltage and high current followed by a spark phase characterized by a low voltage and a decreasing current in several hundreds of nanosecond. During the streamer phase, the gas temperature measured by optical emission spectroscopy related to the second positive system of nitrogen shows an ultra-fast gas heating up to 1200 K at 15 ns after the current rise. This ultra-fast gas heating, due to the quenching of electronically excited species by oxygen molecules, is followed by a quick dissociation of molecules and then the discharge transition to a spark. At this transition, the discharge contracts toward the channel axis and evolves into a highly conducting thin column. The spark phase is characterized by a high degree of ionization of nitrogen and oxygen atoms shown by the electron number density and temperature measured from optical emission spectroscopy measurements of N+ lines. Schlieren imaging and optical emission spectroscopy techniques provide the time evolution of the spark radius, from which the initial pressure in the spark is estimated. The expansion of the plasma is adiabatic in the early phase. The electronic temperature and density during this phase allows the determination of the isentropic coefficient. The value around 1.2-1.3 is coherent with the high ionization rate of the plasma in the early phase. The results obtained in this study provide a database and the initial conditions for the validation of numerical simulations of the ignition by plasma discharge.									49	1	0	0	0	0	49			0963-0252	1361-6595		WOS:000425780000001

In this study, the electrocatalytic performance of chromium (Cr) atom anchored to graphyne (Cr@GY) is systematically investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results show that Cr@GY is an efficient NRR electrocatalyst which can activate the inert N equivalent to N bond sufficiently. In particular, the enzymatic mechanism is considered as the most positive catalytic pathway with the limiting potential of -0.52 V. More importantly, Cr@GY can restrict a competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The electronic properties including Bader charge, the charge difference density (CDD), the partial density of states (PDOS) and the crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) have been analyzed in detail. In addition, the co-doping of B and N atoms in GY is beneficial to reduce the energy barrier of the potential-determining step (PDS) and promote the smooth progress of the NRR. This work can provide theoretical guidance for the experimental synthesis of the single-atom catalysts (SACs) with high activity and stability.									15	1	0	0	0	0	14				2513-0390		WOS:000641754100001

However, the oxygen adsorption of Mo2C is overly strong for boosted catalytic activity. Herein, this work developed a bidirectional electronegative heteroatom doping strategy to tune the electronic cloud density of Mo2C. Boron and nitrogen, which have different electronegativities compared to Mo, co-doped nano-Mo2C moieties embedded in a nanoporous nitrogen-doped carbon frame (B,N-Mo2C/NPNC) were synthesized via a cross-linking-pyrolysis process. The introduced B not only tailored the electronic structure of Mo2C but also created additional electron-deficient B active sites for ORR. Additionally, the unique nanoporous carbon structure with dominant nanochannels benefits the exposure of specific surface areas and fast mass transfer. As a result, compared to N-Mo2C/NPNC without B tuning, B,N-Mo2C/NPNC exhibited superior ORR catalytic activity comparable to commercial Pt/C catalysts, making it outstanding among the Mo-based ORR catalysts. Moreover, B,N-Mo2C/NPNC showed robust catalytic stability for ORR with little shift in half-wave potential even after 10,000 cycles. As a cathode catalyst, a B,NMo2C/NPNC-driven zinc-air battery displayed discharge performance superior to the Pt/C-driven one, heralding promising application prospects. This work provided a feasible strategy for boosting the ORR catalytic activity of molybdenum carbide by simultaneously tuning the electronic structure, creating auxiliary active site, and constructing three-dimensional opening nanoporous carbon structures, which can be extended to other metal catalysts for energy conversion.									2	1	0	0	0	0	3				2574-0970		WOS:000702079900027

PPy and PPy(La1-xSrxMnO3) (0 <= x <= 0.4) successive layers have been obtained on polished and pretreated graphite electrodes following sequential electrodeposition technique. The electrolytes used in the electrodeposition process were Ar saturated 0.1 mol dm(-3) pyrrole (Py) plus 0.05 mol dm(-3) K2SO4 with and without containing a suspension of 8.33 g L-1 oxide powder. Films were characterized by XRD, SEM, linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance (EI) spectroscopy. Electrochemical investigations were carried out at pH 12 in a 0.5 mol dm(-3) K2SO4 plus 5 mmol dm(-3) KOH, under both oxygenated and deoxygenated conditions. Results indicate that the porosity of the PPy matrix is considerably enhanced in presence of oxide particles. Sr substitution is found to have little influence on the electrocatalytic activity of the composite electrode towards the ORR. However, the rate of oxygen reduction decreases with decreasing pH of the electrolyte from pH 12 to pH 6. It is noteworthy that in contrast to a non-composite electrode of the same oxide in film form, the composite electrode exhibits much better electrocatalytic activity for the ORR.

The characterization of the modified films was carried out by X-ray and SEM. In the case of Ti/TiO2-Pt, Pt is deposited preferentially within some of the micropores of the TiO2 film. Ir however, is distributed preferentially across the surface of the oxide film. The difference is thought to result from the position of the metal deposition potential with respect to the flat band potential of n-TiO2.

A temperature profile in the tube furnace was designed to obtain the proposed particle size, crystal structure, and morphology. Synthesized Cd(1-x)ZnxS particles were characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and diffuse reflectance UV Vis spectroscopy. It was seen that there was a polynomial relationship between the band gap and Cd: Zn ratio in the Cd(1-x)ZnxS. Cd0.58Zn023S has shapeless particles between 250 and 500 nm particle size. It was observed that particle size decreased as Zn ratio increased in the Cd(1-x),ZnxS. Cd(1-x),ZnxS hexagonal crystals had nano step surfaces which were one of the desired factors for achieving high photocatalytic efficiency. Finally, Synthesized Cd(1-x.)ZnxS particles were used as photocatalysts for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Cd0.77Zn0.23S structure behaved the most active one among the different compositions of Cd(1-x)ZnxS nanoparticles. Cd0.77Zn0.23S showed almost high photocatalytic activity for HER with 1927 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) hydrogen evolution rate without using noble co-catalyst such as platinum. This good photocatalytic activity was believed to be due to the nanostep surface structure Cd0.77Zn0.23S which led the separation of the reduction and oxidation reaction sites and inhibited the recombination of the generated electrons and holes. Observation of considerably high photocurrent and open circuit potentials and changes in the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy responses supported the photocatalytic activity of the Cd0.77Zn0.23S particles.

The nanocomposites thus obtained were characterized at different stages of the synthesis using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, carbon-hydrogen nitrogen sulfur analyzer, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results showed that CuNPs had been uniformly and finely decorated on the N-Chit-G support, in which copper was in the predominant form of Cu(I). The Randles-Sevcik equation revealed the high active surface area of Cu N-Chit-G compared to the remaining composites obtained. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at Cu@N-Chit-G was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry using a rotating disk electrode in a KOH solution (0.1 mol L-1) saturated with O-2 and O-2 plus MeOH (1.0 mol L-1) to find the good electrocatalytic capability of Cu@N-Chit-G for ORR with a small onset potential of 0.74 V (vs. RHE). A KOH solution, saturated with MeOH (1.0 mol L-1), revealed good 10000 s durability of Cu@N-Chit-G electrocatalyst with a slow drop in the current (91%). Finally, ORR kinetic investigations were conducted using the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plot to find the ORR progress through a 4e(-) pathway. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In this study, sodium citrate was directly carbonized to prepare macroporous nanocarbon shells (CSs) with a shell thickness of similar to 8 nm, which were proposed as the carbon support for the Fe-N catalyst (FePc/CS) for ORR. The experiments showed that the thin-walled macroporous nanostructure of CSs remained unchanged after pyrolysis with Fe (II)-phthalocyanine (FePc). Electrochemical tests performed in 50 mM phosphate buffer solution demonstrated that the catalyst pyrolyzed at 500 degrees C (FePc/CS500) exhibited a 42 mV higher half-wave potential than that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst under the same loading. This is due to the combine effects of the chemical functions (abundant Fe-N active sites) and the structural advantages (macropores and thin-walls, which facilitated the mass transfer in CS and increased the contact interface between the electrolyte and active sites, respectively). FePc/CS500 also exhibited a better durability than Pt/C, stemming from the four-electron reaction pathway that prevented the active sites from being degraded by the generated H2O2. The performance evaluation showed that the MFC with FePc/CS500 as the cathode catalyst delivered a maximum power density of 2.16 +/- 0.02 W m(-2), which was 50% higher than that of Pt/C (1.44 +/- 0.04 W m(-2)). These results indicated FePc/CS500 was a cheap but effective alternative ORR catalyst to Pt/C for energy recovery from wastewater. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The results showed a highly significant increase in malondialdehyde content in CSF (p<0.001) in the patients with PD. We also found significant differences in peripheral blood parameters between the two groups: malondialdehyde content was increased in patients with PD (p<0.05), as was the activity of antioxidative defense enzymes, glutathione reductase, Cu, and Zn-superoxide-dismutase (p<0.05). The production of a highly reactive oxygen species superoxide radical (p<0.05) was also increased. These findings indicated an important role of oxidative stress in PD evolution and progress. The increased levels of reactive oxidative species (malondialdehyde content and superoxide radical production) in peripheral blood, and excessive activity of protective enzymatic systems (glutathione reductase Cu, and Zn-superoxide-dismutase) could indicate an additional systemic reaction related to a chronic oxidative stress state in the brain.									80	2	0	0	67	0	85			0393-5264	1971-3274		WOS:000083521000002	10568214

However, finding robust catalysts for achieving nitrate to ammonia conversion remains a challenge due to the lack of a mechanistic view on the highly complex nitrate reduction and NH3 selectivity. Herein, we systematically investigate electrocatalytic activity and NH3 selectivity of a single-atom catalyst supported on graphitic carbon nitride (TM/g-C3N4) for nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) using first-principles calculations. Our results reveal that Ti/g-C3N4, V/gC(3)N(4), and Nb/g-C3N4 serve as the most promising NO3RR catalysts, as they exhibit stability, excellent activity, high selectivity (Faradaic efficiency of ~ 100%), and low limiting potential (-0.42,-0.25, and-0.40 V for Ti/gC(3)N(4), V/g-C3N4, and Nb/g-C3N4, respectively). In addition, considerable potential energy barriers are found in the formation of byproducts NO2, NO, and N2O, validating their high selectivity. Nitrate to ammonia conversion is more competitive than hydrogen evolution reaction on TM/g-C3N4 owning to a lower limiting potential. This work reveals the structure dependence of NO3RR reaction pathways in single-atom catalysts and opens a new avenue for designing more efficient catalysts for NO3RR under ambient conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000817880300001

A novel preparation method for electrodes in the discharged state, i.e., prefilled with Li2O2 using polyethylene oxide as a binder, is presented. The composition and reactivity of Li2O2-prefilled electrodes are examined by thermal analysis coupled with on-line mass spectrometry. Voltage profiles and gas evolution during the charging process of Li2O2-prefilled electrodes in battery cells are correlated with the thermal decomposition process of Li2O2 and its impact on other electrode compounds. It is found that both thermal Li2O2 decomposition and the electrochemical decomposition of Li2O2 during charging enhance the oxidation of the electrolyte, the binder, and/or carbon, which is suggested to be due to the formation of "nascent" oxygen during Li2O2 decomposition into O-2 and Li2O (thermally) or into O-2 and lithium ions (electrochemically).									75	2	0	0	2	0	78			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000320321600051	23715054

We discovered that in sunflower leaves attached to the plant the initial fall is replaced by an unexpected increase at much longer wavelengths, so that a detectable O-2 evolution is remained till 780 nm. The quantum yield of O-2 evolution at the local maximum at 745 nm reaches almost 20%, of the yield at 650 nm. We conclude that extreme long-wavelength chlorophylls may be present in the intact photosystem II antenna system, similarly to photosystem I.

The two first of these oxide anodes show lower O-2-evolving over-potentials than metal anodes, due to weak O binding but strong hydroxyl (HO*) binding on the surface. Furthermore, the binding energies of O, HO, and HOO on the (110) surfaces fulfill universal linear relations similar to those found on metal surfaces. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

For Au/Fe2O3 pre-dosing the catalyst with O-18 labelled water gives an unexpected evolution order for the labelled CO2 product with the (CO2)-O-18 emerging first, whereas no temporal differentiation is found for Au/ZnO. High pressure XPS experiments are then used to show that CO bond cleavage does occur for model catalysts consisting of Au particles deposited on iron oxide films but not when deposited on ZnO films. DFT calculations, show that this observation requires carbon monoxide to dissociate in such a way that cleavage of the CO bond occurs along with dynamically co-adsorbed oxygen so that the overall process of Au oxidation and CO dissociation is energetically favourable. Our results show that for Au/Fe2O3 there is a pathway for CO oxidation that involves atomic C and O surface species which operates along side the bicarbonate mechanism that is widely discussed in the literature. However, this minor pathway is absent for Au/ZnO.									29	1	0	0	1	1	30			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000286890500010	21152570

Their conduction was studied in wet hydrogen, wet air and dry air atmospheres by various electrochemical methods including AC impedance spectroscopy, isotope effect, electrochemical hydrogen pumping, steam concentration cells and oxygen concentration cells from 873 to 1273 K. Proton conduction was confirmed directly by an electrochemical hydrogen-pumping experiment. The hydrogen evolution rates coincided with theoretical ones calculated from Faraday's law, indicating that in hydrogen atmosphere the charge carriers were predominantly protons. Isotope effect confirmed the ceramic samples possessed proton conduction under water vapor-containing atmosphere. In wet air atmosphere, the samples were found to be mixed (proton+oxide ion+hole) conductors, and in dry air atmosphere to be mixed (oxide ion+hole) conductors. These results were different from the reports that BaO- and MgO-doped LaGaO3 ceramics were mixed conductors of oxide ion and electron hole in 02 and air; whereas they were oxide ion conductors in N-2 and H-2 atmospheres.									3	2	0	0	0	0	3			1001-604X	1614-7065		WOS:000273627600004		
J	KHINDARIA, A; BARR, DP; AUST, SD								LIGNIN PEROXIDASES CAN ALSO OXIDIZE MANGANESE								BIOCHEMISTRY				34	23			7773	7779		10.1021/bi00023a025				JUN 13 1995	1995	The peroxidase isozymes secreted by the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium include lignin peroxidases and manganese-dependent peroxidases. The major isozymes, called lignin peroxidases, are thought to oxidize chemicals directly. The manganese-dependent peroxidases (H3, H4, H5, and H9) are relatively minor, making up only a fraction of the total peroxidase protein. However, we have found that lignin peroxidases will also catalyze the H2O2-dependent oxidation of Mn2+ to Mn3+. We have used lignin peroxidase isozyme H2 (LiPH2) to characterize the manganese peroxidase activity of lignin peroxidases. Transient state kinetic studies were used to obtain a second-order rate constant of 4.2 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1) for the reaction of LiPH2-compound I with free or chelated Mn2+ at pH 6.0. This reaction was too fast to monitor at pH 4.5. Only chelated Mn2+ could reduce LiPH2-compound II to ferric enzyme. The Mn2+-chelate (oxalate) first bound LiPH2-compound Il with a Kd Of (1.5 +/- 0.3) X 10(-5) M and then reduced LiPH2-compound IT to ferric enzyme with a first order rate constant of 215 +/- 6 s(-1). Steady-state kinetic studies on LiPH2 were performed by directly monitoring the formation of Mn3+-oxalate. These results show that oxidation of Mn2+ by a lignin peroxidase does not occur through free radical mediation as proposed previously [Popp et al. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 10475-10480). Electron spin resonance and oxygen evolution studies also indicate that Mn2+ is directly oxidized by LiPH2. In addition, veratryl alcohol oxidation by LiPH2 was inhibited in the presence of Mn2+, suggesting that both Mn2+ and veratryl alcohol are substrates for LiPH2.									37	2	0	0	28	2	40			0006-2960			WOS:A1995RD33300025	7779824

Herein, a series of single transition metal atoms is screened anchoring on a monolayer graphdiyne (TM@GD, TM = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, W, Ir, Pt, and Au) toward electrocatalytic N-2 reduction reaction nitrogen reductive reaction (NRR) by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Several TM@GD, including Ti@GD, V@GD, Nb@GD, Ru@GD, and W@GD, are computed to experience relatively lower free energy uphill for NRR than Ru(0001) surface. Specifically, the Nb@GD is demonstrated to be the most excellent for NRR with a limited potential of only 0.27 V, and also a high selectivity of 49.95% in spite of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) competition simply estimated by Boltzmann distribution. Distal pathway is identified here without the formation of N2N4 species, ensuring a highly oriented product of NH3. Studies in this work would facilitate further experimental research in this field with a new idea and guidance to find out the active catalysts of high efficiency for NH3 synthesis at room temperature.									23	3	0	0	0	0	23				2513-0390		WOS:000490165700001

Herein, we propose a novel and scalable metal coordination-polymer strategy for the facile synthesis of bimetallic PdFe nanoparticles embedded nitrogen-doped carbon (PdFe@N-C) nanoframes as a Mott-Schottky electrocatalyst to efficiently catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in PEMFCs. The metal coordination-polymer is formed through metal ions (Pd and Fe) mediated self-polymerization of 1-naphthylamine (NA), which allows alloy nanoparticles to bind tightly with N-carbon nanoframes after pyrolysis. It is found that PdFe nanoparticles with very small particle-size are uniformly embedded in the porous N-carbon nanoframes and physically separated from each other by the carbon matrix. Profited from the unique structure and composition merits, the half-wave potential of the developed PdFe@N-C nanoframes towards ORR is positively shifted by 30 and 50 mV compared to those of Pd@N-C and Pd/C, respectively. Importantly, the PdFe@N-C nanoframes derived acidic PEMFC delivers a high-power density of 0.91 W cm(-2 )together with remarkable operational stability after 10 h discharging. Such good performances make the metal-NA coordination-polymer an attractive precursor to design and synthesize high-performance electrocatalysts for fuel cells. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This approach combines the advantages of surface, interface, and nanosize engineering. In this work, a MnO2 content of about 9 wt % is deposited on reduced graphene oxide (MnO2@rGO). The MnO2 particles grow uniformly on the rGO surface with a particle size smaller than 20 nm. The MnO2@rGO composites were applied as cathode catalysts in Li-O-2 batteries, demonstrating an initial discharge capacity of 5139 mAh g(-1) and a high capacity of 4262 mAh g(-1) (80% capacity retention) after 15 full discharge-charge cycles at a current density of 100 mA g(-1). The outstanding performance can be attributed to the strong synergistic effect between the rGO framework and the nanosized MnO2 particles on its surface. The rGO framework possesses a porous multilayer structure, which provides an excellent electrical conductivity, promotes oxygen and ion diffusion, and provides storage space for the discharge products. The nanosized MnO2 possesses a high exposed surface, which enhances surface transport of LiO2 species and avoids the accumulation of discharge products on electrode surface. Furthermore, a transition between lithiated and nonlithiated manganese oxide during the discharge and charge processes was observed. This transition apparently helps to promote electron transfer between discharge products and the catalyst and thereby to reduce the overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2574-0962			WOS:000502688800020

The extent of the catalyst deactivation after engine-aging at 800-1000 degrees C was correlated with the microstructural evolution, which was analyzed by X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and a chemisorption technique. This suggests that deactivation is caused by degradation of the catalytically active sites in the three-phase boundary (TPB) region, where Pd, CeO2-ZrO2, and the gas phase meet. The time-resolved in situ DRS revealed that the reoxidation of Pd metal under fluctuating air-to-fuel ratios was retarded relative to the reduction of Pd oxide. The retardation is attributable to the oxygen storage in CeO2-ZrO2. In the fresh catalyst with a high dispersion, most Pd was close to the TPB. Conversely, after engine-aging at elevated temperatures, the retardation effect was less pronounced with respect to Pd particle growth. Grown into large Pd particles, the Pd at sufficient distances from the TPB was no longer affected by the oxygen storage. Consequently, from the ratios of the initial rate constants of the Pd oxidation and reduction under fluctuating air-to-fuel ratio conditions, we can understand the quality and/or quantity of the TPB site in engine-aged catalysts. This measure provides a useful index of the extent of catalyst deactivation.									20	2	0	0	3	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000474812400061

However, it is difficult for a single-component cocatalyst to simultaneously realize the crucial functions. In this study, an effective interfacial transfer of photogenerated electrons and its following rapid oxygen-reduction can be easily realized in a dual electron-cocatalyst modified Fe(III)/rGO-TiO2 photocatalyst, where the rGO nanosheets function as an electron-transfer mediator for the effective transfer of photogenerated electrons from the TiO2 surface while the Fe(III) cocatalyst serves as an electron-reduction active site to promote the following interfacial oxygen reduction. In this case, the rGO nanosheets were firstly loaded on the TiO2 nanoparticle surface by a hydrothermal method and then the Fe(III) cocatalyst was further modified on the rGO nanosheets by an impregnation method to prepare the Fe(III)/rGO-TiO2 photocatalyst. It was found that the dual electron-cocatalyst modified Fe(III)/rGO-TiO2 photocatalyst showed an obviously higher photocatalytic performance than the naked TiO2 and single-cocatalyst modified photocatalysts (such as Fe(III)/TiO2 and rGO-TiO2) owing to the synergistic effect of rGO and Fe(III) bi-cocatalysts. The present work can provide some new insights for the smart design of high-efficiency photocatalytic materials.									42	3	0	0	5	0	43			2045-2322			WOS:000359488100001	26272870

In this work, surface fluorination self-doped Ta2O5 nanoshuttles (FTNSs) photocatalyst is synthesized successfully by a modified one-step hydrothermal method. The test results show the presence of surface fluorine ions, Ta4+ and oxygen vacancies in the sample. The FTNSs prepared by hydrothermal method under 180 degrees C for 24 h exhibits the highest hydrogen evolution rate (HER). The HER is 179.2 and 19.78 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) in the absence of any co-catalyst under full-spectrum and simulated solar light, respectively, which is higher than that of the Ta2O5 nanoshuttles without fluoride and the commercial Ta2O5. The higher HER can attribute to the existence of F, Ta4+ and oxygen vacancies, which enhance the photogenerated carrier mobility and Hydrogen production reduce the recombination.

In this study, noble-metal-free Zn0.5Cd0.5S@MoS2 core@shell nanoheterostructures were elaborately designed and successfully synthesized. The visible-light-driven photocatalytic performance investigation shows that the Zn0.5Cd0.5S@MoS2 exhibits a state-of-the-art H-2 evolution rate of 40.2 mmol g(-1) h(-1) far exceeding that of pristine Zn0.5Cd0.5S by more than 57 times. Moreover, thanks to the protection of MoS2 shells, the Zn0.5Cd0.5S@MoS2 can retain long-term stability in four-cycles of 24 h reactions. Furthermore, a tentative mechanism on H-2 generation was systematically investigated and proposed, which contributes to understand the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Zn0.5Cd0.5S@MoS2 heterostructures and may inspire the synthesis of other desirable catalytic systems.									34	2	0	0	2	0	34			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000483341000112

We present here a unique nanoparticulate type silver-oxide (AgOx-NP) based robust and highly stable electrocatalyst for efficient water oxidation. The AgOx-NP is generated in situ in a HCO3-/CO2 system under benign conditions. Micrographs show that they exhibit a nanoscale box type squared nano-bipyramidal configuration. The oxygen generation is initiated at low overpotential, and a sustained O-2 evolution current density of >1.1 mA cm(-2) is achieved during prolonged-period water electrolysis. The AgOx-NP electrocatalyst performs exceptionally well in metal-ion free neutral or near-neutral carbonate, phosphate and borate buffers relative to recently reported Co-oxide and Ni-oxide based heterogeneous electrocatalysts, which are unstable in metal-ion free electrolytes and tend to deactivate with time and lose catalytic performance during long-term experimental tests.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000381415200016	27472834

So far, all strategies focus on the use of nitrogen-containing carbon precursors, which limits the functionalization of commercially available carbon materials. Here, we present a post-functionalization method to boost the catalytic properties of carbon materials for the ORR by selectively enriching activated carbons with nitrogen graphitic species. A commercial high-surface area activated carbon was postfunctionalized by a two-step procedure. First, the commercial carbon was mixed with different carbon/urea weight ratios and heated in air at 350 degrees C. Then, the functionalized materials were heat-treated at high temperature (from 700 to 1300 degrees C) to tailor the amount and distribution of the different nitrogen species in the resulting carbon structure. Nitrogen functionalization using a carbon to urea weight ratio of 1:2 and heattreatment at 1100 degrees C led to highly selective doping in graphitic nitrogen species, which provided the tools to individually asses the catalytic activity of these nitrogen species. In addition, this study presents a low-cost and easily feasible synthesis route to improve the catalytic activity of carbon materials, leading to an onset potential of almost 0.9 V compared to reversible hydrogen electrode for ORR in an alkaline electrolyte. Moreover, this study provides significant evidence for the key role of graphitic nitrogen.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0008-6223	1873-3891		WOS:000809715300005		
J	Vani, B; Saradhi, PP; Mohanty, P								Characterization of high temperature induced stress impairments in thylakoids of rice seedlings								INDIAN JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY & BIOPHYSICS				38	4			220	229						AUG 2001	2001	Exposure of isolated thylakoids or intact plants to elevated temperature is known to inhibit photosynthesis at multiple sites. We have investigated the effect of elevated temperature (40 degreesC) for 24 hr in dark on rice seedlings to characterize the extent of damage by in vivo heat stress on photofunctions of photosystem II (PSII). Chl alpha fluorescence transient analysis in the intact rice leaves indicated a loss in PSII photochemistry (Fv) and an associated loss in the number of functional PSII units. Thylakoids isolated from rice seedlings exposed to mild heat stress exhibited >50% reduction in PSII catalyzed oxygen evolution activity compared to the corresponding control thylakoids. The ability of thylakoid membranes from heat exposed seedlings to photooxidize artificial PSII electron donor, DPC, subsequent to washing the thylakoids with alkaline Tris or NH2OH was also reduced by similar to 40% compared to control Tris or NH2OH washed thylakoids. This clearly indicated that besides the disruption of oxygen evolving complex (OEC) by 40 degreesC heat exposure for 24 hr, the PSII reaction centers were impaired by in vivo heat stress. The analysis of Mn and manganese stabilizing protein (MSP) contents showed no breakdown of 33 kDa extrinsic MSP and only a marginal loss in Mn. Thus, we suggest that the extent of heat induced loss of OEC must be due to disorganization of the OEC complex by in vivo heat stress. Studies with inhibitors like DCMU and atrazine clearly indicated that in vivo heat stress altered the acceptor side significantly. [C-14] Atrazine binding studies clearly demonstrated that there is a significant alteration in the Q(B) binding site on D1 as well as altered Q(A) to Q(B) equilibrium. Thus, our results show that the loss in PSII photochemistry by in vivo heat exposure not only alters the donor side but significantly alters the acceptor side of PSII.									16	1	1	0	17	0	19			0301-1208			WOS:000170769400002	11811616

Results demonstrate that Mn doping modifies the electronic structure of Co center to boost the intrinsic activity of active site in Co3O4, while inducing S in Co3O4 increases the electrical conductivity and provides ample S sites for proton adsorption. In addition, Mn and S dual-doping effectively increase the proportion of Co3+, resulting in facilitating the four-electron transfer and thus higher electrochemical activities. Consequently, the optimal Mn and S dual doping Co3O4 presents low overpotentials of 330, 407 and 460 mV at 10, 100 and 300 mA cm(-2) for OER, as well as a low Tafel slope of 68 mV dec(-1) and a good durability after 20 h. Current work highlights a feasible strategy to design electrocatalysts via dual-doping and maximizing the high-valence transition metal ions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

During some hypothetical accidental High Temperature (HT) transients, the materials should experience heavy steam oxidation and deep metallurgical evolutions. This promotes Alpha-Beta phase transformations and an associated strong partitioning of oxygen/hydrogen and of the main chemical alloying elements (Nb, Sn, Fe and Cr). Moreover, it has been shown quite recently that such chemical elements partitioning during on-cooling Beta-to-Alpha transformation can strongly impact the residual mechanical properties of HT oxidized materials. Thus, it appeared that it was important to better quantify and, if possible, to compute the quite complex phase equilibrium that occurs in multi-alloyed zirconium materials in the presence of both oxygen and hydrogen. For that, systematic studies have been performed on industrial alloys, charged with oxygen and/or hydrogen. After applying different heating/cooling scenarii, both Electron Microprobe using Wave Dispersive Spectrometry (WDS) and Nuclear Microprobe using Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis (ERDA) have been applied. Finally, to support the observed chemical elements partitioning between the Alpha and Beta allotropic phases, some thermodynamic calculations have been performed thanks to the development and the use of a specific thermodynamic database for zirconium alloys called "Zircobase".									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1012-0394			INSPEC:12677909

The electromotive force (emf) response at these temperatures was linear to the logarithm of DO concentration in the range from 0.6 to 8.0 ppm (log[O-2], -4.71 to -3.59). RuO2-SE displays a Nernstian slope of -41 mV per decade at pH 8.0. It was also found that the response/recovery time to DO changes were sluggish as the water temperature cools down. Response time T (90) to DO changes increased from 8 min at a temperature of 23 A degrees C to about 30 min at a temperature of 9 A degrees C. The proton conductivity of hydrous RuO2 appears to be due to the dissociative adsorption of water and the formation of acidic OH groups in Ru (III,IV) cluster ions. In strong alkaline solutions, the sensor's emf exhibited a mixed potential of fast and slow electrochemical reactions involving DO, RuO4 (2-) and OH- ions. The results also revealed that as pH of the solution increases to pH 10.0-13.0, the response/recovery rate becomes faster, stabilizing more or less quickly depending upon the solution alkalinity. Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray-analysis and impedance spectroscopy techniques were used to examine respectively the morphology, crystalline structure and electrochemical behaviour of sub-micron RuO2 oxides.									21	0	0	0	1	0	22			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000271026500006

Herein, we report a novel and facile catalyst-N, S co-doped carbon spheres with highly dispersed COO (CoO@NS-CSs), where biomass glucose spheres act as carbon precursor and H2S, NH3 derived from the decomposition of thiourea not only provide N, S sources but also can etch carbon spheres to produce nanoporous structure. CoO@NS-CSs catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity with a high onset potential of 0.946 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) and a half-wave potential of 0.821 V vs. RHE through a four-electron pathway in alkaline solution, which is comparable to commercial Pt/C catalyst (onset potential: 0.926 V vs. RHE, half-wave potential: 0.827 V vs. RHE). Furthermore, both the long-term stability and methanol-tolerance of CoO@NS-CSs catalyst are superior to those of commercial Pt/C catalyst. The excellent ORR performance of CoO@NS-CSs catalyst can be attributed to its micro-mesopore structure, high specific surface area (667 m(2) g(-1)), and highly dispersed CoO. This work manifests that the obtained CoO@NS-CSs catalyst is promising to be applied to fuel cells. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Deng, Aijun; Xia, Yunjin; Dong, Hongbiao; Wang, Haichuan; Fan, Dingdong								Prediction of re-oxidation behaviour of ultra-low carbon steel by different slag series								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				10	1					9423	10.1038/s41598-020-66318-w				JUN 10 2020	2020	A kinetic model was developed using FactSage Macro Processing to simulate the re-oxidation of ultra-low carbon steel via different oxidising slags. The calculated results show good agreement with experimental laboratory thermal simulation data. Therefore, the model can be used to predict the change behaviour of slag-metal-inclusion in the re-oxidation reaction of liquid steel. It can provide prediction and guidance for an accurate secondary oxidation control process. During the slag re-oxidation process, when the oxygen in the steel is supersaturated and the slag is low in oxidation, it can easily form stick-like and dendritic shape inclusions of Al2O3 in steel. As the (FeO) content increases in slag, the oxygen transfer from slag to steel is evident, and the inclusion size increases, showing clusters and spherical shapes. In addition, supersaturated oxygen in steel easily forms unstable Al2O3-TiOx inclusions with [Ti]. As the components of liquid steel tend to be uniform, the Al2O3-TiOx inclusions will decompose and disappear, forming stable Al2O3 and TiO2 inclusions. The number of inclusions can be reduced by increasing the basicity and the ratio of CaO to Al2O3 in the initial slag.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000560478900039	32523016

Experiments were performed in an anvil-with-hole apparatus conducted at 4 GPa, 1550 degrees C, and oxygen fugacity (fO(2)) from 2.1 to 3.3 log units below IW buffer. The technique of hydrogen fugacity (fH(2)) buffering via the dissociation of H2O employed here relies upon the diffusion of H-2 through Pt to achieve equal chemical potentials of H-2 in the Pt capsule and outer assemblage elements. The nitrogen source was Si3N4. The fO(2) imposed on the charge was controlled by redox reactions between H-2 buffered externally, Si3N4 and components of the Fe-bearing melt that was reduced with O-2 liberation and metallic Fe formation. The initial Si3N4 was unstable under the experimental conditions and completely consumed according to the reaction of oxidation: Si3N4 (initial) + 3O(2) -> 3SiO(2) (melt) + 2N(2) (melt) with a subsequent participation of nitrogen in the reactions with H-2, the components of silicate and metallic melts.The nitrogen and hydrogen solubility, calculated as N and H, ranges from 0.4 to 1.9 wt.% and from 0.2 to 0.3 wt.%, accordingly. The nitrogen content in iron globules at Delta logfO(2)(IW) = -3.3 was measured as 4.4 wt.%. Characterization by Raman and IR spectroscopy indicates that at fO(2), where a metallic Fe phase is stable, the silicate melt would contain species with N-H bonds (NH3, NH4+, NH2-, NH2+) as well as N-2, oxidized H species (OH- and H2O) and H-2.Experimental studies have shown that the fO(2) evolution during metal segregation would have strongly influenced the nature of nitrogen and hydrogen species in reduced magmas of the early Earth.

J	Tahar, NB; Savall, A								Electrochemical degradation of phenol in aqueous solution on bismuth doped lead dioxide: a comparison of the activities of various electrode formulations								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY				29	3			277	283						MAR 1999	1999	This paper describes the development of electrochemical processes for the oxidative degradation of toxic organic chemicals in waste waters. Doped bismuth lead dioxide anodes have been tested by the kinetic study of phenol anodic oxidation in aqueous solution. The main products during oxidative degradation of phenol are 1,4-benzoquinone, maleic acid and carbon dioxide. Several deposits of Bi2O5-PbO2 on Ti/(IrO2-Ta2O5) substrates have been prepared by anodic oxidation of Pb2+ and Bi3+ in aqueous solutions containing perchloric acid to increase the solubility of bismuth. To study the effect of perchlorate ions, the efficiency of the PbO2 deposit prepared from lead nitrate in an aqueous solution (pure PbO2) was compared with that of a deposit prepared from perchloric acid solution (perchlorate doped PbO2). Although the phenol is oxidized at the same rate on the two deposits, the charge corresponding to the total elimination of 1,4-benzoquinone is three times higher for perchlorate doped PbO2 than for pure PbO2. Phenol degradation is more efficiently carried out on a PbO2 anode doped with perchlorate and with bismuth than on the same electrode doped only with perchlorate, Among the electrodes tested in this work, the pure PbO2 anode is the most efficient for phenol degradation. It is assumed that certain active sites on the anode occupied by perchlorate ions do not participate in the transfer of oxygen atoms and that for the PbO2 electrode doped with bismuth, oxygen evolution is favoured to the detriment of oxygen atom transfer.									134	21	0	0	32	0	147			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000079379900001

We studied the structure of dimeric supercomplexes of photosystem LI and its associated light-harvesting antenna by electron microscopy and single-particle image analysis. Comparison of averaged projections from native complexes and complexes without extrinsic polypeptides indicates that the removal of 17 and 23 kDa extrinsic subunits induces a shift of about 1.2 nm in the position of the monomeric peripheral antenna protein CP29 toward the central part of the supercomplex. Removal of the 33 kDa extrinsic protein induces an inward shift of the strongly bound trimeric light-harvesting complex II (S-LHCII) of about 0.9 nm, and in addition destabilizes the monomer-monomer interactions in the central core dimer, leading to structural rearrangements of the core monomers. It is concluded that the extrinsic subunits keep the S-LHCII and CP29 subunits in proper positions at some distance from the central part of the photosystem II core dimer to ensure a directed transfer of excitation energy through the monomeric peripheral antenna proteins CP26 and CP29 and/or to maintain sequestered domains of inorganic cofactors required for oxygen evolution.									66	1	2	0	63	0	69			0006-2960			WOS:000090107300018	11041855

Herein, we present a facile and effective strategy for the synthesis of ultrafine PdCo bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs, diameter approximate to 4.1 nm) encapsulated in N-doped porous carbon nanocapsules (PdCo@NPNCs) by a one-pot PdCl42- and Co2+-mediated polymerization of dopamine on SiO2 nanospheres, followed by carbonization and chemical etching. The N-doped porous carbon shell that is formed in situ from a dopamine coating could effectively prevent the coalescence of NPs during the carbonization process. Also the carbon shell protects the NPs from detachment and agglomeration as well as dissolution during fuel cell operation. Benefiting from the synergistic effect from their unique structures and chemical compositions, the optimized PdCo@NPNCs exhibit better electrocatalytic activity and enhanced durability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) in alkaline solution than those of commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) and Pd/C (10 wt%) catalysts, even though the content of PdCo is as low as 3.68 wt%. Furthermore, the synthetic method described here can be generalized to other bimetallic NPs confined in NPNCs that can be used in a broad range of applications such as catalysis, environmental protection, drug delivery, chemical and biological sensing, and so forth.									75	3	0	0	0	0	76			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000402734600012

The discharge is driven by a damped sinusoidal voltage waveform at peak-to-peak amplitudes of 8 kV(pp)-13 kV(pp) and pulse repetition frequencies of 250 Hz-4000 Hz. Absolute densities of O-3, NO2, NO3, as well as estimates of the sum of the densities of N2O4 and N2O5 are determined temporally resolved by means of optical absorption spectroscopy using a laser driven broadband light source, suitable interference filters, and a photodiode detector. The measured densities are acquired across the center of the reactor chamber as well as at the outlet of the chamber. The temporal and spatial evolution of the species' densities is correlated to the conversion of n-butane at concentrations of 50 ppm and 400 ppm, measured by means of flame ionization detectors. The n-butane is admixed either before or after the reactor chamber, in order to separate the impact of short- and long-lived reactive species on the conversion process. It is found that, despite the stationary conversion at the selected operating points, at higher voltages and repetition frequencies the densities of the measured species are not in steady state. Based on the produced results it is presumed that the presence of n-butane modifies the formation and consumption pathways of O-3. At the same time, there is no significant impact on the formation of dinitrogen oxides (N2O4 and N2O5). Furthermore, a comparatively high conversion of n-butane, when admixed at the outlet of the reactor chamber is observed. These findings are discussed together with known rate coefficients for the reactions of n-butane with selected RONS.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000762052900001

These profiles are extracted from the complete evolution of progenitor stars, evolved through the main sequence and the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stages, and from time-dependent element diffusion during white dwarf evolution. We discuss the importance of the initial-final mass relationship for the white dwarf carbon-oxygen composition. In particular, we find that the central oxygen abundance may be underestimated by about 15% if the white dwarf mass is assumed to be the hydrogen-free core mass before the first thermal pulse. We also discuss the importance for the chemical profiles expected in the outermost layers of ZZ Ceti stars of the computation of the thermally pulsing AGB phase and of the phase in which element diffusion is relevant. We find a strong dependence of the outer layer chemical stratification on the stellar mass. In particular, in the less massive models, the double-layered structure in the helium layer built up during the thermally pulsing AGB phase is not removed by diffusion by the time the ZZ Ceti stage is reached. Finally, we perform adiabatic pulsation calculations and discuss the implications of our new chemical profiles for the pulsational properties of ZZ Ceti stars. We find that the whole g-mode period spectrum and the mode-trapping properties of these pulsating white dwarfs as derived from our new chemical profiles are substantially different from those based on chemical profiles widely used in existing asteroseismological studies. Thus, we expect the asteroseismological models derived from our chemical profiles to be significantly different from those found thus far.									60	0	0	0	0	0	60			0004-637X			WOS:000280650800024

Here, we systematically studied the catalytic performance of two 3d transition metal (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) atoms loaded on C2N monolayer. Through density functional theory calculations and systematic theoretical screening, it is known that Sc and Ti loaded structures can undergo nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR). Unfortunately, the limiting potential (UL) of NRR is not very friendly and is not conducive to the production of NH3. In order to reduce the UL of NRR, we further studied the structure of B and Ti co-doping (B-Ti-2 @C2N). As expected, the UL of the B-Ti-2 @C2N via the consecutive pathway is 0.10 eV, with high electrocatalytic activity, which effectively inhibiting the competition of the hydrogen evolution reaction. This theoretical research not only adds a new member to the family of electrocatalysts for nitrogen fixation, but also further increases our physical insights on adjusting catalytic activity, which is expected to guide the rational design of improving the catalyst activity of NRR.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000804425300001

The C-13(alpha, n) reaction and its role as a neutron source for the s process								PHYSICAL REVIEW C				78	2					025803	10.1103/PhysRevC.78.025803				AUG 2008	2008	The C-13(alpha,n) O-16 reaction constitutes the dominant neutron source for the main s process, which operates thermal energy of kT = 8 keV. Since the cross section at stellar energies is very small, the reaction rate cannot be directly determined and has to be extrapolated from cross section results obtained at higher energies. To remove various discrepancies in the normalization of previous data sets and to subsequently improve the reliability of the extrapolation, we performed measurements of the C-13(alpha, n)O-16 reaction in the energy range Ec.m. = 320-700keV. In addition, the double differential scattering cross section C-13(alpha, alpha)C-13 was measured in the energy range E-lab = 2.6-6.2 MeV for 28 angles. These data were used to constrain possible contributions from background resonances for a reliable extrapolation with the multichannel R-matrix code SAMMY. As a result, the uncertainties were significantly reduced, and a reaction rate of (4.6 +/- 1.0) x 10-(14) cm(3)/moles at kT = 8 keV (T = 0.1 x 10(9) K) was determined.									91	4	0	0	0	0	94			0556-2813	1089-490X		WOS:000259368700073		
J	Cant, NW; Patterson, MJ								The storage of nitrogen oxides on alumina-supported barium oxide								CATALYSIS TODAY				73	3-4			271	278	PII S0920-5861(02)00010-X	10.1016/S0920-5861(02)00010-X				APR 15 2002	2002	The storage and release of NO2 on alumina-supported barium oxide has been studied with particular attention to the stoichiometry of the two processes. At 400 degreesC the storage process is characterised. by a short period of complete uptake, possibly as nitrito or nitro species, followed by a slower partial uptake in which approximately one NO is released for every three NO2 lost. The latter reaction appears to supply the oxygen necessary to store NO2 as nitrate ions. Molecular O-2 has little direct involvement even if in large excess. The second storage reaction also occurs, but to a much lesser extent, with Al2O3 alone. During temperature programmed desorption, release of NOx from Al2O3 peaks at similar to430degreesC with evolution of NO2 and Some O-2. Release from BaO/Al2O3 exhibits an additional peak near 520degreesC corresponding to formation of NO and a higher O-2 concentration. The NO may arise from NO2 since BaO/Al2O3 has activity for NO2 decomposition by 500degreesC. Although CO2 at low concentration is rapidly taken up by BaO/Al2O3 at 400degreesC it is displaced by NO2 and does not interfere with storage. Thermodynamic calculations show that the formation of Ba(NO3)(2) by the reaction of NO2 with bulk BaCO3 under the conditions used here is more favourable above 380degreesC if NO is evolved than if O-2 is consumed.

It has been assumed so far that the reactions occur across the entire catalyst layer (CL), which is designed and fabricated uniformly with catalysts, conductors of protons and electrons, and pathways for reactants and products. By introducing a state-of-the-art characterization system, a thin, highly tunable liquid/gas diffusion layer (LGDL), and an innovative design of electrochemical proton exchange membrane electrolyzer cells (PEMECs), the electrochemical reactions on both microspatial and microtemporal scales are revealed for the first time. Surprisingly, reactions occur only on the CL adjacent to good electrical conductors. On the basis of these findings, new CL fabrications on the novel LGDLs exhibitmore than 50 times higher mass activity than conventional catalyst-coated membranes in PEMECs. This discovery presents an opportunity to enhance the multiphase interfacial effects, maximizing the use of the catalysts and significantly reducing the cost of these devices.									111	1	0	0	1	0	112			2375-2548			WOS:000391267800009	28138516

Site-specific mutagenesis has been used to alter a portion of the psbB gene encoding the large extrinsic loop E of CP 47 in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803, Alteration of a lysine residue occurring at position 321 to glycine produced a strain with altered PSII activity. This strain grew at wild-type rates in complete BG-11 media (480 mu M chloride). However, oxygen evolution rates for this mutant in complete media were only 60% of the observed wild-type rates. Quantum yield measurements at low light intensities indicated that the mutant had 66% of the fully functional PSII centers contained in the control strain. The mutant proved to be extremely sensitive to photoinactivation at high light intensities, exhibiting a 3-fold increase in the rate of photoinactivation. When this mutant was grown in media depleted of chloride (30 mu M chloride), it lost the ability to grow photoautotrophically while the control strain exhibited a normal rate of growth. The effect of chloride depletion on the growth rate of the mutant was reversed by the addition of 480 mu M bromide to the chloride-depleted BG-11 media. In the presence of glucose, the mutant and control strains grew at comparable rates in either chloride-containing or chloride-depleted media, Oxygen evolution rates for the mutant were further depressed (28% of control rates) under chloride-limiting conditions. Addition of bromide restored these rates to those observed under chloride-sufficient conditions. Measurements of the variable fluorescence yield indicated that the mutant assembled fewer functional centers in the absence of chloride. These results indicate that the mutation K321G in CP 47 affects PSII stability and/or assembly under conditions where chloride is limiting.									25	0	0	0	23	0	25			0167-4412	1573-5028		WOS:A1997XK29000008	9225856

Precise control of the physical correlations among spin, charge, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom in these oxides can exercise considerable enhancement of ORR activity, but has until now remained elusive. Here, we show that nonmagnetic hexavalent molybdenum (Mo6+) atomically dispersed within oxide lattice steers the intrinsic activity of catalytically active sites by entrapping extrinsic electrons at their 3d orbitals, without the occurrence of lattice symmetry breaking and magnetic perturbation. With double perovskite La2Co2+Mn4+O6 as a model catalyst, the atomic-scale electron trap generates additional high-spin, catalytically active Mn3+(t32ge1g) sites and highly conductive Co2+(e2g)-O-Mn3+(e1g) double exchange channels, leading to five-fold improvement in ORR activity. First-principles calculations reveal a substantial increase of the spin density on Mn sites caused by electron trapping, and unambiguously confirm a more exothermic reaction pathway as well as a lower barrier of the rate-limiting surface hydroxide regeneration on Mo-1/La2CoMnO6. We can also extend this strategy with atomic precision easily to other four oxide catalysts and achieve large enhancement in their ORR activities as anticipated, indicating its broad utility. This work embodies the theories of condensed matter physics in rational design of ORR catalysts, and may inspire further development of the control of electron correlation in strongly correlated electron systems.									44	2	0	0	1	0	45			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000621101100024

In this work, monodisperse bimetallic Ni-Pd core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) with tunable shell compositions and contents were synthesized by using a modified one-pot colloidal approach and characterized. Also, the core shell structure dependence of their ORR performance without the interruption of an intermetallic phase was explored. The core-shell structured catalysts (Ni@Pd3/C NPs) exhibited a robust ORR activity and stability with a high onset potential of 0.99 V, a half-wave potential of 0.87 V and an average electron transfer number of 3.91 in 0.1 M HClO4. Furthermore, a high onset potential of 0.98 V, a half-wave potential of 0.86 V and an average electron transfer number of 3.98 were achieved in 0.1 M KOH. These results are comparable to those of the commercially available Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, the catalysts also maintained a good long-term cycling stability in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Thus, this work demonstrates that the ORR performance of the Ni-Pd alloy could be boosted through constructing the core-shell structure with a Pd-enriched surface and the Ni-Pd model alloy could be further applied to assess the role of the Pd-based core-shell structure in other electrochemical catalytic reactions.									48	1	0	0	2	0	49			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000401316100049

However, current research on NOER catalysts mainly focuses on noble metals and single atom catalysts, while low-cost transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are rarely considered. Herein, by applying density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we study the catalytic performance of NOER over 2H-MoS2 monolayers with the most common S vacancies and some Mo atoms substituted by transition metal atoms (denoted as TM-MoS2@V-S). Our results show that an S vacancy and a heteroatom substitution tend to form a first nearest neighbour (1NN) pair, which greatly improves the NOER catalytic performance of 2H-MoS2. The S vacancy site can trigger NOER by strongly adsorbing a NO molecule and elongating the NO bond, while the heteroatom dopant can assist NOER by tuning the electron donating capability of 2H-MoS2 which breaks the linear scaling relations among key reaction intermediates. At low NO coverage, NH3 can be correspondingly yielded at -0.06 and -0.38 V onset potentials over the Pt- and Au-doped MoS2 catalysts with S vacancies (Pt-MoS2@V-S and Au-MoS2@V-S). At high NO coverage, N2O/N-2 is thermodynamically favored. Meanwhile, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is suppressed. Thus, the Pt-MoS2@V-S catalysts are promising candidates for NOER. In addition, coupling the substitutional doping of Mo atoms to S vacancies presents great potential in improving the catalytic activity and selectivity of MoS2 for other reactions. In general, the strategy of coupling hetero-metal doping and chalcogen vacancy can be extended to enhance the catalytic activity of other TMDCs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000691698000001	34525138

Here, Rh with a unique capability to resist against oxidation etching was incorporated into Pd-based catalysts to enhance both their activity and durability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This idea was achieved through the synthesis of the Rh-Pd alloy nanodendrites by co-reducing Rh and Pd salt precursors in oleylamine (OAm) containing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). In this synthesis, Rh-Pd alloy nanostructures with Rh-Pd atomic ratios from 19 : 1 to 1 : 4 were generated by varying the molar ratios of Rh and Pd salt precursors. Interestingly, this variation of the molar ratios of the precursors from Rh rich to Pd rich would lead to the shape evolution of Rh-Pd alloy from dendritic nanostructures to spherical aggregations. We found that Br- ions derived from CTAB were also indispensible to the production of Rh-Pd alloy nanodendrites. Owing to the addition of highly stable Rh as well as the radical structure with a large number of low-coordinated sites on the arms, Rh-Pd alloy nanodendrites with a Rh-Pd atomic ratio of 4 : 1 (Rh80Pd20) exhibited a substantially enhanced electrocatalytic performance towards ORR with a 5% loss of mass activity during the accelerated stability test for 10 000 cycles compared to similar to 50% loss of the commercial Pt/C (E-TEK).									49	3	0	0	3	0	50			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000337143900096	24842604

We report the crystal-plane-controlled selectivity of uniform capping-ligand-free Cu2O octahedra, cubes, and rhombic dodecahedra in catalyzing propylene oxidation with O-2: Cu2O octahedra exposing {111} crystal planes are most selective for acrolein; Cu2O cubes exposing {100} crystal planes are most selective for CO2; Cu2O rhombic dodecahedra exposing {110} crystal planes are most selective for propylene oxide. One-coordinated Cu on Cu2O(111), three-coordinated O on Cu2O(110), and two-coordinated O on Cu2O(100) were identified as the catalytically active sites for the production of acrolein, propylene oxide, and CO2, respectively. These results reveal that crystal-plane engineering of oxide catalysts could be a useful strategy for developing selective catalysts and for gaining fundamental understanding of complex heterogeneous catalytic reactions at the molecular level.									162	15	1	0	15	1	169			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000335202700016	24692419

Herein, through an in situ preparation and Ca-substitution of MnO/C, we were able to obtain a novel composite, i.e., Ca0.5Mn0.5O/C, as a highly active, stable, and cost-effective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst in alkaline media. Ca0.5Mn0.5O/C and MnO/C share a similar rock-salt phase. In comparison to MnO/C, Ca0.5Mn0.5O/C follows a more effective four-electron pathway (versus a two-electron pathway) and displays higher ORR activity, including a more positive onset potential (by 0.05 V), a more positive half-wave potential (by 0.04 V), and a higher current density (by 1.48 mA cm(-2)). The Ca0.5Mn0.5O/C also shows comparable mass activity, higher activity per material cost, and superior stability in alkaline media in comparison to commercial Pt/C. Additionally, the as-prepared Ca0.5Mn0.5O/C exhibits higher ORR activity than the physical mixture of Ca0.5Mn0.5O and carbon. The enhanced ORR performance of Ca0.5Mn0.5O/C is likely due to (1) the presence of the divalent redox pair Mn-II/Mn-III; (2) the formation of MnOOH on the Ca0.5Mn0.5O surface; and (3) a stronger synergistic interaction between Ca0.5Mn0.5O and C resulting from the in situ preparation method. This work provides new routes to develop advanced electrocatalysts using transition-metal-oxide/carbon composites.									13	1	0	0	0	0	14			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000390433700056

Herein, an acid-assisted approach has been developed to prepare nitrogen-doped graphene electrocatalysts via the co-precipitation of graphene oxide (GO) and melamine in the presence of various inorganic acids (e.g., HNO3, H2SO4, and H3PO4), and a subsequent pyrolysis process. When used as an electrocatalyst, the nitrogen doped graphene prepared in the presence of nitric acid exhibited the best catalytic activity towards the ORR by a four-electron pathway with the largest current density (similar to 5.5 mA cm(-2)) and the highest onset potential (similar to 0.90 V vs. RHE) in comparison with the samples prepared in the presence of sulfuric acid and phosphate acid. Being a corrosive and oxidizing acid, nitric acid is likely to promote the formation of surface defects and pyridinic nitrogen under the thermal treatment, thus improving the electrocatalytic activity. More importantly, Zn-air batteries were fabricated by using the as-prepared electrocatalysts in the air electrode, exhibiting high power density and good long-term stability. This facile acid-assisted approach provides a new strategy to synthesize low-cost yet highly efficient heteroatom doped carbon electrocatalysts for the ORR.									20	1	0	0	0	0	21			2052-1553			WOS:000410296700020

Electrochemically driven fluorination, polymerizations, C-H or C-X (X=halide) activation and CO(2)reduction are few examples in this regard. Although electrodes play a key role in these processes, acting as catalysts or synthons in many reactions, their activity has been often neglected or given negligible significance. This review critically analyses the use of different electrodes including Pt, Ni, Cu, stainless steel, sacrificial anodes, B-doped diamond and C-based electrodes in the broad context of organic synthesis while highlighting their potential and limitations. Besides, we also elaborated the electrocatalytic reactions associated with the solvents that are essential to bring out above-mentioned reactions. Thus, this review provides useful guidelines not only for driving typical organic reactions, but also to design new synthetic pathways which will improve our understanding of making organic conversions greener and will also help us realize sustainability in the field of electroorganic synthesis.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000568871700001

A relatively fast reaction was found between Ni and Ti in the absence of PCAs and formation of B2-NiTi nano-crystallites were detected using XRD and TEM after 30h of milling. The mean particle and crystallite size were similar to 2 mu m and similar to 30nm, respectively. Using ethanol, methanol or stearic acid as PCA, resulted in the reduction of the milled products to similar to 90nm (exhibited by SEM), but no NiTi phase formed. Instead the milled products were found to be contaminated by oxygen.

With the promise of graphene-based materials to replace precious metal catalysts, descriptors of their chemical activity are much needed. Here, a site-specific electronic descriptor is proposed based on the p(z) (pi) orbital occupancy and its contribution to electronic states at the Fermi level. Simple structural descriptors are identified, and a linear predictive model is developed to precisely estimate adsorption free energies of OH (G(OH)) at various sites of doped graphene, and it is demonstrated through prediction of the most optimal site for catalysis of ORR. These structural descriptors, essentially the number of ortho, meta, and para sites of N/B-doped graphene sheet, can be extended to other doped sp(2) hybridized systems, and greatly reduce the computational effort in estimating G(OH) and site-specific catalytic activity.									49	3	0	0	1	0	51			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000426872300012	29282859

(2012). Proper fitting of eddy diffusion results in a reduction of the mean difference between 63 observed mixing ratios and their calculated values from a factor of 5 in my previous models for Titan to a factor of 3 in the current model. Oxygen chemistry on Titan is initiated by influxes of H2O from meteorites and O+ from magnetospheric interactions with the Saturn rings and Enceladus. Two versions of the model were calculated, with and without the O+ flux. Balances of CO, CO2, H2O, and H2CO are discussed in detail for both versions. The calculated model with the O+ flux agrees with the observations of CO, CO2, and H2O, including recent H2O CIRS limb observations and measurements by the Herschel Space Observatory.Major observational data and photochemical models for Triton and Pluto are briefly discussed. While the basic atmospheric species N-2, CH4, and CO are similar on Triton and Pluto, properties of their atmospheres are very different with atomic species and ions dominating in Triton's upper atmosphere and ionosphere opposed to the molecular composition on Pluto. Calculations favor a transition between two types of photochemistry at the CH4 mixing ratio of similar to 5 x 10(-4). Therefore Triton's current photochemistry is still similar to that at the Voyager flyby despite the observed increase in N-2 and CH4. The meteorite H2O results in precipitation of CO on Triton and CO2 on Pluto near perihelion. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									32	0	0	0	2	0	32			0032-0633			WOS:000314007400042

The chemical composition of the electrodeposition bath can have a great impact on the final coating quality and the economics of the process. In traditional aqueous electrolytes, zinc deposition competes with the hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions, which can lead to hydrogen embrittlement of the substrate as well as decrease in efficiency. Highly concentrated water-in-salt electrolytes can suppress these reactions significantly. Here, we show that electrodeposition of zinc with high efficiencies can be achieved using an acetate-based water-in-salt electrolyte at room temperature. Nucleation studies confirm that at potentials more negative than -1.30 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the three-dimensional (3D) nucleation process becomes instantaneous, while at more positive potentials it is progressive. Using two of the most common nucleation and growth models, Scharifker-Mostany and Mirkin-Nilov-Heerman-Tarallo, nucleation parameters such as the nucleation rate constant and nuclei density are found, showing a good agreement between the two models.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2196-0216			WOS:000680140000020

The H-2 generation is performed in a divided electrolysis cell in which the hydrogen evolution reaction occurs on a cathode and ferrous iron oxidation on an anode. Electrochemically produced Fe(III) species are reduced back to ferrous form in a reaction with biochar concentrated in a packed-bed column through which an acidic anolyte (FeCl3) solution is continuously recirculated. During the operation of the proposed process with commercial charcoal, the oxidation of carbon resulted in an accumulation of oxygen-containing groups on the carbon surface that leads to charcoal deactivation. Thermal treatment of the charcoal at 250, 350, and 450 degrees C in a nitrogen atmosphere resulted in reactivation of carbon, and the best results (approximate to 80% reactivation) were achieved after 3 h of treatment at 450 degrees C. Nine successful cycles of electrolysis-charcoal regeneration were performed in this study. A approximate to 98% current efficiency for hydrogen production was achieved at a current density of 50 mA/cm(2). Much higher current densities can be obtained using the proposed technique as the anodic process of ferrous iron oxidation is decoupled from the carbon oxidation process. The CO2 production rate achieved in this study was up to 98% of a stoichiometric value proposed for the iron-mediated carbon-assisted water electrolysis process.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2470-1343			WOS:000600090900047	33344845

Using this framework, we calculated simultaneously time-integrated and time-averaged metamorphic fluid fluxes of 83.4 +/- 35.4 m(3) m(-2) and 10(-10.1) (+/-) (0.5) m(3) m(-2) s(-1), respectively, a time-averaged reaction rate constant of 10(-12.7--10.2) m s(-1) and comparable timescales for fluid flow and fluid-driven reaction of 10(4.3 +/- 0.5) yr and 10(2.7-5.2) yr, respectively. These parameters were calculated using an empirical estimate of the coefficient of molecular diffusion and a calculated value for metamorphic porosity. Our estimates are (1) consistent with single pass flow of fluid released by metamorphic devolatilization, (2) within the range where heat is transported by conduction and matter is transported by advection, (3) in agreement with an emerging consensus that metamorphic events are relatively short-lived, and (4) supportive of applying laboratory-based estimates of kinetic parameters to metamorphic systems. Based on a sensitivity analysis, we show that (1) selecting the diffusion coefficient (rather than fluid velocity, reaction rate or flow duration) as an input parameter yields more robust estimates of metamorphic fluid flow parameters, and (2) ignoring reaction-dependent porosity and reaction rates can result in an order-of-magnitude uncertainty in best-fit flow parameters, evaluated from concentration profiles. Finally, similarity between our calculated time-averaged metamorphic fluid fluxes which were obtained numerically and those which were obtained analytically confirms the validity of using the 'quasi-stationary state' assumption to quantify metamorphic fluid flow parameters.

Thus, inhomogeneous chemical evolution models present themselves as a test for stellar nucleosynthesis calculations. Applying such a model to our Galaxy reveals a number of shortcomings of existing nucleosynthesis yields. One problem is the predicted scatter in [O/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] which is too large compared to that observed in metal-poor halo stars. This can be either due to the oxygen or magnesium yields or due to the iron yields (or both). However, oxygen and magnesium are alpha-elements that are produced mainly during hydrostatic burning and thus are not affected by the theoretical uncertainties in the collapse and explosion of a massive star. Stellar iron yields, on the other hand, depend heavily on the choice of the mass-cut between ejecta and proto-neutron star and are therefore very uncertain. We present iron yield distributions as a function of progenitor mass that are consistent with the abundance distribution of metal-poor halo stars and are in agreement with observed Ni-56 yields of core-collapse supernovae with known progenitor masses. The iron yields of lower-mass SNe II (in the range 10-20 M-.) are well constrained by these observations. Present observations, however, do not allow us to determine a unique solution for higher-mass SNe. Nevertheless, the main dependence of the stellar iron yields as function of progenitor mass can be derived and may be used as a constraint for future core-collapse supernova/hypernova models. A prediction of hypernova models is the existence of ultra alpha-element enhanced stars at metallicities [Fe/H] less than or equal to -2.5, which can be tested by future observations. The results are of importance for the earliest stages of galaxy formation when the ISM is dominated by local chemical inhomogeneities and the instantaneous mixing approximation is not valid.									57	1	0	0	0	0	58			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000176441300010

Among these samples, the quaternary porous nanocubes (Cu-Ni-CoSex) proved to be the excellent bifunctional electrocatalysts in dye-sensitized solar cells and hydrogen evolution reactions. Under the standard irradiation, Cu-Ni-CoSex nanocubes exhibited a high power conversion efficiency of 9.74% in solar cells, which was much superior than that of N (8.19%). Cu-Ni-CoSex nanocubes also delivered superb hydrogen evolution performance in terms of a low overpotential (50.2 mV) under the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope (49.6 mV dec(-1)) in alkaline medium.

The as prepared material (NCNTs-AgNFs) has been characterized by various instrumental methods. The morphological analysis shows the unique rose-like AgNFs are placed onto the NCNTs with better dispersion. The higher population of AgNFs has also been observed onto NCNTs coated glassy carbon (GC) rather than bare GC plate. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows chemical reduction and N-doping has done successfully with the restoring sp(2) domain in carbon network. The electrocatalytic activities have been verified using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and hydrodynamic voltammetry techniques in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The resulting catalyst system, NCNT-AgNFs, surpasses the performance of Pt/C, in terms of a kinetic current density, better fuel selectivity and durability. It is also noteworthy that the NCNT-AgNFs exhibits a four electron reduction pathway for ORR with lowering H2O2 yield. The admirable performance of NCNT-AgNFs catalyst along with higher durability holds great potential for application in various fuel cells as cathode catalyst.

Anion-regulated electrocatalysts with abundant active sites benefit the redox kinetics by the integration of different anions into the hetero-anionic structure. Herein, a series of NiCo (oxy)selenide electrocatalysts with an oxygen-selenium hetero-anionic structure were designed and fabricated by the introduction of Se2- into NiCo-layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) nanoboxes created by etching cubic ZIF-67 with Ni2+. It was demonstrated that the Se-doping NiCo-LDH (NiCo-LDH-Se) electrocatalyst exhibited preferable electrocatalytic activities for sulfur redox reactions. Moreover, the hollow nanobox structures provide a large inner space for sulfur storage, and could effectively suppress the shuttle effect by their chemical binding/adsorption with polysulfide. A fabricated Li-S battery with the NiCo-LDH-Se cathode showed excellent electrochemical performance, revealing stable cycling over 1000 cycles with a low-capacity fading rate of 0.02% per cycle at 2C (1C = 1675 mA g(-1)) and a high-rate capability (733 mA h g(-1) at 4C). This work affords an efficient strategy to accelerate the sulfur reaction kinetics and sheds light on the rational design of high-performance electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000755748400001

A linear decrease in specific kinetic current at 0.7 V was noted with increasing phosphate anion concentration. It was also found that the adsorption of phosphate species on CN., was strong and the corresponding ORR activity was not recovered when the catalyst was reintroduced to a fresh HClO4 solution. Trends similar to those noted upon addition of HClO4 to the half-cell were observed when CNx catalysts were soaked ins phosphoric acid. Adsorption of dihydrogen phosphate ions on the surface of CNx exposed to phosphoric acid was verified by transmission infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS results also showed a decrease in the surface concentration of pyridinic-N species accompanied by an increase of equal magnitude in the surface fraction of quaternary-N species, which would include the pyridinic-NH sites. A linear correlation was observed between the loss in pyridinic-N site density and that in ORR activity. The observed poisoning phenomenon is consistent with the two possible active site models, i.e., pyridinic-N sites, which would be rendered inactive by protonation, or the C sites neighboring pyridinic-N species. These latter species would be poisoned by a site blocking effect if they strongly adsorb the phosphate ions. Strong adsorption of negatively charged phosphate ions on neighboring C atoms would also stabilize the pyridinic-NH sites. By identifying a poison that can be used as a probe, this study provides a first step toward identification and quantification of active sites in CNx catalysts.									87	3	0	0	9	0	87			2155-5435			WOS:000385057900111

Though the metal organic framework (MOF)-based materials are highly promising candidates in the area of material chemistry, the combined properties associated with MOFs and the one-dimensional (1D) fibrous matrix, which can lead to better electrocatalytic performance, have been less explored. Herein, we ascertain a fabrication method for ZIF-67 (zeolite imidazolate framework) nanofibers (NFs), Fe-ZIF NFs, and Fe-ZIF-67 NFs via the wet chemical combined electrospinning (ES) approach. The as-synthesized catalysts were utilized for the electrochemical reaction, which showed a high efficiency toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Compared to other catalysts, the Fe-ZIF-67 NF catalyst showed a very less overpotential of 278 mV at a fixed current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The obtained Tafel slope and R-ct values are 77 mV dec(-1) and 1.2 Omega, respectively. The post-X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed the transformation of FeOOH during the OER study along with Co3+ states in mixed Fe-ZIF-67 NFs. In an alkaline electrolyzer, Fe-ZIF-67 NFs were utilized as the anode and a Pt wire as the cathode in 1 M KOH solution, which required a cell voltage of 1.68 V at 10 mA cm(-2) current density with astonishing stability. Hence, this work should open a new path for the exploration of efficient non-noble metal catalysts for energy-related applications.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000630142600056	33647199	
J	Hinojosa, Jose A., Jr.; Weaver, Jason F.								Surface structural evolution during the thermal decomposition of a PdO(101) thin film								SURFACE SCIENCE				605	19-20			1797	1806		10.1016/j.susc.2011.06.014				OCT 2011	2011	We used scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to characterize PdO(101) thin films grown on Pd(111), and the structural changes that occur during isothermal decomposition. We find that the PdO(101) thin films have high-quality surface structures that are characterized by large, crystalline terraces with low concentrations of point defects. Small domains of single-layer oxide are also present on the top layer of relatively thick PdO(101) films grown at 500 K. The thinner PdO(101) films exhibit negligible quantities of such domains, apparently because new domains agglomerate rapidly as the film thickness decreases. We find that the isothermal decomposition rate of a PdO(101) film at 720 K exhibits an autocatalytic regime in which the rate of oxygen desorption increases as the oxide decomposes. Our STM results demonstrate that reduced sites created during oxide decomposition catalyze further PdO decomposition, and reveal strong kinetic anisotropies in the decomposition. The kinetic anisotropies produce one-dimensional reaction fronts that propagate preferentially along the atomic rows of the PdO(101) surface, resulting in the formation of long chains of reduced sites. We also find that reduced sites promote oxygen recombination in neighboring rows of the Pd(101) structure, causing loops and larger aggregates of reduced sites to form. The promotion of decomposition across the atomic rows can qualitatively explain the autocatalytic desorption kinetics. Finally, the STM images provide evidence that underlying PdO(101) layers transfer oxygen to reduced surface domains, thus producing large domains of PdO(101) islands that coexist with reduced domains as well as the larger PdO(101) terraces of the initial surface. Re-oxidation of the surface acts to sustain the autocatalytic decomposition kinetics, and provides a mechanism for oxygen atoms to ultimately evolve from the subsurface of the PdO(101) film.

Understanding the reaction pathways at the electrocatalyst/water interface is of great importance for the development of water oxidation catalysts. How the water is oxidized on the electrocatalyst surface by the positive charges is still an open question. This review summarizes current advances in studies on surface chemistry within the context of water oxidation, including the intermediates, reaction mechanisms, and their influences on the reaction kinetics. The Tafel analyses of some electrocatalysts and the rate-laws relative to charge consumption rates are also presented. Moreover, how the multiple charge transfer relies on the intermediate coverage and the accumulated charge numbers is outlined. Lastly, the intermediates and rate-determining steps on some water oxidation catalysts are discussed based on density functional theories.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000658696100002

However, the present Li-O-2 batteries suffer from the low energy efficiency that is limited mainly by the high overpotentials required to re-oxidize Li2O2, the discharge product. Over the past few years, considerable research efforts have been devoted to the understanding of the Li2O2 oxidation reactions. Here, we summarize the results obtained from the fundamental study of the Li2O2 oxidation, including its morphology, reaction route, kinetics, the initial location upon oxidation and the charge transport within Li2O2. A better mechanistic understanding of the Li2O2 oxidation reaction will provide a solid foundation for the realization of practical Li-O-2 cells with a higher energy efficiency.									14	3	0	0	2	0	14			2095-9273	2095-9281		WOS:000359558700002

In this work, we, report the synthesis of ternary cobalt manganese phosphide nanoparticles from the solution-phase reaction of manganese and cobalt carbonyl complexes with trioctylphosphine. The CoMnP nanoparticles (ca. 5 nm in diameter) are nearly monodisperse and homogeneous in nature. These CoMnP nanoparticles are capable of catalyzing water oxidation at an overpotential of 0.33 V with a 96% Faradaic efficiency when deposited as an ink with carbon black and Nafion. A slight decrease in activity is observed after 500 cycles, which is ascribed to the etching of P into solution, as well as the oxidation of the surface of the nanoparticles. Manganese-based ternary phosphides represent a promising new system, to explore for water oxidation catalysis.									402	12	0	0	11	0	404			0002-7863			WOS:000373518800018	26972408

In this work, we present a simple method for the fabrication of hybrid electrocatalyst, PU@PANI@FeS2, composed of polyurethane (PU), polyaniline (PANI) and iron sulphide (FeS2). Initially, The PU nanofibers of diameter of 200-300 nm were fabricated by electrospinning process. Then, FeS2 together with PANI were deposited on electrospun PU nanofibers via simultaneous precipitation and polymerization. The prepared PU@PANI@FeS2 was thoroughly characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The XRD results confirm the formation of pure FeS2 on PU@PANI. The PU@PANI@FeS2 was tested as an electrocatalyst to catalyse hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and compared its electrochemical activity with NiS2 and SnS2 nanocomposites. The PU@PANI@FeS2 exhibits enhanced HER activity, where it demonstrates low overpotential of 266 and 372 mV to generate 10 mA/cm(2) and 50 mA/cm(2), respectively. The excellent HER activity of PU@ PANI@FeS2 may be due to the cooperative effect of FeS2 and PANI, where FeS2 provides abundant active sites and PANI enhances the conductivity.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2468-0230			WOS:000540775900005

K2CO3 and KCl (0.5, 1, 3, 5 potassium ion mass percentages) were loaded to the acid-leached (demineralized) coal samples prior to charring. The resulting 'doped' coal-char samples were subjected to heat treatment in a CO2 atmosphere up to 1200 A degrees C, and the thermogravimetric curves, as well as the temperature ranges of evolution of hydrogen, were investigated. The results obtained indicate that the temperatures at maximum rate of mass loss (from the DTG curves), as well as the temperatures at maximum rate of hydrogen (H-2) evolution (from the MS curves) are lowered with increasing potassium salt loadings. The relative coal gasification reaction reactivity (1/T (max)) determined from the DTG curves increases with increasing potassium salt loading and increases more for K2CO3 than for KCl. The catalytic influence of K2CO3 on the CO2 gasification of the acid-treated coal sample was found to be greater than that of KCl at a loading of 5 % potassium ion mass percentage.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1388-6150	1572-8943		WOS:000385246400056		
J	Liu, Yanmei; Zhang, Maochao; Li, Jun; Huang, Chengmin					Chengmin, Huang/0000-0002-4501-6300			Centimeter-scale metamorphic contact between basaltic lava and limestone: a case study of the Permian Emeishan large igneous province, SW China								CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES				37	4					72	10.1007/s13146-022-00820-2				DEC 2022	2022	Detailed sampling at different intervals was performed to better understand the reaction along the contact between limestones and intruded basaltic lava in the Permian Emeishan large igneous province, SW China. The contact metamorphism is characterized by element migrations, the presence of nontronite with poor crystallinity, and large negative anomalies of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes, which indicates that geochemical reaction between basaltic lava and limestones is only marked at the centimeter scale. The CaCO3 content decreases from 93.7 to 95.3% in limestone to 58.2% in the metamorphic limestone while the contents of both major elements (Fe2O3, SiO2, Al2O3, K2O, and Na2O) and trace elements (Ti, Cr, Cu, Mn, V, P, Ba, Co, Nb, Zn, and Zr) increase in the metamorphic limestone based on chemical gradients and thermal effects due to emplacement of basaltic lava. The presence of nontronite presumably derived from smectite transformation and the absence of wollastonite along the contact reflect the very low temperature of metamorphic reaction and the very low-grade contact metamorphism. The depletions in the delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of the metamorphic limestone achieve 4.066 parts per thousand-13.792 parts per thousand and 7.522 parts per thousand-9.746 parts per thousand, respectively. The decreases in stable carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions along the contact relative to the unmetamorphosed limestone indicate that geochemical interaction between basaltic lava and limestone is obvious, suggesting the exchange occurred between the limestone and fluids with low delta C-13 and delta O-18 values. In addition, the narrow metasomatically and thermally affected zone demonstrates the low metamorphic reactivity of the limestone, while the limestone behaved as a barrier against fluid percolation. And the amount of crystallization heat of basaltic lava, as well as the interchange of heat with atmosphere, also play non-negligible roles in the centimeter-scale metamorphic reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0891-2556	1878-5212		WOS:000871041900001

The molten copper is deoxidized by a rotating porous graphite tube immersed in the copper bath. The inside space of the porous graphite tube is evacuated so that the CO gas formed at the graphite-metal interface is removed through the tube wall. The experimental results suggest that the mass transfer of oxygen in the metal phase controls the reaction rate. The kinetic data are arranged with a first-order rate equation. At (ppm O) greater than or equal to 10, the rate constant increases by decreasing the porosity of the graphite and increasing the thickness of the tube wall. This result suggests that the suction of CO gas weakens CO bubble stirring and, thereby, the mass transfer at the tube-melt interface. However, when the rate of CO suction becomes comparable to or larger than the CO gas evolution rate, the effect of CO stirring becomes negligible. This situation appears under the conditions of high porosity and large wall thickness at (ppm O) greater than or equal to 10. At the low oxygen concentration range of (ppm O) less than or equal to 4, the effect of CO stirring becomes negligible, regardless of the CO suction condition, because of the considerably low CO formation rate. The achievement of deoxidation by the VSD method is evaluated in connection with the final oxygen concentration.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000075423900002

This mechanism is predicted to be energetically feasible for Mn2O+ (y = 2-4) and the binary CaMn3O4+, in agreement with the experimental observations. In contrast, the reaction does not proceed for the tetramanganese oxides Mn4O+ (y = 4-6) under these experimental conditions. This is attributed to the high fluxionality of the tetramanganese clusters, resulting in the instability of the terminal oxyl radical as well as an energetically unfavorable change of the spin state required for H2O2 formation. Ca doping, yielding a symmetry-broken lower-symmetry three-dimensional (3D) CaMn3O4+ cluster, results in structural stabilization of the oxyl radical configuration, accompanied by a favorable coupling between potential energy surfaces with different spin states, thus enabling the cluster-mediated water oxidation reaction and H2O2 formation.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1948-7185			WOS:000662199600004	34048261

The system is composed of a redox flow battery (RFB) to extract electrical energy and two chemical reactors (anolyte and catholyte regenerators). A quinone as a redox mediator is reduced by a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the anolyte regenerator, whereas a polyoxometalate as another redox mediator is oxidized in the catholyte regenerator, followed by a steady-state power generation at the RFB using the two redox mediators as active materials. This system demonstrates how to reduce the amount of platinum required in a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), especially when using a fuel other than pure hydrogen. The RFB in our system contains two gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs) with a platinum electro-catalyst to insert a "pure hydrogen gas phase" between the anolyte and catholyte to avoid cross-contamination. These two GDEs participate in the hydrogen evolution reaction and hydrogen oxidation reaction, respectively, and require only a small amount of platinum. In addition, the catalysts used in the anolyte regenerator are rhodium complexes. However, these catalysts are in a dissolved state (molecular catalysts) with micromolar-order concentrations, and very little noble metal is used. A carbonaceous catalyst without platinum is used in the catholyte regenerator. This eliminates the need for a noble metal for the oxygen reduction reaction, which is the main reason why platinum is used in a large amount in a conventional PEMFC. Steady-state operations of the anode side, the cathode side, and the total system are demonstrated in this work. Although a small amount of noble metal is still required at this stage, this work may contribute to the complete elimination of noble metals from a PEMFC. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, we report two-dimensional (2D) carbon nitride-based Janus particles as highly efficient, light-driven microswimmers in aqueous media. Due to the superior photocatalytic properties of poly(heptazine imide) (PHI), the microswimmers are activated by both visible and ultraviolet (UV) light in conjunction with different capping materials (Au, Pt, and SiO2) and fuels (H2O2 and alcohols). Assisted by photoelectrochemical analysis of the PHI surface photoreactions, we elucidate the dominantly diffusiophoretic propulsion mechanism and establish the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as the major surface reaction in ambient conditions on metal-capped PHI and even with TiO2-based systems, rather than the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is generally invoked as the source of propulsion under ambient conditions with alcohols as fuels. Making use of the intrinsic solar energy storage ability of PHI, we establish the concept of photocapacitive Janus microswimmers that can be charged by solar energy, thus enabling persistent light-induced propulsion even in the absence of illumination-a process we call "solar battery swimming"-lasting half an hour and possibly beyond. We anticipate that this propulsion scheme significantly extends the capabilities in targeted cargo/drug delivery, environmental remediation, and other potential applications of micro/nanomachines, where the use of versatile earth-abundant materials is a key prerequisite.									27	0	0	0	3	0	27			0027-8424			WOS:000579059100027	32958654

Firstly, theoretical calculations were performed to predict the optimum morphology for solar energy conversion by probing the surface energies of three primary low index facets of Ag3PO4: {100}, {110} and {111}. It was elucidated that the {111} facet possessed considerably higher surface energy (1.65 J m(-2)) than either {110} or {100} (0.78 and 0.67 J m(-2) respectively). We therefore attempted to fabricate Ag3PO4 crystals with {111} facets. Tetrahedral Ag3PO4 crystals, composed of {111} facets, were then successfully synthesised using a novel kinetic control method in the absence of surfactants. In comparison to rhombic dodecahedron {110} and cubic {100} structures, tetrahedral crystals show an extremely high activity for water photooxidation, with an initial oxygen evolution rate exceeding 6 mmol h(-1) g(-1), 10 times higher than either {110} or {100} facets. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge it is the first time that the internal quantum yield for water photooxidation is almost unity at 400 nm, and greater than 80% from 365 to 500 nm, achieved by {111} terminated tetrahedrons. The excellent and reproducible performance is attributed to a synergistic effect between high surface energy and a small hole mass, leading to high charge carrier mobility and active surface reaction sites.									199	16	0	0	17	0	204			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000325946400030

As indicated by the experimental results, both ceramics with 20 vol% and 30 vol% SiC particles followed near parabolic oxidation kinetics. And higher concentration of SiC led to better oxidation resistance performance due to the formation of more silica glass on the surface of the specimens and formation of zircon phase ZrSiO4. In addition, the oxidation of the ceramic composites is diffusion controlled and the activation energies for the diffusion of oxygen in the oxide scale of the ceramics oxidized at temperatures below 1500 degrees C were 5134 J/mol and 5960 J/mol for ZS2 and ZS3, respectively. Then the oxidation of the ceramics transformed to reaction controlled under elevated temperature due to evaporation of the protective silica glass. Furthermore, the evolution process of the surface morphology and oxide scale of the ceramic during initial oxidation stage was given detailed investigation.

Ozonation performance was examined by following ozone absorption rates and K-Acid, chemical oxygen demand and total organic carbon removals. Mean oxidation states and unidentified organic products were also determined. At pH 3, where direct ozone reactions are dominant, the second-order rate constant between K-Acid and molecular ozone was determined as 20 M-1 s(-1) for steady-state aqueous ozone concentration. The competition kinetics approach was also adopted where a reference compound, phenol, and K-Acid were subjected to ozonation. By applying this method, the second-order reaction rate constant was found to be 76 M-1 s(-1). Common oxidation products formed during ozonation at pH 3, pH 7 and pH 7 with 1 mM hydrogen peroxide were identified as methoxy-phenyl-oxime, phenol, benzene, benzaldehyde and oxalic acid via high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses. Continuous nitrate and sulphate evolution were observed during K-Acid ozonation as a consequence of the abrupt release and subsequent oxidation of its amino and sulphonate groups. The number and amount of reaction products were most intensive for K-Acid ozonation at pH 7 with 1 mM hydrogen peroxide. According to the acute toxicity tests conducted with Vibrio fischeri, ozonation products were not less toxic than the original K-Acid solution that caused only 15% inhibition.									6	1	0	0	2	0	7			1472-3581			WOS:000309716600007

Complex 2 is constructed as new multifunctional therapeutic platform for lysosome-targeted imaging and displayed much higher cytotoxicity than its analogue 1 by the introduction of a methyl group instead of a hydrogen atom in acylhydrazone. The cyclic voltammograms and reaction with GSH (glutathione) further confirmed that complex 1 has a reversible redox peak and can react with GSH, which indicate that complex 1 might lose its anticancer effect by undergoing reaction with GSH once it enters the cancer cell. Complex 2 could effectively catalyze the oxidation of NADH (the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) to NAD(+) and induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lead to caspase-dependent apoptosis through damaged mitochondria, simultaneously, accounting for the mitochondrial vacuolization and karyorrhexis. The caspase-3 activation and cytoplasmic vacuolation karyorrhexis induced by complex 2 revealed that the A549 cell lines might undergo cell death primarily mediated by apoptosis and oncosis; however, 1 cannot reproduce this effect. Taken together, these results indicated that complex 2 has more potential for evolution as a new bioimaging and anticancer agent.									16	0	0	0	7	0	16			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000456633400080	30592414

Herein, we propose to tune both the anionic and cationic redox chemistry of Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 via a "three-in-one" strategy integrating Na doping for the Li site and Si substitution for the Mn and Na2SiO3 coating layer, which is achieved by the facile coating of Na+-conductive Na2SiO3. In comparison with the pristine or Li2SiO3-coating sample, the concerns of voltage fading, poor rate capability, structure degradation, and oxygen release have all been largely alleviated due to the "three-in-one" effect. First, the coating layer impedes the side reaction and the dissolution of transition metals (TMs). Second, Na+ is confirmed to be doped into the Li layers to facilitate the transport kinetics of lithium ions while Si' is doped into the TM site, which enhances the stability of the layered structure during cycling due to the strong Si-O bond and reduces the migration of TMs. Third, the integrated strategy also decreases the covalency of TM-O bonds, which is verified to improve the reversibility of anion redox chemistry and suppress oxygen evolution. The synergetic strategy sheds some light on exploring high-performance cathode materials by tuning both anionic and cationic redox chemistry.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000592390700032

Here, we report the development of a high capacity (9000 mAh g(-1)), long-term cyclability (> 60 cycles), low-cost (iron and carbon) catalyst based non-aqueous Li-O-2 battery and unravel the role of the catalyst's porosity and structure in the battery performance. A scalable catalyst, named FeNxCy (S/S), is shown as the bifunctional catalyst at the cathode of the cell, where FeNxCy(S/S) has a unique structure constituted by nitrogen doped iron carbide nanoparticles decorated graphitic carbon spheres connected via graphitic sheets. The mechanism of the growth of discharged product in correlation with the high surface area and mesoporosity in FeNxCy (S/S) are studied using in situ Raman and ex situ XRD studies. The study shows the potential of Li-O-2 batteries as low-cost energy systems having high energy density (2920 Wh kgLi(2)O(2)(-1)) and power density (18 mW cm(-2)) values that are close to their theoretical limits.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0008-6223	1873-3891		WOS:000805838900003		
C	T-Raissi, Ali; Huang, Cunping; Mao, Liqun; Muradov, Nazim						Jena, P; Kandalam, A; Sun, Q		A NEW SOLAR METAL SULFATE - AMMONIA BASED THERMOCHEMICAL WATER SPLITTING CYCLE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN								MATERIALS ISSUES IN A HYDROGEN ECONOMY								15	45		10.1142/9789812838025_0002				2009	2009	All sulfur-family thermochemical water splitting cycles (TCWSCs) rely on concentration and decomposition of sulfuric acid for the oxygen evolution step of the cycle. The sulfuric acid decomposition step presents serious materials and catalyst deactivation challenges. Platinum based catalysts are currently the most active for the H(2)SO(4) decomposition, but they deactivate rapidly. To overcome this difficulty metal sulfate based TCWSCs have been developed. However, the metal sulfate based TCWSCs utilize thermal heat input - thus degrading photonic energy. Based upon FSEC's S-NH(3) TCWSC, a new family of hybrid photo/thermo-chemical water splitting cycles is introduced in this paper that employs the quantum portion of the solar spectrum for the production of hydrogen and the thermal energy (i.e. IR) portion of solar radiation for generating oxygen. FSEC's metal sulfate - ammonia (MSO(4)-NH(3)) hybrid photo/thermochemical water splitting cycles are represented by the following reactions:SO(2)(g) + 2NH(3)(g) + H(2)O(l) -> (NH(4))(2)SO(3)(aq) (chemical absorption) 25 degrees C(NH(4))(2)SO(3)(aq) + H(2)O -> (NH(4))(2) SO(4)(aq) + H(2)(g) (solar photocatalytic) 80 degrees Cx(NH(4))(2)SO(4) + M(2)O(x) -> 2xNH(3) + M(2)(SO(4))(x) + xH(2)O (solar thermocatalytic) 500 degrees CM(2)(SO(4))(x)(s) -> xSO(2)(g) + 2MO(s) + (x-l)O(2)(g) (solar thermocatalytic) 1100 degrees CWhere, M = Zn, Mg, Ca, Ba, Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu.Chemical equilibrium calculations for the reaction between ZnO and (NH(4))(2)SO(4) indicate that both ZnSO(4) and ZnO center dot 2ZnSO(4) can form as the stable reaction products. A series of thermogravimetric/differential thermal analyses/mass spectrometric (TG/DTA/MS) experiments has been carried out to determine the exact nature of all ZnO + (NH(4))(2)SO(4) reaction products. Results obtained to date are presented and discussed.

It has been found that hydrogen interacts strongly with vacancy-related defects, such as the vacancy-oxygen (VO) center. These interactions can be monitored through the formation of the vacancy-oxygen-hydrogen (VOH) center, and this trapping of hydrogen persists at temperatures in excess of 300degC. The diffusion length of hydrogen has been found to be on the order of 10 mum in low doped Si. The defect evolutions during the trapping of hydrogen can be accurately modeled by a set of coupled differential equations describing the most prominent reactions involved.					2009 34th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC 2009)2009 34th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC 2009)	7-12 June 20097-12 June 2009		Philadelphia, PA, USAPhiladelphia, PA, USA	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-1-4244-2949-3	INSPEC:11152468

A case study of Sifnos and Tinos islands (Greece)								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MINERALOGY				8	4			719	732						JUL-AUG 1996	1996	Oxygen isotope compositional heterogeneities among Eocene high P/T rocks and retrograde overprinting assemblages on the Cycladic islands of Sifnos and Tinos are studied with the aim of determining the extent to which they reflect an original tectonostratigraphic signature or the effects of fluid infiltration. Plots of whole-rock delta(18)O values against the chemical index of Garlick show that it is possible to interpret regional isotopic compositional variation in terms of either exchange with an O-18-enriched fluid during retrograde eclogite to greenschist-facies transformations or an originally heterogeneous pre-metamorphic sequence of rock units. However, a detailed analysis of isotopic compositional variations on an outcrop scale shows that there are no identifiable delta(18)O changes accompanying the retrograde metamorphic transformations, thus favouring the latter alternative. The isotopic data support the view that outcrop- and layer-scale variations in the degree of retrograde metamorphic transformation were controlled by selective infiltration (possibly involving local deformation-enhanced permeability creation) of small amounts of fluids. Simple mass-balance calculations based on the stoichiometries of model eclogite-blueschist and blueschist-greenschist reactions suggest that these amounts of fluid were of the order of several weight percent. The isotopic compositional heterogeneity of regional metamorphic sequences must be taken into account when applying models of fluid infiltration.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			0935-1221			WOS:A1996UZ39900007

A smart configuration that alternated Ti vertical bar IrO2-Ta2O5 anode meshes, as a source of O-2 subsequently reduced to H2O2 at adjacent porous reticulated vitreous carbon cathodes, was successfully tested employing a 0.050M Na2SO4 solution at pH 3.0. With this reactor, the need of an external source of pure O-2 or air typically employed during the electrosynthesis of this high value commodity was avoided. Bulk electrolyses in recirculation operation mode were carried out to evaluate the influence of the volumetric flow rate (0.4-1.0 L min(-1)) and applied current (59.5-178.5 mA) on the H2O2 accumulation profiles. The best performance of the reactor was achieved at 0.8 L min(-1) and 59.5 mA, reaching 14.3 mg L-1 H2O2 after 3 h, with maximum current efficiency and electrolytic energy consumption of 100% and 0.021 kWh (g H2O2)(-1), respectively. This is a first approach to produce greener H2O2, envisaging its future application to water treatment by electrochemical advanced oxidation processes.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000589178000036

(Photo)electrochemical energy storage and conversion technology is an important part. Therefore, to realize the practical application of (photo)electrochemical energy technology, nanostructured catalytic materials need to be reasonably designed, synthesized, and modified. Ion beam technology is a powerful and versatile physical modification method. Modification of various catalytic materials from the surface to interface and thin films can be realized by controlling the species, energy, and fluence of implanted ions. Ion beam technology has its unique advantages, including its compulsivity of element doping and its high controllability, accuracy, and repeatability. It can realize arbitrary element doping and defect control of almost any material and finely control its concentration. This makes it possible for the ion beam technology to adapt to the modification requirements of catalytic materials to tailor the electronic structure, interface structure, and morphology of the materials more finely. Besides, a variety of strategies for material design can be realized using ion beams, including element doping, defect control, heterostructure construction, and micro/nanostructure formation, which may bring novel changes in catalytic materials. In this Review, we briefly introduce the principle of ion beam technology and introduce various ion beam technologies that can be applied to different catalytic material modification applications. We systematically review the research progress on the application of ion beam technology in photocatalytic, photoelectrocatalytic, and electrocatalytic materials for water splitting including bandgap engineering, defect engineering, heterostructure formation through ion doping, ion irradiation, ion sputtering, and their combined effects. The applications of ion beam technology on modification of fuel oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysts for fuel cells are also introduced. The advantages of ion beam technology in the modification of catalytic materials are summarized. Several promising topics are proposed to look forward to the future development of ion beam technology in the field of catalytic materials.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			1931-9401			WOS:000585199200001

Herein, monodispersed Co9S8 nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped hierarchically porous hollow carbon spheres (Co9S8 NPs/NHCS) are synthesized through a template-assisted strategy followed by a co-assembly, thermal annealing, and sulfurization process.

A rechargeable ZAB assembled using the Co9S8 NPs/NHCS-0.5 as air cathode delivers a maximum power density of 116 mW cm(-2), high open circuit voltage of 1.47 V, and good durability (no obvious voltage decay after 1200 cycles (200 hours)). Such a hierarchically porous hollow structure of Co9S8 NPs/NHCS-0.5 provides a confined space shell and an interconnected hollow core to achieve outstanding bifunctional catalytic activity and cycling stability, which surpass the benchmark Pt/C-RuO2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000871929900001	36177607

Based on the synergistic effect between Co-N-y and NiFeOx centers, the non-noble hybrid catalyst NiFeOx/CoNy-C achieves a Delta E (eta@jOER,10 - eta@jORR,-3) = 0.84 V in alkaline solution, outperforming the commercial Pt/C, and very close to that of IrOx/C. In the fuel cell mode, the performance of NiFeOx/CoNy-C with the maximum power density of 56 mW cm(-2) is similar to that of Pt/C (63 mW cm(-2)) and IrOx/C (58 mW cm(-2)); in the electrolysis mode, the calculated maximum electrical power consumed on NiFeOx/CoNy-C (237 mW cm(-2)) is more than 3 times that on Pt/C (73 mW cm(-2)), similar with that of IrOx/C. More importantly, the NiFeOx/CoNy-C shows a remarkable stability in alternating modes in a LFURMC system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Akcent) plants to low (LI, 50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and high (HI, 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) growth irradiances was studied using the simultaneous measurements of the photosynthetic oxygen evolution and chlorophyll a (Chl a) fluorescence at room temperature. If measured under ambient CO(2) concentration, neither increase of the oxygen evolution rate (P) nor enhancement of non-radiative dissipation of the absorbed excitation energy within photosystem 2 (PS2) (determined as non-photochemical quenching of Chi a fluorescence, NPQ) were observed for HI plants compared with LI plants. Nevertheless, the HI plants exhibited a significantly higher proportion of Q(A) in oxidised state (estimated from photochemical quenching of Chl a fluorescence, q(P)), by 49-102 % at irradiances above 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and an about 1.5 fold increase of irradiance-saturated PS2 electron transport rate (ETR) as compared to LI plants. At high CO(2) concentration the degree of P stimulation was approximately three times higher for HI than for LI plants, and the irradiance-saturated P values at irradiances of 2 440 and 2 900 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) were by 130 and 150 % higher for HI plants than for LI plants. We suggest that non-assimilatory electron transport dominates in the adaptation of the photosynthetic apparatus of barley grown at high irradiances under ambient CO(2) rather than an increased NPQ or an enhancement of irradiante-saturated photosynthesis.					3rd Regional Photosynthesis Workshop on the Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging and its Application in Plant Science and Technology3rd Regional Photosynthesis Workshop on the Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging and its Application in Plant Science and Technology	FEB 06-11, 2000FEB 06-11, 2000	Czech-German Future Fund; Photon Syst Instruments; Hansatech InstrumentsCzech-German Future Fund; Photon Syst Instruments; Hansatech Instruments	LIPNO, CZECH REPUBLICLIPNO, CZECH REPUBLIC	9	0	0	0	9	0	9			0300-3604			WOS:000169981200006

However, their preparation procedure generally involves using large amounts of excess phosphorus sources for phosphorization, which inevitably release poisonous PH3 or dangerous phosphorus vapor. Here, a strategy for in-situ formation of FePO4 embedded in P-doped carbon 2D nano film (FePO4/PdC) is developed using a highly integrated precursor, which is a small molecular organophosphine ligand, 1,10bis (diphenylphosphine) ferrocene (DPPF). The multi-source precursor DPPF that contains Fe, P, and C is molecular-vapor-deposited on the nickel foam (NF) supported ZIF-67 nanosheets to obtain the composite catalyst, namely DPPF-500/ZIF-67/NF. FePO4/PdC encapsulated the ZIF-67 derived Co/N-doped carbon matrix (CoNC) to form a sandwich structure FePO4/PdC@CoNC. The constructed catalyst shows good performance for OER, requiring an overpotential of only 297 mV to deliver 600 mA/cm2 with a Tafel slope of 42.7 mV dec-1. DFT calculations demonstrate that the synergistic effects between the metal active center and P-doped carbon film reduce the energy barriers and improve electron transport. This method of constructing P-containing catalysts overcomes the demand for additional P sources to realize eco-friendly fabrication and yields a unique structure with good catalytic activity.(c) 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Due to its high efficiency, low cost, and low environmental impact, the URFC, which combines a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) with a polymer electrolyte water electrolyzer (PEWE), has been regarded as an important energy technology that can offer new opportunities to not only further reduce investment costs but also to open doors to the mass production of domestic applications. Despite this, URFCs still have to be further improved and optimized to reach a level of maturity of both fuel cells and electrolyzers in terms of energy efficiency and long-term performance. Currently, the major challenge of URFC technology has been the insufficient performance of the bifunctional electrocatalyst. Based on the most recent research trends and progresses of bifunctional oxygen catalyst materials, this review will provide a systematic introduction and a comprehensive assessment of various bifunctional oxygen catalysts; their science and technology, including material selection, synthesis, and characterization, as well as their applications in URFCs. This review aims to correlate the physicochemical characteristics of URFCs with the catalytic activity/stability of these materials.									23	2	0	0	0	0	23			0079-6425	1873-2208		WOS:000445714000003

Individual and dual doping of N and F heteroatoms was conducted to regulate defects and the pore geometry to the porous carbon matrix. Microscopic analysis of N-F co-doped cotton carbon (N-F/CTC) undergoes morphological amendments in its textural properties and defects responsible in creating active sites for ORR. N-F/CTC catalyst exhibits excellent ORR catalytic activity and methanol and CO tolerance in the alkaline medium, which makes it a potential metal-free ORR catalyst for the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell. N-F/CTC catalyst is subjected to 10 000 repeated potential cycles with no degradation in its activity. XPS analysis of N-F/CTC catalyst revealed the presence of N in the form of pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N, active species, and F in the form of C-F ionic and C-F semi-ionic active forms. The maximum C-C bond polarization, charge redistribution, and high spin densities in the carbon matrices are attained by all these active forms present in the catalyst and synergistically enhance the ORR activity.									30	0	0	0	0	0	30			2574-0962			WOS:000469885300033

The thermal reduction, as investigated by oxygen desorption analysis, revealed for all perovskites one evolution step occurring above 1100 K. Transmission electron micrographs at the beginning of the desorption step revealed the presence of superstructures, which are attributed to the formation of oxygen-deficient domains (ACoO2.5 less-than-or-equal-to ACoO3-x less-than-or-equal-to ACoO3) adopting perovskite-related brownmillerite-type structures. A model for the sequence of the structural changes of the perovskites during the reduction is proposed. The amount of oxygen which evolved above 1100 K increased with decreasing size of the lanthanide ion. Comparative catalytic studies were carried out in a fixed-bed microreactor at atmospheric pressure in the temperature range 600-1200 K. The activities at 830 K, expressed as reaction rates referred to the BET surface area, increased in the order PrCoO3 much less than LaCoO3 < NdCoO3 < GdCoO3. However, no significant influence of the A -site cations on the catalytic activity was found, with exception of praseodymium. PrCoO3 showed a 30 times lower activity than the other samples. The catalytic activity of ACoO3 perovskites can be markedly affected by the presence of Co3O4 impurity in the perovskites.

Rh and Ln-codoped Ca3Ti2O7 exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity than Rh-doped Ca3Ti2O7 for H-2 production from an aqueous methanol solution under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm). In addition, the induction period for H-2 production was shortened by codoping with Rh and Ln. The codoped elements helped control the oxidation state of Rh ions and suppressed the formation of oxygen defects, improving the activity of the Rh-doped Ca3Ti2O7 photocatalyst.

Inflammation is an important reaction in rosacea not only due to inflammatory reactions to cutaneous microorganisms, such asDemodex follicolorum, but also to ultraviolet damage that generates reactive oxygen species. This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 18-beta glycyrrhetinic acid cream for the treatment of mild rosacea by means of noninvasive methods. A total of 24 subjects suffering from erythemato-telangiectatic or mild papulo-pustular rosacea were recruited in the trial. Twelve patients applied an anti-inflammatory cream with 18-beta glycyrrhetinic acid twice daily for 20 days and 12 patients, recruited as control, applied the same formulation without 18-beta glycyrrhetinic acid. After 10 days of treatment, a significant reduction of erythema was recorded in the patient sample who applied the 18-beta glycyrrhetinic acid cream, the mean change from baseline showed an increase in hydration level of the skin surface but it was not statistically significant. The use of 18-beta glycyrrhetinic acid cream can be helpful in managing symptoms and condition of rosacea skin, especially in the management of erythema.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1396-0296	1529-8019		WOS:000567472200001	32833275

In this paper, we investigate electrical tree degradation under DC voltages in thermally aged silicone rubber (SIR). Charge transport dynamics are revealed by means of space charge measurement and simulation to give a better insight into the electrical tree initiation and evolution. The results show that a thermal oxygen reaction enhances the SIR cross-linked networking and thus gives rise to a higher tree initiation voltage in the early stage of aging. Subsequently intensified thermal degradation and cracking reaction accelerate SIR cross-linked network breakdown and generate micro-cracks. The increased deep traps and significantly decreased charge carrier mobility after thermal aging result in greater homo charge accumulating near the needle tip. The mechanism of DC electrical tree initiation in SIR is clarified based on the trap theory. It is argued that more trapped charges in the low-density region near the tip in the late thermally aged stage would decrease the tree initiation voltage, while the resultant homo charges would in turn reduce the electric field around the tip. Therefore, after thermal aging, the reduction of tree initiation voltage under DC voltage is less than that under AC voltage.									7	3	0	0	0	0	10			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000554950900001

With this in mind, herein, the hybrid electrode based on polypyrrole -CuS composite, PPyCuS, is fabricated with the aim to form an electrode photo-electrocatalyst for HER. Therefore, an in situ sonoelectrochemical method was employed to synthesis of hybrid nanocomposite film on copper substrate. The photoelectrochemical performance of PPyCuS@GOPt hetrostructure was investigated in acidic solution under visible light irradiation by linear sweep voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, EIS, and Tafel slopes evaluation. Actually, we could prepare the PPyCuS@GOPt nanocomposite film on Cu2O nano particles exhibited a much smaller onset overpotential with high current density for photo-HER. It was proven that GO, and Pt can act as effective dual co-catalysts to enhance the photocatalytic H-2 production activity of PPyCuS. The higher photoactivity is attributed to the fact that the photoinduced interfacial charge transfer in the heteronanostructures follow by further transfer in GO sheets. This work is expected to provide a new concept for development of highly efficient polymer-sulfide compounds photoelectrocatalysts for HER under simulated sunlight.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2213-3437		WOS:000405370200038

The module calculates the concentrations of surrogate organic species in two-dimensional space defined by volatility and oxygen-to-carbon ratio. It is implemented into the EMAC global chemistry-climate model, and a comprehensive evaluation of its performance is conducted using an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) factor analysis dataset derived from almost all major field campaigns that took place globally during the period 2001-2010. ORACLE 2-D uses a simple photochemical aging scheme that efficiently simulates the net effects of fragmentation and functionalization of the organic compounds. The module predicts not only the mass concentration of organic aerosol (OA) components, but also their oxidation state (in terms of O : C), which allows for their classification into primary OA (POA, chemically unprocessed), fresh secondary OA (SOA, low oxygen content), and aged SOA (highly oxygenated). The explicit simulation of chemical OA conversion from freshly emitted compounds to a highly oxygenated state during photochemical aging enables the tracking of hygroscopicity changes in OA that result from these reactions. ORACLE 2-D can thus compute the ability of OA particles to act as cloud condensation nuclei and serves as a tool to quantify the climatic impact of OA.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1991-959X	1991-9603		WOS:000442267200004

The possibilities for corrosion after oxygen depletion must be evaluated, even if copper is considered to be immune in oxygen-free water. To follow the interaction of copper with deoxygenated aqueous solution, open-circuit potentiometric and electrochemical impedance measurements have been coupled to in-situ detection of cupric ion, dissolved molecular hydrogen and oxygen concentrations using electrochemical sensors. A kinetic model that considers the production of hydrogen as a catalytic process, the rate of which is proportional to the surface coverage of an intermediate species formed during interaction between copper and the solution is used to interpret the results. Kinetic parameters are estimated by a simultaneous fit of the experimental impedance spectra, the open circuit potential and cupric ion concentration as depending on temperature (22-70 degrees C) and exposure time (up to 720 h) to the model equations. Using the obtained values and a balance equation of hydrogen production on copper and its diffusion out of the cell through its walls, the kinetic parameters of this process are estimated by fitting dissolved molecular hydrogen concentration vs. time data at the three temperatures.

Specifically, new nitrogen-doped carbon-supported cobalt catalysts (Co-N-C catalysts) are made by pyrolyzing various ratios of the nitrogen atom rich heterocycle compound, 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium dicyanamide (EMIM-dca) and cobalt salt (Co(NO3)(2)). The ORR activity (J(K) at 0.8 V vs RHE, in 0.1 M KOH solution) of a typical catalyst in this family, Co-15-N-C800, is 8.25 mA/mg, which is much higher than the ORR. activity values of N-C catalysts (0.41 mA/mg). The active site in the catalyst is found to be the Co-N species, which is most likely in the form of Co2N. Metallic cobalt (Co) particles, Co3C species, and N-C species are not catalytically active sites, nor do these moieties interact with the Co-N active sites during the catalysis of the ORR Increasing the Co salt content during the synthesis favors the formation of Co-N active sites in the final catalyst. Higher pyrolysis temperatures (e.g., a temperature higher than 800 degrees C) do not favor the formation of the Co-N active sites, but cause the formed Co-N active sites to decompose, which, therefore, leads to a lower catalytic activity. This reveals that the control of the parameters that affect the final structure is critical to catalyst performance and, therefore, the effective development of high-performance heteroatom-doped non-noble-metal ORR catalysts.									99	4	0	0	3	0	99			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000389624600029	27934155

Special attention was paid to adsorbed hydrogen and hydroxyl and to oxide formation. In fluoride medium and at open circuit potential (OCP) the Si surface is completely hydrogenated and is oxidised only upon imposing a large anodic current. Conversely, GaAs is oxidised at OCP, and AsH bonds appear on the surface only in the presence of a cathodic current sufficient to compete with surface oxidation by oxygen dissolved in the electrolyte. Upon potential cycling, the surface of germanium undergoes nearly reversible changes between a hydroxylated and a hydrogenated state, and may be found in either state at OCP, depending upon its history. In situ IR spectroscopy allows one to rationalise the very different behaviours of surface reactivity found for these otherwise rather similar semiconductors and to determine the electrochemical reaction mechanisms.

The synthesis of IrOx.nH(2)O colloids by alkaline hydrolysis of Ir(III) or Ir(IV) salts proceeds through monomeric intermediates that were characterized using electrochemical and spectroscopic methods and modeled in TDDFT calculations. In air-saturated solutions, the monomers exist in a mixture of Ir(III) and Ir(IV) oxidation states, where the most likely formulations at pH 13 are [Ir(OH)(5)(H2O)](2) and [Ir(OH)(6)](2-), respectively. These monomeric anions strongly adsorb onto IrOx.nH(2)O colloids but can be removed by precipitation of the colloids with isopropanol. The monomeric anions strongly adsorb onto TiO2, and they promote the adsorption of ligand-free IrOx.nH(2)O colloids onto mesoporous titania photoanodes. However, the reversible adsorption/desorption of electroactive monomers effectively short-circuits the photoanode redox cycle and thus dramatically degrades the photoelectrochemical performance of the cell. The growth of a dense TiO2 barrier layer prevents access of soluble monomeric anions to the interface between the oxide semiconductor and the electrode back contact (a fluorinated tin oxide transparent conductor) and leads to improved photoanode performance. Purified IrOx.nH(2)O colloids, which contain no adsorbed monomer, give improved performance at the same electrodes. These results explain earlier observations that IrOx.nH(2)O catalysts can dramatically degrade the performance of metal oxide photoanodes for the OER reaction.									35	2	0	0	4	0	37			0002-7863			WOS:000358186700020	26106904	
J	Chen Yalin; Zhang Wei; Wang Wei; Wang Jia; Wang Qi; Cai Guangxu								Evaluation of Water-line Area Corrosion for Q235 Steel by WBE Technique								Journal of Chinese Society for Corrosion and Protection				34	5			451	8		10.11902/1005.4537.2013.247				Oct. 2014	2014	The water-line area corrosion of carbon steel in 3.5%NaCl solution was studied by means of wire beam electrode (WBE) technique. The corrosion current distribution was regularly measured over a period of 40 d. In the initial stage, it was found that, down from the waterline, the anodic current increased gradually. This indicated that an oxygen concentration cell had been formed already. But the cathode region and anode region were mixed up in this stage. With the progress of the corrosion process, the cathode region was located near the waterline and the anode region was located beneath the cathode region. As the cathodic reaction above the waterline was speeding up, the corrosion region extended from the lower portion of the electrode upward to the waterline and thus the corrosion rate of whole electrode increased. In the smooth stage of corrosion, the main cathode region was located above the waterline and the corrosion rate became stable. This work confirms the applicability of the WBE method for the study of waterline corrosion. This method can especially provide information concerning the evolution of the corrosion current distribution of the electrode, which can not be acquired by the traditional technique with a bulk electrode of long steel strip.									6	8	0	0	0	0	14			1005-4537			INSPEC:15206216		
J	MURTHY, VSR; RAO, BS								MICROSTRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE DIRECTED MELT-OXIDIZED (DIMOX) AL-MG-SI ALLOYS								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE				30	12			3091	3097		10.1007/BF01209222				JUN 15 1995	1995	Metal-ceramic composites produced via directed melt oxidation (DIMOX) of aluminium alloys are of recent interest. The in situ composite forming method is based on the reaction of a molten alloy with a gaseous oxidant. In the present study, Al-Mg-Si alloys were subjected to directed melt oxidation and the progressive microstructural evolution was examined by interrupted growth experiments. In the early stages, liquid alloy oxidizes to form a duplex oxide layer (MgO + MgAl2O4) on the surface. The openings in these oxide layers allow the liquid alloy to wick through to form small nodules on the surface. When further wicking occurs through these nodules, a ''cauliflower'' type of colonies is formed. During the early part of the second stage, spinel growth dominates to form a multi-layered structure. In the final stage, as the magnesium reaches low levels, Al2O3 formation dominates the growth, and alumina crystals grow continuously for several tens of micrometres. The oxygen required for alumina formation is expected to come from two sources: (i) from the ingress of oxygen through microcracked oxide layers, and (ii) demixing of magnesium-containing oxides in the underneath layers.									25	4	0	0	0	0	27			0022-2461			WOS:A1995RG75600012

However, due to their insufficient Lewis acidity and unfavorable electronic parameters, resulting in poor N-2 adsorption, instability of key N intermediates (NNH*/NNH2*/N*), and preference for hydrogen evolution, the NH3 selectivity and yield rate with metal oxides are far from satisfactory. Herein, theoretical predictions reveal that tuning the electronic structure of defective Co3O4 (Co3O4-x) via a single-Ru-atom dopant can cooperatively enhance the N-2 adsorption, driven by strong Ru-4d-N-2p orbital coupling, and stabilize the key N-intermediates, further suppressing the H* dimerization and significantly boosting the NH3 selectivity. Motivated by DFT predictions, we introduced optimal single-Ru-atom dopants to maximize the Lewis acidity of Co3O4 with in situ-generated oxygen defects (Ru1.4Co3O4-x), which exhibited an excellent N-2-fixation activity with a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency (40.2%) and yield rate (39.4 mu g/h/mg(cat); 2.67 mg/h/mg(Ru)) at 0 V (vs RHE), along with long-term stability and 2.5 times higher selectivity than pristine Co3O4-x, outperforming the state-of-the-art Ru/C.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2380-8195			WOS:000731062000017

By a sudden change from stir to high CO2, PSII activity of C. littorale decreased temporarily and then recovered, while PSI activity showed the opposite change (Pesheva et al., Plant Cell Physiol, 35 (1994) 379-387). To investigate the efficiency of energy captured by open PSII reaction centers, the quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence of intact cells of C. littorale was analyzed. The data obtained are compared with those obtained with cells of Stichococcus bacillaris which has little tolerance to high CO2. Activities of photosynthetic oxygen evolution of the intact cells and DCIP photoreduction with the crude membrane fraction of C. littorale decreased within 1-2 days, and after about 4 days both activities recovered and/or were elevated to higher levels than those in the air conditions. During this temporal decrease in these activities, the effective quantum yield of PSII also lowered to about 50% of that in air. The values of F-v/F-m transiently decreased indicating photoinhibition in PSII. Such fluorescence quenching parameters recovered after about 4 days. On the other hand, the activities of PSII and other photosynthetic characteristics did not recover in S. bacillaris.									35	1	0	0	26	0	36			1011-1344			WOS:A1996WG20600014		
J	Saoudi, O.; Matrakova, M.; Aleksandrova, A.; Zerroual, L.								Electrochemical behavior of PbO2/PbSO4 electrode in the presence of surfactants in electrolyte								ARABIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				13	5			5326	5331		10.1016/j.arabjc.2020.03.011				MAY 2020	2020	The electrochemical behavior of PbO2/PbSO4 electrode is investigated in 4.5 M H2SO4 in presence of three surfactants, Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS), Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and Sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), using cyclic voltametry, electrochemical spectroscopy impedance and galvanostatic discharge as techniques. The micro morphology of the surface of the modified PbO2 electrodes is examined by scanning electron microscopy. The results show that SDS and CTAB when added in the electrolyte could refine the coating particles and change the roughness of the surface of the electrode leading to a thin film of PbO2 with amorphous character. In addition, SDS and CTAB shift the hydrogen evolution potential towards more negative values, improve the discharge capacity of the anodic layer and accelerate the charge transfer. Under cathodic polarization, CTAB presents the lowest value of the charge transfer resistance R-ct. In the contrary, STPP shifts the oxygen evolution potential towards more positive values, passivates the surface of the electrode and inhibits completely the reaction of PbO2 formation.

However, the origin of the cluster formation and active S sites in the cluster is unknown, hindering the development of efficient catalysts. Herein, the mechanism of the transition from amorphous MoS3 to [Mo3S13](2-) clusters is systematically investigated. In addition, the active S sites have been identified by the selective removal of S atoms via low-temperature heat treatment. In summary, we believe that the clusters grow from amorphous MoS3 with apical S atoms, and bridging S atoms are the active HER sites in the [Mo3S13](2-) clusters. The clusters deposited on carbon nanotubes exhibited good electrochemical HER activity with a low onset potential of 96 mV, a Tafel slope of 40 mV/decade, and stability for 1000 cycles.									36	0	1	0	2	0	37			2155-5435			WOS:000434369600047
