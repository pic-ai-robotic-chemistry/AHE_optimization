Herein, for the first time, a NiS microsphere film was grown in situ on Ni foam (NiS/Ni foam) via a sulfurization reaction as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting with superior activity and good durability. This NiS/Ni foam electrode delivers 20 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 158 mV for the HER and 50 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 335 mV for the OER in 1.0 M KOH. This bifunctional electrode also enables a high-efficiency alkaline water electrolyzer with 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of only 1.64 V, which could be promising in water splitting devices for large-scale hydrogen production.									404	21	0	0	10	0	406			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000368352900041	26661579

This study integrates dominant Co/Co3O4 with a small fraction of RuO2 and the CoRu alloy anchored on a hollow carbon matrix, originating from the novel Ru-doped hollow metal-organic framework (MOF) precursor, which is synthesized via tannic etching and ion exchange. Notably, the introduced ultralow Ru (1.28 wt %) not only generates new Ru-based species but also induces a Ru-enriched surface with abundant oxygen vacancies. Moreover, a suitable balance among different valencies of Co or Ru can be tuned by oxidation time, resulting in preferable Co2+ and Ru4+ species. Triggered by these unparalleled surface properties along with good conductivity, hollow structure, and the synergistic effect of multiple active sites, the resulting CoRu-O/A@hollow nitrogen-doped carbon (HNC) shows robust catalytic performance for ORR/OER/HER in an alkaline electrolyte. Typically, it exhibits a potential gap of 0.662 V for OER/ORR and enables an alkaline water electrolyzer with a cell voltage of 1.558 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This work would serve as guidance for well construction of transition-metal-based trifunctional electrocatalysts by the MOF-assisted strategy or the modulation effects of low-content Ru.									24	0	0	0	3	0	24			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000592923100028	33152235

However, rational design and synthesis of semiconductor heterojunctions especially for Cu-based ones as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) still face challenges, and the in-depth study of catalytic mechanisms is urgently needed. Herein, n-type cobalt layered double hydroxide nanosheets are assembled on p-type cuprous phosphide nanowire to form p-n junction. This heterostructure with a strong built-in potential (E-BI) of 1.78 V provides enlarged electrochemical active surface area, enhanced active site, facilitated electron separation and transfer, and accelerated formation of superoxide radical. As expected, the heterogeneous electrocatalyst exhibits significantly improved activities for OWS, achieving an overpotential of 111 mV for HER and 221 mV for OER and an applied voltage of 1.575 V for OWS at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH. Moreover, the overpotentials are further decreased under visible light irradiation. This work represents a new insight into Cu-based catalysts toward OWS and an approach based on E-BI to design semiconductor heterostructure promising for renewable energy applications.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000686268100001	34411426

Herein, a facile and easily scalable "impregnation-carbonization-acidification" strategy for fabricating a class of single-atom-anchored (including cobalt and nickel single atoms) monolith as superior binder-free electrocatalysts for developing high-performance wearable Zn-air batteries is reported. The as-prepared single atoms, supported by N-doped carbon flake arrays grown on carbon nanofibers assembly (M SA@NCF/CNF), demonstrate the dual characteristics of excellent catalytic activity (reversible oxygen overpotential of 0.75 V) and high stability, owing to the greatly improved active sites' accessibility and optimized single-sites/pore-structures correlations. Furthermore, wearable Zn-air battery based on Co SA@NCF/CNF air electrode displays superior stability under deformation, satisfactory energy storage capacity, and good practicality to be utilized as an integrated battery system. Theoretical calculations reveal a mechanism for the promotion of the catalytic performances on single atomic sites by lowering the overall oxygen reduction/evolution reaction barriers comparing to metal cluster co-existing configuration. These findings provide a facile strategy for constructing free-standing single-atom materials as well as the engineering of high-performance binder-free catalytic electrodes.									285	23	0	0	16	0	288			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000468005400018	30803063

The present promising cobalt-based catalysts still leave room to meet the activity requirement. Here, a composite catalyst of a-Co(OH)2/Ag was synthesized by a simple photochemical deposition route, which was designed to improve the electrocatalytic activity for OER. Moreover, a photoinduced surface plasmon on Ag particles was found to further enhance the catalytic performance under low power of laser irradiation. Loading of silver nanocrystals on a-Co(OH)2 nanosheets can decrease the overpotential towards OER for 10 mA cm-2 from 320 to 288 mV, this value can be further decreased of 45 mV under 1000 mW of laser irradiation with a wavelength of 532 nm. The derivation of the catalyst during the OER process was examined, which indicates the structural transformation from a-Co(OH)2 to CoOOH. The photoinduced surface plasmon modulates the electronic structure of cobalt sites, facilitates the formation of active cobalt species, and induces the enhancement of catalytic activity. These findings may give some hints for plasmon-induced electrocatalysis and the design of advanced electrocatalysts. (c) 2022 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

Herein, we present characterization of morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of pulsed 532 nm laser treated TiO2 nanotubes (NT) sputtered by the thin film of chromium. Scanning electron microscopy enables verification of the diameter and length of titania while Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies were used to evaluate crystalline phase and the oxidation state of elements, respectively. The recorded polarization curves clearly indicate that the optimized laser-treatment enhances activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the TiO2 NT decorated with very small amount of Cr species. The analysis of Mott-Schottky plot shows significant increment in donor density (N-d) for the laser irradiated sample comparing to the one before annealing and pristine titania resulting from the effective manipulation of the electrode/electrolyte interface. Moreover, the impact of the processing parameters including energy fluence of laser beam and the thickness of sputtered Cr layer on the current density was evaluated by the electrochemical measurements performed under vis and UV-vis light. The results show promising application of direct interaction of laser beam with the surface of material exhibiting initially both poor OER activity and visible light response. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

It was found that surface and electrochemical properties for the oxygen evolution reaction are both affected through the cooling process, being the electrode prepared at 400 degrees C using the slow cooling process the less susceptible to wear. The Tafel slope obtained in the high overpotential domain was analysed in light of the apparent charge transfer coefficient.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0100-4042			WOS:000288382200006

Herein, a facile approach was proposed to construct NiFe-MOF nanosheets on Fe foam (FF). As a self-supporting electrode, the NiFe-MOF/FF electrode shows impressive electrocatalytic OER performance. Specifically, it exhibits an ultra-low overpotential of 216 mV to reach a current density of 50 mA cm(-2), and outstanding stability (beyond 50 h at 200 mA cm(-2)). The excellent performances of NiFe-MOF/FF arise from the highly exposed active centers, the excellent conductivity, and the synergy effect between Ni and Fe. This research provides a promising strategy for the synthesis of multi-metal MOFs as high-efficiency electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000768940000001	35289819

All the electrocatalysts have shown remarkably enhanced electrocatalytic properties in comparison with their performance in aqueous electrolysis cell. According to cyclic voltammetric results, 0.36 A cm(-2) peak current density has been exhibited in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from 30 wt% Ni/TiO2 electrocatalyst. 15 wt% Ni-doped titania sample has shown the best result in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the anodic peak current density of 0.3 A cm(-2). In the anodic polarization curves, the performance of 15 wt% Ni/TiO2 hollow sphere electrocatalyst was evaluated up to 140 mA cm(-2) at comparatively lower over-potential value. 20 wt% Ni/TiO2 hollow sphere electrocatalyst has also shown electrochemical stability in PEM water electrolyzer for 48 h long analysis. The comparative electrocatalytic behavior of hollow spherical materials with non-sphericals is also presented, which clearly shows the influence of hollow spherical structure in greater electrocatalytic activity of the materials. The physical characterization of all the hollow spherical materials is presented in this work, which has confirmed their better electrochemical behavior in PEM water electrolyzer.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0256-1115			WOS:000322393100008

Ba-3(MnO4)(2) comprises C-3v-symmetric MnO43- oxo-anions with three long Mn-O bonds and one short Mn-O bond at room temperature. Ba-3(MnO4)(2) caused a conductivity jump by one order of magnitude at approximately 600 degrees C owing to the antiferromagnetic/paramagnetic phase transition, accompanied by a shape change of the tetrahedral MnO43- anions from C-3v to T-d symmetry, as confirmed by the electrical conductivity measurements and the extended X-ray absorption fine structure at an elevated temperature. Hence, the Ba-3(MnO4)(2) base anode of the H-SOEC exhibited improved performance, with anode polarization resistances being lower than those of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3, a well-known H-SOEC anode material. Impedance analysis in terms of oxygen and water partial pressure revealed that the superior performance of the Ba-3(MnO4)(2) base anode can be attributed to the extended reaction area. Since abundant unoccupied 3d states of the high-valence-state Mn5+ cations are favorable for charge transfer interactions with water electron donors, thereby facilitating water adsorption, the oxygen evolution reaction could occur directly over the electrode surface, and thus the reaction sites were not limited to the gas-electrode-electrolyte triple phase boundary.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2052-1553			WOS:000472193200028

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of structure-adjustable novel material composed of metal nodes and organic ligands, and their unique physical and chemical properties endow them with adjustable catalytic properties and make them potentially alternate to noble metal catalysts for the OER. However, the controllable synthesis of MOFs with a favorable structure for the OER is still a great challenge. Here, we report a simple solvent-assisted strategy to realize the synthesis of NiFe MOFs with controllable morphology and electronic structure. Owing to the highly exposed active sites and optimized electronic structure for the active sites, the obtained two-dimensional carboxylic acid-based MOFs (2D-NiFe-BDC) show an excellent OER activity in 1.0 M KOH, the overpotential for oxygen evolution is as low as 223 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slope is 37.3 mV dec(-1), together with a decent stability of at least 70 h under a large current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Moreover, we also investigate and prove the universality of this synthesis method for other carboxylic acid-based MOFs. This work not only provides a universal route to design 2D MOFs but also demonstrates the superiority of the method to adjust the performance of highly efficient OER catalysts for related energy conversion and storage technologies.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17				2052-1537		WOS:000687280600001

In this study, metal-organic framework (MOF) derived porous cobalt poly-phosphide (CoP3) concave polyhedrons are prepared and explored as superior bifunctional electrocatalysts for the HER and OER. The prepared MOF derived CoP3 concave polyhedrons show excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability towards the HER and OER in both acidic and alkaline media, with the Tafel slopes of 53 mV dec(-1) and 76 mV dec(-1) and a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotentials of -78 and 343 mV for the HER and OER, respectively, which are remarkably superior to those of the transition metal phosphides (TMPs) and comparable to those of the commercial precious metal catalysts. In addition, they also offer efficient catalytic activities and durabilities under neutral and basic conditions for the HER.

In this work, double-carbon co-supported Co-based oxide with the Cu and S substitutions are synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method and formed a unique honeycomb structure. As expected, the (Cu, Co)(3)OS3@CNT-C3N4 exhibits high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with low overpotential (0.86 V), high power density (215 mW cm(-2)), and long-term discharge stability (115 h). The (Cu, Co)3OS(3)@CNT-C3N4-based rZAB also shows a stronger charge-discharge durability with a very low voltage gap of merely 0.5 V than that of Pt/C+RuO2. The high catalytic performances are attributed to these following reasons: (i) the porous morphology and hierarchical structure with plentiful "catalytic buffer", which accelerates the mass transfer; (ii) a high-speed electronic transmission network established by C3N4 and carbon nanotube (CNT), enhancing the conductivity; (iii) the strong synergistic effect between (Cu, Co)(3)OS3@CNT and C3N4, which improves the kinetics of ORR/OER; and (iv) the controllable occupation of Cu ions and S ions, which effectively regulates the CoO6 surface and increases the active site density.

The modified active carbon showed remarkable improvement in activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction, which was due to the lower charger transfer, lower activation barrier, and higher exchange current density. Electrochemical evaluation showed a direct four-electron the oxygen reduction reaction on NiCo2O4 modified active carbon, compared to a two-stage process on bare active carbon.

Limited by the low tolerance and/or poor activity of most 1st-row transition metal-based electrocatalysts in strongly acidic media, bifunctional electrocatalysts are currently advocated to work at high pH values. Herein, this review summarizes the recent progress of nonprecious bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in alkaline media, including transition metal-based phosphides, chalcogenides, oxides, nitrides, carbides, borides, alloys, and metal-free materials. Besides, some prevalent modification strategies to optimize the activities of catalysts are briefly listed. Finally, the perspective on current challenges and future prospects for overall water splitting driven by advanced nonprecious electrocatalysts are briefly discussed.									32	3	0	0	2	0	34			2398-4902			WOS:000544657200002

Both steps of the splicing reaction proceeded with a phosphorothioate in the Sp configuration but were blocked by the Rp diastereomer. Both steps also proceeded with inversion of stereochemical configuration around phosphorus, consistent with a concerted transesterification reaction. These results are identical to those found for nuclear precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing and provide support for the hypothesis that group II introns and nuclear pre-mRNA introns share a common evolutionary history.									93	1	0	0	70	0	97			0036-8075			WOS:A1994PW30800034	7527587

In present work, we report a facile strategy to construct 3D ordered nickel-based OER catalyst. Firstly, nickel nanocones array (NNA) is electrodeposited on commercial Ni foam (NF) from an ammoniacal Ni (II) electrolyte, then an amorphous nickel and iron based bimetallic hydroxide layer is fabricated on the NNA/NF via an ultrafast approach from an Fe3+ contained solution at 100 degrees C. The derived composite material (Ni-Fe-OH@NNA/NF) exhibits high electrocatalytic activity toward OER as well as good durability. Moreover, it demonstrates that this is a general approach to fabricate other Ni-based bimetallic hydroxide (Ni-M-OH, M = Ni, Co, Mn, or Cu) layers on NNA/NF with good OER performance. This work provides an attractive method for the design and fabrication of 3D ordered nickel-based electrocatalyst for OER. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Overall water splitting and zinc air systems are promising energy conversion and storage means, but need high-performance, low-cost, and highly stable bifunctional electrocatalysts to hydrogen evolution/oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) and OER/oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), respectively. Herein we develop a facile method to fabricate CoMn double hydroxide (DH) hollow spheres as high-performance trifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting and zinc-air battery. The outmost surfaces of the CoMn DH hollow spheres are composed of ultrathin nanosheets with a thickness of approximately 2.5 nm. Owing to the hollow and ultrathin features, CoMn DH hollow spheres exhibit excellent activities and robust stabilities toward HER, OER, and ORB. The overall water electrolyzer assembled with the CoMn DH hollow spheres can drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of merely 420 mV in 1.0 M KOH, among the best reported metal oxides and hydroxides. Remarkably, each all-solid-state Zn air battery with the optimized CoMn DH hollow spheres air-cathode exhibited good cycling stability. Furthermore, two all-solid-state Zn air batteries in series can power 55 red LED and the two-electrode electrolyzer catalyzed by the optimized CoMn DH hollow spheres with excellent operation stabilities.									39	2	0	0	0	0	39			2168-0485			WOS:000449577200112

The crystallinity and stability of the films are a strong function of the deposition temperature. Films deposited at temperatures from 50 to 90 degrees C are amorphous, but films deposited from refluxing solution at 103 degrees C are crystalline. The crystalline films adhere strongly to the substrate, whereas the amorphous films peel off of the substrate when dried due to drying stresses. The crystalline films deposit with the normal spinel structure, with a lattice parameter of 0.8097 nm and crystallite size of 26 nm. The catalytic activity of Co3O4 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the crystalline and amorphous films is compared by Tafel analysis in alkaline solution at pH 14. The crystalline Co3O4 film has a Tafel slope of 49 mV/decade and an exchange current density of 2.0 X 10(-1) A cm(-2), whereas an amorphous film deposited at 50 degrees C has a Tafel slope of 36 mV/decade and an exchange current density of 5.4 x 10(-12) A cm(-2). Because the films deposited from refluxing electrolyte deposit directly as crystalline films, it is possible to deposit them epitaxially on single-crystal Au(100). This opens up the possibility to study the catalytic activity of different Co3O4 planes exposed to the electrolyte.									342	11	0	0	15	0	346			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000309041000009

Identifying their active sites and understanding their reaction mechanisms are essential to explore novel transition metal (TM) oxides catalysts and further promote their catalytic efficiency. Here we report a systematic investigation, by means of soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS), on cubic and tetragonal CoxMn3-xO4 (x = 1, 1.5, 2) spinel oxides as a family of highly active catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We demonstrate that the ORR activity for oxide catalysts primarily correlates to the partial covalency of between O 2p orbital with Mn4+ 3d t(2g)-down/e(g)-up, Mn3+ 3d e(g)-up and Co3+ 3d e(g)-up orbitals in octahedron, which is directly revealed by the O K-edge sXAS. Our findings propose the critical influences of the partial covalency between oxygen 2p band and specific metal 3d band on the competition between intermediates displacement of the ORR, and thus highlight the importance of electronic structure in controlling oxide catalytic activity.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			2079-4991			WOS:000467768800093	30970569

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a key reaction involved in water splitting, which requires a catalyst. The current work explores the possible application of sodium and potassium iron phosphates (AFePO(4), A=Na and K) as electrocatalysts for ORR activity. These earth-abundant iron phosphates were synthesized by the solution combustion synthesis (SCS) technique by using ascorbic acid both as fuel and reducing agent for Fe. The crystal structure was analyzed by Rietveld refinement. The formation of carbon coating was identified by thermogravimetric analysis and Raman spectroscopy. Electrocatalytic properties of AFePO(4) were investigated in alkali electrolytes for the first time by using linear sweep voltammetry with a rotating disk electrode (RDE). The ORR activities of these alkali iron phosphates are comparable to that of the Pt/C system. The Tafel slope and electron transfer number of the alkali iron phosphates were calculated. The ORR activity of NaFePO4 was found to be better than KFePO4 and FePO4. This work demonstrates alkali iron phosphates as alternate cost-effective, novel electrocatalysts for productive ORR activity in alkaline solution.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000426844600034

Palladium is one of the most catalytically active metals toward HER. Here, an electrocatalyst is designed where palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) are immobilized on the surface of nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide. A comparative study of two different nitrogen doping strategies is employed wherein covalent incorporation of nitrogen (N) source and noncovalent attachment of 1-aminopyrene to graphene lattice is carried out. The morphological and physicochemical characteristic studies confirmed that the doping is successful over the carbon lattice, followed by nucleation of Pd NPs over N sites. Electrocatalytic activity of these two different catalysts toward HER is examined using the linear sweep voltammetry technique. It is found that Pd anchored covalently N modified carbon outperforms the 1-aminopyrene based catalyst. These findings will have a profound impact upon the designing of application specific electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-7350			WOS:000842540900001

However, the high overpotential () originates from poor charge-transfer ability and low catalytic activity may lead to high power consumption. Herein, we alleviate these issues by introducing borate into the NiFe (oxy)hydroxide framework. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the borate could be efficiently adsorbed onto the Ni/NiFe (oxy)hydroxide surface. Microscopically, the adsorbed borate can induce a favorable electronic structure for the Ni active sites. Meanwhile, the macroscopic charge-transfer ability of this synthesized catalyst has been dramatically increased. Hence, the catalytic performance of this material is improved compared with its NiFe counterpart: we achieved a higher OER activity with an ultralow of only 230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and of 200 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) on Ni foam in alkaline medium. Moreover, this borate mediated NiFe (oxy)hydroxide is very stable: no appreciable degradation is observed after more than 110 hours of operation.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000445218000024

Unfortunately, Pd is easy to suffer from agglomeration because of the decrease of their excessive metal surface free energy at elevated temperature, dramatically reducing their catalytic activities for ORR. Herein, we report a facile in-situ self-assembly strategy coupled with the annealing method to synthesize the well-dispersed Pd nanoparticles on nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon spheres (Pd-NMCS) catalysts, and analyze the catalytic activities for ORR. More importantly, the nitrogen atoms in the NMCS can expose more basic/catalytic sites that can coordinate with Pd nanoparticles to form the strong Pd-N interactions, which can not only tightly anchor Pd nanoparticles but also be advantageous to show outstanding stability and good resistance to methanol crossover. As expected, the obtained Pd-NMCS exhibit good ORR catalytic activities, desirable reaction kinetics, excellent stability, as well as better methanol tolerance, which may offer potential for the practical application of fuel cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0253-3820	1872-2040		WOS:000662230600001

Based on thermodynamic considerations, a possible explanation to the low exchange current for hydrogen reactions in alkaline is put forward. We propose this effect to be a consequence of the change in configurational entropy of the proton as it approaches the surface. As a proton crosses the outer Helmholtz plane, it will lose a fraction of its entropy before it can interact with the electrode surface, which gives rise to an entropic barrier. The size of this barrier will depend on the electrostatic environment in the double layer region. The entropic barrier can be rate determining only when the surface catalysis is fast. Therefore the effect of pH is most pronounced on good catalysts and for fast reactions. This entropic barrier is also in a good agreement with the unusually low prefactor measured in experiments of good catalysts such as Pt. In such catalysts, the enthalpy barrier of 0.1-0.2 eV of the rate-determining step does not come from any of the surface reactions (Volmer, Tafel or Heyrovsky) but instead from the proton transfer into the outer Helmholtz layer.

Herein, a 3D free-standing NiFe(oxy)hydroxide-based electrode with Schottky junction is constructed, in which NiFe(oxy)hydroxide (NiFe(OH)(x)) nanosheets are chemically assembled on the top of metal-like Ni3S2 scaffold that are in situ formed on commercial Ni mesh. Such an assembly enhances the binding strength of each components, promotes the charge transfer across the interfaces, and modulates the electronic and nanostructural features of NiFe(OH)(x). Consequently, the electrode delivers current densities of as high as 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2) for OER at overpotentials of only 248 and 270 mV with long-term stability in 1 m KOH. When it was paired with a NiMo hydrogen evolution cathode in a practical two-electrode system, a current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) is achieved at a low cell voltage of approximate to 1.61 V at 80 degrees C in 30% KOH without losing performance for at least 1500 h. This is the best performance reported thus far for alkaline water electrolysis under industrial conditions, demonstrating its great potential for practical applications.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000723115100001	34841659

The air electrode hybrid catalysts with controlled morphology are prepared by a facile hydrothermal self assembly process, which exhibits highly bi-functional catalytic activity for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during discharge and charge processes in a rechargeable Zn-air battery. When these catalysts are integrated into a practical primary Zn-air battery, a high open circuit voltage of 1.5 V is achieved along with a high discharge peak power density of 295 mW cm(-2). The specific capacity normalized to the mass of consumed Zn is 821 mA h g(-1), corresponding to a high energy density of 970 W h kg(-1), which shows this zinc-air battery's performance is higher than any battery currently commercially available to meet the requirements of high-power electric equipment. More specifically, the electrochemically rechargeable Zn-air battery incorporating by this bifunctional catalyst exhibits an unprecedented small charge-discharge voltage polarization, high reversibility and high stability, suggesting this battery can be used as a power source for portable electronics, armamentarium and electrical vehicles. Furthermore, a flexible, rechargeable Zn-air battery as a wholly solid-state energy storage device, and exhibiting good peak power density and decent stability, should be viable in other practical applications such as smart electronics and wearable electronic devices.

Here, we synthesize for the first time a highly ordered mesoporous BiFeO3 semiconductor using tartaric acid-assisted growth of the BiFeO3 compound inside the pores of a carbon template. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and N-2 physisorption measurements reveal that the template-free material possesses a three-dimensional hexagonal mesostructure with a Large internal BET surface area (141 m(2) g(-1)) and narrow sized pores (ca. 4 nm). Aka, the pore was comprise single-phase BiFeO3 nanocrystals according to the high-resolution TEM, electron diffraction and magnetic experiments. The mesoporous BiFeO3 shows high activity for the photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under UV-visible Light (lambda > 380 nm), affording an average oxygen evolution rate of 66 mu mol h(-1) g(-1).

Herein, we prepared metallic cobalt nanoparticle decorated N-doped graphitic sheets (Co@NGr) by adopting facile pyrolysis of a mixed ligand cobalt-based MOF (CoMOF-2) as a sacrificial template displaying good OER and HER activity. The catalytic material harvested at three different pyrolytic temperatures was characterized by various analytical methods such as PXRD, SEM, TEM, Raman, and XPS analyses. The catalytic activity of the obtained hybrid composite materials towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was studied. Co@NGr-900 was found to be an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst and 10 mA cm(-2) current density was afforded at an overpotential of 390 mV for OER and 340 mV for HER respectively. This study provides insight for the development of cost-effective nonprecious element-based electrocatalysts for water splitting which has relevance in energy storage and conversion. Catalytic performance is governed by the synergistic compositional effect of metallic cobalt/nitrogen-doping in the graphitic carbon increasing the electrical conductivity/active sites of the composite material.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000664786000064	35479352

We analyze thermal evolution of the impregnated M(acac)(x)-TiO2 composites with a combination of analytical methods and reveal strong differences in the precursor decomposition onsets and the resulting product composition, compared to the case of pure M(acac)(x) precursors. Consequent electron microscopy analyses of the resulting MOx-TiO2 composites indicate the presence of small (1-5 nm) amorphous MOx nanoparticles that are homogeneously distributed on the surface of the substrate TiO2. Complementing Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectra confirm pronounced effects of MOx deposition on the state of TiO2 substrate and suggest strong electronic communication between the components. The composites obtained at 350 degrees C were further tested towards sacrificial hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) demonstrating the dynamic nature of the NiOx-TiO2 photocatalyst whose Ni-0 active HER sites were generated in situ upon light exposure. In contrast, FeOx-TiO2, CoOx-TiO2, and NiOx-TiO2 were all active towards OER, featuring water oxidation ability in descending order, while XPS data of the samples after reaction indicate that partial oxidation of M species takes place during the course of the photocatalytic experiment. This work provides detailed insights on the wet chemistry-based preparation of MOx co-catalysts decorating oxide nanopowders including optimization of the thermal treatment, potential substrate effects and synergy as well as further prospects in photocatalysis.									46	1	0	0	1	0	46			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000479056700037

The introduction of nitrogen within the carbonaceous framework generates catalytic active sites and alters the electrical conductivity. However, the synthesis of these materials often involves long processes and severe reaction conditions which yield a low concentration of nitrogen (N) functionalities. Herein, we present a facile method for the synthesis of N-rich carbon by carbonizing a carbon nitride (C3N4)-polydopamine composite (CNDA) which can readily be prepared by room temperature self-polymerisation of dopamine in the presence of C3N4. The intrinsically high N content in C3N4 leads to a highly N-doped carbon. The CNDA catalyst synthesized at 900 degrees C contained 12.5 at% of N, enhancing both the ORR and OER catalytic activities through a 4-e(-) dominated pathway, providing a comparable E-1/2 and a remarkably improved diffusion-limited current to the other reported N-doped carbon catalysts. When used as an air-cathode in a zinc-air battery, this CNDA catalyst possessed stable discharge-charge cycling performance for 216 h, outperforming the Pt/C standard. This work opens a promising platform for the development of template-free processes for the synthesis of non-metal and nitrogen-rich carbon materials which are attractive for metal-air batteries and fuel cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000711528700024

Here, B, N-doped carbon nanosheets embedded with Co nanoparticles are reported by a simple wet chemical method and further pyrolysis process. The average size of Co nanoparticles is 10.03 +/- 1.6 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements show that those doped with B enrich active sites of the catalyst with highly active B-C bond and provide greater electrochemical surface area for ORR. The material shows impressive ORR performance with a positive half-wave potential of 0.87 V and a superior limiting current density of 6.88 mA cm(-2) outperforming commercial Pt/C in alkaline solution. Noticeably, the optimized electron structure of Co-N species significantly weakens the Co-O bond and adsorption energy of OOH*, which could promote the occurrence of close to the four-electron ORR process. This work, besides showing electrocatalysts with excellent ORR performance, provided an approach for optimizing catalytic activity of Co-based materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000792617800001

Catalysts based on precious metals such as RuO2 and IrO2 show high efficiency for oxygen evolution reaction. However, these catalysts are less abundant and expensive. To date, earth-abundant water oxidation catalysts still exhibit less activity for water oxidation. Herein, we report the synthesis of high surface area Mn2O3 nanomaterials for an efficient photocatalytic water oxidation catalyst. The synthesis process involves three simple steps. In the first step, CaMnO3 is synthesized by the citrate-gel method. In the second step, CaMnO3 is transformed into freestanding layers of epsilon-MnO2 by selective removal of Ca2+. In the third step, these layers are converted into irregularly shaped two-dimensional Mn2O3 flakes (AD-Mn2O3) by calcination at 550 degrees C. These AD-Mn2O3 nanostructures show 4 times higher surface area (127 m(2) g(-1)) when compared to the irregularly shaped Mn2O3 nanoparticles (CG-Mn2O3) synthesized by the citrate-gel method at the same temperature. The AD-Mn2O3 nanostructures show super hydrophilicity with a contact angle of zero degree. This material exhibits excellent photocatalytic water oxidation activity with a turnover frequency of 1.53 x 10(-3) s(-1), which is twice the activity shown by CG-Mn2O3. This study can help in developing an earth-abundant, cost-effective, efficient catalyst for overall water splitting.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2574-0970		WOS:000613246600045

Here we demonstrate improved OER activity through incorporation of a third cation, aluminum. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to deposit thin films of nickel oxide (Ni-O) and nickel-aluminum oxide (Ni-Al-O) to measure activity for the OER. Electrochemical preconditioning of the oxide films led to the formation of the OER-active oxyhydroxide catalysts. For Ni-Al-O films, electrochemical preconditioning resulted in aluminum dissolution until a stable composition at a Ni:Al ratio of 9:1 was reached. Because iron can be incorporated into the films from the solution, compositional effects of iron were studied by controlling the iron impurity level in the electrolyte. Turnover frequencies (TOFs) were determined for each catalyst, and it was found that the highest performing electrocatalysts were the films containing nickel, aluminum, and iron, confirming that aluminum exerts a promotion effect on nickel oxyhydroxide catalysts. Studies showed that unlike the Ni-Fe-OOH films, for which the TOF had very little thickness dependence, the activity of Ni-Al-Fe-OOH catalysts was dependent on thickness. This effect may arise from morphological changes in the catalyst film that modulate the density of the active site with thickness. For the thinnest films, aluminum doping improved the TOF of Ni-Fe-OOH catalysts by over 3-fold.									18	0	0	0	3	0	18			2574-0962			WOS:000469885300057

However, the slow charge transport and high free energy of intermediates conversion greatly restrain the kinetics of OER. Herein, we strategically adopt the hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) ligand to prepare an impressive NiFe bimetallic conductive Metal-organic framework (MOF) in-situ grown on carbon cloth ([Ni2.87Fe0.13(HHTP)2]n/ CC) via the conventional one-step hydrothermal method. The obtained [Ni2.87Fe0.13(HHTP)2]n/CC was characterized by high electrical conductivity, large specific surface area and affluent nanopores, which enables the [Ni2.87Fe0.13(HHTP)2]n/CC to improve the electron conductivity and deliver more catalytic active sites. Benefitting from the synergistic interaction of bimetallic Ni-Fe site and nanostructure advantages, [Ni2.87Fe0.13(HHTP)2]n/CC shows the greatly enhanced catalytic activity of a low overpotential of 310 mV at 20 mA cm-2 towards OER. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations well corroborate that the activity improvement is mainly attributed to NiO4-FeO4 (Fe site), instead of the NiO4-NiO4 and NiO4-FeO4 (Ni site), indicating that the Fe doping increases the activity of Ni site. This work systematically examines the potential of [Ni2.87Fe0.13(HHTP)2]n/CC in the OER and provides new avenue for designing the next-generation conductive MOFs catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2468-0230			WOS:000859659000001

Herein, the effect of crystal structure on the OER activity of Sr iridate particles is explored. Phase-pure Sr4IrO6, Sr2IrO4, and SrIrO3 micrometer-scale particles show high activity toward the OER with the electrode area-based geometric activity increasing in the order of IrOx < SrIrO3 < Sr4IrO6 < Sr2IrO4 at a constant Ir mass electrode loading. Particularly, Sr2IrO4 displays superior activity and stability compared to commercial Ir/C (Premetek) nanoparticles, including more than an order of magnitude improvement in the catalyst surface area normalized specific activity. This translated to a similar Ir-based mass activity for Sr2IrO4 despite significantly larger average particles sizes (0.1-3 mu m for Sr2IrO4 versus 2-3 nm for Ir/C) and a 40-fold improvement in Ir-based mass activity in comparison to IrOx particles synthesized by a similar thermochemical procedure. During electrochemical testing of the Sr iridate materials, initial Sr leaching results in the formation of a stable Ir-rich catalyst surface with a modified electronic environment compared to Ir-only materials, potentially leading to enhanced OER activity. The superior intrinsic activity of Sr iridates illustrates the ability of surface-leached crystalline materials to stabilize high activity surface sites capable of significantly improving catalyst performance toward economical OER-based technologies.									38	2	0	0	3	0	38			2574-0962			WOS:000483434700019

Herein, we report a facile electrodeposition method for fabrication of nanostructured Pd thin films from protic ionic liquids. The electrochemical behavior and electrodeposition of Pd were studied in a protic ionic liquid, ethylammonium nitrate (EAN), compared with aqueous solution and aprotic ionic liquids, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride-tetrafluoroborate (EMIM-Cl-BF4), using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The electrodeposition of Pd in protic ionic liquids is found to proceed via an instantaneous nucleation and diffusion-controlled 3D growth mechanism, and accompanied with hydrogen co-evolution at more negative deposition potentials. By controlling the electrodeposition media, electrodeposition potential and time, we show that Pd thin films can be electrodeposited from protic ionic liquids with finely tuned nanostructures and large surface area. The prepared Pd thin films were employed as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions in alkaline media with an onset potential of 0.95 V (RHE). It was found that Pd films prepared from protic ionic liquids exhibit larger electrochemically active surface area and higher catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reactions than aqueous and aprotic ionic liquid electrolytes under similar electrodeposition conditions.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11				2046-2069		WOS:000360860500082		
J	Zhou, Sheng; Qin, Jiayi; Zhao, Xueru; Yang, Jing								3D hierarchically macro-/mesoporous graphene frameworks enriched with pyridinic-nitrogen-cobalt active sites as efficient reversible oxygen electrocatalysts for rechargeable zinc-air batteries								CHINESE JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				42	4			571	582		10.1016/S1872-2067(20)63642-7				APR 2021	2021	Efficient and affordable electrocatalysts for reversible oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR and OER, respectively) are highly sought-after for use in rechargeable metal-air batteries. However, the construction of high-performance electrocatalysts that possess both largely accessible active sites and superior ORR/OER intrinsic activities is challenging. Herein, we report the design and successful preparation of a 3D hierarchically porous graphene framework with interconnected interlayer macropores and in-plane mesopores, enriched with pyridinic-nitrogen-cobalt (pyri-N-Co) active sites, namely, CoFe/3D-NLG. The pyri-N-Co bonding significantly accelerates sluggish oxygen electrocatalysis kinetics, in turn substantially improving the intrinsic ORR/OER activities per active site, while copious interlayer macropores and in-plane mesopores enable ultra-efficient mass transfer throughout the graphene architecture, thus ensuring sufficient exposure of accessible pyri-N-Co active sites to the reagents. Such a robust catalyst structure endows CoFe/3D-NLG with a remarkably enhanced reversible oxygen electrocatalysis performance, with the ORR half-wave potential identical to that of the benchmark Pt/C catalyst, and OER activity far surpassing that of the noble-metal-based RuO2 catalyst. Moreover, when employed as an air electrode for a rechargeable Zn-air battery, CoFe/3D-NLG manifests an exceedingly high open-circuit voltage (1.56 V), high peak power density (213 mW cm(-2)), ultra-low charge/discharge voltage (0.63 V), and excellent charge/discharge cycling stability, outperforming state-of-the-art noble-metal electrocatalysts.

However, how to distinguish the contribution of different factors to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is still a serious challenge. In this study, Al ions can control the morphology of CoOOH in cycle of nanosphere-nanosheet-nanosphere, and Ce-doping can significantly improve the OER activity of CoOOH, with an overpotential of 263 mV@50 mA cm(-2) and low Tafel slope of 53.74 mV dec(-1). In order to explain the above interesting experimental phenomena, detailed characterization has been carried out, such as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electrochemical tests. At the same time, the mechanism of OER performance improvement was discussed based on electrochemical testing and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Subsequently, the OER activities of different reactive sites, such as Al, Co, Ce, and oxygen vacancies (O-v), have been compared. As the main active center of OER, Ce ion has a minimum potential barrier of 1.71 eV. The results show that the adjustment of the adsorption intensity of the oxygen-containing species by Ce ions dominants the potential-determining step. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect of Ce and Co has also been confirmed based on the d-band theory. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, non-PGM electrocatalysts for the HOR are still in their early development stages as compared with the significant advances in those for the oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, this paper summarizes the recent progresses and highlights the key challenges for the rational design of non-PGM electrocatalysts, aiming to promote the development of non-PGM HOR electrocatalysts. Fundamental understandings of the HOR mechanism are firstly reviewed, where theoretical interpretations on the low HOR kinetics in alkaline media, including the hydrogen binding energy theory, the bifunctional mechanism, and the water molecule reorganization, are particularly discussed. Subsequently, progresses of typical non-PGM HOR electrocatalysts in acid and alkaline media are summarized separately. For the HOR under alkaline conditions, the superiorities and challenges of Ni-based catalysts are discussed with a particular focus as they are the most promising non-PGM electrocatalysts. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges and provide perspectives on the future development directions of non-PGM HOR electrocatalysts.									22	3	0	0	3	0	22			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000624625200001

The halo and the disk are assumed to evolve independently, both starting with gas of primordial composition, and in different ways: strong outflow is assumed to take place during the similar to 1 Gyr Of the halo formation, while the disk is built by slowly infalling gas. This description of the halo+disk evolution can correctly account for the main observational constraints (at least in the framework of Pimple models of galactic chemical evolution). We utilise then metallicity dependent yields to study the evolution of all elements from C and Zn. Comparing our results to an extensive body of observational data (including very recent ones), we rue able to make a critical analysis of the successes and shortcomings of cut-rent yields of massive stars. Finally. we discuss qualitatively some possible ways to interpret the recent data on oxygen vs iron, which suggest that oxygen behaves differently from the other alpha-elements.									169	8	0	0	1	0	169			1432-0746			WOS:000088424400018

It is found that abundant active sites with favorable electronic structure and high electrical conductivity play a dominant role in achieving high electrocatalytic efficiency of perovskites, thus efficient strategies need to be designed to generate multiple beneficial factors for OER. Here, highlighted is an unusual super-exchange effect in ferromagnetic perovskite oxide to optimize active sites and enhance electrical conductivity. A systematic exploration about the composition-dependent OER activity in SrCo1xRuxO3-delta (denoted as SCRx) (x = 0.0-1.0) perovskite is displayed with special attention on the role of super-exchange interaction between high spin (HS) Co3+ and Ru5+ ions. Induced by the unique Co3+-O-Ru5+ super-exchange interactions, the SCR0.1 is endowed with abundant OER active species including Co3+/Co4+, Ru5+, and O-2(2-)/O-, high electrical conductivity, and metal-oxygen covalency. Benefiting from these advantageous factors for OER electrocatalysis, the optimized SCR0.1 catalyst exhibits a remarkable activity with a low overpotential of 360 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which exceeds the benchmark RuO2 and most well-known perovskite oxides reported so far, while maintaining excellent durability. This work provides a new pathway in developing perovskite catalysts for efficient catalysis.									45	3	0	0	1	0	45			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000480428900001	31402592

Electrochemical deposition is considered as a promising method for large-scale industrial applications, but it is prone to generating dense compounds, which reduces the effective catalytic activity area of electrodes. Herein, a low-cost and high-performance bifunctional NiFeMn alloy@NiFeMn oxyhydroxide electrocatalyst was deposited by several minute electrodeposition. Due to the doping of manganese, this method effectively engineers a multi-level dendritic NiFeMn alloy and oxyhydroxide layer, and significantly reduces the energy barrier for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which has been proved by the density functional theory calculations. Specifically, the as-prepared catalyst shows excellent electrocatalytic performance for OER (219 mV) and HER (19 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Experimentally and theoretically, the catalyst demonstrated extraordinary performance for overall water splitting and provides a new possibility for industrialization in the future.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000642586900001

It is found that the EPD catalyst films demonstrate better catalytic activity per unit mass than do the dropcast films, as defined by diffusion-limited current, by approximately 27% for ORR and 25% for OER. When accounting for different loading levels, the absolute activities of these catalysts are superior to those of other reported Co3O4 colloidal nanoparticulate catalysts without conductive additives, showing that this material has excellent intrinsic activity for future optimization. Inspection of the electrode kinetics shows that EPD catalysts have more favorable characteristics as exhibited by their smaller Tafel slope (96 mV per decade for EPD versus 109 mV per decade for dropcast films). We analyze this enhancement by determining the metal oxide surface area for each catalyst film using a novel sequential metal deposition technique starting with electrodeposition of Ag followed by Pb underpotential deposition (UPD). Through UPD experiments we find, surprisingly, that EPD films have a smaller surface area than the dropcast films. We conclude that EPD films are more active per unit surface area. When accounting for surface area and mass, the EPD catalyst outperforms dropcast by a factor of 2.5 for ORR and 2.6 for OER. We anticipate that morphological differences in the EPD films relative to the dropcast ones, such as particle coverage and electrical conductivity, are responsible for this behavior. Such a result has important implications for future studies on the structure of EPD-manufactured nanoparticulate thin films and on the mechanisms for performance enhancement in such catalysts.									59	2	0	0	4	0	61			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000349667700020		
J	Eastwood, BJ; Christensen, PA; Armstrong, RD; Bates, NR								Electrochemical oxidation of a carbon black loaded polymer electrode in aqueous electrolytes								JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY				3	4			179	186		10.1007/s100080050145				MAY 1999	1999	The suitability of a polymeric composite material for use as part of an anode structure in a cathodic protection system has been examined. The composite material was a conductive blend (volume resistivity typically 1.5 Omega cm) of carbon black in a polyethylene binder. A long operational lifetime for the material demands that the rate of carbon loss must be low. In the work reported here, electrochemical and in situ analytical techniques were employed to characterise the performance of the material over a wide range of anodic current densities in a variety of aqueous electrolytes. The predominant anodic electrochemical reaction on the polymeric material is CO2 formation in acid and neutral solutions, which causes loss of carbon from the surface and the development of a non-conducting layer of polyethylene. The characteristics of the reaction suggest that it occurs via the discharge of H2O. In alkaline pH, however, the anodic reactions are more complex. A high OH- concentration (pH 12 or higher) favours the formation of oxygen rather than CO2, particularly at low anodic potentials. The presence of CO32- in the electrolyte catalyses the evolution of oxygen at pH values as low as 9. The electrochemical formation of oxygen always occurs in parallel with the generation of some humic acid in the solution.									49	6	0	0	1	0	53			1432-8488			WOS:000080268600001

However, the introduction of other transition metals in diverse catalytic systems using a precisely controllable method has remained a great challenge. In this study, a facile strategy is proposed by using Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with tunable metal composition as a template to synthesize various Co-Fe molar ratios of spinel metal oxides. The iron-cobalt oxide (FeCo oxide) is successfully synthesized by utilizing thermal conversion of FeCo-based PBAs; the obtained oxide possessed a rough and porous structure with numerous interconnected granular nanoparticles formed in hollow multiple voids of each surface. In addition, the suitable iron contents occupying the octahedral sites in the spinel structure of FeCo oxide can further reduce the charge-transfer resistance and enhance the electrocatalytic activities toward OER. Benefiting from the unique structure and the chemical composition, the as-synthesized FeCo oxide shows an excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a good stability for at least 12 h of operation in alkaline solution. These results suggest that the electrocatalytic activities can be optimized by controllable metal composition of the PBA-derived metal oxides, which are the promising electrocatalysts for OER application.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2574-0962			WOS:000618839200028		
J	Nandan, Ravi; Nanda, K. K.

Here, a rational facile synthesis methodology has been developed to design N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) and Fe-Fe3C nanostructures co-embedded in B-doped mesoporous carbon nanostructures (BFNCNTs) as a noble metal-free superior bi-functional electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution/reduction reactions. The incorporation of N and B with negligible/undetectable B-N formation and Fe-Fe3C nanostructures leads to the superior performance by introducing plenty of defects, local heterogeneity and a high specific surface area (similar to 272 m(2) g(-1)). Besides, mesoporous boron-doped carbon acts as a host material for NCNTs and Fe-Fe3C, and it offers good connectivity as well as a protective coating for durable catalysis. Remarkably, more positive onset (-30 mV) and half-wave potentials (-225 mV) with -94% current retention under accelerated stability test and fuel tolerance for the ORR, in combination with lower onset (422 mV) and E-j=10(OER) (562 mV) potentials with high current density (190 mA cm(-2) @ 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl) for the OER as compared to commercial state-of-the-art electrocatalysts suggest superior bifunctional behavior of BFNCNTs. The complete oxygen electrochemical activity Delta E = E-j(OER)=10 = E-1/2(ORR) = 0.788 V for BFNCNTs is lower than recently reported various state-of-the-art bifunctional catalysts. Besides, a prototype battery fabrication using BFNCNTs as the cathode electrode for driving a light emitting diode has been demonstrated. Overall, BFNCNTs have potential to serve as a non-precious electrocatalyst for electrochemical energy devices.									65	3	1	0	2	0	66			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000407641200041

Kinetic trends are observed and can be classified into three pH regions: acidic (1-5), neutral (5-9), and alkaline (9-13). Under neutral conditions, in which H2O becomes the primary reactant, substantial overpotential, which is not affected by pH and the supporting electrolyte type, is required for electrocatalysis in both directions. This ion independence, including pH, suggests that HER/HOR performance under neutral conditions solely reflects the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of Pt in the rate determining steps, which involve electron transfer with water molecules. A global picture of the HER/HOR, resulting from mechanistic switching accompanied by change in pH, is detailed.									34	1	0	0	1	0	35			2196-0216			WOS:000342817800009

However, both the metabolites and the biochemical fluxes behind any biological phenomenon are encrypted in the DNA sequence. Metabolism constrains and even changes the information flow when the DNA-encoded instructions conflict with the homeostasis of the biochemical network. Inspection of adaptive virulence programs and emergence of xenobiotic-biodegradation pathways in environmental bacteria suggest that their main evolutionary drive is the expansion of their metabolic networks towards new chemical landscapes rather than perpetuation and spreading of their DNA sequences. Faulty enzymatic reactions on suboptimal substrates often produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), a process that fosters DNA diversification and ultimately couples catabolism of the new chemicals to growth. All this calls for a revision of the CD in which metabolism (rather than DNA) has the leading role.									41	0	0	0	34	1	42			0265-9247	1521-1878		WOS:000331953500002	24419968

Herein, we report a facile and controllable method for the in-situ growth of urchin-like FeOOH-NiOOH catalyst on Ni foam (FeOOH-NiOOH/NF). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms that the proportion of Ni and Fe species with high valence state gradually increase with the extension of growth time. Electrochemical studies have shown that the optimized FeOOH-NiOOH/NF-24 h and -12 h catalysts demonstrate excellent electrochemical activity and stability in oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions. Moreover, the cell voltage is reduced around 0.15 V at high current density (0.5-1.0 A cm(-2)) as compared to the state-of the art RuO2/NF(+)parallel to Pt-C/NF(-) system, far better than most of the previously reported catalysts. The cost analyst revealed that using FeOOH-NiOOH/NF catalyst as both electrodes could potentially reduce the price of H-2 around 7% compared with traditional industrial electrolyzers. These excellent electrocatalytic properties can be attributed to the unique urchin-like structure and the synergy between Ni and Fe species, which can not only provide more active sites and accelerate electron transfer, but also promote electrolyte transport and gas emission.

It is shown that for high CO2 contents (X-CO2 > 0.82) such that the reaction temperature is relatively low, the structure is affected by LTC and exhibits two distinct stages of energy release caused by low-and high-temperature chemistry, respectively. Based on the ZND structures, the dynamic parameters such as cell size, direct initiation energy and critical tube diameter of detonation within the LTC affected regime have been evaluated using various semi-empirical models. Such detonation structures exhibiting two distinct length scales lead to two distinct values for each of these dynamic parameters. For the evolution of the induction length and cell size, although the total length scales do not show negative response with increasing temperature, the length scale of the first-stage ignition demonstrates negative response when the post-shock temperature decreases within the LTC controlled regime. For the evolution of direct initiation energy, the models based on critical curvature and critical decay rate show negative temperature response, but the model based on cell size predicts continuous increase of critical initiation energy with increasing dilution. For the critical tube diameter, the model based on the critical decay rate approach also exhibits the negative temperature response. (C) 2018 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Specially, the mechanism for the formation of quantum dots in relation to Fe/Ni ratio and the corresponding activity of ORR and OER are studied carefully. Consequently, NiFe2O4(QDs)/CNTs exhibits superior bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activities with the lowest the potential difference (Delta E) of 0.9 V, outperforming well-known commercial Pt/C and IrO2, directly demonstrating the advantages of quantum dots catalysts on providing more effective actives sites and adsorption-desorption sites to promote oxygen reaction kinetics. NiFe2O4(QDs)/CNTs, as high-performance catalyst used in liquid and flexible metal-air batteries, realize high power density, high specific capacity, long-term rechargeability (over 800 h), and extremely low charge-discharge voltage gaps (only 0.62 V) in ambient atmosphere. Furthermore, the metal-air batteries with flexible configuration effectively prevent the migration of Zn2+/Mg2+, the production of carbonate and the hydrogen evolution reaction. Density functional theory calculations further illustrate that the NiFe2O4(QDs) on CNT has a very active ORR and OER site at the interface Ni site. The work offers prospects for the rational design of quantum dots containing composites to achieve their practicalities in next generation of metal-air batteries.									122	9	0	0	3	0	124			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000458419000017

Using Paracetamol as a model pollutant and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal as the priority objective, we have studied the effects of irradiance intensity (13-87W/m(2)), iron concentration (0.09-0.45 mM), hydrogen peroxide concentration (9-45 mM) and finally DOC concentration (4-25 mM) on the relationship between the mineralization rate, the H(2)O(2) reaction rate and the oxygen generation rate. A high level of oxygen generation is indicative of inefficient conditions whereas a decrease in dissolved oxygen concentration (i.e. generation rates near to zero) indicates a lack of hydrogen peroxide.

Over the past few decades, significant effort has been devoted to improving the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution efficiency, while substantially less focus has been directed towards the oxidation reactions. More recently, the realization of the potential for simultaneous hydrogen production with value-added organics has inspired researchers to use photooxidation pathways to tune the selectivity of oxidized products. As a distinct benefit, the less energetically demanding organic reforming is highly favorable when compared to the slow kinetics of oxygen evolution which negates the need for expensive and/or harmful hole scavengers. Photocatalyst modifications, such as secondary component deposition, doping, defect, phase and morphology engineering, have been the main strategies adopted to tune the photooxidation pathways and oxidation products. Direct control of the process conditions, including pH, temperature and reactant concentration, and favorable reactor designs can further improve the selectivity towards desired products. While other published reviews focus on the types of photocatalysts or feedstocks used to enhance the hydrogen evolution efficiency, this review highlights the importance of controlling the selectivity of the photoreforming reaction, particularly as an alternative path for waste abatement or valorization for industry. This review links the strategies used to improve the selectivity of photoreforming of organic waste into high-value and desirable chemicals, as well as offers an outlook on the future research direction required to deliver highly selective photocatalyst. A holistic strategy that comprises photocatalyst and system designs, appropriate characterizations and implementation of artificial intelligence has also been proposed and discussed to further aid establishment of the structure-mechanism-function relationship, thereby accelerating the discovery of optimum selective photoreforming systems.									44	2	0	0	4	0	44			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000639555200003

The reaction of dissociative recombination of the main ionospheric ion O-2(+) with thermal electrons in the ionosphere of Mars is considered as a source of hot oxygen atoms. The distribution of suprathermal oxygen atoms by kinetic energy is calculated. It is shown that the exosphere is populated by a considerable number of suprathermal oxygen atoms with kinetic energies just below the escape energy of 2 eV; that is, a hot oxygen corona of Mars is formed.									28	0	1	0	1	0	28			0038-0946	1608-3423		WOS:000241571400003

The Role of Diffusion Processes in the Formation of Conductive Channels in Cells with Resistive Memory								Journal of Nano and Microsystem Technique				22	4			201	14		10.17587/nmst.22				2020	2020	The review describes physical and chemical processes: oxidation and reduction reactions, the generation of oxygen vacancies, the drift of charged oxygen vacancies in an electric field and the diffusion of vacancies caused by a temperature gradient, which play a role in the formation of nanoscale conductive channels in resistive memory cells - memristors - based on transition metal oxides. The fundamental difference in a behavior of conductive channel within single memristor operating cycle for bipolar and unipolar switching modes is described. The common features of the diffusion mechanisms controlling the evolution of conductive channels of different nature are revealed. It is shown that the control of bipolar memristor operating cycle can be achieved both by changing the length of the conductive channel and due to its shape variation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1813-8586			INSPEC:19762384

Reaction effectiveness and product evolution turn out to depend strongly on the wavelength of the incident light. Under UV light, the pi-conjugated system and the hexyl side chain are degraded almost simultaneously, involving Norrish-type reactions that lead to complete disintegration of the alkyl chains. Under visible light only the pi-conjugated system is destroyed, whereas the aliphatic side chains are hardly affected. While the reaction under UV light is consistent with a radical reaction starting at the alpha-carbon of the alkyl side chain, the reaction under visible illumination is more likely to involve a photosensitized species that primarily attacks the pi-conjugated system of the polymer.									49	1	0	0	2	0	49			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000306674200016

However, their poor catalytic performance in alkaline media is problematic for practical application. Herein, we report the synthesis of two metal-free 2D COFs as efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction in an alkaline solution. The overpotentials are 136 and 91 at 10 mA cm(-2) with small Tafel slopes in alkaline media, respectively. The superior HER activity is due to the thiophene-S units, which have higher conductivity, charge mobility and synergy with one-dimensional nanochannels of 2D COFs. The experimental identification is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work demonstrates that rational design of unique thiophene-based COFs can effectively improve their HER activities, which holds great potential for practical applications in water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000781261800001

Rietveld refinement allowed the identification of the crystallographic phases present in all oxides. The electrocatalytic performance of these oxides towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was examined in alkaline medium by rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) in the redox competition mode. The results indicate that the best performance was found with the LANC electrocatalyst prepared with carbon as a conducting agent (LANC/Carbon), which showed good catalytic activity towards the ORR via a pseudo four-electron transfer pathway. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity of LANC is probably a result of the presence of a Ag phase, which improves the synergistic effect between the perovskite and carbon added to increase the conductivity, thus leading to a higher ORR performance when compared to other materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0103-5053	1678-4790		WOS:000624339500020

An analysis of the structure-property relationships of the optical and redox properties of the corroles has been carried out by comparing their optical spectra and their electrochemical properties. The results demonstrate that post-functionalized meso-expanded Co(III) triarylcorroles exhibit enhanced electrocatalyzed oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and that their reactivity can be controlled by modulating the electronic structure, the functionalization and the number of coupled meso-substituents.									10	0	2	0	1	0	10			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000519895500026	32101178

Herein, efficiency limits of these devices are modeled by combining the detailed-balance model of the light-absorbers with Butler-Volmer electron-transfer kinetics. The impacts of the redox shuttle thermodynamic potential, light-absorber bandgaps, and electrocatalytic parameters on the solar-to-hydrogen conversion (STH) efficiency are modeled. We report that the thermodynamic potential of the redox shuttle with respect to the hydrogen and oxygen evolution potentials has a direct effect on both the STH efficiency and the optimal tandem light-absorber bandgaps needed to achieve the maximum possible STH efficiency. At 1 sun illumination and assuming ideal and optimally selective electrocatalytic parameters, the STH efficiency varies from a minimum of 21%, for a redox shuttle potential of 0 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), to a maximum of 34%, for a redox shuttle potential of either 0.36 V or 1.06 V vs. RHE. To attain the maximum possible STH efficiency of 34%, the light-absorber bandgaps must be 1.53 eV and 0.75 eV, yet the optimal redox shuttle potential depends on whether the hydrogen-evolving or oxygen-evolving light-absorber has the larger bandgap. Results also underscore the importance of optimizing the absorptance of the top light-absorber, which enables large STH efficiencies to be achieved with a wider range of bandgap combinations. Moreover, given the large overpotentials for the oxygen evolution reaction and reasonably low overpotentials for most redox shuttle reactions, the tandem design is more efficient than a single light-absorber design even when the potential of the redox shuttle exceeds 1.23 V vs. RHE. When the exchange current density of the redox shuttle reactions is as low as 10(-5) mA cm(-2), STH efficiencies as large as 22% are still achievable as long as selective catalysis and optimal redox shuttle potential are assumed, suggesting that even slow redox shuttle reactions may not limit the practicality of these devices.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000457194500016

Hydrogen production halved in seawater compared to pure water, mainly due to flocculation of the granules, and activity recovered by de flocculation and/or lowering the Na+ concentrations. The activity of the settled granular photocatalyst was higher than that of the suspended powder photocatalyst under anoxic conditions. The decrease in activity was small up to the DO value of pure oxygen bubbling, which shows the effective inhibition of oxygen reduction and thermal hydrogen oxidation.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			1566-7367	1873-3905		WOS:000440771300027

Under electrochemical conditions, the Pt surface gets poisoned with halide ad-atoms and it causes the attenuation of both hydrogen adsorption/desorption in the lower potential region (0.06-0.4 V) and electroxidation of Pt nanoparticles in the higher potential region (0.6-1.2 V). Above certain concentration (5 x 10(-6) M), the strongly adsorbing I- ions mask the H-upd features. On the other hand, Br- and Cl- ions alter the peak features in the H-upd region, those are characteristic of different Pt surface sites. On excursion to higher potentials (similar to> 1.2 V), concurrent halogen evolution, Pt oxidation, and oxygen evolution are observed; the increase in peak intensity in the H-upd region reflects the reconstruction of the Pt surface. To remove the adsorbed halide ions from the Pt surface, an in-situ potentiostatic method is employed, which involves holding the working electrode at similar to 0.03 V in 0.1 M NaOH solution. The cleanliness and retention of surface-structure are confirmed from the voltammograms recorded in the test electrolyte and the recovery of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity after cleaning the Br- ion-contaminated Pt surface supports this conjecture.

The development of low-cost and high-efficiency electrocatalysts has become a major scientific challenge worldwide. Microorganisms are widely found in nature and are characterized by their rich structure, composition and metabolism. These properties facilitate their use as intelligent templates for electrocatalyst structures and as sources of non-metallic elements such as carbon, phosphorus, sulfur, as well as metallic elements. The use of microorganisms in electrocatalyst production has become a new trend owing to the advantages of non-toxicity, reproducible production, and ease of scaling up. Thus, this paper reviews the development of microbial "intelligence" guided preparation of electrocatalysts and their current applications in the fields of hydrogen evolution reactions, oxygen evolution reactions, oxygen reduction reactions, carbon dioxide reductions and lithium batteries. In order to achieve the function of "intelligent" guidance of microorganisms, four aspects need to be addressed: (1) the selection of suitable microbial species and the culture and activation conditions, which significantly helps in tailoring the microbial properties for specific applications; (2) the exploration of microbial species that can accumulate metal species from their living environment and thus produce metal nanoparticles, which will help obtain nanocomposites with desired properties; (3) the selection of compounds with good catalytic properties, high stability, and compatibility with microbial substrates; and (4) the development of highly controllable nanocatalysts through modern molecular biology and genetic engineering to regulate microbial life processes such as metabolic proliferation and apoptosis. With the resolution of these issues, we believe that the application of microbial intelligent templates guided electrocatalysts can be further extended to other electrocatalytic reactions such as ethanol oxidation reactions (EOR), nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR), and to other applications in fields such as electronics, sensing, imaging, and biomedicine. The goal of this review is to promote a deeper understanding of the correlations among microbial metabolism, catalyst micro-nano structures and structure-activity relationships. Furthermore, the challenges associated with such materials and the prospects for future development are discussed herein.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-6818			WOS:000849637800004

Response variables included the temperature of incipient reaction, the total exothermic heat of reaction, particle mass, morphology and mineralogy of the reacted particles. Based on the experimental data and phase stability calculations, reaction mechanisms were proposed to represent the behavior of the particles during oxidation. The reaction mechanisms were verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses of the oxidized particles and by thermochemical and mass balance calculations to reproduce the DSC and TGA data.

The kinetic burdens associated with the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) cause a large amount of energy loss. Hence, these reactions must be catalyzed. Therefore, an array of magnetic CoPt nanoparticle (NP)-decorated ultrathin Co(OH)(2) nanosheets was synthesized and applied for electrocatalytic water splitting in 1 M KOH. CoPt@ Co(OH)(2) required a minimum overpotential of 334 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in the OER and 226 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) in the HER in addition to possessing exceptional stability upon cycling and chronoamperometry. The advantages of the magnetic property of CoPt@ Co(OH)(2) have been utilized for the first time to improve its stability. The aging study carried out at the CoPt@ Co(OH)(2)-modified interface with and without magnetic support has shown that the magnetically co-stabilized interface was more stable even after 5 days of aging in 1 M KOH. This magnetism-assisted enhancement in the stability of a nanocatalyst-modified interface along with proper further developments will surely take the electrocatalysis of water splitting to a new level.									49	4	0	0	2	0	50			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000403966900009

The murburn precepts for aerobic respiration and redox homeostasis								PROGRESS IN BIOPHYSICS & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				167				104	120		10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2021.05.010		DEC 2021		DEC 2021	2021	Murburn concept is a new perspective to metabolism which posits that certain redox enzymes/proteins mediate catalysis outside their active site, via diffusible reactive oxygen species (DROS, usually deemed as toxic wastes). We have recently questioned the proton-centric chemiosmotic rotary ATP synthesis (CRAS) explanation for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (mOxPhos) and proposed an oxygencentric murburn model in lieu. Herein, the chemical equations and thermodynamic foundations for this new model of mOxPhos are detailed. Standard transformed Gibbs free energy values of respiratory reactions are calculated to address the spontaneity, control, and efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. Unlike the deterministic/multi-molecular and 'irreducibly complex' CRAS model, the stochastic/bimolecular and parsimonious murburn reactions afford a more viable precept for the variable and nonintegral stoichiometry, higher yield for NADH than FADH2, and origin/evolution of oxygen-centric cellular life. Also, we present tangible DROS-based explanations for the multiple roles of various reaction components, HCN > H2S order of cellular toxicity in aerobes, and explain why oxygen inhibits anaerobes. We highlight the thermodynamic significance of proton deficiency in NADH/mitochondria and link the 'oxygen -> DROS -> water' metabolic pathway to the macroscopic physiologies of ATP-synthesis, trans-membrane potential, thermogenesis, and homeostasis. We also provide arguments for the extension of the murburn bioenergetics model to life under anoxic and extreme/unique habitats. In the context of mOxPhos, our findings imply that DROS should be seen as an essential requisite for life, and not merely as pathophysiological manifestations. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Two materials, i.e., platinum and glassy carbon (GC), were investigated as electrode supports recording polarization and chronopotentiometric curves, with a rotating disk electrode in alkaline solutions. LDHs containing iron exhibited higher activity for OER and all the materials showed a good stability and durability in alkaline media.

The presence of surface defects on electrocatalysts promotes conductivity and diffusion coefficient, thus improving electrochemical performance. Here, an efficient way is described for generating defect-rich, highly ordered macroporous phosphorus-doped cobalt oxides catalysts (Co:Pi/CoOx/CP) by an in situ template assembly strategy followed by a fast microwave-induced plasma (MIP).

The evolution of morphology and crystal structure in the synthesis of powders was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The surface chemical properties of the powders were studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The oxygen sorptive/desorptive kinetics was studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Kinetics of the oxygen exchange reactions were analyzed and explained using empirical kinetics models with minimum error. A strong correlation was observed between the oxygen desorption parameters and oxygen to copper ratio calculated from measured XPS spectra. Copper oxide powders synthesized using the alanine assisted combustion and citrate gel methods resulted in optimum kinetic properties for use as an oxygen carrier at high temperature.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0888-5885			WOS:000346322200027		
J	Yu, L.; Ren, Z.					Yu, Luo/0000-0002-3807-4860			Systematic study of the influence of iR compensation on water electrolysis								MATERIALS TODAY PHYSICS				14						100253	10.1016/j.mtphys.2020.100253				AUG 2020	2020	Water electrolysis has been one of the most studied topics in materials research in the past decade because of the global effort in exploring clean and renewable energy sources. Much effort has been devoted to developing highly active electrocatalysts for the two half reactions of water electrolysis, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Some reported electrocatalysts are even superior to the benchmark platinum and iridium dioxide catalysts, and thus are claimed to be promising for large-scale commercial use. However, most electrochemical data in the literature are reported after iR compensation, where R is the overall resistance, including contact resistance, charge-transfer resistance, and intrinsic resistance. Unfortunately, these types of resistance cannot be avoided in real electrolyzers, which means that R still results in energy consumption if the electrocatalysts are used for industrial water electrolysis. Thus, the data with iR compensation are always misleading, and setting criteria for iR compensation in analyses of water electrolysis is urgently needed to instruct the scientific community. In this work, we test the catalytic performance of several reported HER and OER catalysts with and without iR compensation and discuss the contribution from iR compensation under small and large current densities. We also present a comparative study between two iR compensation methods (automatic and manual iR compensation). Finally, we propose some strategies to reduce the R to achieve better performance without iR compensation, which is necessary for industrial applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we fabricated iron phosphide/N, P-doped carbon nanosheets electrocatalysts via a one-pot pyrolysis process without any post-treatments, which shows high ORR activity over the whole pH range. In alkaline solution, the optimal catalyst exhibits almost the same onset potential (0.918 V vs RHE) and half-wave potential (0.832 V vs RHE) with commercial Pt/C (20 wt %), meanwhile it shows prominent catalytic activity compared with Pt/C in acidic and neutral media. Noteworthy, the catalyst catalyzes ORR process following a one-step 4e pathway in all these media and poses better tolerance toward methanol and greater durability than Pt/C. It was proved that FexP (x = 1 or 2) and N,P-doped carbon synergistically contributed to the high ORR activity for the electrocatalysts. This work would broaden the application of iron phosphides in the field of electrocatalysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, electrocatalysts that can readily activate N2, promote selective ammonia formation over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction, and maintain stability under reaction conditions are needed to enable this technology. Herein, we give our perspective on metal oxynitrides (A(x)B(y)O(w)N(z)) as an emerging and underexplored materials class for e-NRR. We contrast the activity, selectivity, and stability of metal oxynitrides with those of their metal nitride and metal oxide counterparts. We discuss the different possible e-NRR reaction mechanisms on metal oxynitrides, emphasize challenges related to using metal oxynitrides for e-NRR, and provide an outlook for future research. Ultimately, the huge design space of metal oxynitrides is ripe for exploration to find catalyst formulations that overcome some of the limitations of traditional metal oxides and metal nitrides for e-NRR.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000841259600001

The surface chemistries and microstructures of Ag/LSM/CFC were characterized, and its bifunctional electrocatalysis effects were examined in this article. The results showed that the catalytic activity of LSM/CFC toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was greatly improved by the silver modification. The superior 3D hierarchical electrode microstructure and the good interface between the silver and LSM resulted in a large electrochemical active area and more catalytic sites. Ag/LSM/CFC exhibited a high half-wave potential of 0.833 V, a small Tafel slope of 48.81 mV.dec(-1) and a large electrochemical surface area (C-dl=82.16 mF.cm(-2)) in 0.1 M KOH solution at room temperature. Furthermore, a flexible Al-air battery with this kind of 3D hierarchical air electrode delivered a high power density of 5.14 mW.cm(-2) and excellent stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1452-3981			WOS:000570963900086

Herein, we develop a facile and high-yield preparation route to fabricate a multifunctional material consisted of CoFe alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes arrays grown on both sides of reduced graphene oxide (CoFe@N-CNT/rGO). CoFe@N-CNT/rGO displays excellent properties in the field of rechargeable Zn-air battery and electromagnetic wave absorption. CoFe@N-CNT/rGO shows bifunctional electrocatalytic performances toward oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, favorably comparable to that of commercial catalysts (Pt/C and IrO2). Furthermore, the assembled liquid and all-solid-state rechargeable Zn-air batteries with CoFe@N-CNT/rGO as air cathode display good chargingedischarging performance. As electromagnetic wave absorbing material, CoFe@N-CNT/rGO shows the minimal reflection loss of -33.2 dB at 13.3 GHz, superior to reported carbon-based electromagnetic wave absorbing materials. Based on excellent electromagnetic absorption performance, electromagnetic energy conversion device is designed to realize reasonable utilization and conversion of the absorbed electromagnetic energy. These encouraging results lay a solid foundation for development the multifunctional material and provide an effective strategy for simultaneously solving energy crisis and electromagnetic radiation problems.

The ORR mechanism in high donor number (DN) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-based electrolytes is markedly different from that occurs in low DN acetonitrile(MeCN)-based electrolytes. The ORR is catalyzed by the reduced Fe(I) state of Fe(II) PC. Consequently, the Fe(II) PC/Fe(I) PC redox potential relative to O-2 reduction potential in each electrolyte is important for ORR catalysis. In MeCN-based electrolytes, the Fe(I) PC catalyst is formed at a higher potential than the ORR potential. Hence the catalyzed ORR occurs at the inner-Helmholtz plane of the electrode, stabilizing the superoxide ion (O-2(-)) formed by one-electron reduction of O-2, as Fe(I) PC-O-2(-). Indeed, LiO2 was identified in the Raman spectra of cathodes from discharged Li-O-2 battery cells. In DMSO-based electrolytes, the Fe(I) PC formation potential occurs below the ORR potential and accordingly LiO2 is more stable in its solvated state in the electrolyte solution as the Li(DMSO) n-O-2(-) ion pair. This drives the ORR at the outer-Helmholtz plane of both catalyzed and uncatalyzed electrodes in DMSO-based electrolytes. The FePC embedded carbon electrode doubled the cycle life of Li-O-2 cells utilizing low DN electrolytes. (C) 2017 The Electrochemical Society.

Under anaerobic conditions, the relatively small quenching of the maximum fluorescence (F-max) is accompanied by a large increase of the initial fluorescence (F-0), which is partially reversible. Changes in the extent of the Q(A)(-)Fe(2+) and chlorophyll triplet EPR signal during anaerobic photoinhibition were consistent with double reduction of Q(A) [as reported by Vass et al. ((1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 1408-1412)]. When illumination was done in the presence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) or ferricyanide, no change occurred in F-0 while F-max was quenched. The quenching of F-max occurred more rapidly than the loss of oxygen evolution, and they were both irreversible. In the presence of ferricyanide, the percentage of inhibition of oxygen evolution was larger than the decrease in the extent of the Q(A)(-)Fe(2+) signal, indicating that damage of the donor side occurred. In the presence of DCMU, a decrease of the Q(A)(-)Fe(2+) EPR signal occurred which corresponded to the inhibition of oxygen evolution and to an increase of the triplet EPR signal, indicating a possible overreduction of QA. However, these changes were less marked in the DCMU-treated samples than in the sample without additions and occurred despite the quenching of F-max. These results suggest that strong illumination of thylakoids, in the presence of DCMU, results in a slower formation of stable forms of reduced Q(A), thereby allowing the occurrence of side-path reactions leading to F-max quenching. From the fluorescence quenching data, these side-path reactions seem to occur under all the conditions studied with the exception of samples illuminated under anaerobic conditions without additions. To rationalize these observations, we propose that, under the latter conditions, relatively rapid overreduction of the reaction center results in the inhibition of charge separation and hence the prevention of F-max quencher formation. When overreduction of Q(A) is slowed down (by the presence of electron acceptors, oxygen, or DCMU), then side-path reactions occur resulting in the irreversible fluorescence quenching and irreversible damage. These two effects may be related to overoxidation of PS II components.									56	0	0	0	53	0	56			0006-2960			WOS:A1994NA88600043	8130223

Herein, we developed a facile and easily scalable hard-template strategy to fabricate hierarchical Ni/Ni0.2Mo0.8N nanosheets (similar to 4.37 nm in thickness) in situ coupled with N-doped carbon (Ni/Ni0.2Mo0.8N@N-C) as an efficient electrocatalyst for the OER. The elaborate construction of Ni/Ni0.2Mo0.8N can validly regulate the electronic structure, increase the number of active sites, and facilitate diffusion kinetics. Benefiting from the coupling effect between hierarchical Ni/Ni0.2Mo0.8N and the N-carbon matrix, the resultant Ni/Ni0.2Mo0.8N@N-C exhibits excellent OER performance in alkaline media, including a low overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1), as well as remarkable stability for long-term electrolysis operation, significantly exceeding the findings for most previously reported OER electrocatalysts. Theoretical studies demonstrate that incorporation of Ni into Ni0.2Mo0.8N can effectively optimize water adsorption energy and enhance electronic states density near the Fermi level, which is conducive to accelerating the OER process. This work underlines a rational and new perspective for designing inexpensive and robust Mott-Schottky electrocatalysts toward OER for energy storage and conversion devices.									23	0	0	0	4	0	23			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000525862500150

In this effort, a novel and facile self-jet vapor-phase growth approach is developed, from which highly dispersive FeNi alloy nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) grown on a cotton pad (FeNi@NCNT-CP) can be fabricated. The as-prepared FeNi@NCNT-CP clusters exhibit superior bifunctional catalytic activity, with a high half-wave potential of 0.85 V toward ORR and a low potential of 1.59 V at 10 mA cm(-2) toward OER. Specifically, owing to the synergistic effects of FeNi alloy NPs and NCNT, FeNi@NCNT-CP clusters deliver excellent stability, demonstrating a small potential gap of 0.73 V between ORR and OER after operation for 10 000 cycles. Furthermore, FeNi@NCNT-CP serves as a cost-effective, superior catalyst for the cathode of a rechargeable Zn-air battery, outperforming a catalyst mixture of expensive Pt/C and IrO2. FeNi@NCNT-CP provides a maximum power density of 200 mW cm(-2) and a cycling stability of up to 250 h. This contribution provides new prospects to prepare non-noble electrocatalysts for metal-air battery cathodes.									28	1	0	0	0	0	28			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000603365000001	33377268

Nevertheless, this approach is immensely handicapped by the tardy oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) can feasibly substitute the OER for hydrogen generation with less power expending on account of the more beneficial thermodynamics and kinetics. Herein, the hierarchical nickel-iron phosphide (Ni-Fe-P) nanosheet directly grown on Ni foam (NF) is proposed as a high-efficiency selfsupported bifunctional electrocatalyst. Integrating the advantages of the unique architecture and the composition, the Ni-Fe-P/NF electrode displays highly alluring electrocatalytic activity and stability toward EOR as well as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The as-assembled Ni-Fe-P/NF//Ni-Fe-P/NF hybrid ethanol-water electrolyser only requires 1.53 V to supply 10 mA cm-2, outperforming the sole water splitting (1.66 V). Noteworthily, the liquid product of electrolysis is more meritorious than the raw material, highlighting that the hybrid ethanol-water electrolyser we elaborated possesses prodigious potentiality for application in energysaving H2 generation and the oxidation of ethanol into acetic acid. This work may provide an innovative strategy in designing and developing other high-efficiency organic molecule electrocatalysts and related energysaving H2 production applications in the future.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000723631100003

Herein, we present an elaborate method for preparing FeNi-based bimetallic alloy/oxide hybrids implanted in spongy-like N-doped carbon (S-FeNi/NiFe2O4@NC) via introducing FeNi Hofmann-type metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as pyrolysis precursors. Impressively, the evenly distributed FeNi alloys coexisting with oxides are directly derived from bimetallic nodes in the MOFs, which are expected to boost the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity by multi-compositional synergism. Meanwhile, spongy-like N-doped carbon matrix would be effective for achieving rich metal active sites and rapid mass/electron transport. Accordingly, the obtained S-FeNi/NiFe2O4@NC-800 shows an extraordinary electrochemical activity with an ORR/OER potential gap of 0.76 V. In addition, the catalyst emerges outstanding stability with potential losses that are only half those of commercial reference catalysts for both ORR and OER after 10,000 cycles. Importantly, zinc-air battery assembled with S-FeNi/ NiFe2O4@NC-800 delivers a high peak power density of 129 mW cm(-2) and an excellent specific capacity of 837 mA h g(-1).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000802795800002

Among many candidates for oxygen evolution reaction, NiFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH)-based electrocatalysts show the highest activity in an alkaline medium. Unfortunately, the poor electrical conductivity of NiFe-LDH limits its potential as an electrocatalyst, which was often solved by hybridization with conductive carbonaceous materials. However, we find that using carbonaceous materials for anodes has detrimental effects on the stability of AEMWEs at industrially relevant current densities. In this work, a facile monolayer structuring is suggested to overcome low electrical conductivity and improve mass transport without using carbonaceous materials. The monolayer NiFe-LDH deposited on Ni foam showed much better AEMWE performance than conventional bulk NiFe-LDH due to better electrical conductivity and higher hydrophilicity. A high energy conversion efficiency of 72.6% and outstanding stability at a current density of 1 A cm(-2) over 50 h could be achieved without carbonaceous material. This work highlights electrical conductivity and hydrophilicity of catalysts in membrane-electrode-assembly as key factors for high-performance AEMWEs.									7	2	0	0	0	0	8			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000685245800049	34251792

The equations are derived for the current response of a dispersion of catalyst centres supported on a rotating disk by assuming two parallel contributions: one limited by the convective-diffusive transport, and the other by spillover. The spillover contribution arises as a result of the adsorption of active species on the support and surface diffusion towards the catalyst centres. It is assumed that the dissolved concentration of species on the rotating disk surface is homogeneous, which is shown to be better accomplished at high enough rotation rates and small catalyst centres. The Levich equation for a continuous disk electrode appears as a limiting case at high coverages or high spillover. A factor (B-sp/2zF), with well defined physical meaning, can be obtained from rotating disk experiments to characterise quantitatively the influence of the spillover effect on the electrochemical reaction. Examples of application to real systems are shown, including hydrogen oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction over platinum nanoparticles and molecular catalyst centres. It is shown that the rotating disk technique can be used to obtain quantitative information of spillover effects on electrochemical reactions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is still necessary to understand the experimental parameters in the synthesis of these materials and their impacts on electrocatalysis. Thus, this work reports the influence of the solvent on the impregnation of nickel ions into ZIF-67 for the obtention of nickel cobaltites and its impact on the electrocatalytic behavior. The impregnation process was conducted in methanol or ethanol and investigated via infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetry, to understand the different mechanisms of interaction between nickel ions and ZIF- 67. Electrocatalysts were obtained after calcination of the precursors at 350 degrees C in air. Both solvents lead to the formation of nanocomposites. However, the experiments in methanol resulted in the formation of the nanocompouite NiCo2O4/C, while the use of ethanol led to an additional crystalline phase of nickel oxide (NiCo2O4/NiO/C). Measured overpotentials in the alkaline medium were 333 and 341 mV (in KOH 1 M, at j = 10 mA cm(-2)), respectively, for NiCo2O4/NiO/C and NiCo2O4/C. The material's high electrocatalytic performance is related to the high concentration of electroactive sites like Ni3+ and Co3+ ions and the presence of oxygen vacancies. Higher catalytic performance for the NiCo2O4/C nanocomposite was observed at high current densities, related to the low electrode resistance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000752752600001

With the introduction of metal cations, especially Co(II) ion, these weaker hydrogen bonds linked in this bulk HOF of BTC can be easily broken to obtain the ultrathin wire-shaped product, denoted as Co-Fiber. That is mainly for the reason that the divalent cobalt ions with modest polarity exhibit moderate disturbance and destruction to H-bonding networks. Following calcination and phosphatization, abundant HOF-derived porous carbon-coated CoP particles in CoP/NCNT/PC inherit the morphology of Co -Fiber and endow with in-situ formed N-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Initial electrochemical activation of the CoP/NCNT/PC catalyst promotes the formation of the electrocatalytically active species of cobalt oxyhydroxide for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution. The obtained CoP/NCNT/PC composite exhibits an outstanding OER performance with the low overpotential of 282 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), the relatively small Tafel value (103.7 mV dec(-1)), and the long-term durability remaining 90.5% over 10 h. The reasonable and facile method to synthesize low-cost, efficient and robust CoP/NCNT/PC shows great potential to substitute noble-metal based electrocatalysts for OER. Meanwhile, it will provide a new way for the application of HOF-derived carbon nanomaterials in the new energy field.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0008-6223	1873-3891		WOS:000805837400001

A devised synthetic method for uniform dispersion and controlled particle size of catalyst materials could improve the catalytic parameters. We demonstrated a facile, surfactant-free method to immobilize ultrafine iridium oxide (IrOx) nanoparticles over nanosheet-shaped zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) surface of bimetallic Ni/Co-ZIF-67. The optimum Ni/Co atomic ratio (1:6.5) improved the electronic conductivity and the combination with the well-dispersed IrO(x )nanoparticles (average 2.3 nm) provided IrOx@Ni/Co-ZIF-67. The optimized electrode assembly with 2.8 at.% (compared to 1.6 and 6.5 at.%) loading amount of IrO(x )led to superior OER performance. It appeared that catalytic activity correlated to the balanced ratio of metallic Ir-0 and Ir3+ states. The active Ir3+ site coordinated by a hydroxyl group would likely promote the first dehydration step in alkaline media to initiate the catalytic OER, while the metallic Ir stabilizes the Ir3+ state. The desirable large surface area of ultrafine IrO(x )nanoparticles and the evenly controlled Ir-0/Ir3+ species resulted in the high catalytic parameters. Additionally, the close electronic contact at the interface of IrO(x )and conductive Ni/Co-ZIF-67 should provide high catalytic OER performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000848358600002

Due to the dependence of catalytic properties on their composition, size and shape, rational design can improve the utilization efficiency and catalytic performance of iridium oxide for the oxygen evolution reaction. Here we have induced a cube to rod transition in nanostructured iridium oxide (NIO) by tuning the salt to precursor ratio in the molten salt synthesis (MSS) process. Furthermore, we have compared the electrocatalytic performance of these NIOs for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media with that of commercial IrO2 nanoparticles (NPs) and its annealed derivative in terms of specific capacitance, total charge, most accessible charge, electrochemically active surface area, and roughness factor. Our NIOs synthesized using the MSS process showed enhanced electrocatalytic OER activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 media compared to the commercial IrO2 NPs before and after annealing. A facile single-step synthesis of the IrO2 nanocubes and nanorods has been demonstrated and an electrochemical investigation suggested that the IrO2 nanorods exhibit the highest catalytic activities among all NIOs due to their high electrochemically active surface area, low charge transfer coefficient, high current density, high electrochemical stability, high accessibility to active sites and low overpotential, while the annealed commercial IrO2 NPs showed the worst performance. Our studies show a simple, reliable and scalable synthesis method from iridium tetrachloride salt to make shape tunable electrocatalytic NIOs which possess enhanced OER activity compared to commercial samples in acidic media.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000749768000001

The scalable production of nanoscale g-C3N4 with remarkable electron separation efficiency in one-step, green, economic and "bottom-up" approach is of great challenge. Herein, one-dimensional porous architectural g-C3N4 nanorods have been facilely prepared by direct calcination of hydrous melamine nanofibers precipitated from aqueous solution of melamine. Porous morphologies with increased interfacial area enhance light capture capacity and accelerate catalysis reaction. It is noted that oxygen atoms were simultaneously doped into g-C3N4 matrix, which broke the symmetry of pristine g-C3N4, resulting in more effective separation of electron/hole pairs. Thus, the oxygen-doped g-C3N4 nanorods loaded with Pt presented excellent visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in the triethanolamine solution (732 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) and in overall water splitting (29.6 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)), and 2,4-dinitrophenol degradation for O-doped g-C3N4 nanorod (removal efficiency of 100% within 75 min). Subsequently, the visible-light photocatalytic H-2 evolution (96 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) with simultaneous 2,4-dinitrophenol degradation were achieved for Pt@g-C3N4 nanorod. The proposed synthesis strategy overcomes long-standing, stubborn and serious stacking/agglomeration for g-C3N4 synthesis, and paves the pathway for industrial scale-up production of high-performance g-C3N4 and application in practical energy and environment area.									207	10	1	0	28	0	212			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000424960700001

Therefore, it is urgent to develop electrocatalysts with excellent performance and stability to accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reaction kinetics. Herein, a self-supporting binder-free electrocatalyst was successfully prepared using in situ grown Cu(OH)(2) nanowires on CF as the carrier to grow ZIF-67 via a room temperature immersion method. The combination of Cu(OH)(2) nanowires and the unique structure of ZIF-67 forms a three-dimensional nanostructured catalyst, in which the unique structure and the existence of synergy may contribute to a larger electrochemical active surface area, expose more electrochemically active sites, adjust the electronic structure, and accelerate the rate of electron transfer, thus greatly improving the electrocatalytic activity and durability for OER. The as-prepared Cu(OH)(2)@ZIF-67/CF exhibited excellent OER performance under alkaline conditions and required overpotentials of 205 mV and 276 mV to drive current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a small Tafel slope of 70.5 mV dec(-1) for OER. The stability test of Cu(OH)(2)@ZIF-67/CF at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) displayed excellent stability for 22 h. This study provides a feasible strategy for the rapid preparation of low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts in alkaline media.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000647893200001	33960361

Binder-free catalyst containing electrodes were directly tested for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER). The FeSe/NF electrode displayed an OER current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at potential of 1.42 V, and a relatively small Tafel slope of 109 mV dec(-1) in a 1 M KOH solution. Also, FeSe/NF electrode exhibited reasonable HER overpotential of 200 mV at 10 mAcm(-2) current density with Tafel slope of 145 mV dec(-1). The XRD and TEM studies revealed that the formation of heterogeneous interfaces of NiSe2 and FeSe2, generated more active sites that can promote better ions and electron transport in the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Furthermore, HRTEM analysis indicates that FeSe2 rich in Se vacancy defects can be created with suitable M - O and M - H bond for better OER and HER performance, respectively. In a-two electrode alkaline water electrolyzer, current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 50 mA cm(-2) were obtained at cell voltages of 1.52 V and 1.85 V, respectively, using pure FeSe-NF as both the cathode and anode.

This novel approach produces a stable dispersion of crystalline BPQDs with an average lateral size of 2.95 nmand thickness of 3.59 nm. Wedemonstrated that the as-prepared BPQDs can be an efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our BPQDs without any supporting catalyst exhibited an impressive electrocatalytic activity for OER with an overpotential of 450 mV at 10 mA cm 2, whilst the traditional CoOx electrocatalyst showed an overpotential of 480mV. By integrating our BPQDs with CoOx, we achieved an outstanding electrocatalytic OER performance with an overpotential of 360 mV at 10 mA cm 2, a low Tafel slope of 58.5 mV dec 1 and excellent stability, which was even comparable to the commercial IrO2 and RuO2 systems. This work introduces a promising protocol to prepare scalable BPQDs for realworld applications including electrocatalysis.									42	2	0	0	5	0	44			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000471010900003

The CuO electrode self-assembles on a stainless steel substrate via chemical bath deposition at 80 degrees C in a mixed solution of CuSO4 and NH4OH, followed by air annealing treatment, and shows a 2D nanosheet bundle-type morphology. The OER performance is studied in a 1 M KOH solution. The OER starts to occur at about 1.48 V versus the RHE (eta = 250 mV) with a Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(-1) in a 1 M KOH solution. The overpotential (h) of 350 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) is among the lowest compared with other copper-basedmaterials. The catalyst can deliver a stable current density of > 10 mA cm(-2) for more than 10 hours. This superior OER activity is due to its adequately exposed OER favorable 2D morphology and the optimized electronic properties resulting from the thermal treatment.									121	5	0	0	3	0	121			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000404571500010

The size-limiting growth of NiFe-NDs (similar to 4.0 nm in diameter) was realized via the confinement of the 3D flower-like mesoporous structure and the rich N/O functionality of FeCo-NC. Benefiting from the distinctive structure with the simultaneously maximum exposure of both OER and ORR active sites, the NiFe-ND/FeCo-NC composite showed an ORR halfwave potential of 0.85 V and an OER potential of 1.66 V in 0.1 mol L-1 KOH at 10.0 mA cm(-2). In-situ Raman analysis suggested the activity of OER was derived from the Ni sites on NiFe-ND/FeCo-NC. Moreover, the NiFe-ND/FeCo-NC-assembled Zn-air battery (ZAB) exhibited a very small discharge- charge voltage gap of 0.87 V at 20 mA cm(-2) and robust cycling stability. Furthermore, the NiFe-ND/FeCo-NC composite was also applicable for fabricating all-solid-state ZAB to power wearable electronics with superior cycling stability under deformation. Our work could enlighten a new applicable branch of atomically dispersed metal-nitrogen-carbon materials as unique substrates for fabricating multifunctional electrocatalysts.									28	6	0	0	2	0	27			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000525164300001

However, most of the high-activity ORR/OER catalysts can also accelerate side-reactions, such as electrolyte degradation on cycling. To address this issue, we change our strategy from pursuing highly active catalysts to developing stable cathodes that are compatible with the electrolyte. In this work, hierarchical mesoporous ZnO/ZnFe2O4/C (ZZFC) nanocages are synthesized from the templates of metal-organic framework (MOF) nanocages. Such ZZFC nanocages have lower ORR/OER catalytic activity as compared with the widely used catalysts for fuel cells, but they do not catalyze the degradation of organic electrolyte during operation. Furthermore, the optimized porosity and conductivity can fit well the needs of the Li-O-2 cathode. When employed in a Li-O-2 battery, the ZZFC cathode delivers a primary discharge/charge capacity exceeding 11 00 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 300 mA g(-1) and an improved cyclability with capacity of 5000 mAh g(-1) for 15 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance is ascribed to the hierarchical porosity and little degradation of the organic electrolyte.									96	8	0	0	1	0	96			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000353005300062	25689844

However, traditional density-functional-theory-derived d-band theory fails to describe the hydrogen adsorption energy (Delta G(H)) on hollow sites. Herein, by studying the Delta G(H) for a series of Ni-M (M=Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Mo, W) bimetallic alloys, an improved d-band center was provided and a potential NiCu electrocatalyst with a near-optimal Delta G(H) was discovered. Moreover, oxygen atoms were introduced into Ni-M (O-NiM) to balance the adsorption/desorption of hydroxyl species. The tailored electrocatalytic sites for water dissociation can synergistically accelerate the multi-step alkaline HER. The prepared O-NiCu shows the optimum HER activity with a low overpotential of 23 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). This work not only broadens the applicability of d-band theory, but also provides crucial understanding for designing efficient HER electrocatalysts.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000808246800001	35441413

In particular, developing a low cost, environmental benign, robust and stable ORR catalyst still remains a challenging task due to its sluggish kinetics. Here in this work we developed a simple and environmentally green electro-spinning technique for decoration of cobalt oxides (Co3O4) on polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers to generate a hybrid nanostructure of carbon nanofiber- Co3O4 (CNF- Co3O4) during calcinations and employed resultant electrocatalyst towards ORR. The CNF provided active surface to seed as well an anchoring spot for nanocrystals and act as a conducting network. The resulting CNF-Co3O4 hybrid displayed a supeior ORR current density that surpassed bare CNF and occurred via a 4 electron direct reduction pathway. It may due to the as formed heterogeneous interface during the decoration of Co3O4 on CNF leads to enhanced conductivity and thereby decreases ORR overpotential as well as enhanced reaction rate at CNF-Co3O4 surface.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2365-6549			WOS:000471812400044

In this work, a hybrid catalyst composed of MnO/Ni nanoparticles anchored on porous branched nitrogen-doped carbons (MnO/Ni@BNCs) were prepared by direct pyrolyzing melamine foams containing Mn(II) and Ni (II) ions at 800 degrees C under N-2 atmosphere. On the basis of electrochemical tests, it was found that the MnO/Ni@BNCs hybrid catalyst showed a high efficient four-electron catalytic pathway towards ORR and gave a low yield of H2O2 (< 7.53%). It also exhibited a good catalytic stability and methanol tolerance, exceeding the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The excellent catalytic performance was attributed to the synergetic effect between high catalytic activity of MnO and high electrical conductivity of Ni. Furthermore, the high surface area and porous structure characters of carbon support, which partially inherited the microstructure of melamine foam, also benefited the electron transfer and reactive species transformation during ORR process.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2365-6549			WOS:000402286000011

Fabrication of high-efficiency and robust water oxidation is essential to realize wide-scale artificial photosynthesis. Here, we report an efficient strategy to improve the water oxidation activity of iridium oxide by a nitrogen-coordination method. Due to the coordination effect, the iridium oxide can be well dispersed to generate ultra-small nanoparticles and the intrinsic activity can be improved for the water oxidation reaction. This study suggests that high-performance water oxidation catalysts can be constructed based on a nitrogen-coordination strategy.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000592648700029	33179640

However, ambient NRR is severely challenged by the lack of active electrocatalysts and a serious competition between hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and NRR. Herein, we report a low-cost, oxygen-deficient, and multivalent vanadium oxide (mVO(x)) nanosheets mixed with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as an active electrocatalyst for NRR. The testing results show a high ammonia yield of 18.84 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1) and a remarkable faradaic efficiency of 16.97% at -0.35 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in a neutral 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The outstanding performance is correlated by theoretical calculations to the hydrophilicity and high concentration of oxygen vacancies in mVO(x), which promote nitrogen/water activation and lower the energy barrier for NRR. The presented insights of tailoring hydrophilicity via defect engineering are expected to significantly influence future designs of high-performance NRR electrocatalysts.									28	1	0	0	2	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000526703800009

This study improves the electrochemical and corrosion performance of the coating for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution in alkaline water-splitting electrolysis through the use during electrodeposition of a sacrificial stainless-steel counter electrode. Analysis using energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the although the elemental make-up is largely similar, the morphology is transformed. Through measurements of the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) after long-term intermittent ageing it was found that the surface area was increased by a factor of six. Assessments and comparisons of the electrochemical performance using 3-electrode chronopotentiometry confirm this is one of the most active bifunctional coatings known. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The characterization of the catalyst by X-ray diffractometry and transmission electron microscopy confirms the formation of a single-phase, 3-dimensional, ordered mesoporous CuCo2O4 structure. The as-prepared CuCo2O4 nanoparticles possess a high specific surface area of 97.1 m(2) g(-1) and a spinel crystalline structure. Cyclic voltammetry demonstrates that mesoporous CuCo2O4 catalyst enhances the kinetics for either oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Li-O-2 battery utilizing 3DOM CuCo2O4 shows a higher specific capacity of 7456 mAh g, than that with pure Ketjen black (KB). Moreover, the CuCo2O4-based electrode enables much enhanced cyclability with a 610 mV smaller discharge recharge voltage gap than that of the carbon-only cathode at a current rate of 100 mA g(-1). Such excellent catalytic performance of CuCo2O4 could be associated with its larger surface area and 3D ordered mesoporous structure. The excellent electrochemical performances coupled with its facile and cost-effective way will render the 3D mesoporous CuCo2O4 nanostructures as attractive electrode materials for promising application in Li-O-2 batteries.

Herein, Pd/NiFeOx nanosheets are synthesized with tightly arranged petal nanosheets and uniform mesoporous structure on nickel foam (NF). The porous 2D structure yields a larger surface area and exposes more active sites, facilitating water splitting at all pH values. The overpotential of Pd/NiFeOx nanosheets for OER is only 180, 169, and 310 mV in 1 m KOH, 0.5 m H2SO4, and 1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) conditions at 10 mA cm(-2) current density, as well as excellent HER activity with ultralow overpotential in a wide pH range. When using porous Pd/NiFeOx nanosheets as bifunctional catalysts for water splitting, it just required a cell voltage of 1.57 V to reach a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) with nearly 100% faradic efficiency in alkaline conditions, which is much lower than that of benchmark Pt/CRuO2 (1.76 V) couples, along with the improving stability benefiting from the good corrosion resistance of the inner NiFeOx nanosheets.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000696457700001

Appropriate surface engineering of non-noble metal electrocatalysts is essential for tuning their electrocatalytic properties. Herein, MnCoP nanosheets are designed and constructed by doping Mn into CoP via direct one-step electrodeposition on carbon cloth. Doping Mn can not only modify the surface electronic structure of CoP, but also enhance electrochemical surface areas (ECSA) to expose more accessible active sites, and increase the intrinsic activity for HER and OER. As a result, the electrocatalyst reasonably shows superior catalytic performance: the overpotential is as low as 65 mV for HER and 261 mV for OER in 1 M KOH solutions to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), along with outstanding stability benefited from the strong affinity between the catalyst and CC substrate. The electrolyzer cell for overall water splitting, using MnCoP/CC as both anode and cathode catalysts, exhibits a very low voltage of 1.62 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent long-term durability within 24 h. This study offers a general method to produce high-performance and cost-effectiveness catalysts for water splitting and other catalytic fields.									79	2	0	0	1	0	80			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000525637300089

Traditional optimization methods to control nanocrystal attributes such as size typically rely upon one variable at a time (OVAT) methods that are not only time and labor intensive but also lack the ability to identify higher-order interactions between experimental variables that affect target outcomes. Herein, we demonstrate that a statistical design of experiments (DoE) approach can optimize the synthesis of CoNi2S4 nanocrystals, allowing for control over the responses of nanocrystal size, size distribution, and isolated yield. After implementing a 2(5-2) fractional factorial design, the statistical screening of five different experimental variables identified temperature, Co:Ni precursor ratio, Co:thiol ratio, and their higher-order interactions as the most critical factors in influencing the aforementioned responses. Second-order design with a Doehlert matrix yielded polynomial functions used to predict the reaction parameters needed to individually optimize all three responses. A multiobjective optimization, allowing for the simultaneous optimization of size, size distribution, and isolated yield, predicted the synthetic conditions needed to achieve a minimum nanocrystal size of 6.1 nm, a minimum polydispersity (sigma/(d) over bar) of 10%, and a maximum isolated yield of 99%, with a desirability of 96%. The resulting model was experimentally verified by performing reactions under the specified conditions. Our work illustrates the advantage of multivariate experimental design as a powerful tool for accelerating control and optimization in nanocrystal syntheses.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000665748900018	33877801

Herein, metal-organic frameworks template-derived porous carbon/NiFeP nanosheets (denoted as C/NiFeP NSs) that interconnect into open hierarchical flower-like nanoarchitectures, are synthesized through a hydrothermal method and subsequent phosphorization at low temperature. The carbon frameworks derived from the pyrolysis of terephthalic acid not only enhance the electrical conductivity but also provide the robust flexible skeleton for anchoring NiFeP to form heterojunction, thus improving the charge transfer capacity and stability. Merited by the cooperative effect of carbon, interface, porous nature, and synergistic effect of Ni and Fe, the obtained nanostructure possesses superior the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction performance. Importantly, an alkaline electrolysis cell assembled with C/NiFeP NSs as both cathode and anode could reach 10 mA cm(-2) at a low voltage of 1.54 V, which is lower than most of the values currently achievable for non-precious metal electrocatalysts. Moreover, this cell also exhibits stable operation for 20 h.

Herein, we prepared nitrogen-doped carbon-incorporated CoP@Fe-CoP core-shelled nanorod arrays grown on Ni foam (CoP@Fe-CoP/ NC/NF) through phosphorization of ZIF-67@Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue (ZIF-67@CoFe-PBA). The hierarchical nanorod arrays combined with the core-shelled structure offer favorable mass/electron transport capacity and maximize the active sites, thus enhancing the electrochemically active surface area. The synergistic effect of the bimetallic components and the nitrogen-doped carbon matrix endow the composite with an optimized electronic structure. Benefiting from the above superiorities of morphological and chemical compositions, this self-supported CoP@Fe-CoP/NC/NF heterostructure can drive alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with overpotentials of 97 and 270 mV to yield 100 mA cm(-2), respectively.

This strategy is based on the direct formation of active catalytic material on the electrode surface during electrolysis. In our case, cobalt hydroxides (-Co(OH)(2) and CoO(OH) for HER and OER, respectively) in a carbon matrix are produced by the chemical and electrochemical transformation of various forms (glass, glass-ceramic and polycrystalline) of Na4Co3(PO4)(2)P2O7 during electrolysis in 1 M NaOH solution. The CoOx(OH)(y)/C composites demonstrate remarkable stability over time (more than 50 h), and bifunctional catalytic activity with an overall water splitting potential close to 1.8 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The range of overpotentials for OER and HER is 346-365 and 326-369 mV, respectively. These electrodes can invert the OER and HER processes with a total overpotential of 0.6 V in the cell. This remarkable CoO(OH) Co(OH)(2) inversion in the carbon matrix its further utility for creating bifunctional electrodes for long-life water splitting cells.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000450208000010	30346012

Iridium (Ir)-integrated titanium nitride nanowires (Ir-TiN NWs) for bifunctional catalytic activities are demonstrated. To expose real electrocatalytic activity, the Ir-TiN catalysts are characterized in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) computations by a wide range of spectroscopic and electrochemical systems. Impressively, Ir-TiN NWs electrocatalysts grown from titanium dioxide nanoparticles, which are capable of delivering quick hydrogen (H-2) evaluation with least over-potentials of 93mV for 10mAcm(-2) in neutral medium. In addition, this efficient Ir-TiN NWs delivers outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction with smaller over-potential of 49mV for 10mAcm(-2) in acid medium. Overall, the study highlights a novel, extremely energetic bifunctional catalyst; it proposes novel imperative perceptions into the structure and performance of bimetallic nitride electrocatalysts in wide range pH environments.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2699-9412			WOS:000783854600003

In this work, efficient TMSe@MOF-5 catalysts were synthesized by in situ incorporation of presynthesized transition-metal selenide nanoparticles (MnSe, FeSe, CoSe, NiSe, CuSe, and ZnSe) into MOF-5 at room temperature. All the synthesized composites were successfully characterized by powder x-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, elemental mapping, and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry. Among various TMSe@MOF-5/NF working electrodes, MnSe@MOF-5/NF showed higher OER catalytic activity, requiring an overpotential of only 170 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline medium with a Tafel slope of 61 mV dec(-1), which is superior to many other reported OER catalysts including state-of-the-art RuO2 (n(10) = 290 mV). It is believed that the higher OER activity of MnSe@MOF-5/NF is due to the formation of a heterojunction from Ni of the nickel foam to the MnSe@MOF-5 at the surface of the working electrode.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1047-4838	1543-1851		WOS:000492584100002

Here, we conducted a theoretic study to propose the use of subsurface oxygen vacancies in anatase TiO2(101) for photocatalytic water-splitting, aiming to combine both high activity and stability. This study demonstrates that subsurface defects expand light-harvesting ability of TiO2 to the visible light region and facilitate photogenerated charge separation, and these results were then verified by experiments. These vacancies also bestow high catalytic activity on sites of water adsorption and oxidation above them on the defect-free surface. Importantly, subsurface defects are inert toward reactive oxygen species, ensuring high stability for the nearby surface catalytic sites. These results demonstrate the role of subsurface oxygen vacancies in catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction, leading to a new design strategy for photocatalytic or catalytic oxide materials.									19	2	0	0	3	0	20			1932-7447			WOS:000440956200024

However, there are still some challenges in the tuning of metal-free electrocatalysts and in understanding the roles of various nitrogen species in their electrocatalytic performance. Herein, we design a covalent triazine framework (CTF)-based material as an effective metal-free bifunctional electrocatalyst. We chose BINOL-CN (2,2'-dihydroxy-[1,1'-binaphthalene]-6,6'-dicarbonitrile) as both a carbon and a nitrogen source for the fabrication of N-containing CTF-based materials. Four BINOL-CTFs with varying N-functionalities (pyridinic-N/triazine-N, pyrrolic-N, quaternary-N, and pyridine-N-oxide) were successfully obtained. These materials were evaluated in the ORR and the HER in basic and acidic conditions, respectively. The best material has an onset potential of 0.793 V and a half-wave potential of 0.737 V, and it follows first-order kinetics in a 4e(-) pathway in the ORR reaction. The same material shows an impressive HER activity with an overpotential of 0.31 V to achieve 10 mA/cm(2) and a small Tafel slope of 41 mV/dec, which is comparable to 31 mV/dec for Pt/C, making it a potential bifunctional electrocatalyst. We showed that the ORR and HER reactivity of CTF-based materials depends exclusively on the amount of quaternary-N species and on the available surface area and pore volume. This work highlights the engineering of CTF materials with varying amounts of N species as high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000579956100028	32897044

Flexible zinc-air batteries using quasi-solid gel electrolytes are considered a potential candidate because of their high energy density, long-term durability and safety. In this work, spinel NiCo2O4 is employed as the bifunctional catalyst for fabricating flexible zinc-air batteries. Electrochemical measurements in both the three-electrode and full-cell configurations indicate a good bifunctionality for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The flexible zinc-air batteries are assembled using a gel electrolyte consisting of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and 6 M KOH. A simple method for preparing the gel electrolyte is reported to maintain a high water content within the gel, which is the key factor facilitating the high discharge rate of flexible zinc-air batteries. The optimal flexible battery can be discharged at a large current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for 5 min and reaches a capacity of 37 mAh cm(-2) and a maximum power density of 64 mW cm(-2). The origin of the decayed charge/discharge behavior and cell failure is investigated by the three-electrode chronopotentiometry and post-mortem X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. ZnO precipitation is considered the main reason for the decay of both zinc and air electrodes. The good flexibility during cycling is also demonstrated by a continuous bending test, revealing its potential for practical applications.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000710691400001		
J	Tennie, A; Hoffbauer, R; Hoernes, S								The oxygen isotope fractionation behaviour of kyanite in experiment and nature								CONTRIBUTIONS TO MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY				133	4			346	355		10.1007/s004100050457				DEC 1998	1998	The oxygen isotope fractionation between kyanite and calcium carbonate has been investigated experimentally at four temperatures in the range between 625 and 775 degrees C at 13 kbar. Because of low exchange rates, the isotopic reaction was enhanced by polymorphic transformation of andalusite to kyanite. With this experimental modification a close approach to equilibrium was reached in all runs. The temperature dependence of the equilibrium fractionation is described by the equation 1000 ln alpha(ky-cc) = -2.62 x 10(6)/T-2. Application of the experimental results to natural quartz-kyanite-garnet assemblages indicates the preservation of the oxygen isotope composition of kyanite acquired during its formation, reflecting its extremely low oxygen diffusivity. This refractory behaviour restricts the use of kyanite for thermometry but opens the possibility to use its O-isotope composition as an indicator for recognition of polymetamorphic rock histories and reconstruction of the prograde evolution of a metamorphic sequence.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			0010-7999			WOS:000077854300003

To replace the rare and expensive noble metal electrocatalysts, developing nonprecious metal SACs (NPMSACs) with superior electrocatalytic activity and stability is of paramount importance for achieving high efficiency in CRR and HER. Herein, a brief overview of recent achievements in the carbon-rich NPMSACs for both CRR and HER is provided. The synthesis strategies and corresponding electrocatalytic performances of various carbon-rich NPMSACs are discussed in the order of various metals (Ni, Co, Fe, Zn, and Sn for CRR, as well as Ni, Co, Fe, Mo, and W for HER), with a special attention paid to understand the structure-activity relationships. Finally, the remaining challenges and future perspectives for enhancing CRR and HER performance of NPMSACs are outlined.									119	13	0	0	6	0	118			2366-9608			WOS:000490288400002

IrO2, as a commercial electrocatalyst for the anode side of a PEM water electrolyzer, can both overcome the high corrosion conditions and exhibit efficient catalytic performance. However, the high consumption of Ir species cannot meet the sustainable development and economic requirements of this technology. Accordingly, it is necessary to understand the OER catalytic mechanisms for Ir species, further designing new types of low-iridium catalysts with high activity and stability to replace IrO2. In this review, we first summarize the related catalytic mechanisms of the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and then provide general methods for measuring the catalytic performance of materials. Second, we present the structural evolution results of crystalline IrO2 and amorphous IrOx using in situ characterization techniques under catalytic conditions to understand the common catalytic characteristics of the materials and the possible factors affecting the structural evolution characteristics. Furthermore, we focus on three types of common low-iridium catalysts, including heteroatom-doped IrO2 (IrOx)-based catalysts, perovskite-type iridium-based catalysts, and pyrochlore-type iridium-based catalysts, and try to correlate the structural features with the intrinsic catalytic performance of materials. Finally, at the end of the review, we present the unresolved problems and challenges in this field in an attempt to develop effective strategies to further balance the catalytic activity and stability of materials under acidic OER catalytic conditions.

In this work, the controlled growth of Co2P NAs on the surface of a MXene (Ti3C2Tx)-modified self-supporting electrode is demonstrated as a competent and reliable bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient water splitting. The heterointerface in Co2P@Ti3C2Tx with an optimized adsorption free energy of H*, H2O, and better conductivity can give enhanced HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) activity, with a low overpotential (42 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2). Additionally, the OER (oxygen evolution reaction) activity has also been similarly strengthened by the synergy of Co2P and MXene with an overpotential of 267 mV to arrive at 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the excellent bifunctional electrode (Co2P@Ti3C2Tx parallel to Co2P@Ti3C2Tx) exhibits efficient engineering water-splitting performance (1.46 V@10 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline solution. This simple design can propose a promising approach to exploit precious-metal-free catalysts for energy conversion.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			1948-7185			WOS:000657347700010	33999628

The ORR diffusion limiting current density and OER current density at 1.0 versus (Ag/AgCl)/V are 6.32 and 45.82 mA cm(-2) at 1600 rpm in alkaline solution, respectively, indicating that dandelion-like alpha-MnO2-HS catalyst exhibits superior bifunctional catalytic activity. The Li-O-2 batteries with alpha-MnO2-HS catalyst can yield high initial discharge specific capacity of 7897.6 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1). Moreover, the cycle life of Li-O-2 batteries with alpha-MnO2-HS catalyst is significantly improved and can sustain 108 cycles. These results indicate that as-fabricated hollow sphere structure without adding any hard templates is favorable for superior bifunctional catalytic activity in aqueous and non-aqueous electrolyte.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000440287100038

The methylcyclopropyl radical is known to rearrange on the nanosecond time scale, providing us with a means of probing for radical formation. Surprisingly, no rearrangement occurs subsequent to C-Br bond dissociation, which commences at similar to 220 K. Instead, displacement of bromine by oxygen occurs to yield adsorbed methylcyclopropoxide, which is identified using infrared spectroscopy. The C-O bond of methylcyclopropoxide is cleaved at similar to 400 K to yield a transient methylcyclopropyl radical. As shown previously, the methylcyclopropyl radical rearranges and the ring-opened butenyl species is trapped on the surface. Addition to oxygen yields 3-buten-1-oxy and addition to the metal affords the butenyl-Mo moiety. Infrared spectroscopy is used to identify these intermediates. The same linear species are formed from the reaction of 4-bromo-1-butenc. The 3-buten-1-oxy species is also formed from reactions of 3-buten-1-ol on O-covered Mo(1 1 0). Upon further heating, the 3-buten-1-oxy reacts to form 1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, water, and dihydrogen between 450 and 600 K. Ethene is also evolved at similar to 560 K. The primary mechanism for ethene evolution is elimination from metal-bound butenyl. Carbon monoxide is also formed above 900 K, due to reaction of surface carbon and oxygen. The implications of our results for studies where alkyl halides are used as models for radical reactions on surfaces are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

This work is focused on the performance evolution of FSDC20 in CLHG with Fe2O3/CeO2 (FSDC0) as comparison, and the related mechanisms are explored. The results show that the evolution of H-2 yield with redox cycles for both samples contain an activation and an attenuation process, and the fourth cycle acts as the demarcation point for FSDC20 before the H-2 yield stabilizes. Specifically, the activation mainly lie in the phase transition from Fe3O4 to FeO, and the activation and attenuation processes can be ascribed to the particle microstructure evolution. For the activation process in the first four cycles, the grains on the particle aggregate together, however, with porous structure, and the improved reactivity can be attributed to the enhanced interaction between Fe2O3 and CeO2 as well as the generation of CeFeO3. However, the grains continue to aggregate on a large scale after the fourth cycle, leading to serious sintering and thus the attenuation process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000700947100001

However, it is both diffuse and intermittent, which presents problems regarding how best to harvest this energy and store it for times when the sun is not shining. Devices that use sunlight to split water into hydrogen and oxygen could be one solution to these problems, because hydrogen is an excellent fuel. However, if such devices are to become widely adopted, they must be cheap to produce and operate. Therefore, the development of electrocatalysts for water splitting that comprise only inexpensive, earth-abundant elements is critical. In this Review, we investigate progress towards such electrocatalysts, with special emphasis on how they might be incorporated into photoelectrocatalytic water-splitting systems and the challenges that remain in developing these devices.									1963	92	0	0	111	2	1980				2397-3358		WOS:000401918900003

Here, by simply calcining the mixture of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and sodium borohydride in an inert atmosphere, boron dopants and nitrogen defects are simultaneously introduced into g-C3N4. The resultant boron-doped and nitrogen-deficient g-C3N4 exhibits excellent activity for photocatalytic oxygen evolution, with highest oxygen evolution rate reaching 561.2 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), much higher than previously reported g-C3N4. It is well evidenced that with conduction and valence band positions substantially and continuously tuned by the simultaneous introduction of boron dopants and nitrogen defects into g-C3N4, the band structures are exceptionally modulated for both effective optical absorption in visible light and much increased driving force for water oxidation. Moreover, the engineered electronic structure creates abundant unsaturated sites and induces strong interlayer C-N interaction, leading to efficient electron excitation and accelerated charge transport. In the present work, a facile approach is successfully demonstrated to engineer the electronic structures and the band structures of g-C3N4 with simultaneous introduction of dopants and defects for high-performance photocatalytic oxygen evolution, which can provide informative principles for the design of efficient photocatalysis systems for solar energy conversion.									315	19	0	0	41	0	317			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000486340700001	31518015

However, until now this class of catalysts has been limited by its long-term performance, as a result of compositional and morphological instabilities of the NPs. In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful technique for understanding morphological and compositional evolution under controlled conditions. It is of great importance to study the evolution of the morphology and elemental distribution in bimetallic NPs and their interaction with the support in reducing and oxidizing treatments at the atomic scale for the rational design of catalysts. Here, we use in situ TEM to follow dynamic changes in the NP morphology, faceting and elemental segregation under working conditions in previously unreported Pt-Ni core-shell octahedral structures. We follow changes in the Pt-Ni catalyst from a segregated structure to an alloyed shell configuration and then a more spherical structure as a function of temperature under reducing conditions. Exposure to an oxidizing environment then leads to oxidation of the C support, while the spherical NPs undergo a cycle of transformations into cubic NPs followed by the reaction to spherical NPs. The formation of the cubic NPs results from CO formation during C oxidation, before it is finally oxidized to CO2. Our observations may pave the way towards the design of optimized structure-stability electrocatalysts and highlight the importance of TEM visualization of degradation and transformation pathways in bimetallic Pt-Ni NPs under reducing and oxidizing conditions.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000451738900044	30426121	
J	Berndt, D								Valve-regulated lead-acid batteries								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				100	1-2	SI		29	46		10.1016/S0378-7753(01)00881-3				NOV 30 2001	2001	Valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries with gelled electrolyte appeared as a niche market during the 1950s. During the 1970s, when glass-fiber felts became available as a further method to immobilize the electrolyte, the market for VRLA batteries expanded rapidly. The immobilized electrolyte offers a number of obvious advantages including the internal oxygen cycle which accommodates the overcharging current without chemical change within the cell. It also suppresses acid stratification and thus opens new fields of application. VRLA batteries, however, cannot be made completely seated, but require a valve for gas escape, since hydrogen evolution and grid corrosion are unavoidable secondary reactions. These reactions result in water loss, and also must be balanced in order to ensure proper charging of both electrodes. Both secondary reactions have significant activation energies, and can reduce the service life of VRLA batteries, operated at elevated temperature. This effect can be aggravated by the comparatively high heat generation caused by the internal oxygen cycle during overcharging. Temperature control of VRLA batteries, therefore, is important in many applications. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Herein, we report heteroatom Fe-incorporated Ni5P4 (Fe-NiP) as an excellent bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that heteroatom Fe effectively steers the electronic structure of Ni(5)P4, which optimizes the hydrogen adsorption behavior. Additionally, the hierarchical conductive framework of Fe-NiP contributes to abundant active sites. Thus, the Fe-NiP catalyst shows robust performance with enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity. As a good bifunctional catalyst, it demands low overpotentials of 144 and 223 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively. Considering the good bifunctional activity, an outstanding electrolyzer has been successfully assembled, which is superior to the benchmark of a RuO2 (+)//Pt/C(-) electrolyzer. This study sheds light on steering the electronic structure of electrocatalysts through a heteroatom modulation strategy.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000814199800001	35675572

F anions with strong electronegativity are predicted to enhance this transformation. Herein, a fluorine-anion doping route is proposed to convert the well-latticed NiMoO4@MNF to amorphous F-NiMoO4@MNF by a facile and versatile molten salt strategy. The well-defined nanorod arrays guarantee abundant exposed active sites, rapid mass transfer, and fast gas bubble release. Moreover, the emerged loose amorphous structure is conducive to the dynamic migration of F species and effective penetration of the electrolyte; therefore, the resulting exchange between F and hydroxide anions induces the formation of an active oxy(hydroxide) layer, thus finally optimizing the electronic structure and absorption/desorption energy on the surface of F-NiMoO4@MNF. The boosted OER performance of reconstructed F-NiMoO4@MNF is reliably confirmed by a low overpotential of 188 mV at 50 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 33.8 mV dec(-1), and favorable long-term stability. In addition, accelerated hydrogen evolution is observed, which is ascribed to the finely tuned electron distribution. This work would provide a new reconstruction route assisted by F-anion doping to the development of high-performance catalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	7			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000679917500068	34264054

In this work, a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts of based on ultrafine CoFe alloy (4-5 nm) dispersed in defects enriched hollow porous Co-N-doped carbons, made by annealing SiO(2)coated zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) encapsulated Fe ions. The hollow porous structure not only exposed the active sites inside ZIF-67, but also provided efficient charge and mass transfer. The strong synergetic coupling among high-density CoFe alloys and Co-N(x)sites in Co, N-doped carbon species ensures high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. First-principles simulations reveal that the synergistic promotion effect between CoFe alloy and Co-N site effectively reduced the formation energy of from O* to OH*. The optimized CoFe-Co@PNC exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic stability and activity with the overpotential of only 320 mV for OER at 10 mA center dot cm(-2)and the half-wave potential of 0.887 V for ORR, outperforming that of most recent reported bifunctional electrocatalysts. A rechargeable ZAB constructed with CoFe-Co@PNC as the air cathode displays long-term cyclability for over 200 h and high power density (152.8 mW center dot cm(-2)). Flexible solid-state ZAB with our CoFe-Co@PNC as the air cathode possesses a high open circuit potential (OCP) up to 1.46 V as well as good bending flexibility. This universal structure design provides an attractive and instructive model for the application of nanomaterials derived from MOF in the field of sustainable flexible energy applications device.									50	7	0	0	2	0	51			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000578954300002

In this work, the synthesis of Co-based multi-metal borides nanochains with amorphous structure is reported for boosting the oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) by one-pot NaBH4 reduction of Co2+, Ni2+, and Fe2+ under ambient temperature. In all the investigated Co-based metal borides, NiCoFeB nanochains show the excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 284 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1), respectively, together with excellent catalytic stability, and robust HER performance with an overpotential of 345 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the excellent electrocatalytic performance is mainly attributed to optimal electronic structure by tuning the Co-3d band activities by the incorporation of Ni and Fe for enhanced water splitting via the potentially existed Co-0 state. Moreover, the electrolyzer using NiCoFeB nanochains as anode and cathode offers 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.81 V, comparable to commercial Pt/C // Ir/C, providing a simple method to design and explore highly efficient and cheap bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									110	7	0	0	5	0	110			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000454953900013	30515971

Two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide nanosheets have proven to be effective electrocatalysts, especially in hydrogen evolution reactions. However, MoS2 has been less researched as a potential electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The introduction of vanadium atoms by chemical doping significantly increases the ORR activity of the MoS2 nanosheets, which is greatly improved compared to the bulk MoS2. The vanadium heteroatoms can not only change the electrical properties and band structure of the pristine materials, but also provide a rich active site for the catalysis.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000459941000056

A key challenge is the ability to control the surface catalytic sites in terms of the alloying composition, thermochemical treatment and phase in correlation with the catalytic properties. Herein we show novel findings of the nanoscale evolution of surface catalytic sites on thermochemically-tuned gold-palladium nanoalloys by probing CO adsorption and oxidation using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) technique. In addition to the bimetallic composition and the support, the surface sites are shown to depend strongly on the thermochemical treatment condition, demonstrating that the ratio of three-fold vs. bridge or atop Pd sites is greatly reduced by thermochemical treatment under hydrogen in comparison with that under oxygen. This type of surface reconstruction is further supported by synchrotron high-energy X-ray diffraction coupled to atomic pair distribution function (HE-XRD/PDF) analysis of the nanoalloy structure, revealing an enhanced degree of random alloying for the catalysts thermochemically treated under hydrogen. The nanoscale alloying and surface site evolution characteristics were found to correlate strongly with the catalytic activity of CO oxidation. These findings have significant implications for the nanoalloy-based design of catalytic synergy.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000426148500032	29417115

The temporal evolution of the droplet's chemical composition and size is monitored by Raman spectroscopy and elastic light scattering, respec-tively. The dependencies on the oxygen amount in the surrounding gas phase (similar to 0-20%), the droplet size (similar to 500-3000 nm in radius), and the laser power and wavelength are investigated. The oxygen amount and the droplet size have only a very minor influence on the reaction rate, if at all. By contrast, the reaction becomes substantially faster at higher laser power and shorter wavelength. The experimental observations indicate that mechanisms involving the photoexcitation of oleic acid are the dominant pathways. Our study reveals that direct photodegradation has to be accounted for when using optical traps or applying spectroscopic and light scattering characterization methods to study aerosol particles that contain fatty acids.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0021-8502	1879-1964		WOS:000591602400002

In this context, two-dimensional (2D) materials are attracting enormous interest as potential advanced photo(electro)catalysts and, recently, 2D group-IVA metal monochalcogenides have been theoretically predicted to be water splitting photocatalysts. In this work, we use density functional theory calculations to theoretically investigate the photocatalytic activity of single-/few-layer GeSe nanoflakes for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in pH conditions ranging from 0 to 14. Our simulations show that GeSe nanoflakes with different thickness can be mixed in the form of nanoporous films to act as nanoscale tandem systems, in which the flakes, depending on their thickness, can operate as HER- and/or OER photocatalysts. On the basis of theoretical predictions, we report the first experimental characterization of the photo(electro)catalytic activity of single-/few-layer GeSe flakes in different aqueous media, ranging from acidic to alkaline solutions: 0.5 M H2SO4 (pH 0.3), 1 M KCl (pH 6.5), and 1 M KOH (pH 14). The films of the GeSe nanoflakes are fabricated by spray coating GeSe nanoflakes dispersion in 2-propanol obtained through liquid-phase exfoliation of synthesized orthorhombic (Pnma) GeSe bulk crystals. The PEC properties of the GeSe nanoflakes are used to design PEC-type photodetectors, reaching a responsivity of up to 0.32 AW(-1) (external quantum efficiency of 86.3%) under 455 nm excitation wavelength in acidic electrolyte. The obtained performances are superior to those of several self-powered and low-voltage solution-processed photodetectors, approaching that of self-powered commercial UV-Vis photodetectors. The obtained results inspire the use of 2D GeSe in proof-of-concept water photoelectrolysis cells.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000586868400036	32960559

In this study, we demonstrate two catalysts prepared via pyrolysis of Polyaniline and Vinazene with carbon. Their excellent Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities and potential cycling stability were confirmed using thin film rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) in 0.1M KOH and 0.1M HClO4. Structural-performance correlation analysis confirms that not only graphitic nitrogen is responsible for high ORR, but also other nitrogen functions including pyrrolic one. However, catalyst that is rich in graphitic-N shows more stability especially in acidic medium. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The specific OER activity is substantially increased by 16 times from 0.02 mA cm(BET)(-2) for pure Co3O4 to 0.32 mA cm(BET)(-2) for x = 1 at an overpotential of 0.4 V and exhibits a strong correlation with the amount of Ni ions in the +3 oxidation state. X-ray spectroscopic study reveals that inclusion of Ni3+ ions upshifts the occupied valence band maximum (VBM) by 0.27 eV toward the Fermi level (E-F), and creates a new hole (unoccupied) state located similar to 1 eV above the E-F. Such electronic features favor the adsorption of OH surface intermediates on NixCo3-xO4, resulting in enhanced OER. Furthermore, the emerging hole state effectively reduces the energy barrier for electron transfer from 1.19 to 0.39 eV, and thereby improves the kinetics for OER. The electronic structure features that lead to a higher OER in NixCo3-xO4 can be extended to other transition metal oxides for rational design of highly active catalysts.									53	2	0	0	3	0	53			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000487859200056

Herein, we designed a one-step carbonization strategy for synthesizing monodispersed Co nanoparticles supported on N-doped carbon nanotube (Co/CNT), which shows excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance with long-term durability for oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction. The formation of car-bon substrates from the carbonization of nitrogenous organic molecules are benefit to capture more Co nanoparticles though strong metal-substrate interaction, then construct high-density effective active sites of the Lewis base for accelerating the electrocatalytic reaction process. To verify its superior performance, a rechargeable Zn-air battery with a Co/CNT air electrode was subsequently constructed. The battery exhibits an open-circuit voltage of 1.41 V and a specific discharge capacity of 835.2 mAh/gZn, which can be continuously charged and discharged with good cycle stability. Our study provides a new strategy for developing various practical carbon-based non-noble metallic bifunctional electrocatalysts with promising performance in electrocatalysis and batteries to achieve the target of carbon neutrality.

Herein, an efficient and stable MoS2-Ti3C2 MXene electrocatalyst is synthesized using a delicately designed one-step hydrothermal method, in which the few-layers thick, edge-oriented, high-percentage 1T'phase (similar to 85.0 %) MoS2 nanosheets are well grown on the cation-modified Ti3C2 MXene and stabilize Ti3C2 MXene against spontaneous oxidation caused by dissolved-oxygen. The structure and phase engineering of MoS2 as well as the fully surface-shielding Ti3C2 MXene endow the as-synthesized MoS2-Ti3C2 MXene electrocatalyst with a wealth of accessible active sites and high electrical conductivity for HER together with excellent structure stability. Consequently, the as-synthesized MoS2-Ti3C2 MXene exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic HER performance in acidic medium with a low overpotential of 98 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a depressed Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1) and a low electrochemical resistance.									55	2	0	0	6	0	56			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000623587800001

However, such catalysts often suffer from high overpotential and sluggish kinetics in both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). In this study, a hybrid catalyst made of iron-doped cobalt phosphide (Fe-CoP) nanowire arrays and Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets is introduced that displays strong electronic interactions at the interface, which significantly improves the interfacial reactivity of reactants and/or intermediates with the hybrid catalyst surface. The combined experimental and theoretical study further confirms that the hybrid catalyst promotes the sluggish rate-limiting steps in both the HER and OER. Full water electrolysis is thus enabled to take place at such a low cell voltage as 1.52 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) along with superior durability and high conversion efficiency.									45	0	0	0	2	0	45			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000646563500001

During the oxygen evolution reaction process, the over potential is 269 mA at the current density of 50 mA cm-2 and the Tafel slope is 97 mV dec-1. It also realizes the stable long-term electrocatalysis of methanol to formate under high current density and maintains a relatively high Faraday efficiency of 100%. Meanwhile, the energy saving is higher than 10% in the methanol oxidation and co-hydrogen production system that achieves great attention. The superior performance of NiFe.P@NiCo-LDH/CC bifunctional electrocatalysts might be beneficial from the interaction to Ni and Fe bimetallic extranuclear electrons that exposes more active sites.

Herein, we report a proof-of-concept strategy for creating an exposed and embedding interface model by constructing a unique Co9S8 core with a full WS2 shell (Co9S8/FWS2) and a half WS2 shell (Co9S8/HWS2) to uncover the synergistic effect of heterointerfaces on the catalytic performances. Tailoring the heteroepitaxial growth of WS2 shell, Co9S8/HWS2 with exposed Co-S-W interfaces leads to the exceptional electron density changes on edged-S atoms with large amounts of lone-pair electrons. Meanwhile, the unique Co9S8/HWS2 could accelerate the kinetic adsorption of hydrogen- and oxygen-containing intermediates. Such Co9S8/HWS2 electrocatalysts show extremely low overpotentials of 78 and 290 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. Using Co9S8/HWS2 as both the cathode and anode, an alkali electrolyzer delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a quite low cell voltage of 1.60 V. The results of both operando Raman spectroscopy and electron spin resonance indicate the presence of S-S terminal and S-S bridging with unsaturated S atoms during the HER process. The present work reveals the synergistic effects of nanoscale interfaces on overall electrocatalytic water splitting.									32	2	0	0	0	0	32			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000512216900111	31920074

Under optimal photocatalytic conditions (photoirradiation at lambda >= 420 nm, Ru(bpy)(3)Cl-2 as the photosensitizer, Na2S2O8 as the oxidant in borate buffer at pH = 8.5), the optimum apparent TOF of 10.9 mu mol s(-1) m(-2) and O-2 initial evolution rate of 31.7 mmol s(-1) g(-1) were achieved, which, to our best knowledge, are the highest values reported for heterogeneous photocatalytic water oxidation to date. Variables of the photocatalytic reaction, including catalyst concentrations, pH, dye concentrations and oxidant concentrations, were systemically studied. The oxygen atoms of the evolved oxygen came from water, as confirmed by isotope-labeled experiments. The stability of Co3V2O8 was tested and confirmed with multiple experiments (FT-IR, XRD, XPS), which indicated that Co3V2O8 is a stable catalyst under water oxidation. In addition, a mechanism of Co3V2O8 for the process of water oxidation was proposed.									54	2	0	0	4	0	54			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000344384000025

Herein, we use [CH3NH3][ZnxCo1-x(HCOO)(3)] as precursors to prepare hollow ZnxCo1-xSe2 microcubes by a simple solvothermal strategy. Particularly, the synthesized hollow Zn0.1Co0.9Se2 microcube presents the best electrocatalytic performance, with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of only 196 mV for HER in acid and 308 mV for OER in alkaline solution, respectively. The hollow porous structure and a handful of zinc doping contribute to enhancing electrocatalytic performance. The former is conducive to expose more active sites, while the latter not only can improve the conductivity of the electro-catalyst, but also enhance the hydrogen adsorption capacity of the material. The synthesis method is simple, low toxicity and has no high temperature carbonization process, which provides a good prospect for the synthesis of non-precious metal bifunctional electro-catalysts with hollow structure.

Herein, an emerging technique of pulsed electric current (PEC) for facilitating NPs exsolution was firstly utilized in functional materials towards tailoring structure and morphology of materials. PEC facilitated Ni NPs exsolution in situ and the exposed active sites were highly dispersed on the LaCrO3 substrate surface. Such result was confirmed by combining x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. As a consequence, PEC-treated and untreated LaCrO3 perovskite samples were employed as electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The PEC-treated samples exhibit obviously improved OER activity (lower overpotential, smaller Tafel slope) and lower reaction resistance than the untreated samples. This illustrates that the exsolved Ni NPs driven by PEC are beneficial for the OER performance and are probably the components of the OER active sites.									6	1	0	0	1	0	7			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000478694400001	31315092

We find that the excess electrons associated with O-vac's are involved in charge transfer (CT) to the intermediate adsorbate species HO*, O*, and HOO* and/or new surface oxygen hole states that we identified. The CT is responsible for an increase in these species' binding energies to the oxygen deficient surface (cBTO-TiO2-x) to an extent consistent with their electro-negativity. The much stronger stabilization of HO* and O* compared to HOO* results in an increased overpotential eta(OER) on the reduced oxide. This result is at odds with experiment that shows a significantly increased efficiency for oxygen-deficient BTO, suggesting that a different mechanism and/or surface must be involved under the experimental conditions. We also identify heretofore unreported HO* and O* intermediate adsorbate structures whereby these species oxidize the surface and a surface oxygen hole is formed adjacent to the adsorption site. We assign the facile surface oxidation to the 2-fold coordination of the surface oxygen atoms in Ti-O-Ti surface moieties and a resulting low work function.									28	1	0	0	0	0	28			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000400039300016

Herein, we report a facile Ketjenblack carbon (KB)-templated in situ synthesis method to fabricate highly dispersed bimetallic NiFe phosphides as highly efficient OER electrocatalysts. The Fe dopant can effectively modulate the electronic structure and increase the oxidation degree of Ni2P species. Remarkably, benefitting from the large specific surface area, optimized electronic structure and faster charge transfer kinetics, the KB-templated NiFe phosphides exhibit dramatically enhanced OER activity in alkaline medium. By tailoring the Ni/Fe ratio, (Ni0.5Fe0.5)(2)P/C-KB-900 delivers a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at an ultra-low overpotential of 296 mV and a small Tafel slope of 77 mV dec(-1), which is much more active than commercial RuO2. Post-electrolysis characterization further reveals that the bimetallic phosphides are in situ converted to NiFe oxides/hydroxides during the OER, serving as the OER active sites with high activity. This work offers a novel route to design and fabricate transition metal phosphide/carbon catalysts for water splitting by controlling the morphology and composition.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2052-1553			WOS:000599443400014

The structure, morphology, size, and composition of the as-obtained nanocrystals are examined by a series of characterization techniques. The architectures display remarkable catalytic performances toward oxygen reduction and hydrogen generation in comparison with commercial Pt black and Pt/C catalysts, through the polarization, chronoamperometry, and durability measurements. This is due to the special dendritic nanostructures with rich surface defects, porous features and the synergistic effects between Pt and Au in the alloy. In combination with the simple, easily controllable, and time-saving synthetic strategy, AuPt NDs may find potential applications and shed some light on the construction of other bimetallic nanocatalysts in fuel cells.

One mechanism for instability is the occurrence of unstable density gradients due to the accumulation of reaction products. In this paper we conduct two-dimensional nonlinear numerical simulations for a member of this class of system: the methylene-blue-glucose reaction. The result of these reactions is the oxidation of glucose to a relatively, but marginally, dense product, gluconic acid, that accumulates at oxygen permeable interfaces, such as the surface open to the atmosphere. The reaction is catalyzed by methylene-blue. We show that simulations help to disassemble the mechanisms responsible for the onset of instability and evolution of patterns, and we demonstrate that some of the results are remarkably consistent with experiments. We probe the impact of the upper oxygen boundary condition, for fixed flux, fixed concentration, or mixed boundary conditions, and find significant qualitative differences in solution behavior; structures either attract or repel one another depending on the boundary condition imposed. We suggest that measurement of the form of the boundary condition is possible via observation of oxygen penetration, and improved product yields may be obtained via proper control of boundary conditions in an engineering setting. We also investigate the dependence on parameters such as the Rayleigh number and depth. Finally, we find that pseudo-steady linear and weakly nonlinear techniques described elsewhere are useful tools for predicting the behavior of instabilities beyond their formal range of validity, as good agreement is obtained with the simulations.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1539-3755	1550-2376		WOS:000258179000054	18764059

However, these metal-based catalysts often suffer from multiple disadvantages, including high cost, low selectivity, poor stability and detrimental environmental effects. Here, we describe a mesoporous carbon foam co-doped with nitrogen and phosphorus that has a large surface area of similar to 1,663 m(2) g(-1) and good electrocatalytic properties for both ORR and OER. This material was fabricated using a scalable, one-step process involving the pyrolysis of a polyaniline aerogel synthesized in the presence of phytic acid. We then tested the suitability of this N,P-doped carbon foam as an air electrode for primary and rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Primary batteries demonstrated an open-circuit potential of 1.48 V, a specific capacity of 735 mAh g(Zn)(-1) (corresponding to an energy density of 835 Wh kg(Zn)(-1)), a peak power density of 55 mW cm(-2), and stable operation for 240 h after mechanical recharging. Two-electrode rechargeable batteries could be cycled stably for 180 cycles at 2 mA cm(-2). We also examine the activity of our carbon foam for both OER and ORR independently, in a three-electrode configuration, and discuss ways in which the Zn-air battery can be further improved.

Thomas; Wang, Qing								Redox catalysts for aprotic Li-O2 batteries: Toward a redox flow system								NANO MATERIALS SCIENCE				1	3			173	183		10.1016/j.nanoms.2019.02.008				SEP 2019	2019	Large-scale electrical energy storage with high energy density and round-trip efficiency is important to the resilience of power grids and the effective use of intermittent renewable energy such as solar and wind. Lithiumoxygen battery, due to its high energy density, is believed to be one of the most promising energy storage systems for the future. However, large overpotentials, poor cycling stability, and degradation of electrolytes and cathodes have been hindering the development of lithium-oxygen batteries. Numerous heterogeneous oxygen electrocatalysts have been investigated to lower the overpotentials and enhance the cycling stability of lithium-oxygen batteries. Unfortunately, the prevailing issues of electrode passivation and clogging remain. Over the past few years, redox mediators were explored as homogenous catalysts to address the issues, while only limited success has been achieved for these soluble catalysts. In conjunction with a flowing electrolyte system, a new redox flow lithium-oxygen battery (RFLOB) has been devised to tackle the aforementioned issues. The working mechanism and schematic processes will be elaborated in this review. In addition, the performance gap of RFLOB with respect to practical requirements will be analysed. With the above, we anticipate RFLOB would be a credible solution for the implementation of lithium-oxygen battery chemistry for the next generation energy storage.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			2096-6482	2589-9651		WOS:000856028500001

Construction of abundant triple-phase boundary (TPB) effectively facilitates cathode reactions occurring at TPB. Herein, a wood-derived integral air electrode containing Co/CoO nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped carbonized wood (Co/CoO@NWC) is constructed with a dual catalytic function. The potential gap between oxygen reduction and evolution is shortened to 0.77 V. Liquid ZABs using Co/CoO@NWC as cathode exhibit high discharge specific capacity (800 mAh g(Zn)(-1)), low charge-discharge gap (0.84 V), and long-term cycling stability (270 h). Co/CoO@NWC also shows distinguished catalytic activity and stability in all-solid-state ZABs. The inherent layered porous and pipe structures of wood are well maintained in catalytically active carbon. The different hydrophilicity of carbonized wood and Co/CoO endow abundant TPBs for battery reaction. The Co/CoO located on TPB provides main active sites for oxygen reactions. The inherent pipe structures of wood carbon and the interaction between Co/CoO and NWC effectively prevent nanoparticles from aggregation. The design and preparation of this monolithic electrocatalyst contribute to the broad-scale application of ZABs and promote the development of next-generation biomass-based storage devices.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000682727800001	34365727

Exchange current densities and Tafel slopes for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions were determined from quasi-steady state polarization curves obtained in 1 M KOH and 6 M KOH solutions at temperatures ranging from 30-degrees to 90-degrees-C. In addition, the influence of thermal, chemical and electrochemical treatments on the polarization behaviour was studied and X-ray analysis and SEM were applied for the characterization of the sample material. The electrochemical behaviour of the electroless prepared amorphous metal alloys was found to be advantageous and very similar to that already reported for the conventionally prepared amorphous materials.									35	3	0	0	0	0	37			0360-3199			WOS:A1992HK96100002

In this work, a novel strategy for engineering water splitting electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolyte was developed by synergistically coupling La-doped NiFe-layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) nanosheets onto three-dimensional (3D) vertically aligned MXene nanosheets on macroporous nickel foam (NF) substrates (NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF). The electrocatalytic performance of the prepared NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF is enhanced by the synergy of strong electronic interaction among multiple metal centers and unique vertically aligned porous MXene with increased active surface area, accelerated reaction kinetics and improved water adsorption and dissociation ability. To reach the commercially required current density (500 mA cm-2), the NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF exhibits greatly reduced overpotentials of 233 and 255 mV for HER and OER, respectively, along with excellent durability. Moreover, an alkaline electrolyzer driven by NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF delivers a lower cell voltage (1.71 V) compared with that of Pt/C-RuO2 couple to achieve the current density of 500 mA cm-2.

Metal nanoclusters protected by different types of ligands, such as thiolates, alkynyls, hydrides, and N-heterocyclic carbenes, have been synthesized in recent years. Moreover, recent experiment and theoretical studies also indicated that the metal nanoclusters show great promise in many electrocatalytic reactions, such as hydrogen evolution, oxygen reduction, and CO2 reduction. The atomically precise nature of their structures enables the elucidation of structure-property relationships and the reaction mechanisms, which is essential if nanoclusters with enhanced performances are to be rationally designed. Particularly, the ligands play an important role in affecting the interface bonding, stability and electrocatalytic activity/selectivity. In this review, we mainly focus on the ligand effect on the interface structure of metal nanoclusters and then discuss the recent advances in electrocatalytic applications. Furthermore, we point out our perspectives on future efforts in this field.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000658872100001	34101616

A composite of carbon-wrapped Mo2C nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes is prepared on Ni foam by direct hydrolysis and carbonization of a gel composed of ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate and hydroquinone resin. The Mo2C nanoparticles with well-controlled particle size act as a highly active oxygen reduction reactions/oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER) catalyst. The carbon coating can prevent the aggregation of the Mo2C nanoparticles. The even distribution of Mo2C nanoparticles results in the homogenous formation of discharge products. The skeleton of porous carbon with carbon nanotubes protrudes from the composite, resulting in extra voids when applied as a cathode for Li-O-2 batteries. The batteries deliver a high discharge capacity of approximate to 10 400 mAh g(-1) and a low average charge voltage of approximate to 4.0 V at 200 mA g(-1). With a cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1), the Li-O-2 batteries exhibit excellent charge-discharge cycling stability for over 300 cycles. The average potential polarization of discharge/charge gaps is only approximate to 0.9 V, demonstrating the high ORR and OER activities of these Mo2C nanoparticles. The excellent cycling stability and low potential polarization provide new insights into the design of highly reversible and efficient cathode materials for Li-O-2 batteries.									69	4	0	0	2	0	69			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000390117800017

One can distinguish two oxidation pathways: at potentials below 2.5 V a direct electron transfer to the BOO takes place, while at potentials above 2.5 V OH radicals are produced and scavenged by the reactants. As a consequence, the oxygen evolution reaction is at least partially suppressed. The direct electron transfer to. the electrode is observed for i-propanol, ethanol and cyclohexane. For acetone and HFiP, only the second, indirect, pathway with the participation of OH radicals is effective. For all the reactants except HFiP CO2 formation was observed generally at 2.5 V or higher, the potential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the pure supporting electrolyte. Hence OH radicals are instrumental in the cleavage of C-C bonds. For HFiP, the cyclic voltammograms of the supporting electrolyte with and without the reactant are identical. This indicates that the oxidation of HFiP is initiated by OH radicals followed by a further electron transfer to the electrode, similarly to the oxidation of CO (I. Kisacik, A. Stefanova, S. Ernst and H. Baltruschat, PCCP, 15 (2013) 4616). For both pathways, the reactivity follows the same trend as the homogeneous hydrogen abstraction reaction rates with OH radicals. The intermediate radicals formed in the reaction with the electro-generated OH radicals can react with oxygen present in the solution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

B-site substituted SrCoO3-delta derivatives have previously been investigated as promising materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes due to the stabilization of a 3 C perovskite structure with high electronic and ionic conductivity that allows large oxygen storage capabilities. Here, antimony-substituted strontium cobalt oxides are investigated and identified as new candidate materials for thermochemical oxygen separation applications. In this work we shed light on the exceptional redox kinetics and cyclability of antimony-substituted variants undergoing oxygen exchange at intermediate temperatures (500 to 800 degrees C). Through the use of density functional theory and isothermal gas atmosphere switching, we demonstrate how the inductive effect of the more electronegative antimony dopants in the Co position, facilitates the kinetics of metal oxide oxidation, whilst hindering reduction reactions. SrCo0.95Sb0.05O3-delta was identified to isothermally evolve 3.76 cm(3) g(-1) of oxygen at 500 degrees C and calculated to produce up to 10.44 cm(3) g(-1) under temperature-swing reaction configurations aligning with previously reported materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000780050600001

In the present study, the photo-electrocatalytic properties of CaMn2O4 in water-splitting were investigated. CaMn2O4 powders with irregular shapes and nanowire shapes were synthesised using mechanochemical processing and a hydrothermal method, respectively. The anode in a photo-electrochemical cell was fabricated by embedding CaMn2O4 powders within polypyrrole. The results showed that CaMn2O4 induced a higher dark and light current in comparison to the control sample (polypyrrole alone). CaMn2O4 nanowires exhibited higher dark and light current in comparison to irregular-shaped CaMn2O4 powders. The difference was attributable to the higher surface area of nanowires compared to the irregular-shaped particles, rather than the difference in exposed crystal facets.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2076-3417		WOS:000472641200024

An increasing number of reports have been published lately on the HER over single atom catalysts (SACs) owing to the high catalytic activity, stability and maximum atom utilization of SACs, of which the final point endows noble-metal catalysts with low costs. In this Review, we highlight the electrochemical applications of all reported SACs in the HER, with a particular focus on the discussion of their catalytic properties and mechanisms at the atomic level.

However, the widespread implementation of ZABs is still hampered by the sluggish oxygen redox reactions. Thus the deployment of cost-effective and highly efficient air electrodes to substitute precious metals (Pt/Ir), is highly challenging, however, highly desired. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are emerging functional materials, which demonstrate several outstanding characteristics, such as high specific surface area, high conductivity, self-doped N, open pore structure, versatile compositions and favourable chemical stability. Through varying the metal/organic moiety or by employing different synthesis protocols, ZIFs with different properties could be obtained. Being adaptable, desired functionalities may be further incorporated into ZIFs through pre-treatment, in situ treatment, and post treatment. Thus, ZIFs are the ideal precursors for the preparation of variety of bi-functional air electrodes for ZABs by materials tuning, morphological control, or by materials hybridization. Here, the recent advances of ZIFs-based materials are critically surveyed from the perspective of synthesis, morphology, structure and properties, and correlated with performance indicators of ZABs.

Since the particles are under continuous electrochemical stress, decay in their catalytic performance (a.k.a., fatigue) often occurs due to degradation of the active materials, detachment of particles and deteriorating kinetics. Here we report that these problems are well addressed by fluidizing the particles. The catalysts, instead of being fixed on an electrode, are now fluidized in the electrolyte. Reaction occurs when individual particles collide with the electrode, which collectively delivers a continuous, scalable and stable electrochemical current. Since the catalysts now work in rotation, they experience much faster kinetics and avoid the buildup of excessive electrochemical stress, leading to orders of magnitude higher particle-average efficiency and greatly enhanced fatigue resistance. Proof-ofconcepts are demonstrated using Pt/C catalysts for three well-known reactions, including oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution and methanol oxidation reactions, all of which suffer severe performance decay using Pt/C under different mechanisms. Fluidized electrocatalysis breaks the spatial and temporal continuum of electrocatalytic reactions, and makes them drastically more fatigue resistant. It is material- and reaction-agnostic, and should be a general approach to enhance electrocatalytic reactions.									19	1	0	0	2	0	20				2096-5745		WOS:000794103400002

In order to gain a comprehensive insight into the migration and redistribution of various sulfur species in the CLC system, a typical Chinese coal (designated as LZ) with large size range around 180-400 mu m (as frequently used in the real CLC system) was selected and its reaction with CuFe2O4 combined oxygen carrier (OC) was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which indicated that the reaction behavior of CuFe2O4 with LZ coal of large size changed greatly due to the maceral enrichment and mineral segregation in the LZ coal. At the two main reaction stages, the characteristic temperatures of CuFe2O4 reaction with LZ coal of large size range shifted to higher temperatures and the reaction rates increased relative to the reaction of CuFe2O4 with LZ coal of small size range (63-106 mu m). Furthermore, the migration and redistribution of various sulfur species formed from reaction of LZ coal with CuFe2O4 at its oxygen excess number Phi = 1.0 were studied through gaseous Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which revealed that the SO2 mainly resulted from oxidation of H2S by CuFe2O4 combined with direct emission through pyrolysis of LZ coal at the peak temperature of 413.6 degrees C, while the solid Cu2S was formed through the gaseous sulfur liberated out by LZ coal and further reaction with the reduced CuFe2O4. Finally, thermodynamic simulation of LZ coal reaction with CuFe2O4 OC was conducted, and among all the four factors considered the CuFe2O4 oxygen excess number O, reaction temperature, steam concentration, and the system pressure the CuFe2O4 oxygen excess number 0 was ascertained as the most significant to migrate and converting most of the sulfur involved in LZ coal to the solid Cu2S is suggested as a good option for its ensuing separation out of the reduced OC. In addition, in order to simultaneously realize the CO, capture and effective in situ desulfurization during reaction of LZ coal with CuFe2O4 OC, the optimized condition was preliminarily explored and the CuFe2O4 oxygen excess number 0 was suggested to fix around 1.5.									18	4	0	0	0	0	21			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000386107200080

Many Co-based perovskite oxides such as LaCoO3 have been discovered as the stable and active ORR catalysts, which can be good candidates to replace platinum (Pt). Although researchers have tried substituting various transition metals into the Co-based perovskite catalysts to improve the ORR performance, the influence of substitution on the ORR. mechanism is rarely studied. In this paper, we explore the evolution of ORR mechanism after substituting Fe into LaCoO3, using the combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high-resolution X-ray microscopy, X-ray diffraction, surface-sensitive soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy characterization, and electrochemical tests. We observed enhanced catalytic activities and increased electron transfer numbers during the ORR in Co-rich perovskite, which are attributed to the optimized e(g) filling numbers and the stronger hybridization of transition metal 3d and oxygen 2p bands. The discoveries in this paper provide deep insights into the ORR catalysis mechanism on metal oxides and new guidelines for the design of Pt-free ORR catalysts.									35	6	0	0	4	0	38			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000459221900015	30694640

Herein, we synthesized oxygen-vacancy-rich CoFe/CoFe2O4 embedded in N-doped hollow carbon spheres (Vo-CoFe/ CoFe2O4@NC) through pyrolysis, carbonization, and partial reduction. The synergistic effect of introducing oxygen vacancies into CoFe2O4 and the well-defined heterointerfaces between the CoFe alloy and spinel-type CoFe2O4 moderately controlled the electronic structure and provided abundant active sites for the ORR and OER. Vo-CoFe/CoFe2O4@NC exhibited high ORR activity (half-wave potential: 0.858 V and Tafel slope: 56 mV dec-1) and delivered a low overpotential (360 mV at 10 mA cm-2) for the OER. Moreover, rechargeable ZABs using Vo-CoFe/CoFe2O4@NC as the air cathode revealed excellent open-circuit voltage (1.53 V), good power density (139.5 mW cm-2), and longer cycling durability than the state-of-the-art Pt/C-RuO2.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000822982100003

The spherical Ni3N nanoparticles were uniformly coated with a carbon protective layer formed in-situ with a thickness of 10 nm, which shows excellent catalytic activity for overall water splitting in alkaline solution. The experimental results showed that the initial potential for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was -0.06 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode, vs RHE), and the overpotential (eta) was 284 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2); the initial potential for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was 1.53 V vs RHE, and eta was 390 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, Ni3N@C had excellent stability for overall water splitting in alkaline solution. The excellent activity and high stability of the catalyst are due to the high intrinsic activity of Ni3N as well as the formation of carbon coating layer, which not only improves the conductivity of the material and accelerates the transfer of electrons and protons, but also protects Ni3N from corrosion in alkaline electrolyte. In a word, we provide a simple, economical and low-temperature sustaining method to prepare Ni3N to be used in water splitting, and the preparation method can also be used to prepare other promising bifunctional electrocatalysts for energy conversion field.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0256-1115	1975-7220		WOS:000809699700001

However, the high overpotential and low power output caused by the limitations of the cathode material have impeded their commercialization. To overcome these injurious issues, herein we report the enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of SWBs using a well-controlled N-doped carbon cloth as a cathode current collector. The resulting electrochemical performance reveals that the presence of pyridinic-N prepared by pyrolysis at 700 degrees C is related to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward the OER and ORR and the improved electrochemical behavior of the SWB. At a current density of 0.25 mA cm(-2), the SWB with a pyridinic-N-containing cathode shows a lower overpotential of 0.84 V and a higher power density of 9.66 mW cm(-2), which are significantly better than those of graphitic-N-dominated carbon cathodes. Furthermore, the in-depth density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations support our claim that pyridinic-N-doping at the zigzag edges or monovacancy defects of the carbon structure are responsible for the enhancement in the electrochemical performance of the SWB, and the carbon atoms close to pyridinic-N are the main active sites.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2574-0962			WOS:000516665300041		
J	Liu, Ying-Chau; Koza, Jakub A.; Switzer, Jay A.								Conversion of electrodeposited Co(OH)(2) to CoOOH and Co3O4, and comparison of their catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				140		SI		359	365		10.1016/j.electacta.2014.04.036				SEP 10 2014	2014	Cobalt hydroxide, beta-Co(OH)(2), was electrodeposited cathodically from an alkaline solution of tris(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III). The Co(OH)(2) crystals grew into a microcone morphology and the surface became CoOOH at anodic potentials. The Co(OH)(2) film was fully converted to CoOOH by electrochemical oxidation at 95 degrees C in 1 M KOH and to Co3O4 by thermal decomposition at 300 degrees C in air. The Co(OH)(2) and CoOOH films grew with a [001] orientation on Au(111), and the converted Co3O4 films had a [111] orientation. The overall morphology was retained upon conversion. However, an increase in roughness was observed on the surface of the CoOOH and Co3O4 microcones. The electrochemically active area of the films was estimated from double layer capacitance measurements in acetonitrile with tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte. The CoOOH had a roughness factor of 9.4, and the Co3O4 had a roughness factor of 63.6. The catalytic activities of the films for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were compared by Tafel analysis in an O-2 saturated 1 M KOH at room temperature. The CoOOH and Co3O4 films appeared to exhibit different Tafel behavior with Co3O4 being the superior catalyst when the geometric area was used in the Tafel analysis. However, when the observed current densities were corrected for the measured electrochemically active areas, the linear regions of the two Tafel plots fell on the same line. The results suggest that the active species, likely Co(IV), for the OER is the same on both materials. Both CoOOH and Co3O4 had a Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1) and an exchange current density of 6.1 x 10(-11) A cm(-2). The conversion method outlined in the paper provides a means to produce Co3O4 with a large electrochemically-active area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

There were two types of tungsten carbide in the samples; one was pure WC, and the other was wrapped by carbon. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results revealed that the diameters of WC nanocrystals ranged from 100 to 200 nm, and that the WC nanocrystals were slightly agglomerated. The possible formation mechanism of the as-obtained tungsten carbide was discussed.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0366-7022	1348-0715		WOS:000243471100002

Ce modification at electronic level is proved to be an efficient strategy owing to the flexible transformation of Ce3+/Ce4+. Herein, Ce0.21@Co(OH)(2) with the optimized Ce doping have been fabricated to tailor the fast electron transfer for the enhanced activity and stability for OER. Firstly, the obtained core-shell structure composed of vertical loose Co(OH)(2) sheets not only exposes a large number of active sites, but also provides channels for Ce doping. Secondly, the high pressure microwave with instantaneous heating can fast introduce Ce into Co(OH)(2), obtaining Cex@Co(OH)(2) with well dispersion and close integration. The intimated interaction between Ce and Co species may provide the "df electronic ladders" for accelerating electron transfer of the catalytic surface. Meanwhile, Ce promotes the formation of Co-superoxide intermediate and/or the release of oxygen, which is considered to be the rate-determining step for OER. The electrochemical measurements confirmed the low overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and great stability of Ce-0.21@Co(OH)(2) for OER. This work demonstrates a meaningful approach to realize the tuned electronic structure through metal doping.

Herein, pulsed laser deposited N, H dual-doped black anatase TiO2 (N-H:TiO2) films grown under NH3 are examined for the electrochemical water splitting application. This case is compared with only nitrogen or oxygen vacancy doped films. These dual-doped films are highly conducting (98.77 mu Omega cm @ 300K) with holes as majority carriers. Electrostatic force microscopy also reveals significant differences in the work functions for the cases compared. Interestingly, the doped films not only exhibit impressive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with an initial overpotential of approximate to 0.6V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode [RHE]), but the same reduces significantly down to approximate to 0.42V at 10mAcm(-2) after 5h chronoamperometry. Concurrently, there is a remarkable increase in current density (from approximate to 10 to 30mAcm(-2)) at the overpotential of 0.6V after 2000 cycles with excellent durability over 15h. This peculiar self-activation and performance enhancement of the catalysis is examined through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis which reveals the increased percentage of oxygen vacancies and incorporation of a new phase TiOxNy on the film surface via electrochemical surface reactions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the N-H:TiO2 thin films have appropriate hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energies commensurate with observed high HER activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2699-9412			WOS:000783867000008

The as-prepared, catalyst was utilized to enhance the catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in energy-saving electrolysis of Na2CO3. The morphology characterization indicates that Ag nanoparticles uniformly disperse on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (RGO), and their average size is only about 5.7 mn. The electrochemical tests show that the as-prepared catalyst exhibits high electrocatlytic activity for ORR in alkaline media. Furthermore, when the catalyst is used for the oxygen reduction cathode (ORC) in the galvanostatic electrolysis of Na2CO3, the cell voltage can be reduced by 1.05 V, as compared with the conventional hydrogen evolution cathode (HEC) electrolysis. Correspondingly, up to 41.5% electrical energy consumption is saved at the same current density of 100 mA cm(-2).									24	2	0	0	1	0	26			0888-5885			WOS:000359279100010

The chemical energy can be used as a fuel or converted back to electricity when needed. Water electrolysis to hydrogen and oxygen is a well-established technology, whereas fundamental advances in CO2 electrolysis are still needed to enable short-term and seasonal energy storage in the form of liquid fuels. This paper discusses the electrolytic reactions that can potentially enable renewable energy storage, including water, CO2 and N-2 electrolysis. Recent progress and major obstacles associated with electrocatalysis and mass transfer management at a system level are reviewed. We conclude that knowledge and strategies are transferable between these different electrochemical technologies, although there are also unique complications that arise from the specifics of the reactions involved.									75	1	0	0	5	0	76			0027-8424			WOS:000545947700017	31843917

Results show that the reaction atmosphere determines reaction type,reaction degree and structure of heat-treated PAN fiber. Under nitrogen condition,the heating triggers free radical chemical reaction,which is quicker and needs higher activation energy to generate the C CHC NH conjugate structure due to dehydrogenation and nitriles base cyclization. Under air condition,the heating and oxygen cause ionic cyclization,which is slower and needs lower activation energy to generate aromatic heterocyclic structure containing C O and C N groups with super thermostability.			在空气和氮气条件下,分别对聚丙烯腈(PAN)原丝在190~260℃范围内进行热处理,利用DSC、FT-IR、NMR与TG研究了PAN纤维的各官能团在不同介质中的化学反应性和化学结构演变。研究表明,不同气氛导致PAN大分子官能团的化学反应类型、反应程度和最终化学结构不同,氮气气氛下,热引发自由基化学反应的活化能较高,但反应速率快,氰基成环、亚甲基脱氢后逐渐异变生成C=CHC=NH共轭结构;空气气氛下,热和氧引发离子环化反应的活化能较低,但反应速率慢,氰基成环、亚甲基脱氢、氧化反应生成含C=O、C=N的芳杂环结构;尽管氮气中成环及脱氢反应程度高,但氧化性气氛形成的含氧芳杂环结构热稳定性远大于氮气气氛下形成的共轭结构。						0	1	0		0	0	1			1009-6264			CSCD:4756603

The prepared RhNC-900 catalyst (1.47 wt% Rh) is comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst (20 wt% Pt) in terms of the ORR in alkaline media and might inspire new ideas for the development of fuel cells and water splitting.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2046-2069		WOS:000641127700025	35423952

Herein, we report Sm0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8M0.2O3-delta (M = Co, Cu) perovskite doped with different transition metals at the B-site as a cheaper OER electrocatalyst in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Among the prepared catalysts, Sm0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Co0.2O3-delta (SSFCoO) catalysts show improved OER activity with an on-set potential of 1.48 V vs. RHE with a lower overpotential of 316 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the OER performance correlated with the electronic structure of the electrocatalyst was analyzed through X-ray photoelectron spectra which revealed that the improved OER activity of the SSFCoO catalyst is due to an increased Fe4+ oxidization state. Strong Fe 3d-O 2p hybridization causes up-shifting of the O 2p valence band close to the Fermi level from 1.0 eV to 0.33 eV, significantly reducing the charge transfer energy and causing faster OH- adsorption and desorption for efficient OER activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2398-4902			WOS:000691722000001

Based on hydrothermal coordination strategy, we take advantage of strong oxidizing property of nitrate ions to realize temperaturecontrollable atom-escape of metal Ni for self-assembling super-hydrophilic hydroxide FeNi-OH on nickel base as electrocatalysts of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Such distinctive Ni source, resulting in improved ohmic contact and mechanical robustness of catalysts, in conjunction with super-hydrophilicity-accelerated bubble separation and electrolyte contact, endows the catalyst with excellent electrocatalytical activity for both HER and OER in alkaline solution. Super-hydrophilic FeNi-OH delivers the current density of 50 mA cm-2 at overpotentials of 236 mV for OER and 196 mV for HER. Water electrolysis with FeNi-OH as anode and cathode demands a cell voltage of 1.664 V to drive 50 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH, continuously operating for 25 h. This study opens up an avenue in establishing super-hydrophilic structure via self-assembly of the escaped atoms, broadening the horizon on low-cost iron-containing catalyst preparation for energy conversions.									42	1	0	0	1	0	42			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000653012200002

Developing highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential to reduce the energy consumption. Herein, nickel foam (NF)-supported NiCoP nanorod array catalyst is prepared and used for HER and OER. Not only at a small current density (10 mA/cm(2)), but also at the commercially required high current density (>500 mA/cm(2)), NiCoP/NF catalyst shows excellent bifunctional properties with extremely low overpotential and high stability. Small overpotentials of 60 and 253 mV are needed to drive the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for HER and OER, respectively, and the cell voltage of overall water splitting is only 1.55 V. At the high current density of 500 mA/cm(2), the overpotentials are 180 and 365 mV, and the corresponding cell voltage is only 1.83 V. Furthermore, the cell voltage hardly changes within 24 h of overall water splitting test, which makes the catalyst have promising applications in the industrial water electrolysis. The high performance of NiCoP/NF outperforms the commercial RuO2-Pt/C couple and most of the bifunctional Ni/Co-based catalysts reported so far.									38	1	0	0	1	0	38			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000605008000003

In this work, mesoporous hollow nanospheres of titanium dioxide@indium selenide@silver phosphate (TiO2@In2Se3@Ag3PO4) are designed and synthesized. The three-layer structure consists of TiO2 as the inner layer, In2Se3 as the middle layer, and Ag3PO4 as the outer layer. When TiO2@In2Se3@Ag3PO4 is irradiated with light, In2Se3 serves as the sensitizer to enhance light absorption and in the three-layer architecture, the photogenerated electrons and holes migrate in opposite direction in the near surface to minimize recombination. Hence, the three monomeric materials produce synergistic effects upon light illumination. The excited electrons are mainly concentrated in the conduction band (CB) of In2Se3 to promote the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and also increase the output voltage during discharging. On the other hand, holes are primarily concentrated in the valence band (VB) of Ag3PO4 to promote the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and decrease the input voltage during charging. During light illumination, the discharging and charging voltages of the ZABs are 1.82 V and 0.64 V, respectively. The novel materials design reveals an effective strategy to harvest photo energy for electrochemical storage devices.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000780376400003

In order to improve web search results, previous research studies employed user queries/preferred words and the number of links in the web documents. In this study, performance of the search results exploiting these two criteria is examined and other preference criteria for web documents are analyzed. Experimental results show that personalized web search results employing queries and preferred words yield up to 1.7 times better performance over the current search engine and that the search results using the number of links gives up to 1.3 times better performance. Although it is found that the first of the user's preference criteria for web documents is the contents of the document, readability and images in the document are also given a large weight. Therefore, performance of web search personalization algorithms will be greatly improved if they incorporate objective data reflecting each user's characteristics in addition to the number of queries and preferred words.				웹 문서 수의 급증으로 인해 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 발생하는 정보의 과부하 문제가 심각하게 부각되었다. 웹 검색 결과를 개선하기 위하여 개발된 기존의 알고리즘들은 주로 사용자의 질의어 및 선호어와 문서의 링크수를 이용하였다. 본 연구에서는 실험을 통하여 이 두가지 요소들을 이용한 검색 결과의 성능을 알아보고 이들 요소들 외에 선호하는 웹문서의 선택 기준을 조사 분석하였다. 실험 결과 질의어 및 선호어를 이용한 개인화된 검색 결과는 현 검색 엔진에 비해 최대 약 1.7배의 성능 향상을 가져 왔으며, 링크수를 이용한 검색 결과는 최대 약 1.3배의 향상을 보였다. 사용자가 웹문서를 선호하는 기준은 문서 내용이 최우선이었으나, 가독성과 문서가 포함한 이미지도 큰 비중을 차지하였다. 따라서 질의어 및 선호어 개수 이외에 각 사용자의 성향에 부합하는 객관적 데이터를 추가적으로 활용한다면 웹 검색 개인화 알고리즘의 성능이 크게 향상될 수 있을 것이다.					14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1598-5016			KJD:ART001416880

However, the basal plane sites which account for the vast majority of sites are less active, resulting in limited activity of 1T-MoS2. In this case, improving the activity of basal planes appears to be a promising way to enhance overall HER activity. Herein, we report a hierarchical self-supported electrode composed of nanowire arrays of 1T-MoS2 nanosheets decorated with Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles (Ni(OH)(2)@1T-MoS2 NWAs) for alkaline water electrolysis. The activity toward HER is significantly improved by promoting water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption capability on the 1T-MoS2 basal plane by constructing a heterogeneous structure with Ni(OH)(2). Furthermore, Ni(OH)(2) endows the electrode with catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from these advantages, the resulting electrode achieved extraordinary activity with a small overpotential of 56.9 mV and 1.51 V to reach 10 mA cm-2 for alkaline HER and overall water electrolysis. Furthermore, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed the reaction mechanism.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000796226400001

Herein, a general and facile strategy is developed to engineer cobalt oxide nanostructures via selective acid leaching for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A leaching process is implemented to selectively remove CoMoO4 by treating mixed Co-Mo oxides in diluted hydrochloric acid solution, resulting in the formation of sub-5 nm particles and a threefold increase in the specific surface area (up to 150 m(2) g(-1)). The leached oxides exhibit superior OER activity to pristine oxides as a result of (i) a larger surface area, (ii) phase purification to expose more active Co3O4 species to the reactant, and (iii) faster charge transfer kinetics for the OER. This strategy can be also applied to a broader range of earth-abundant metals, where a second metal (Li, Ca, and Mg) is selectively leached out, which results in a material with a larger surface area and enhanced catalytic performance for the OER. Moreover, various metal oxides with a high surface area, such as NiO and Fe2O3, can be prepared via this simple synthetic method. This work will pave a new practical way for the production of high surface area catalysts for diverse applications.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000490983100033		
J	Peng, Bo; Zhang, Huiyan; Zhang, Yaping								Investigation of the relationship between functional groups evolution and combustion kinetics of microcrystalline cellulose using in situ DRIFTS								FUEL				248				56	64		10.1016/j.fuel.2019.03.069				JUL 15 2019	2019	Functional groups evolution characteristics of biomass during the combustion process have a significant influence on the combustion mechanism because they directly affect the diffusion of oxygen to the surface of biomass. In this paper, microcrystalline cellulose was chosen as the feedstock. The functional groups evolution characteristics were studied using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was also conducted to be compared. In situ DRIFTS and TG of cellulose were performed from 20 degrees C to 500 degrees C at different heating rates in different atmospheres. The results of in situ DRIFTS showed that oxygen-containing functional groups firstly increased and then decreased with increasing temperature, while hydrogen-bonded functional groups showed the opposite characteristics. Compared with TG experiments, it can be obtained that the O-H bonds maintained the crystal structure of cellulose at low temperature, and promoted further reactions at high temperature. The production of C=O functional groups prevented further decomposition of cellulose. The relationship of combustion kinetics during the initial stage of combustion and in situ functional groups evolution characteristics were obtained. This study demonstrated that the combustion kinetics can be predicted by the surface functional groups evolution of biomass, which provides a potential way for studying biomass combustion.					6th International Conference on Biomass Energy (ICBE)6th International Conference on Biomass Energy (ICBE)	OCT 16-19, 2018OCT 16-19, 2018		Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINAWuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA	14	0	0	0	4	1	14			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000463823500007

The array-like colloid composite of (NiCoFe)-Fe-III-LDH/N-GO is used as a bifunctional catalyst for both oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR). The (NiCoFe)-Fe-III-LDH/N-GO array has a 3D open structure with less stacking of LDHs and an enlarged specific surface area. The hierarchical structure design and novel material chemistry endow high activity propelling O-2 redox. By exposing more amounts of Ni and Fe active sites, the (NiCoFe)-Fe-III-LDH/N-GO illustrates a relatively low onset potential (1.41 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) in 0.1 mol L-1 KOH solution under the OER process. Furthermore, by introducing high valence Co3+, the onset potential of this material in ORR is 0.88 V. The overvoltage difference is 0.769 V between OER and ORR. The key factors for the excellent bifunctional catalytic performance are believed to be the Co with a high valence, the N-doping of graphene materials, and the highly exposed Ni and Fe active sites in the array-like colloid composite. This work further demonstrates the possibility to exploit the application potential of LDHs as OER and ORR bifunctional electrochemical catalysts.									210	21	0	0	6	0	212			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000429318400007

However, irreversible oxygen loss causes a change in the crystal structure, and the cations migrate in the transition metal layer, resulting in a rearrangement of the electronic structure and ultimately a severe voltage decay. Herein, we introduce Pt nanoparticles with good catalytic activity and electrical conductivity into lithium-rich cathode materials to improve the loss of lattice oxygen for the first time. We have revealed that the evolution of the lattice structure after the lattice oxygen redox reaction is relatively stable in the lithium-rich oxide with Pt nanoparticles, which is in stark contrast to the apparently deformed crystal structure in the lithium-rich oxide without Pt. Pt-containing electrodes exhibit excellent high-capacity retention rate (more than 80% after 200 cycles), and voltage decay is significantly reduced (less than 0.4 V after 200 cycles). Our results highlight the role of Pt nanoparticles in alleviating the loss of lattice oxygen and stabilizing the crystal structure, which opens up the field of vision for the design of high-energy-density lithium rich cathode oxides with stable structure.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000577586400013

However, several size effects have already been evidenced for this reaction. Near the temperature where the steady-state reaction rate is maximum, the reactivity per Pd surface atom (turnover number (TON)) increases for small particles. At low temperature, in transient molecular beam experiments, a second peak of CO2 appears after the CO beam is closed, while the oxygen is still supplied to the sample. This peak shifts, and its shape changes with temperature and oxygen pressure. This peak is explained by the presence of CO strongly bound to the particle edges. This strongly bound CO reacts well after the CO adsorbed on the facets has desorbed. A kinetic model is presented which explains the evolution of this peak with temperature and oxygen pressure.					9th International Symposium of Small Particles and Inorganic Clusters9th International Symposium of Small Particles and Inorganic Clusters	SEP 01-05, 1998SEP 01-05, 1998	Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Phys; Swiss Natl Sci Fdn; Swiss Acad Sci; Univ Lausanne; Schweizer Gesell Nanowissensch & NanotechnSwiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Phys; Swiss Natl Sci Fdn; Swiss Acad Sci; Univ Lausanne; Schweizer Gesell Nanowissensch & Nanotechn	LAUSANNE, SWITZERLANDLAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND	25	0	0	0	0	0	25			1434-6060	1434-6079		WOS:000087317100083

The prepared P-Co-rGO catalyst shows a great enhancement in the electrocatalytic activity and stability towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline solution, characterized with a positive onset potential of 0.89 V (vs. RHE), a negative shifting of only about 12.8 mV of the half-wave potential and the closest diffusion limiting current density (-5.5 mA cm(-2)) as compared to those of the commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). More interestingly, the prepared P-Co-rGO also exhibits excellent catalytic activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with a low potential of 1.62 V (vs. RHE) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a maximum current density of almost 30 mA cm(-2) at 1.66 V (vs. RHE). Specifically, the prepared P-Co-rGO shows much higher activity and stability than the mono-doped reduced graphene oxide either with P or Co, respectively. This could be ascribed to the modification of the charge and spin densities and the edge and defect effects of the rGO after the co-doping of P and Co, thus resulting in a remarkable enhancement of the electrocatalytic properties for both the ORR and OER.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			2046-2069			WOS:000379442400001

On the perfect surface, the elementary reaction of HS* -> H* + S* is the rate-determining step in the two-step H2S dissociation process, and the formation of H2O is however the rate-determining step for the whole reaction between H2S and CuO. As for the defect surface, the reaction of H2O formation is still a more preferable pathway than the complete dissociation and H-2 formation route. In view of COS decomposition on the perfect surface, the energy barriers for the formation of CO or CO2 from COS decomposition are too high, and thus are difficult to take place. On the defect surface, the presence of oxygen vacancy greatly promotes the adsorption and subsequent decomposition of COS. Finally, the remaining sulfur favorably exists on the surface rather than SO2 formation, and copper sulfides will inevitably generate as the dissociations of H2S or COS proceed. The results attained in this work are helpful to give insights into the sulfur evolution of sulfur-containing fuels in the chemical looping combustion process.					1st International Conference on Energy and Environment (ICEE)1st International Conference on Energy and Environment (ICEE)	SEP 19-22, 2019SEP 19-22, 2019		Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINANanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA	15	1	0	0	0	0	16			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000536058700006

The activity and durability of the catalyst play an important role in enhancing the electrochemical performance of the battery.

Namely, practical rechargeable NC@NPC loaded zinc/air battery testing using oxygen in air demonstrates desirable discharge voltages at current densities up to 80 mA cm(-2).

The as-synthesized mesoporous MoO3-x is very active and stable (durability > 12 h) for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under both acidic and alkaline conditions. The intrinsic MoO3 serves as an HER electrocatalyst without the assistance of carbon materials, noble metals, or MoS2 materials. The results from transmission electron microscopy and N-2 sorption techniques show that the as-synthesized mesoporous MoO3-x has large accessible pores (20-40 nm), which are able to facilitate mass transport and charge transfer during HER. In terms of X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature-programmed oxidation, and diffusive reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy, the mesoporous MoO3-x exhibits mixed oxidation states (Mo5+, Mo6+) and an oxygen-deficient structure. The as-synthesized MoO3-x only requires a low overpotential (approximate to 0.14 V) to achieve a 10 mA cm(-2) current density in 0.1 M KOH and the Tafel slope is as low as 56 mV dec(-1). Density functional theory calculations demonstrate a change of electronic structure and the possible reaction pathway of HER. Oxygen vacancies and mesoporosity serve as key factors for excellent performance.									279	6	0	0	11	0	279			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000383276600009

The coating offers high overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction, and low surface fouling susceptibility. The electrocatalytic properties of the SSMPO coating were tested in the oxidation of 4-chlorophenol (4CP). The 4CP oxidation reaction was found to be first order with respect to 4CP The corresponding currentdensity-dependent apparent reaction rate constants were calculated. This data revealed that the anode maintains its electrocatalytic efficiency with increasing current density. An increase in oxidation temperature was found to have a beneficial effect on the 4CP oxidation rate. The electrocatalytic activity of the coating was found to significantly depend on the transition doping element incorporated in the coating. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, a physicochemical characterization and an electrochemical characterization of the porous Ti/SnO2-Sb2O3/PbO2 electrodes were performed. The results showed that Ti/SnO2-Sb2O3/PbO2 electrodes with 150 mu m pore size had the best removal effect on chloride ions with removal ratios amounting up to 98.5% when the initial concentration was 10 g L-1, the current density 125 mA cm(-2), the initial pH = 9, and the electrode plate spacing 0.5 cm. The results, moreover, showed that the oxygen evolution potential of 150 mu m porous Ti/SnO2-Sb2O3/PbO2 electrodes was highest, which minimized side reactions involving oxygen formation and which increased the removal effect of chloride ions.									7	2	0	0	2	0	8				2227-9717		WOS:000495436200124

Here a sulfur-treated Fe-based metal-organic-framework is reported as a promising electrocatalyst for the OER, which shows a low overpotential of 218 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits a very low Tafel slope of 36.2 mV dec(-1) at room temperature. It can work on high current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 298 and 330 mV, respectively, by keeping 97% of its initial activity after 100 h. Notably, it can achieve 1000 mA cm(-2) at 296 mV with a good stability at 50 degrees C, fully fitting the requirements for large-scale industrial water electrolysis. The high catalytic performance can be attributed to the thermocatalytic processes of H+ capture by -SO3 groups from *OH or *OOH species, which cascades to the electrocatalytic pathway and then significantly reduces the OER overpotentials.									43	2	0	0	1	0	43			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000530329400004

Herein, we report a simple solvothermal method to synthesize in-plane BP/Co2P heterostructures for electrocatalysis. By using the reactive edge defects of the BP nanosheets as the initial sites, Co2P nanocrystals are selectively grown on the BP edges to form the in-plane BP/Co2P heterostructures. Owing to disposition on the original defects of BP, Co2P improves the conductivity and offers more active electrocatalytic sites, so that the BP/Co2P nanosheets exhibit better and more stable electrocatalytic activities in the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions. Our work not only extends the application of BP to electrochemistry, but also provides a new idea to improve the performance of BP by utilization of defects. Furthermore, this strategy can be extended to produce other BP heterostructures to expand the corresponding applications.									190	9	0	0	14	0	192			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000426252400011	29265714

Quasi-simultaneous IR and Raman spectroscopies were used to follow the evolution of the active phase and adsorbed species on the catalyst under reaction conditions.An increase of reduced Mo species on the active phase is observed by Raman spectroscopy in parallel with a deactivation of the redox properties of the catalyst. Complementary EPR experiments show the transformation of Mo-VI to Mo-V and its accumulation in absence of oxygen. Selectivity toward oxidation products is drastically affected by the accumulation of Mo-V species on the active phase. Oxygen addition to the reaction mixture leads to a decrease of the amount of Mo-V and a partial restoration of the oxidative properties of the catalyst. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Structural characterization results reveal that the as-prepared sample has the same composition as bulk graphitic carbon nitride and verify the well-defined tubular morphology of the graphitic carbon nitride tubes, which have a diameter of about 270 nm and a wall thickness of 30 nm. With regard to the photocatalytic activity of the sample, the degradation of organic dyes under visible light irradiation was carried out and cycling experiments were conducted, and the results indicated that the prepared sample has visible light catalytic activity and great stability. The specific tubular structure of graphitic carbon nitride will provide more active sites and higher reaction efficiency with potential application to waste treatment. When applied as an electrocatalyst in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), GCNTs deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 360 mV with a Tafel slope of only 40 mV dec(-1), and demonstrate excellent long term durability.									17	4	0	0	1	0	19			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000444201700033	30014066

However, CoMoP2-based materials were rarely reported, especially in the rechargeable batteries. Herein, CoMoP2 nanoparticles anchored on N, P co-doped carbon nanosheets (CoMoP2@NPC) were prepared through the simple pyrolysis of organic precursor in the presence of phosphoric acid. When used as electrode materials, the as-prepared CoMoP2@NPC electrode exhibited good electrocatalytic activities towards oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions for Li-O-2 batteries. With the unique structure, NPC nanosheets could not only improve electrical conductivity of the composite, but also relive volume changes during cycling to expose the active sites of CoMoP2 nanoparticles. This work introduces a highly-effective strategy for preparing carbon materials embedded bimetal phosphides for energy storage and conversion devices.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2452-2627			WOS:000617915200001

Herein, a new alkaline-stable 3D nickel metal-organic framework (Ni-MOF), containing a 1D rod-packing chain structure fused with a tetranuclear nickel cluster [Ni-4(mu(3)-OH)(2)], is used as a target material to explore its OER properties. The electrocatalytic activities of pure Ni-MOF and hybrid materials made from Ni-MOF with different acetylene black loaded electrodes, such as glassy carbon, fluorine-doped tin oxide, and nickel foam, have been evaluated. Further analysis unravels that the enhanced OER performance might be attributed to the synergistic interactions of two catalytic active species between in situ formed beta-Ni(OH)(2) and a tetranuclear Ni-4(mu(3)-OH)(2) cluster in Ni-MOF. The findings will shed fresh light on the fabrication of MOF-derived catalysts for efficient electrochemical energy conversion.									58	2	1	0	1	0	58			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000526414400062	32207301

In this work a novel self-supported hierarchical OER catalyst comprising vanadium oxide (VO/VO2) nanocrystals embedded in amorphous trinickel disulfide (Ni3S2) nanosheets grown on Ni foam (VOx/Ni3S2@ NF, 2 > x > 1) is reported. This VOx/Ni3S2@ NF demonstrates excellent OER activity and durability in alkaline media. To achieve an OER current density of 100 mA cm(-2), it requires an overpotential of only 358 mV (or 330 mV after 95% iR compensation), which is even much lower than that for commercial RuO2 catalysts (446 mV). Detailed investigation unveils that the excellent OER performance of VOx/Ni3S2@ NF is tightly associated with its rationally combined chemical composition and hierarchical nanostructure; remarkably, the presence of vanadium oxide nanocrystals in the Ni3S2 nanosheets boosts the OER activity by strengthening the Ni-O bond. This work opens a new route to the rational synthesis of highly efficient OER electrocatalysts, and may help deepen our understanding of the OER process catalyzed by non-precious metal-based hybrid electrocatalysts.									43	1	0	0	1	0	43			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472183200040

The OMSS Co3O4 with a diameter around 1 mm is constructed from a large number of nanoparticles mainly with (111) preferential exposed crystal planes. Superior catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be manifested in Li-O-2 batteries with the charge voltage platform reduced to similar to 3.6 V. An outstanding performance of cycling stability was also achieved with a cut-off specific capacity of 1000 mA h g(-1) over 60 cycles. The fantastic cycling performance may be attributed to the open mesoporous spherical shell structure with high specific surface area which improves the transport capability of oxygen, increases the active sites and the sedimentary space of discharge products. It almost gets the highest cycling performance among metal oxide catalysts used in Li-O-2 batteries reported to date.									33	1	0	0	2	0	33			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000351845400050

In this work, a facile strategy was applied to prepared Ag-CeO2-Co3O4/C dual-functional catalyst. The interface interaction affecting the electronic structure and valence state of Ag, Ce and Co, significantly facilitates the ORR/OER catalytic activity. For the Ag-CeO2-Co3O4/C catalyst, the half-wave potential is 0.80 V and limiting current density is 6.2 mA cm(-2) in ORR, while the overpotential is 340 mV s(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2) in OER. The maximum power density in Zn-air battery is 178 mW cm(-2) at 300 mA cm(-2). The relationship between interface interaction and catalytic activity provides guidance for developing multiple catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2468-0230			WOS:000848652500001

Unfortunately, it has been a significant challenge to develop highly ordered microporous/mesoporous structures for them to provide more active sites for these applications. In order to do so using the soft-templating method, three conditions have to be met, namely, a strong interaction between the inorganic precursor and the organic templates; eliminating the formation of bulk manganese phosphate; and the preservation of the manganese phosphate framework without it collapsing upon template removal. Herein, a soft-templating approach is reported using an organophosphonic acid (n-hexylphosphonic acid) as both the etching and the templating agent, followed by high-vacuum-assisted annealing. This approach simultaneously satisfies the above conditions. Both microporous and mesoporous manganese phosphates with uniform pore sizes and well-defined pore structures are obtained. The utilization of the organophosphonic acid is shown to be the key in the transformation from bulk manganese oxide into a highly ordered microporous phosphate. A very high surface area of 304.1 m(2) g(-1) is obtained for the microporous manganese phosphate, which is the highest among the reported values for Mn-based compounds. The ultrafine micropores and high specific surface area of our manganese phosphate promote electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000475269900017	31062894

Here, we report a surprising observation that unique reactions at this interface under photo-electrochemical (PEC) conditions lead to unusual performance enhancement of Ta3N5 for solar water oxidation reactions. The enhancement was only observed when Co(OH)(2) was introduced as a water oxidation co-catalyst. Illumination and positive bias were also critical to the enhancement. It was proposed that Od radical formation induced by illumination results in the formation of Ta-O-Co bonds, which exhibit less severe Fermi-level pinning when compared with Ta-O-Ta bonds that are more commonly observed on bare Ta3N5 under normal PEC conditions. When a high-performance oxygen evolution catalyst such as cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) was added to the Ta3N5/Co(OH)(2) system, high photocurrent densities and good stability were achieved simultaneously.									31	3	0	0	2	0	31			2542-4351			WOS:000425302500016

Much attention has been paid to designing optimal electrocatalysts for water splitting, which includes the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To date, the most effective water splitting electrocatalysts are still Pt based and Ir or Ru group noble metal materials, which can significantly improve the current density with the presence of a low overpotential. As alternatives to noble metals electrocatalysts, a series of studies have been carried out for cobalt-based electrocatalysts on the strengths of non-noble metal properties over the past years. However, the defect engineering of cobalt-based materials for the water splitting process has not been explained systematically. Herein, we summarize various kinds of defects and their functions based on Co-based materials for OER and HER The principles of how various defects improved electrocatalytic performance are introduced clearly; then, the vacancies (included anion and cation vacancies) and heteroatomic doping (included nonmetal and metal atomic doping) were introduced systematically. Furthermore, we especially highlight several defect modification electrocatalysts. Finally, difficulties of defects engineering and the future research directions for Co-implicated electrocatalysts are proposed.									112	8	0	0	4	0	112			2168-0485			WOS:000452344900006

Exploring a high-efficient and good durability OER electrocatalyst to promote the reaction rate has drawn enormous attention. Herein, a particle-in-nanoplate architecture constructed by self-assembled Ni2.3FeP3.4 nanoparticles intertwined with the carbon nanotubes (Ni2.3FeP3.4/CNTs) is synthesized. The architecture of the resultant novel electrocatalyst Ni2.3FeP3.4/CNTs, which possesses the optimal balance of electrochemical active site, ion and electron conductivity, phosphorous content, delivers highly effective and stable electrocatalytic performance. In detail, as for OER, the Ni2.3FeP3.4/CNTs exhibits extraordinarily high-efficient with the smallest onset potential of similar to 1.43 V vs. RHE, the lowest over-potential of 239 mV and 282 mV to reach the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, and the smallest Tafel slopes of 26.9 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. During 12 h galvanostatic electrolysis, the voltage is well maintained without any significant increase, representing a stable non-precious-metal catalyst for water oxidation. Moreover, a lower cell voltage of 1.523 V is achieved at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) by using it as a cathode in the overall water splitting. In addition, for the first time, the Ni2.3FeP3.4/CNTs is designed as an anode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBS). Consequently, the as-prepared Ni2.3FeP3.4/CNTs nanoarchitecture shows a high reversible capacity of 335.1 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1), excellent rate capability of 58.3 mA h g(-1) under 10 A g(-1), and stable long-term cycling performance.

Herein, we demonstrate the first report on the facile synthesis of (NiFe)S-2 nanoparticles grown on graphene (abbr. (NiFe)S-2-GN, where GN stands for graphene), through a simple sulfidation process of the NiFe LDH-GO composites (GO is graphene oxide). Characterization of the as-prepared (NiFe)S-2-GN is carried out in details by XRD, FESEM, TEM and HRTEM, XPS, and Raman spectra. Under 400 degrees C, the NiFe LDH nanosheets decorated on GO surface react with sulfur and transform into (NiFe)S(2 )nanoparticles with the size of 30-50 nm, simultaneously, GO is reduced to GN, forming the (NiFe)S-2-GN nanocomposites. By changing the concentrations of the added salts, various (NiFe)S-2-GN-x composites (x is the starting salt concentrations such as 0.16, 0.2 and 0.40 M added into GO suspension) are obtained. The (NiFe)S-2 in (NiFe)S-2-GN is formed as a single phase by crystal lattice doping of Ni and Fe, showing an exact composition of (Ni0.75Fe0.25)S-2. Among the composites, the (NiFe)S-2-GN-0.2 exhibits optimized electrocatalytic activity. It presents superior OER performance with an overpotential of 320 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, and the Tafel slope of 61 mV/dec is smaller than that (68 mV/dec) of the commercial RuO2. The electrode also maintains strong durability during long-term electrolysis process at the fixed current density of 10 mA cm(-2). It is expected that the (NiFe)S-2-GN material can serve as a promising non-noble metal electrocatalyst for OER. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A new route involving S was developed to achieve atomic dispersion of Fe-N-x species on N and S co-decorated hierarchical carbon layers, resulting in single-atom bifunctional OER/ORR catalysts for the first time. The abundant atomically dispersed Fe-Nx species are highly catalytically active, the hierarchical structure offers more opportunities for active sites, and the electrical conductivity is greatly improved. The obtained electrocatalyst exhibits higher limiting current density and a more positive half-wave potential for ORR, as well as a lower overpotential for OER under alkaline conditions. Moreover, a rechargeable Zn-air battery device comprising this hybrid catalyst shows superior performance compared to Pt/C catalyst. This work will open a new avenue to design advanced bifunctional catalysts for reversible energy storage and conversion devices.									766	53	0	0	38	0	770			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000394996100030	27910196

Herein, we report a photoactive bifunctional catalyst of spinel-type NiCo2S4 (NCS) urchin-like structure with rich mesopores and direct band gap energies of ca. 1.4 and 2.4 eV. The NCS catalyst exhibits high catalytic activities for both OER (eta = 338 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and ORR (eta = 475 mV at E-1/2), comparable to that of the state-of-the-art counterparts (e. g., Pt/C for ORR, RuO2 for OER). Under light illumination, the p-type photoactive NCS catalyst can absorb visible light, generating photogenerated holes and photoelectrons via the photoelectric effect for direct conversion of photoenergy into electric energy with increasing kinetics charge transfer process and provides ca. 10 and 18.5 % lower OER and ORR overpotentials, respectively than those under the dark condition. In addition, the as-fabricated zinc-air battery with the photoactive NCS as the cathode exhibits decrease in voltage gap from 0.82 to 0.60 V with an increasing round-trip efficiency from 59.2 % to 68.8 % after exposed to visible light. The zinc-air battery with a reversible redox reaction for the simultaneous conversion of chemical and photoenergy into electric energy could open a new pathway for the utilization of a single energy conversion and storage device.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17				2566-6223		WOS:000538155500009

However, their large-scale applications are greatly hindered due to the lack of high-efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts. Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have been reported as promising electrocatalysts. Notably, (Ni1_xCrx)2P (0 < x < 0.15) is an unstable electrocatalyst, which undergoes in-situ electrochemical oxidation during the initial oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and even in the activation cycles, and is eventually converted to Cr-NiOOH serving as the actual OER active sites with high efficiency. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations and experimental results elucidate that the OER performance could be significantly promoted by the synergistic effect of surface engineering and electronic modulations by Cr doping and in-situ phase transformation. The constructed rechargeable ZnABs could stably cycle for more than 208 h at 5 mA cm-2, while the voltage degradation is negligible. Furthermore, the developed catalytic materials could be assembled into flexible and all-solid-state ZnABs to power wearable electronics with high performance.@& nbsp;2020 Science China Press.

Therefore, a cost-effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline, neutral or acidic solution is required, based on the use of catalysts incorporating earth abundant elements. This work demonstrates that beta-FeOOH(Cl) nanorod catalysts with high crystallinity and small size (an average diameter of 3 nm and a length of 15 nm) provided the best performance in the OER activity among Fe-based oxide and (oxy) hydroxide catalysts. The pristine beta-FeOOH(Cl) nanorods with the high crystallinity are realized by a new process enabling one-pot, fast, and room temperature synthesis, which is the key to forming colloidal suspensions of the highly crystallized pure-phase beta-FeOOH(Cl) nanorods. The versatility of this process also enabled doping of a wide variety of transition metals. Doping of Ni2+ (at 1.2 at%) improved the OER activity and shifted the threshold potential in the negative direction by 100 mV in an alkaline electrolyte, which was comparable to that of conventional IrOx colloidal nanoparticles.									37	1	0	0	4	0	37			2398-4902			WOS:000422773700022

A new pressure concept with increased compression efficiency, termed intermediate differential pressure polymer electrolyte water electrolysis is proposed. With slightly pressurized oxygen and a much higher hydrogen pressure, this pressure concept profits from the advantages of the lower gas crossover of differential (only hydrogen compressed) pressure water electrolysis and the improved oxygen evolution reaction kinetics with increasing pressure of balanced pressure operation. Data for gas pressures up to 100 MPa is modeled, based on experimental results up to 5 MPa, of the three pressure concepts and validated with literature data up to 70 MPa. While differential pressure electrolyzer operation, following ideal isothermal compression, can be more efficient than today's best mechanical compressors up to 40 MPa, the intermediate pressure concept shows higher compression efficiency up to 90 MPa.

In this work, NiSe-1, NiSe-2 and NiSe-3 were electrodeposited from the baths with different ratios of NiCl2 center dot 6H(2)O and SeO2 (2:1, 1:1 and 1:2) on nickel foam (NFs) as bifunctional electrocatalyst for HzOR and OER. respectively. In comparison with NiSe-1 and NiSe-3, NiSe-2 with nanoporous structure exhibits superior catalytic performance towards OER with a low overpotential of 252 mV vs. RHE to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) and a high durability (16 h at 100 mA cm(-2)). NiSe-2 further shows excellent performance towards HzOR with an enomous current density of 318 mA cm(-2) at 0.4 V vs. RHE and a high stability (24 h at 100 mA cm(-2)). A special mechanism was suggested and demonstrated for remarkably enhanced catalytic performance of bifunctional NiSe-2 electrocatalyst. This can be associated with its high conductivity, uniformly distributed nanoporous structure, large electrochemically surface area and more importance of the superaerophobic surface caused by nanoporous structure of NiSe-2. The as-prepared bifunctional Ni-based selenide catalyst suggests its potential use for HzOR and OER during water electrolysis.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000581151800044

Currently, MnO2-based materials are promising candidates for OER electrocatalysts owing to their abundance and excellent properties. Herein, a hydrothermal method was used to prepare MnO2 nanowires with different diameters. Furthermore, an impregnation method was applied to dope MnO2 nanowires with Ca and Ag ions. Characterization by TEM, XRD, Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N-2 adsorption, and linear-scanning voltammogram analysis were performed on these materials. It was found that the OER activity of as-prepared and doped MnO2 nanowires is highly dependent on the fraction of surface trivalent manganese in MnO2 nanowires. Density functional theory calculations of doped MnO2 revealed the delicate change of the electronic properties of MnO2 nanowires after doping.									37	2	0	0	5	0	37			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000356311200012

The fabrication process involves the pyrolysis of phytic acid doped polyaniline aerogel. A nonaqueous Li-O-2 battery with a specific capacity as high as 12607 mAhg(-1) was constructed by using an oxygen electrode based on NPCNFs supported by Ni foam. The NPCNF electrode showed a lower overpotential than pure carbon. The observed excellent electrochemical performance could be because of the unique foamlike N- and P-codoped carbon microstructure, which had a high ORR catalytic activity. These results indicate that the use of NPCNF as a cathode material could be a feasible approach to obtain a high-capacity Li-O-2 battery.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000397015100007

This study provides evidence that earth-abundant nanoparticles of transition metals encapsulated in a nitrogen-doped carbon shell (M@N-C, M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu or Fe alloys) are promising catalysts in acidic solutions. By density functional theory calculations and experimental validations, we quantitatively propose a method of tuning the ORR activity of M@N-C by controlling the nitrogen-doping level, the thickness of the N-C shells and binary alloying. FeCo@N-C/KB was chosen as the best ORR catalyst because of its onset and half-wave potentials of 0.92 and 0.74 V vs a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively, and its excellent durability. Furthermore, FeCo@N-C/KB possesses a high activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER; -0.24 V vs RHE at -10 mA cm(-2)), thus demonstrating that it is a good bi-functional ORR and HER catalyst in acidic media.									71	1	0	0	3	0	71			1884-4049	1884-4057		WOS:000391939200002

However, their passivating effect becomes questionable when localized defects are formed, since the oxide layers could promote oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) as cathodes for the anodic dissolution of the exposed Fe atoms at the defect sites. Using DFT + U calculations, we investigate the ORRs on the Cr2O3 and Fe2O3 surfaces. We found that the Cr2O3 layer discourages cathodic ORRs more than the Fe2O3 layer due to a higher ORR overpotential and is thus a more effective passive layer. We also checked the overpotentials of the passive layers with Al, Fe, Cr, Mn, Mo, and Ni alloyants. We predict that Mo doping could further suppress the ORRs on both layers. In contrast, Mn is detrimental as it accelerates the oxygen reduction.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000545668100031		
J	PUZIEWICZ, J								TITANIUM ZONING IN BIOTITES - AN EXAMPLE FROM THE STRZEGOM-SOBOTKA GRANITES (SW POLAND)								NEUES JAHRBUCH FUR MINERALOGIE-MONATSHEFTE					7			289	305						JUL 1995	1995	Biotites occurring in the granitoids of the Strzegom-Sobotka massif (SW Poland) commonly exhibit zoning in titanium that decreases from center towards margin. The highest variation in TiO2 observed within an individual biotite is ca. 1 wt%, while the Fe2+/(Fe2+ + Mg) ratio shows no variation in a scale of individual plates. This suggests that titanium diffusion in biotite is too slow to obliterate the content of the element established during crystallization of an igneous mica,,whereas iron and magnesium appear to be highly mobile. Titanium is dissolved in biotite due to heterogeneous reactions involving ilmenite (or other Ti mineral), oxygen, and (in some cases) water or quartz. Once calibrated experimentally, those reactions would yield information relating titanium content in biotite to temperature, oxygen fugacity, and water fugacity (at constant pressure). Zoned distribution of titanium preserves the information on the evolution of those variables during biotite crystallization from a magma.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0028-3649			WOS:A1995RQ32200001

Hence, the formation of laser-supported detonation and combustion processes has been investigated. The essence of this paper is in observing the initiation of chemical reaction between the ablated aluminum plasma and oxygen from air by the high-power laser pulse (>1000 mJ/pulse) and in conducting a quantitative comparison of the chemically reactive laser-initiated waves with the classical detonation of an exploding aluminum (dust) cloud in air. The findings in this work may lead to a new method of initiating detonation from a metal sample in its bulk form without any need to mix nanoparticles with oxygen for initiation.				본 논문에서는 공기 중에서 높은 레이저 복사 조도에 따른 효과에 의해 발생되는 금속 플라즈마의 발달과정에 대하여 레이저 펄스가 끝나는 이후로 쉐도우그래프(Shadowgraph) 가시화 방법을 이용하여 현상을 연구하였다. 따라서 레이저에 의한 데토네이션의 발생과 이를 일으키는 연소 과정 대한 연구가 진행되었다. 본 논문의 가장 중요한 점들은 높은 레이저 에너지에 의해 삭마 된 기체 상태의 알루미늄과 공기로부터의 산소와의 화학반응의 진행을 관측했을 뿐만 아니라, 화학 반응 최종 산화물을 X선 회절 분석법(X-Ray Diffraction)을 통해 관측한 것이다. 그리고 레이저를 통해 유도된 화학적 반응 파와 공기 중에서의 알루미늄 분진 폭발의 데토네이션과의 양적인 평가를 유도하였다. 이러한 연구는 덩어리 상태의 금속 샘플에서 공기 중의 산소를 이용하여 데토네이션을 발생시키는 새로운 방법을 제시할 것으로 여겨진다.					0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1226-4881			KJD:ART001630448

In this work, a highly active single-atomic Pt site photocatalyst was synthesized through employing defective TiO2 nanosheets as solid support for photocatalytic water splitting. It indicated that the surface oxygen vacancies on defective TiO2 nanosheets could effectively stabilize the single-atomic Pt sites through constructing a three-center Ti-Pt-Ti structure. The Ti-Pt-Ti structure can hold the stability of isolated single-atomic Pt sites and facilitate the separation and transfer of photoinduced charge carriers, thereby greatly improving the photocatalytic H-2 evolution. Notably, our synthesized photocatalyst exhibited a remarkably enhanced H-2 evolution performance, and the H-2 production rate is up to 13460.7 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1), which is up to around 29.0 and 4.7 times higher than those of TiO2 nanosheets and Pt nanoparticles-TiO2. In addition, a plausible enhanced reaction mechanism was also proposed combining with photo-electrochemical characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results. Ultimately, it is believed that this work highlights the benefits of a single-site catalyst and paves the way to rationally design the highly active and stable single-atomic site photocatalysts on metal oxide support.

Herein, a one-pot solvothermal method was developed for constructing Pt76Co24 nanomyriapods (NMs) with abundant active sites, where L-glutamic acid and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) were used as the green reductant and structure directing agent, respectively. The architecture had a larger electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 24.49 m(2) g(-1) than Pt49Co51 nanoparticles (NPs, 15.17 m(2) g(-1)), Pt80Co20 NPs (16.71 m(2) g(-1)) and commercial Pt black (20.35 m(2) g(-1)), and exhibited superior catalytic performances for ORR and HER. The mass activity of Pt76Co24 NMs (105.26 mA mg(Pt)(-1)) for ORR was twice as high as Pt black (47.35 mA mg(Pt)(-1)). And the Pt76Co24 NM catalyst exhibited better durability in acid media relative to Pt black and/or Pt/C (20 wt%). This work would have practical applications in catalysis, and energy storage and conversion.									47	4	0	0	1	0	47			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000402387900052

In this article, nanostructured CuCo2Se4 comprising earth-abundant elements have been reported to exhibit superior bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under alkaline conditions. The CuCo2Se4 electrocatalyst with a spinel structure type requires low overpotential of 320 mV to reach current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for OER and 125 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for HER, respectively, which is lower than other reported transition metal chalcogenide electrocatalysts based on Co/Cu, and significantly lower than the well-known precious metal oxide catalysts (IrOx and RuOx). To understand the origin of high catalytic performance in CuCo2Se4, density functional theory (DFT) has been utilized to study the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of bulk CuCo2Se4 as well as slabs with (100) and (111) surface orientations with and without OH- adsorption. The theoretical results show that CuCo2Se4 is in a metallic state with a high electrical conductivity which plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity. Comparison between Co and Cu revealed that Co sites exhibit better OER catalytic activity. Importantly, a surface enhancement of the local magnetic moment on the Co atoms is found to be limited to the top layer in the (100) slab, whereas such variation of the local magnetic moment affects all layers of the (111) slab, strongly favoring OH- adsorption on Co atom at the (111) surface and making the (111) surface more catalytically active. The different surface energies of (111) and (100) surfaces were also observed from DFT studies which will have a pronounced influence on the observed catalytic activity of these surfaces.									29	0	0	0	1	0	29			2574-0962			WOS:000526598300113

Herein, a MOF-derived phosphorization Pern, approach was developed to produce Ni2P-CoP bimetallic phosphides as bifunctional electrocatalysts for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Ni2P-CoP shows superior electrocatalytic activities to both pure Ni2P and CoP toward HER and OER, revealing a strong synergistic effect. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental mapping analysis show that, in the sample Ni2P-CoP, the Ni2P and CoP nanoparticles with an average particle size 10-20 nm were mixed closely on the nanoscale, creating numerous Ni2P/CoP interfaces. By comparison with the sample Ni2P+CoP, in which seldom Ni2P/CoP interfaces exist, we documented that the Ni2P/CoP interface is an essential prerequisite to enhanced electrocatalytic activities in Ni2P-CoP bimetallic phosphides. This finding is meaningful for designing and developing bicomponent and even multicomponent electrocatalysts.									222	9	0	0	10	0	222			1944-8244			WOS:000405764700119	28613810

Nb4N5 interlayers with different thicknesses are formed between Ta3N5 films and Ta back substrates using a thin film transfer method. Zone-axis images and electron diffraction patterns of cross-sections of the resulting Ta3N5/Nb4N5/Ta/Ti electrodes acquired by transmission electron microscopy evidence the formation of a 200 nm thick oriented Ta3N5 grain layer in the vicinity of the interlayer. This oriented Ta3N5 layer promotes electron transport throughout the Ta3N5 film. As a result, a Ta3N5 photoanode incorporating a Nb4N5 interlayer exhibits a higher photocurrent during the oxygen evolution reaction. These results obtained using the Ta3N5/interlayer/substrate configuration elucidate the key role played by the buffer layer in achieving efficient water splitting with Ta3N5 photoelectrodes.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000384238900018

These compounds were synthesized by a facile glycine-nitrate synthesis and the phase formation was confirmed by X-ray and neutron powder diffraction analysis. The apparent OER activity was evaluated by quasi-steady state current measurements in alkaline media using a traditional three-electrode system. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows an increase in Fe substitution causes an increase in the surface concentration of various Co oxidation states. A Tafel slope in the vicinity of 60 mV/decade and electrochemical reaction order for OH-near unity were found for the unsubstituted compounds. A decrease in the Tafel slope to 49 mV/decade was observed when iron is incorporated in high amounts in the perovskite structure. The area specific current density showed dependence on the Fe fraction; however, the dependence of specific current density with Fe fraction is not linear. We believe that the iron incorporation in the La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 perovskites decreases the electron transfer barrier and facilitates the formation of cobalt-hydroxides. (C) The Author(s) 2016.

In particular, carbon-based SMACs exhibit optimal electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) which is of paramount importance for several sustainable energy conversion and generation technologies, such as fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Despite continuous endeavors in developing various advanced carbon-based SMACs for electrocatalytic ORR, the rational regulation of coordination structure and thus the electronic structure of carbon-based SMACs remains challenging. In this review, we critically examine the role of coordination structure, including local coordination structure (i.e., metal atomic centers and the first coordination shell) and extended local coordination structure (i.e., the second and higher coordination shells), on the rational design of carbon-based SMACs for high-efficiency electrocatalytic ORR. Insights into the relevance between coordination structures and their intrinsic ORR activities are emphatically exemplified and discussed. Finally, we also propose the major challenges and future perspectives in the rational design of advanced carbon-based SMACs for electrocatalytic ORR. This review aims to emphasize the significance of coordination structure and deepen the insightful understanding of structure-performance relationships.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-5404			WOS:000829048800001	35867176

However, the sluggish rates of oxygen reactions on the cathode of ZABs demand the preparation of durable, active, and cost-effective oxygen electrocatalysts. Thus, MnO2-based nanoparticles (NPs) have been investigated as potential oxygen electrocatalysts for ZABs, which have the advantages of high activity, cost-effectiveness, and excellent durability. Hence, this review aims to contribute a general outline of advancements in MnO2-based catalysts most recently. The types and structures of MnO2-based NPs, working mechanism, and electrochemistry of rechargeable ZABs are discussed. Then, different synthesis approaches for MnO2 NPs in rechargeable ZABs application are highlighted and summarized. The synthesis approaches of MnO2-based NPs addressed in this review refer to sol-gel, microemulsion, chemical coprecipitation, rheological phase reaction, solid-phase, template, microwave, redox, hydrothermal, and refluxing routes. The impact of the morphology and composition on MnO2-based NPs in their structural characteristics is summarized. Finally, the current challenges and possible strategies for improving the catalytic activity of MnO2-based NPs as air catalysts for ZABs are discussed in detail. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

CHEMCATCHEM				12	2			536	543		10.1002/cctc.201901293		NOV 2019		JAN 18 2020	2020	We perform first-principles calculations to investigate whether or not nitrogen is the best dopant in system of Co-X-4 embedded graphene (X=N, S, B, and P) electrocatalysts towards hydrogen evolution reaction(HER). Our theoretical results reveal that N, S, B, and P-doped graphene can enhance the catalytic activity toward HER compared with the pristine graphene, and S doped graphene exhibits more favorable performance than N doped graphene, consistent with the experimental results. For the Co-X-4 embedded graphene (X=N, S, B, and P), we predict that S may be a promising dopant in graphene supported single atom Co. The rather low hydrogen adsorption free energy (-0.07 eV) and activation energy barrier (0.78 eV) for the rate-determining step, the downshift of the d band center, the enhanced charge density of d(z)(2) orbital as well as the reduced work function are responsible for the unexpected activity of Co-S-4 embedded graphene for HER. Overall, Co-S-4 embedded graphene catalyst could be a good candidate for hydrogen evolution reaction.									21	0	0	0	4	0	21			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000500394900001

It is reported that octahedrally coordinated Co3+ (Co-oh(3+)) is considered as active sites in spinel Co3O4, but there is still a lack of sufficient evidence to prove the effect of Co species. In this work, we synthesized accurately the three spinel Co3O4 samples with different exposed crystal planes to investigate the reaction mechanism between methane molecule and Co species. The activity results show that methane oxidation activities follow an order of Co3O4-(2 2 0) > Co3O4-(3 1 1) > Co3O4-(1 1 1). A series of in-situ characterization analyses are performed to explore the evolution process of Co species and the transform of lattice oxygen species for methane combustion. The results indicate that the high catalytic activity is assigned to the exposed state of surface lattice oxygen atoms and the mutual transformation of Co3+ oh and Co2+ 0h . Therefore, it explained that the high activity of the (2 2 0) crystal plane is mainly involved with the high exposure of Co3+ and surface lattice oxygen. Adsorption oxygen species were induced to reactive oxygen species during the transformation of Co3+ oh stable structure and Co2+ oh unstable structure.									4	1	0	0	1	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000734414100006

The efficiency of such a hybrid system strongly depends on the electrocatalyst used for hydrogen production. Here we evidence that a mixed noble metal free Co/Cu-containing polyoxometalate/Carbon Cloth (Cu6Co7/CC) hybrid possesses excellent activity as a water splitting pre-electrocatalyst at neutral pH, with Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) overpotentials of 390 mV and 500 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slopes of 96 mV dec(-1) and 147 mV dec(-1), respectively. The nature of the catalysts involved for both the oxidation and reduction processes has been investigated. The long-term activity of the electrodes is also demonstrated. A negligible amount of H2O2 is produced during the electrolysis process. CO2 fixation with wild-type R. eutropha and the biocompatible Cu6Co7/CC precatalyst as both anode and cathode materials has been tested. The hydrogen produced on the cathode is consumed by the bacteria for living and growth with more than 50% of input electrical energy transferred into biomass. The solar-to-biomass efficiency (SCE) can reach 9.9 +/- 0.5% in a 6-day experiment, almost 10 times higher than those of natural plants, showing the high performance of this Cu6Co7/CC/R. eutropha system.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000434241800017

However, efficient improvement of the performance of the oxidation half-reaction during water splitting, thus enhancing H-2 evolution efficiency, has become an urgent issue. Herein, non-precious metal Co0.83Ni0.17 alloy nanoparticles on activated carbon (Co0.83Ni0.17/AC) have been successfully fabricated by a simple thermal-treatment method. The resulting Co0.83Ni0.17/AC with a dominant alloy particle size of 45 nm exhibits a microporous and mesoporous structure with a surface area of 159.2 m(2) g(-1). As an electrocatalyst, the as-prepared Co0.83Ni0.17/AC demonstrates bifunctional electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, delivering overpotentials of 193 and 325 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Importantly, it is found that the electrocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid on Co0.83Ni0.17/AC is more favourable than the OER process, with almost 224 mV less overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) and 96% faradaic efficiency at 1.425 V vs. RHE (passing charge amount of similar to 40C). As a simultaneous anode and cathode electrocatalyst for water splitting, Co0.83Ni0.17/AC displays a H-2 generation rate of 8.98 mmol min(-1) in 1.0 M KOH solution containing 10 mM benzyl alcohol, almost 1.4 times that obtained by an OER-introduced water splitting system, with near 98% faradaic efficiency for H-2. This work would be helpful to develop low-cost and abundant bifunctional electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic organic synthesis and simultaneously improving H-2 generation from water splitting.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000430996700080

Herein, a hybrid catalyst film composed of Cu2Se and Cu2O nanoparticles directly grown on Ti foil (Cu2Se-Cu2O/TF) was prepared through a simple and fast cathodic electrodeposition method. Surprisingly, this electrode required a relatively low overpotential of 465 mV to achieve a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER in 0.2 M carbonate buffer (pH = 11.0). Furthermore, a long-term constant current electrolysis test confirmed the high durability of the Cu2Se-Cu2O/TF anode at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) over 20 h. The XRD, TEM and XPS analysis of the sample after the OER indicated that a CuO protective layer formed on the surface of the Cu2Se-Cu2O catalyst, which effectively suppressed further oxidation of the Cu2Se-Cu2O catalyst during the OER and resulted in sustained catalytic oxidation of water.									29	1	0	0	1	0	30			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000435872900019	29707718

Herein, an efficient oxygen reduction catalyst was rationally designed by constructing ultrasmall Pt and Pt/MoC dual active sites co-anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon. Owing to the synergistic effect of the dual active sites, the optimized Pt-MoC@NC delivers superior oxygen reduction activity with ultralow Pt loading. Especially, the Pt-MoC@NC shows robust methanol tolerance. As the cathodic catalyst, Pt-MoC@NC based zinc-air battery possesses outstanding performance with a large peak power density of 100 mW cm(-2) and long charge-discharge durability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2199-692X			WOS:000870535000001

Modified sol-gel synthetic route used for the synthesis of NiO/ZnO green nano-hybrids ([NiO/ZnO]-GNH) is devoid of utilization of any chemical-reducing agents. Efficient [NiO/ZnO]-GNH electro-catalysts were characterized for various aspects using Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR), gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), field emission scanning electron micrographs (FE-SEM), UV-Visible spectrophotometry (UV-Vis), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) steps of water splitting reactions were evaluated via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) via fabrication of modified Ni-foam electrode through decoration of [NiO/ZnO]-GNH. The as-synthesized [NiO/ZnO]-GNH promises electro-catalytic performance with a small over-potential of 0.42 V and 264 mV for OER and HER, respectively, for the achievement of a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). Results of the current work can be extended to the practical scale adoption of the fabricated electro-catalysts through optimized investigation and economical evaluation for the consolidation of environmental sustainability and green energy production.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1751-8253	1751-7192		WOS:000642486000001

Rational design and development of an effi-cient and stable OER electrocatalysts are of enormous importance but still challenging for electrochemical energy conversion. In this work, a unique nanoflower like electrocatalyst consisting of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles wrapped with amorphous Ni based nanosheet on the 3D porous iron foam (IF) substrate (named as Ni-ANS@NiFe2O4/IF) is proposed and the evolution of catalyst morphology and its effect on electrochemical activity were explored. Profiting from the unique nanoflower structure and the coupling of ample active substances with favorable conductive substrates, the prepared Ni-ANS@NiFe2O4/IF exhibits outstanding OER activity with low over -potential of 209, 251, 270 mV to reach a current density of 10, 100 and 200 mA cm-2, and admirable long-term stability.

The mass evolution as a function of immersion time is measured for different solid phases such as iron, lepidocrocite, magnetite and ferrous hydroxide. Results show that in the presence of oxygen, gallic acid enhances the initial dissolution of iron due to complexation with ferrous ion. The ferrous complex is subsequently oxidized into an insoluble ferric complex leading to a reduction in the anodic reaction rare. No magnetite is formed under these conditions. in the absence of oxygen, magnetite is formed by reduction of lepidocrocite on precorroded steel coated with films not containing gallic acid. When gallic acid is present in the paint film the reductive transformation of lepidocrocite to magnetite is inhibited. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, a thin Si absorber causes insufficient absorption of light and it should be needed to solve problems. Here, a 21-mu m-thin Si photoanode for which a NiOx-coated silicon nanopyramid (SiNP) is employed is presented as a solution. The NiOx/n-SiNP structures improved the light absorption as well as the total number of catalytic sites to enable photo-oxidation reactions. A photocurrent of 7.7 mA/cm(2) was generated at the equilibrium potential of the OER (E-OER = 1.23 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode in a 1 M KOH solution). Also, the photoanode did not show any degradation over the 24 hr of a photoelectrochemical water-oxidation process. (c) 2017 The Electrochemical Society.

However, as a H-2-evolution cocatalyst, the improved photocatalytic performance by metallic Ag is quite limited due to its low H-2-evolution rate. In this study, for the well-known TiO2/Ag photocatalyst, Ag2S as the efficient H-2-evolution active sites was selectively loaded on the metallic Ag surface to greatly promote the interfacial H-2-evolution reaction rate. In this case, the TiO2/Ag-Ag2S sample was synthesized by a two-step process including the simple photoinduced deposition of metallic Ag on the TiO2 surface and the following in situ sulfidation of partial Ag into Ag2S. Photocatalytic experimental results indicated that the TiO2/Ag-Ag2S(40uL) photocatalysts clearly exhibited a significantly higher UV-light photocatalytic H-2-evolution activity (119.11 mu mol h(-1)) than the pure TiO2, TiO2/Ag and TiO2/Ag2S photocatalysts by a factor of 51.8, 3.9 and 3.6 times, respectively. On the basis of the present results, a synergistic effect of dual electron-cocatalyst (metallic Ag and Ag2S) is proposed for the improved photocatalytic H-2-evolution activity, namely, the Ag-nanoparticle cocatalyst can steadily capture and transfer the photogenerated electrons from TiO2 surface, while the Ag2S cocatalyst is considered to be the interfacial active sites to promote the rapid H-2-evolution reaction. This research may provide new strategies for the development of highly efficient photocatalytic materials used in various fields.									135	14	0	0	15	0	135			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000424719300043

Herein, a cost-effective and ecofriendly strategy is reported to fabricate coral-like FeNi(OH)(x)/Ni as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in alkaline media. With the assistance of mild corrosion of Ni by Fe(NO3)(3), in situ generated FeNi(OH)(x) nanosheets are intimately attached on metallic coral-like Ni. Integration of these nanosheets with the electrodeposited coral-like Ni skeleton and the supermacroporous Ni foam substrate forms a binder-free hierarchical electrode, which is beneficial for exposing catalytic active sites, accelerating mass transport, and facilitating the release of gaseous species. In 1.0 mol L-1 KOH solution, a symmetric electrolyzer constructed with FeNi(OH)(x)/Ni as both the anode and the cathode exhibits an excellent activity with an applied potential difference of 1.52 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to that of an asymmetric electrolyzer constructed with the state-of-the-art RuO2-PtC couple (applied potential difference of 1.55 Vat 10 mA cm(-2)). This work contributes a facile and reliable strategy for manufacturing affordable, practical, and promising water-splitting devices.

How to construct high-activity sites for the reversible ORR and OER together in the air cathode still remains challenging. Herein, by introducing Fe into Co-doped carbon, an efficient bifunctional ORR and OER electrocatalyst with multiple active sites of uniformly dispersed alloy nanoparticles, atomic-scale metal-N coordinated species and pyridinic-N groups has been successfully prepared by mechanochemical condensation and subsequent pyrolysis. Fe-doping into a Co-based system not only results in the formation of alloyed FeCo nanoparticles that greatly enhance the OER kinetics, but also helps increase the ratio of pyridinic-N and metal-N groups and promote electron transfer between the metal and N, significantly improving the ORR activity. DFT calculation reveals that the FeCo alloy is more energetically favorable than pure Co in the OER process through increasing the adsorption energy for OH and accelerating the dehydrogenation step. The ZABs assembled using the optimized electrocatalysts as the air cathode exhibit outstanding charge and discharge performance, large power density, and long cycling life, much better than those using precious metal catalysts Pt/C and RuO2. The present study presents a scalable mechanochemical strategy to synthesize low-cost carbon-based materials with well-defined multiple active sites, showing great promise in energy storage, adsorption, and catalysis.									38	2	0	0	0	0	38			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000482139000013		
C	Prater, DN; Rusek, JJ						Wilson, A		Hydrogen peroxide reduction cathode utilizing enzyme electrocatalysis								PROCEEDINGS OF THE SIXTH EUROPEAN SPACE POWER CONFERENCE (ESPC)		ESA Special Publications		502				705	709						2002	2002	The electrochemical reduction of hydrogen peroxide on noble metal catalyst surfaces is hindered by the evolution of oxygen, as well as a reaction mechanism that involves an adsorption step, which decreases electrical potential and thermodynamic efficiency. The only way to overcome this loss is to produce a catalyst with an associated reaction mechanism that realizes the full reduction energy of hydrogen peroxide. Increasing reduction potential through a change in the properties of the reaction mechanism via properties of the catalyst, without a compromise in current density, would offer an enhancement. While it is still to be determined whether or not this actually does involve a change in the reaction mechanism of hydrogen peroxide reduction, changes in the half-reaction voltage may be realized by new catalytic methods.Following recent work on bioelectrocatalysis for the fabrication of biosensors, it is proposed that a fuel cell electrode be produced utilizing enzyme electrocatalysis. One effect of bioelectrocatalysis research has been the invention of enzyme immobilization methods such that the kinetic effectiveness is not hindered, while maintaining direct (mediatorless) transfer of electrons between the enzyme and the electrode. The properties of enzyme electrocatalysis result in an electrode that operates at a higher potential than previous noble-metal catalysed electrodes for hydrogen peroxide reduction, yet with sufficient current density to make its use worthwhile in a fuel cell for the production of power.In this paper, a number of oxido-reductases (enzymes that participate electro-catalytically in a reduction or oxidation reaction) are investigated for their suitability as an electrocatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of hydrogen peroxide. The criteria of suitability include a high reduction potential (not yet realized with noble metal catalyzed electrodes), a proper reaction mechanism that does not involve excessive oxygen evolution, and sufficient current density.					6th European Space Power Conference (ESPC)6th European Space Power Conference (ESPC)	MAY 06-10, 2002MAY 06-10, 2002	European Space Agcy; Univ Porto, Fac Engenharia; EFACEC, Sistemas Electr SAEuropean Space Agcy; Univ Porto, Fac Engenharia; EFACEC, Sistemas Electr SA	OPORTO, PORTUGALOPORTO, PORTUGAL	4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0379-6566		92-9092-812-3	WOS:000176274600108

A suitable electrocatalyst (represented by platinum-based catalyst) is required to catalyze this reaction process. However, the limitation of poor stability and high cost from platinum-based materials have seriously hindered the commercial development of zinc-air batteries. Considering the importance of stability, tungsten carbide (WC) is an extremely attractive candidate material because of its high electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance. Herein, Fe, Co co-doped tungsten carbide/nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst (FeCo-WC/NC) was synthesized by hydrothermal assisted vacuum rapid calcination. The Fe and Co with d-orbital multi-electron transition metals can adjust the electronic structure of WC, reduce the energy barrier of oxygen reduction reaction, and improve the catalytic efficiency. FeCo-WC/NC exhibited a high limiting current density of 5.62 mA cm(-2), a positive half-wave potential of 0.85 V and excellent stability. Zinc-air batteries successfully assembled by FeCo-WC/NC showed a power density of 122.52 mW cm(-2), a specific capacity of 744 mAh g(-1) and outstanding cyclical stability.

In this work, a three dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous nickel and iron based sulfide (Ni-Fe-S) with a sea urchin-like morphology is synthesized by a facile sulfurization of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) precursors with a hydrothermal reaction and post-calcination treatment. The mass ratio of PBA and sulfur sources, the hydrothermal temperature and time, and the presence of hydrazine hydrate are found to be important factors for the formation of the unique sea urchin-like materials with the porous carbon layer and mixed phases of Fe5Ni4S8 and NiS, which are conducive to fast mass and charge transfer along various directions, endow the materials with mixed valences, improve the electronic conductivity and prevent the agglomeration of nanostructured sulfides. Benefiting from these fascinating advantages, the optimal Ni-Fe-S catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activities with an overpotential as low as 200 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and good stability toward the OER.

Simplification of the synthesis process is the key to realize mass production. In this work, quaternary Ni-Co-S-P nanoparticles (NPs) were directly grown on carbon fiber cloth via a summary one-step electrodeposition process. The interconnected nanoparticles are instrumental in increasing the specific surface area and accelerating mass transfer, thus enhancing the electrocatalytic overall water-splitting performance. Moreover, their superhydrophilic and superaerophobic properties could facilitate the diffusion of medium and the rapid delivery of the generated bubble. As a result, bifunctional Ni-Co-S-P nanoparticles (NPs) achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 280 and 78 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively, along with the Tafel slopes of 69 and 89 mV dec(-1). Besides, the Ni-Co-S-P displays an excellent performance with a cell voltage of 1.61 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water-splitting. Moreover, benefiting from the superhydrophilic and superaerophobic characteristics, Ni-Co-S-P also exhibits robust stability and durability for both the OER and HER. This paper provides a new idea for simplifying the synthesis process of electrocatalysts.									35	0	0	0	2	0	35			2168-0485			WOS:000484071600036

The study compared the behavior of three commercially available sulfones: ethyl vinyl sulfone (EVS), tetramethylene sulfone (TMS), also called sulfolane, and ethyl methyl sulfone (EMS). First, we carried out a preliminary investigation of the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) as a function of solvent type and Li+ concentration. Then, TMS and EMS were tested (LiTFSI salt) in Li-O-2 cells. The cells exhibited initial capacities around 1800 and 2000 mAh.g(carbon)(-1), respectively. The capacity retention on cycling was quite low. We analyzed the reaction products during discharge and charge by means of powder X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, H-1-nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry. Although EVS was at first sight the most attractive sulfone, since it is a liquid at room temperature, it was the least stable in the presence of oxygen; its vinyl group was attacked by reduced O-2 species. On the other hand, both TMS and EMS performed better during the first five cycles; Li2O2 formation and decomposition was the main reaction, although some byproducts formed during cycling. After five cycles, there was still a considerable amount of Li2O2 formed, but decomposition to form Li2CO3 became significant, and it accumulated at the O-2 electrode. This was the likely reason for capacity fading.									38	2	0	0	1	0	39			1932-7447			WOS:000340809600009

However, classical electrochemical tests usually provide coupled multi-reaction currents. Furthermore, dissolved oxygen makes in situ measurements significant due to the thermodynamic instability of Ti. In this study, the effects of pre-reduction and dissolved oxygen on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics on the Ti surface were investigated by electrochemical and composition characterizations. The HER current was quantitatively separated from the apparent cathodic current from Ti, including the reductions of the oxide film, H+, and O-2 by scanning electrochemical microscopy. The HER transfer coefficient and standard rate constant for Ti spontaneously passivated in air (P-Ti) are both 0.48/4.9 x 10(-12) cm/s in aerated and O-2-saturated solutions, while those for Ti activated by electro-reduction (EA-Ti) are 0.25/3.6 x 10(-7) cm/s and 0.25/3.1 x 10(-7) cm/s, respectively. The variable HER behavior is caused by the changes in the film electronic structure and composition except for the competition reduction between O-2 and H+ as indicated by Mott-Schottky and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. The deviation from 0.5 in the transfer coefficient implies that the Tafel slope and HER mechanism should be analyzed with caution.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000746409200001

Herein, we reported the synthesis of trifunctional catalysts with three-dimension (3D) hierarchically porous nitrogen-doped carbon framework with Ni-Co dual metal-involving and carbon nanotubes growth derived from nickel metal-organic framework. The as-synthesized catalyst exhibited better oxygen reduction reaction performance under both neutral and basic conditions compared with commercial Pt/C catalysts. Under basic electrolyte, the oxygen evolution reaction performance of the synthesized catalyst was comparable to that of commercial IrO2 catalysts and reasonable hydrogen evolution activity was achieved compared with reported non-noble metal-based catalysts. The assembled microbial fuel cell using the as-prepared material as the air electrode exhibited a maximum power density of 1971.2 mW m(-2) and could steadily operate for more than 250 h of feed period. Furthermore, the Zn-air battery fabricated with the obtained catalyst showed excellent power density and rechargeability, which were superior to that of a Zn-air battery using Pt/C/IrO2 as the air electrode. We anticipate that the results described here can provide a new idea for design of multifunctional electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage devices.

However, the reasons for the low rate of electrocatalytic oxygen evolution and issues of long-term material stability, which are central constraints for attaining desirable efficiency for sustainable technologies like water electrolysis or electrochemical CO2 reduction, are still not completely resolved. While a lot of attention has been directed towards the search for new materials with unique (electro) catalytic properties, experimental results accumulated during the last four decades and prediction from models suggest that RuO2 possesses superior activity for oxygen evolution under acidic conditions. Considering that RuO2 is a material of choice, we show that tailoring the surface morphology on the meso- and macroscale has great potential for the improvement of the efficiency of this gas evolving reaction. Advanced analytical tools have been utilized for the combined investigation of both activity and stability. Namely, the potential dependent frequencies of gas-bubble evolution, an indicator for the activity of the electrode, were acquired by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), while the dissolution of RuO2 was monitored using a micro electrochemical scanning flow cell combined with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (SFC-ICP-MS). The obtained fundamental insights will aid improving the design and thus performance of electrode materials for water oxidation.									91	3	0	0	5	0	93			2046-2069			WOS:000331191200025

A lab-scale solar reactor has been designed to test and analyze solar-driven reduction of non-volatile metal oxides arranged in a packed bed. The test bed allows monitoring of oxygen evolution to determine the reaction rate. Experimental tests with Mn2O3, Mn3O4 and CeO2 have been carried out and the performance of each reaction has been analyzed. Total conversion is obtained for Mn2O3 reduction. However, only some zones of the Mn3O4 and CeO2 samples achieve reaction temperature. Different types of sample-holders have been used to hold the particles packed-bed, in order to enhance the conversion. The high influence of the irradiance distribution on the sample surface is demonstrated by a testMn(3)O(4) reduction.

J	Hsiao, Hsin-Ying; Chuang, Min-Chieh								Eliminating Evolved Oxygen through an Electro-flocculation Efficiently Prompts Stability and Catalytic Kinetics of an IrOx center dot nH(2)O Colloidal Nanostructured Electrode for Water Oxidation								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				137				190	196		10.1016/j.electacta.2014.06.003				AUG 10 2014	2014	A facile approach which harnesses dual-potential pulsed amperometric technique to expedite the water oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions intermittently through an electro-flocculation is reported. The new strategy yields discriminated physical morphology and chemical composition of as-prepared IrOx center dot nH(2)O, compared with the previous approach, which lead to an alteration of kinetic mechanism and enhancement of stability in alkaline solution (pH 12). By the virtue of the catalyst architecture efficiently producing electroactive Ir sites (Gamma(ea) = similar to 4 x 10(-8) mol mol/cm(2)), eta for water oxidation was measured to be 0.22 V (at current density of 1.2 mA/cm(2)). The tafel slope was estimated to be 29 +/- 1 mV per decade, suggesting the recombination of S-O-ads as the rate determining step. Contrast to the considerably flocculated structure reported previously, the IrOx center dot nH(2)O construction herein was well-defined sphere-like clusters (5-10 nm) and resides separately. Furthermore a XPS examination revealed that the oxygen-containing constituents of the prepared IrOx, regardless of preparation techniques, were hydroxides (dominate) and hydrated water, instead of the lattice oxide ions. IrOx center dot nH(2)O formed using the present strategy yielded O-to-Ir ratio to be 2.9, which was substantially lower than 6.4 of a hydroxide-abundant constituent prepared without intermittent elimination of oxygen.

However, going beyond state-of-the-art catalysts that are based on expensive noble metals remains a major challenge. Recently, nanostructured composites of conductive carbons and earth-abundant metals or metal oxides have emerged as promising electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a versatile and inexpensive synthetic method for the production of metal@metal sulfide core-shell nanoparticles (metal = cobalt, nickel) embedded in the walls of sulfur- and/or nitrogen-doped hollow carbon capsules. Metal oxide nanoparticle shells were also generated as an alternative to the metal sulfide shells. The fabrication of these materials was achieved via the thermal decomposition of sacrificial metal-organic framework nanocrystals coated with a metal-tannic acid coordination polymer shell, which delivered zerovalent metal nanoparticles embedded in the walls of the nitrogen-doped hollow carbon capsules. Subsequent pyrolysis processing in the presence of thiourea produced the metal sulfide nanoparticle shell. Alternatively, an oxide shell was generated under oxidizing conditions. The supported metal@metal sulfide and metal@metal oxide core-shell nanoparticles proved to be excellent catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of oxygen and evolution of oxygen from water, and they were far superior to analogous zerovalent metal nanoparticles. The materials produced accordingly allow the elucidation of key structure-activity relationships, and these insights reveal promising next-generation catalysts for important electrochemical processes that are derived from earth-abundant components.									40	1	0	0	4	0	40			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000459331600012

The characteristics of polydopamine-coated surfaces were explored by varying dopamine concentration and polymerization time for noble metal deposition, which is a key for the development of advanced catalysts. The variation of these parameters for dopamine coating on carbon nanofibers (CNFs) finally modulated the amount of palladium (Pd) nanoparticles deposited on the dopamine-coated surface, which is CNFs. The results showed that the higher the dopamine concentration, the larger the amount of deposited Pd, while the polymerization time is inversely proportional to the amount of Pd deposited. Thereby, the optimally functionalized surface for Pd deposition was found with a dopamine concentration of 3mg mL(-1) and a reaction time of 6 hours (PDAT1). This optimum Pd/CNF hybrid material showed very promising electrochemical and catalytic performances with a high discharge capacity of about 5.26 mA h cm(-2) which could be maintained up to the 67th cycle at a cut-off capacity of 0.2 mA h cm(-2) in non-aqueous Li-O-2 batteries and an impressive catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction via the preferred 4 electron pathway in aqueous electrolyte.									30	3	0	0	4	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463819400008

In the measurements, a continuous flux of methanol at excess in the gas phase and pulses of atomic oxygen were provided to the surface kept at 230 K. The formation of the partial oxidation product methyl formate under the applied conditions was evidenced by time-resolved mass spectrometry, and accumulation of formate species, which resulted in a deactivation of the surface for methyl formate formation, was followed by in situ Infrared Reflection Absorption Spectroscopy measurements. The results suggest a different reactivity of oxygen accumulated during the oxygen pulses and atomic oxygen for the competing reaction pathways in the oxidation of methanol to the desired partial and the unwanted overoxidation products.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000698613900001	34558565

Only recently have SOA models been developed that explicitly represent multi-generational SOA formation. In this work, we integrated the statistical oxidation model (SOM) into SAPRC-11 to simulate the multi-generational oxidation and gas/particle partitioning of SOA in the regional UCD/CIT (University of California, Davis/California Institute of Technology) air quality model. In the SOM, evolution of organic vapors by reaction with the hydroxyl radical is defined by (1) the number of oxygen atoms added per reaction, (2) the decrease in volatility upon addition of an oxygen atom and (3) the probability that a given reaction leads to fragmentation of the organic molecule. These SOM parameter values were fit to laboratory smog chamber data for each precursor/compound class. SOM was installed in the UCD/CIT model, which simulated air quality over 2-week periods in the South Coast Air Basin of California and the eastern United States. For the regions and episodes tested, the two-product SOA model and SOM produce similar SOA concentrations but a modestly different SOA chemical composition. Predictions of the oxygen-to-carbon ratio qualitatively agree with those measured globally using aerosol mass spectrometers. Overall, the implementation of the SOM in a 3-D model provides a comprehensive framework to simulate the atmospheric evolution of organic aerosol.									24	0	0	0	7	0	24			1991-959X	1991-9603		WOS:000360652200008

At a 0.1 mg loading, OER studies of Cu-Cu(2)ONPs@C showed a significantly low overpotential of 530 mV@10 mA cm(-2) with the applied potential of 2.07 V in 0.4 M KOH. HER studies showed an overpotential of -672 mV@10 mA cm(-2) with the applied potential of -1.058 V in 0.4 M H2SO4. Cu-Cu(2)ONPs@C showed a good electrocatalytic current density of 57.7 mA cm(-2) for OER and -125 mA cm(-2) for HER at a significantly low catalyst loading. For controlled studies, Cu(2)ONPs and CuNPs in carbon matrix have also been synthesized, and their catalytic activities (OER and HER) have been compared with those of the hybrid Cu-Cu(2)ONPs@C. The comparative studies indicated that the presence of conducting metal CuNPs along with Cu(2)ONPs in the carbon matrix enhanced the electrocatalytic activity for both OER and HER as compared to that of pure Cu(2)ONPs and CuNPs in the carbon matrix. Interestingly, the solvent used for fabricating different NP electrodes has also shown significant influence on the electrocatalytic current density. The synthesized hybrid Cu-Cu(2)ONPs@C, Cu(2)ONPs@C, and CuNPs@C were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and BET analysis. To the best of our knowledge, the fabricated hybrid Cu-Cu2ONP@C exhibited a strong bifunctional electrocatalytic response at a high current density with a low catalyst loading (0.1 mg) among the different Cu-based nanostructured catalysts explored for the water splitting reactions.									39	0	0	0	4	0	39			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000427157000020

The emerging and cost-effective molybdenum phosphide electrocatalyst was appropriately optimized and used as a bifunctional catalyst in an alkaline electrolyte for both SOR and HER. Powered by state-of-the-art perovskite-Si tandem photovoltaics, a remarkable photocurrent density of over 17 mA cm(-2) was achieved in the HER coupled with the SOR. In addition to the significantly enhanced photocurrent, the SOR can further reduce the overall cost of solar H-2 production owing to the elimination of the expensive membranes required for H(2 & nbsp;)and O-2 gas separation. Considering the high global demand for desulfurization via the SOR, the strategy proposed here will enable practical H-2 production from renewable sources while effectively converting the toxic SO2 gas into a value-added product for the chemical industry.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000783086800001

Co9S8 is known for its intrinsic structural and electronic properties favorable for electrocatalytic applications, but the synthesis of stoichiometrically optimal Co9S8 electrocatalysts remains challenging. Herein, a facile one-step solid phase calcination approach is presented in which Co9S8 nanoparticles (NPs) were concurrently synthesised on carbon nanosheets (CNSs). The reaction mechanism for this synthesis was systematically investigated using TG/DSC-MS analysis. Relative to other cobalt chalcogenide electrocatalysts, the as-prepared thermally stable nanocomposite (Co9S8/CNS) has better electrocatalytic performance for the OER in alkaline electrolytes, exhibiting a smaller overpotential of 294 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 50.7 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, a minimum overpotential of 267 mV with a Tafel slope of 48.2 mV dec(-1) could be achieved using highly conducting multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as a conducting filler in the nanocomposites.									81	6	0	0	1	0	83			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000390083200015

Because unknown surface species may result from air exposure, we developed a clean transfer system for the air-free electrochemical investigation of epitaxial thin films fabricated under typical surface science conditions. LaNiO3 electrocatalysts exposed to ambient air exhibit a lower activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction than samples probed without air exposure. We demonstrate that this decrease in activity is connected to an alteration of the chemical environment of the electrocatalytically active sites through carbonate formation on exposure to CO2. Our study therefore shows that (1) the effects of air exposure must be considered for transition metal oxide catalysts and (2) that for the perovskite oxide LaNiO3 the clean surface is more active than the air-exposed surface.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000670013400001

Herein, a simple and cost-effective autologous growth method is developed to prepare NiFe-based integrated electrodes for water oxidation. In this method, a Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet film is first developed on nickel foam by oxidative deposition in a chemical bath solution. The as-prepared nanosheet electrode is then immersed into a solution containing Fe(iii) cations to form an Fe-doped Ni(OH)(2) electrode by utilization of the different solubility of metal cations. Benefiting from its unique and integrated nanostructure, this hierarchically structured electrode displays extremely high catalytic activity toward water oxidation. In 1 M KOH, the electrode can deliver a current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of only 330 mV. This work provides a facile way to produce an efficient, durable, and Earth-abundant OER electrocatalyst with no energy input, which is attractive for large-scale water splitting.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2046-2069			WOS:000476751400011	35518845

Yet, it is expensive as well as scarce and therefore needs to be used most efficiently. In order to reduce the amount of necessary Pt we propose a synthesis approach to alloyed RuPt nanoparticles which retain the enhanced catalytic activity of Pt. These particles are dispersed on an electrically conductive, highly accessible and stable carbon coating. The synthesis route relies on the co-deposition of molecular Ru and Pt precursors together with a carbon precursor with micelles as structure directing pore templates. The films adhere without the use of binding agents like Nafion, which can decrease catalytic activity by blocking of pores and active surface sites. Carbonization in reducing atmosphere (H-2/Ar) leads to ordered mesoporous carbon films with a controlled morphology and a very high electrical conductivity. The films exhibit well dispersed small nanoparticles.The presented RuPt catalyst films show a four times higher activity per Pt in the hydrogen evolution reaction compared to conventional Nafion-based Pt/C reference catalysts. Moreover, the synthesis approach represents a generic approach to ordered mesoporous carbon coatings containing metal nanoparticles.

Herein, an in-depth investigation into the gas evolution on the air electrode is conducted by in-situ characterization. It is found that the charging process can be divided into three stages: no obvious bubbles, small bubbles owing to the oxygen evolution, and large bubbles owing to oxygen evolution and carbon corrosion. The post analyses illustrate that the severe bubble formation can deteriorate the electrochemical performance of the air electrode. With the catalyst loading increases, the bubbles on the surface become smaller and sparser. At low current densities, the air electrode can keep "selfclean" from bubbles, which is the ideal state for the charge. Whereas with an increase of the current density, the large-bubble stage is enlarged, and more bubbles are attached to the surface, leading to extra charge impedance. As the extent of discharge/charge reduces, the three stages disappear, and only small bubbles can be found on the surface, which is favourable for the stable operation. This work provides a profound understanding of the charging behaviors on the air electrode, facilitating the development of high-performance Zn-air and other metal-air batteries.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729781800001

The interaction among these species is described by a model that incorporates the most important plasma chemical processes, such as ionization, electron attachment and detachment, electron impact dissociation and excitation, and clustering. The spatio-temporal evolution of charged and neutral species and their reaction rates are evaluated along different moments during the pulses. The case of the first Trichel pulse is considered separately, since its characteristics clearly differ from the subsequent pulses. The results show that the negative space charge is constituted of different types of ions, depending on the stage of the pulse. Moreover, a spatial segregation of negative ions is observed during the post-pulse period. Regarding neutral species, ozone increases linearly with time, without being considerably affected by the occurrence of pulses.									17	3	0	0	1	0	18			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000342678900014

The 3D electrode with large accessible active sites and improved conductivity, possesses an optimized ionic and electronic transport path during electrochemical processes. High areal capacitance of 1.65 F cm(-2) is obtained at an ultrahigh current density of 100 mA cm(-2), which is 19.88 times higher than pristine NF. The direct growth of nanowires makes the present supercapacitor electrode robust for long-term cycling test. By virtue of the favorable hydrogen adsorption energies on Ni-0 and OHads energy on NiO or NiOOH, the 3D electrode exhibits high performance in hydrogen evolution reaction with 146 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel value of 72 mV dec(-1), and oxygen evolution reaction with 382 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel value of 103 mV dec(-1) in 1 m KOH. An electrolyzer using 3D electrodes as both anode and cathode can yield a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.71 V, and possesses superior long-term stability to an electrolyzer consisting of Pt/C parallel to Ir/C. The present work develops an effective and low-cost method for the large-scale fabrication of Ni/NiO core-shell nanowires on commercial NF, providing a promising candidate for supercapacitors, fuel cells, and electrocatalysis.									114	5	0	0	7	0	116			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000440561400002	29971960

The innovative catalyst not only has the advantages of 1D nanowires and 2D nanosheets, but also forms 1D/2D bonding heterostructures and spherical cactus-like 3D morphology. Under the synergy of heterostructures and 3D morphology, when the electrolyte is alkaline, the overpotential required in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is low. In addition, when the catalyst is subjected to overall water splitting in a two-electrode system of an alkaline electrolyte, it can also obtain a desired current density at a low overpotential. Moreover, when the material is used in electrolytes with different alkalinity, it demonstrates excellent stability under different electrolytes. A good industrial application prospects can be expected for the transition metal electrocatalyst. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a novel strategy is employed to construct a heterojunction consisting of metal phosphide NixFeyP and layered double hydroxide (LDH) with graphene oxide (GO) as conductive support. By adjusting the molar ratio of Ni to Fe, a series of heterojunctions with mixed valence state Fe delta+/Fe3+ and Ni delta+/Ni2+ (delta is likely close to 0) redox couples are achieved and strong synergistic effects towards overall water splitting performance are found. The optimized catalyst with a Ni/Fe molar ratio of 0.72:0.33, namely Ni-0.7 Fe0.3P/LDH/GO, delivers ultra-low overpotentials for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of 79 and 198 mV at the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, for overall water-splitting practical application, it only requires 1.526 V at 10 mA.cm(-2) with robust stability, which is superior to most reported electrocatalysts. Experimental results demonstrate the improved electronic conductivity, enlarged electrochemically active area and accelerated kinetics together account for the enhanced performance. This work supplies new prospects for the promotion and application of such heterojunction electrocatalysts in overall water splitting.									3	3	0	0	0	0	5			0254-5861			WOS:000791003300006

Carrying out the two reactions separately is challenging, since the catalytic intermediates are linked by scaling relations. Optimizing the efficiency of OER over CER in acidic media has proven especially difficult. In this regard, we have investigated the OER versus CER selectivity of manganese oxide (MnOx), a known OER catalyst. Thin films (similar to 5-20 nm) of MnOx were electrodeposited on glassy carbon-supported hydrous iridium oxide (IrOx/GC) in aqueous chloride solutions of pH similar to 0.9. Using rotating ring-disk electrode voltammetry and online electrochemical mass spectrometry, it was found that deposition of MnOx onto IrOx decreases the CER selectivity of the system in the presence of 30 mM Cl- from 86% to less than 7%, making it a highly OER-selective catalyst. Detailed studies of the CER mechanism and ex-situ structure studies using SEM, TEM, and XPS suggest that the MnOx film is in fact not a catalytically active phase, but functions as a permeable overlayer that disfavors the transport of chloride ions.									134	5	0	0	4	0	136			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000442183700032	30024752

The electrochemical redox characteristics such as peak multiplicity, peak currents and peak potentials on these electrodes under both potentiostatic steady state and cyclic voltammetric conditions were obtained. The anomalies associated with the redox peak potential values both in the anodic and cathodic branches of the cyclic voltammograms were attributed to the distinct electrochemical behaviour of bismuth/antimony on the electrode surface along with silver. The behaviour of these electrodes for the electrocatalytic cathodic reduction of oxygen was also investigated both by potentiostatic steady state and cyclic voltammetric techniques under rotating conditions. The kinetic parameters corresponding to the electrochemical reduction of oxygen on these electrodes were obtained. These electrodes were ranked with respect to their electrocatalytic activity both for the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			0021-891X			WOS:A1993LP63300006

Although abundant of alternative materials have been developed, Pt/C remains the most efficient electrocatalyst for the ORR and HER. Nevertheless, improving the stability and reducing Pt loading for Pt-based electrocatalysts are still big challenges. Herein, semiconductor crystals Na4Ge9O20 with richer topology structure was chosen as electro- catalyst support, subsequently, the conductive polymer polyaniline (PANI) was decorated on semiconductor Na4Ge9O20, low-content Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) with the size of 1-3 nm were then uniformly anchored on the surface of Na4Ge9O20-PANI to obtain the efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR and HER in the acidic solution. More importantly, the stability and mass activity of the obtained electrocatalyst 5 wt% Pt/Na4Ge9O20-PNAI are significantly higher than that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C for ORR and HER. It was proposed that the PANI could not only promote the electron transfer from Na4Ge9O20 to Pt, but also stabilize the Pt NPs, thus, improving the electrocatalytic activity and stability of 5 wt% Pt/Na4Ge9O20-PNAI.

Recently, non-metal doped nanosheets of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as a promising Pt-free electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, we investigate the potential of nitrogen- and phosphorus- (N- and P-) doped TMDs (MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2) as high-performing electrocatalysts for ORR using first principle calculations, motivated by recent experimental advances to incorporate single S/Se vacancies on the surface of TMD monolayers using electrochemical methods. We observed a strong hybridization of p-orbitals of N/P atom with the p- and d-orbitals of neighbouring S/Se and Mo/W atoms, respectively, activating pristine TMDs by increasing density of states near Fermi-level. Based on the free energy profiles of the four-electron reduction process, we expect that N-TMDs to be efficient in catalyzing ORR, whereas, too strong binding of reaction intermediates prevents ORR on P-TMDs. Among the candidates considered, N-WS2, is found to be a promising TMD as ORR catalyst with the overpotential as low as 0.31 V, stimulating further experimental studies.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			2196-0216			WOS:000461673300029

Here we extend a series of studies that examine pH-dependent surface potentials and electron-transfer properties of effectively perfect low-index crystal faces of hematite in contact with simple electrolyte. Zero-resistance amperometry (ZRA) was performed in a two electrode configuration to quantify spontaneous dark current between hematite crystal face pairs (001)/(012), (001)/(113), and (012)/(113) at pH 3. Exponentially decaying currents initially of up to 200 nA were reported between faces over 4 min experiments. Fourth-order ZRA kinetics indicated rate limitation by the OER for current that flows between (001)/(012) and (001)/(113) face pairs, with the (012) and (113) faces serving as the anodes when paired with (001). The cathodic partner reaction is reductive dissolution of the (001) face, converting surface Fe3+ to solubilized aqueous Fe2+, at a rate maintained by the OER at the anode. In contrast, OER rate limitation does not manifest for the (012)/(113) pair. The uniqueness of the (001) face is established in terms of a faster intrinsic ability to accept the protons required for the reductive dissolution reaction. OER rate limitation inversely may thus arise from sluggish kinetics of hematite surfaces to dispense with the protons that accompany the four-electron OER. The results are explained in terms of semiquantitative energy band diagrams. The finding may be useful as a consideration for tailoring the design of polycrystalline hematite photoanodes that present multiple terminations to the interface with electrolyte.									30	2	0	0	4	0	31			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000348688700021	25506667

The controlled distribution of amorphous phase at the nanoscale in materials, however, remains a substantial challenge, which results in the absence of an underlying relationship between the amorphization level and the catalytic activity. In this work, we successfully realize identified amorphization of ultrathin two-dimensional alpha-Ni(OH)(2) nanomeshes through Fe doping, by which the amorphization rates can be controlled over 10-78% in area ratios with the desired amount of Fe doping. The localized amorphization dramatically accelerates the reaction kinetics and thus enhances the overall performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Specifically, a strong correlation between the OER activity and the amorphization rate is discovered, and alpha-Ni0.75Fe0.25(OH)(2) with the highest amorphization rate of 78% achieves the highest catalytic activity. The enhanced catalytic activity is dominantly attributed to the doping-induced localized amorphization, which provides more accessible active sites and responsible local chemical environments than the fully crystallized structures. The understanding of the amorphization-catalytic activity relationship thus provides new insight into developing highly efficient catalysts.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000661562200001

Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of CoFe2Se4/NiCo2Se4 hybrid nanotubes (CFSe/NCSe HNTs) with open ends and abundant heterointerfaces. The CFSe/NCSe HNT hybrid nanotubes are obtained by using NiCo2-aspartic acid nanofibres (NiCo-Asp NFs) as the templates which can be converted to the CFSe/NCSe HNTs via proton etching, three metal coprecipitation, Kirkendall effect and anion-exchange reaction. The CFSe/NCSe HNTs may function as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts, and they exhibit a low overpotential of 224 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and outstanding stability with only 1.4% current density change even after 15 h, superior to those of the reported single-component counterparts. The obtained density of states and differential charge density confirm the existence of a heterointerface which can induce the accumulation of electrons at the interface of CFSe-NCSe and consequently increase the carrier density and electrical conductivity of the CFSe/NCSe HNTs. This research provides a new avenue for the fabrication of hollow nanohybrids with heterointerfaces.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000631583300001	33885610

Particle precipitation zones (PPZs) were observed and analyzed for the composition and thickness. After heating at 1273 K for 10 h, 30 h, and 50 h, the composition of precipitated particles was Ca-Ti-O and TiOx in diffusion couples with a slag phase of CaO center dot Al2O3 (CA). The precipitates changed into mainly Ca-Si-O when the slag phase was 3CaO center dot Al2O3 (C(3)A) or 12CaO center dot 7Al(2)O(3) (C(12)A(7)). Elements of calcium and oxygen diffused from the slag phase to the steel phase were proved not to be from the decomposition of calcium aluminates, but ion diffusion under concentration gradients. The thickness of the PPZ increased from 1.5 mu m to 14.8 mu m with the increase of CaO/Al2O3 ratio of the slag phase and the heating time. The dissolved oxygen at the slag-steel interface calculated by the dynamic model demonstrated that the oxygen delivery capacity of calcium aluminates increased with their CaO/Al2O3 ratios. The evolution path of Ca-Ti-O to Ca-Si-O calculated by FactSage primely explained the precipitation variance of diffusion couples with various slag phases. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

The LMR cathode shows much higher Delta S than other conventional layered-structure cathode materials during the initial activation of the Li2MnO3 component associated with the concurrent extensive Li+ ion removal, oxygen evolution, and structural rearrangement. The evolution of entropy change during cycling correlates well with the transformation from layered to spinel-like phase. The reversible heat generation rate related to entropy changes dominates the thermal behavior of the LMR cathode at low rate conditions, especially during the initial charging process. The contribution of the reversible heat generation rate decreases in the subsequent cycles due to increased overpotential during cycling. These results provide valuable information on the fundamental mechanism of voltage fade in LMR cathodes and for thermal management of batteries using these materials.

In this article, a bi-functional catalyst (Co-NC@CoFeS2) towards ORR and OER is synthesized via the simple insitu growing of cobalt-iron sulfide on cobalt and nitrogen co-doped polyhedral carbon (Co-NC). The combination of cobalt-iron sulfide and Co-NC substrate not only enlarges accessible channels for the reaction but also promotes electron transfer in the catalytic process. Benefiting from the synergy of the Co-NC substrate and the supported cobalt-iron sulfide in regulating the electrochemical interfaces, the electrical conductivity and the electronic structure, a narrow voltage gap of 0.646 V between the OER potential at 10 mA cm-2 and the halfwave potential of the ORR is observed for Co-NC@CoFeS2, showing an enhanced catalytic capability than that of the standard Pt/C + RuO2 composite. Moreover, a rechargeable Zn-air battery with Co-NC@CoFeS2 as an air electrode exhibits a large open-circuit voltage (1.44 V), high peak power density (174.4 mW cm-2), and long cycle life (over 400 cycles). Therefore, this work provides a new vision for the design and preparation of promising functional electrocatalysts for Zn-air batteries.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000704003100004

The interfacial catalytic models of LixO(2) (x = 4, 2, and 1) molecules adsorbed on 3d-TMC surfaces were used to simulate discharging (oxygen reduction reaction, ORR) and charging (oxygen evolution reaction, OER) processes. The calculated results indicate that the TiC surface has smaller ORR and OER overpotentials, which may be due to the maximum catalytic activity of 3d-TMCs. Taking overpotentials as the measurement of catalytic activity, some intrinsic properties related to catalytic activity are determined, including adsorption energies of Li and LiO2, surface energy, and binding energy of O. The catalytic activities of 3d-TMCs for ORR and OER are inversely proportional to the adsorption energies of Li and LiO2. The ORR overpotentials are proportional to the surface energies of 3d-TMC surfaces, but the relationship between OER overpotentials and the surface energies is not clear. TiC has a moderate binding energy of O atom. Additionally, when the bonding state tends to be saturated, namely, Fermi level happens to be in pseudogap, the catalytic activity reaches its maximum. By calculating ORR and OER overpotentials and establishing the correlation between catalytic activity and relevantly the intrinsic properties of 3d-TMCs, our investigation is helpful for screening and designing highly active catalysts to enhance ORR and OER in Li-O-2 batteries.									19	2	0	0	1	0	19			1932-7447			WOS:000441484600025

Herein, a newly designed hybrid catalyst with Cr-doped FeNi-P nanoparticles encapsulated into N-doped carbon nanotubes (Cr-doped FeNi-P/NCN) with unprecedented electrocatalytic activity is developed by a simple one-step heating treatment. The as-synthesized Cr-doped FeNi-P/NCN with moderate Cr doping exhibits admirable oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction activities with overpotentials of 240 and 190 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH solution. When used in overall water splitting as a bifunctional catalyst, it needs only 1.50 V to give a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to its typically integrated Pt/C and RuO2 counterparts (1.54 V @ 10 mA cm(-2)). Density functional theory calculation confirms that Cr doping into a FeNi-host can effectively alter the relative Gibbs adsorption energy and reduces the theoretical overpotential. Additionally, the synergetic effects between Cr-doped FeNi-P nanoparticles and NCNs are regarded as significant contributors to accelerate charge transfer and promote electrocatalytic activity in hybrid catalysts.									224	13	0	0	13	0	225			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000468033400024	30791164

Here, we briefly review the framework and foundation of first-principles-aided thermodynamic models and highlight its contribution to stability analysis on catalysts and identification of reaction-induced structural evolution of catalyst under reaction environment. The present review is helpful for understanding the ongoing developments of first-principles-aided thermodynamic models, which can be employed to screen high-stability catalysts and predict their structural reconstruction in future rational catalyst design.

However, in many cases, our synthetic control over particle size, composition, and shape is limited requiring trial and error. Deeper atomic-scale insight in the particle formation process would enable more rational syntheses. Here we exemplify this using a family of trimetallic PtNiCo nanooctahedra obtained via a low-temperature, surfactant-free solvothermal synthesis. We analyze the competition between Ni and Co precursors under coreduction "one-step" conditions when the Ni reduction rates prevailed. To tune the Co reduction rate and final content, we develop a "two-step" route and track the evolution of the composition and morphology of the particles at the atomic scale. To achieve this, scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray elemental mapping techniques are used. We provide evidence of a heterogeneous element distribution caused by element-specific anisotropic growth and create octahedral nanoparticles with tailored atomic composition like Pt1.5M, PtM, and PtM1.5 (M = Ni + Co). These trimetallic electrocatalysts have been tested toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), showing a greatly enhanced mass activity related to commercial Pt/C and less activity loss than binary PtNi and PtCo after 4000 potential cycles.									122	8	0	0	7	0	124			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000364725400045	26441293

Herein, Ag-MnFe2O4 heterojunction nanoparticles supported on N, S, P-codoped graphene (NSPG) are developed with enhanced ORR and OER bifunctional electrocatalytic activities and stability. In contrast, S, P-doped graphene (SPG) and N, P-doped graphene (NPG) show less stabilization for the heterojunction particles. For example, under alkaline conditions, the ORR half-wave potential of Ag-MnFe2O4/NSPG can reach 0.831 V, and the over potential for OER is 0.56 V at the current density 10 mA center dot cm(-2). Furthermore, Ag-MnFe2O4/NSPG shows better methanol resistance and durability than Pt/C catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2073-4344		WOS:000736107300001

The LAB cells with MnSI exhibited a larger first discharge capacity and better cycle performance (893 mAhg(-1), 738 mAh g(-1) up to 10 cycles) than those without MnSI. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) conducted during the discharge/charge cycle showed deposition and decomposition of the discharge product, Li2O2 , on the surface of the air electrode. Cyclic voltammetry results suggested that MnSI promotes the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction because of its high reactivity with O-2.

The mesoporous structure of carbon facilitates the mass transport and availability to the Fe-N sites during the ORR; however, the construction of mesoporous carbon architecture with highly exposed and accessible Fe-N active sites remains challenging. Herein, 3D-to-2D transformation of zeolitic imidazolate frame-work-7 (ZIF-7) was successfully achieved via convenient impregnation in ammonium ferric citrate aqueous solution. After pyrolysis, isolated Fe-N sites are generated and confined within highly mesoporous carbon without using any additional modulator or template. The optimal Fe-N catalyst exhibits excellent performance toward ORR in alkaline medium, exceeding commercial 40% Pt/C catalyst in terms of activity, stability, and methanol resistance.									75	5	0	0	4	0	75			2155-5435			WOS:000414724700029

To predict the evolution of slag-metal composition and temperature, it is important to control the process efficiently. The framework developed by Sarkar et al. (Metall Mater Trans B 46:961-976, 2015) is advanced further to estimate the evolution of chemical composition and temperature of molten metal and slag. In this present study, a period of flight is considered for droplets at the early period of blow when stable emulsion has not formed. The size distribution of the droplets is evaluated according to the Rosin-Rammler-Sperling distribution. A coupled mixed-controlled kinetic model is incorporated in order to quantify the extent of reaction at the interface of a single droplet in the emulsion phase. This kinetic model assumes that transport of species in both metal and slag phases are rate controlling. Reaction kinetics of these individual droplets are tracked at each time step throughout its period of residence in the metal-slag-gas emulsion, to predict the evolution of the metal and slag compositions for the entire converter with blowing time. Evolution of the bath temperature is estimated by developing a thermal model. The predictions from the model, when validated with plant trial data, could efficiently simulate the phosphorus and manganese reversal phenomena, along with the early removal of silicon (Cicutti et al. in 6th International Conference on Molten Slags, Fluxes and Salts, Stockholm-Helsinki, 2000, Paper 367, pp. 1-9, 2000).									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000626411400001

Perovskite oxides serve as attractive candidates given their structural and compositional flexibility in addition to high intrinsic catalytic activity. In a departure from the conventional doping approach utilizing metal elements only, here it is shown that non-metal element doping provides an another attractive avenue to optimize the structure stability and OER performance of perovskite oxides. This is exemplified by a novel tetragonal perovskite developed in this work, i.e., SrCo0.95P0.05O3-delta (SCP) which features higher electrical conductivity and larger amount of O2(2-)/O-species relative to the non-doped parent SrCoO3-delta (SC), and thus shows improved OER activity. Also, the performance of SCP compares favorably to that of well-developed perovskite oxides reported. More importantly, an unusual activation process with enhanced activity during accelerated durability test (ADT) is observed for SCP, whereas SC delivers deactivation for the OER. Such an activation phenomenon for SCP may be primarily attributed to the in situ formation of active A-site-deficient structure on the surface and the increased electrochemical surface area during ADT. The concept presented here bolsters the prospect to develop a viable alternative to precious metal-based catalysts.									205	12	0	0	7	0	207			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000383608400009

While regulating the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process via introducing additive into the system has been reported effective in promoting OER activity, controlling the PCET process by tuning the intrinsic material properties remains a challenging task. In this work, we take double perovskite oxide PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+delta (PBSCF) as a model system to demonstrate enhancing OER activity through the promotion of PCET by tuning the crystal orientation and correlated proton diffusion. OER kinetics on PBSCF thin films with (100), (110), and (111) orientation, deposited on single crystal LaAlO3 substrates, were investigated using electrochemical measurements, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and synchrotron-based near ambient X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results clearly show that the OER activity and the ease of deprotonation depend on orientation and follow the order of (100) > (110) > (111). Correlated with OER activity, proton diffusion is found to be the fastest in the (100) film, followed by (110) and (111) films. Our results point out a way of boosting PCET and OER activity, which can also be successfully applied to a wide range of crucial applications in green energy and environment. Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) has been observed in chemical, energy, and biological transformation processes. Here we demonstrate that the rate of PCET and oxygen evolution reaction can be dramatically enhanced by tuning crystal orientation and the correlated proton diffusion.									43	0	0	0	2	0	43			2041-1723			WOS:000567931900004	32855418

We syntheized few-layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets as the piezoelectric catalyst for ultrasonic vibration (US)-coupled PMS system toward enhanced pollutant abatement. Scavenger tests, dissolved oxygen (DO) exclusion experiment and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) identify that sulfate radical (SO4.-) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) are the primary ROS in the US/MoS2/PMS system. Particularly, O-2(.-) is a vital intermediate for O-1(2) generation, and multiple formation pathways of O-1(2) were proposed in the US/MoS2/PMS system. With the assistance of DO and ultrasound, the utilization efficiency and activity of PMS will be remarkably increased because the majority of PMS evolves into more reactive SO4.- and O-1(2) for pollutant degradation. This work not only provides mechanistic insights into the interconnected regimes of piezocatalysis and heterogeneous Fenton-like reactions, but also achieves high chemical efficiency for sustainable water remediation.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000815993800005

Electrodeposition and electrocatalytic performance of Ni-Co alloy								Journal for Electrochemistry and Plating Technology				17				2	13		10.12850/ISSN2196-0267.JEPT3530				Aug. 2014	2014	The electrodeposition of Ni-Co alloy coatings on pure copper has been carried out at different current densities (c.d.) from an aqueous sulphate bath at room temperature. The effects of c.d. on deposit characters such as composition, hardness and thickness have been studied. The electrodeposited Ni-Co coatings were tested for their electro-catalytic behaviors, namely for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 6M KOH by cyclic voltammetry and chrono-potentiometry techniques. The surface morphology and phase structure of the deposit corresponding to different c.d.s were studied using, respectively FEGSEM and XRD study. The chrono-potentiometry study revealed that Ni-Co alloy coating deposited at 4.0 Adm-2 is more electro active for HER and that deposited at 1.0 Adm-2 is more electro-active for OER. Hence, Ni-Co alloy coatings deposited at 4.0 Adm-2 and 1.0 Adm-2 can be used as efficient electrode materials for, respectively HER and OER reactions finds applications in fuel cells as demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chrono-potentiometry experiments. The characteristic electro catalytic behaviour of the coatings for HER and OER are attributed to the inherent phase structure, composition, specific surface area and porosity of the coated materials under test, determined by the cathode current density at which they are deposited, supported by FEGSEM and XRD study.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0267			INSPEC:15169368

In experiments examining the corrosion of Al alloy 6061 in borated solutions simulating the water chemistry of post-LOCA sump water, HE rates were evaluated by analyzing the potentiodynamic cathodic polarization curves from rotating cylinder electrodes, and an empirical formula predicting the HE rates as a function of solution pH was proposed based on the evaluation results. At pH 7, the dominant cathodic reaction during free corrosion was found to be the oxygen reduction reaction and the HE rate was slow; however, the HE reaction became increasingly significant as the solution pH progressively increased to 11. The HE sources on the alloy surface were inferred to be mainly the bulk matrix, which was covered with a less protective hydroxide film in more alkaline solution, as well as the trenches formed by the intense anodic dissolution of the matrix around electrochemically more noble Fe-bearing intermetallic particles. Local alkalization due to preferential oxygen reduction on these intermetallic particles may also contribute to the formation of such trenches and HE; however, this mechanism should have been mostly suppressed by the buffering capacity of the borated solutions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0029-5493	1872-759X		WOS:000514621600016

Additionally, methanol electro-oxidation can replace the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction when coupled to hydrogen evolution or to the electroreduction of other biomass-derived intermediates. But the cost-effective realization of these reaction schemes requires the development of efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts. Here, a noble metal-free catalyst, Ni1-xFexSe2 nanorods, with a high potential for an efficient and selective methanol conversion to formate is demonstrated. At its optimum composition, Ni0.75Fe0.25Se2, this diselenide is able to produce 0.47 mmol cm(-2) h(-1) of formate at 50 mA cm(-2) with a Faradaic conversion efficiency of 99%. Additionally, this noble-metal-free catalyst is able to continuously work for over 50 000 s with a minimal loss of efficiency, delivering initial current densities above 50 mA cm(-2) and 2.2 A mg(-1) in a 1.0 m KOH electrolyte with 1.0 m methanol at 1.5 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. This work demonstrates the highly efficient and selective methanol-to-formate conversion on Ni-based noble-metal-free catalysts, and more importantly it shows a very promising example to exploit the electrocatalytic conversion of biomass-derived chemicals.									10	1	0	0	1	0	10			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000608216900001	33458957

The deposition conditions have been optimized for peak performance of their electrocatalytic behavior, like hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1M KOH. Corrosion behaviors of the coatings have also been tested under study conditions of electrocatalysis. Electrocatalytic behaviors were tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry techniques. Experimental results demonstrated that Ni-W alloy coatings, deposited at low and high current densities (c. d.) were showing superior performance for OER and HER, respectively. Better electrocatalytic activity for HER with increase of deposition c. d. was attributed by the unique phase structure, surface morphology and chemical composition of the coatings, confirmed by XRD, SEM and EDX analysis. The dependency of coating thickness and hardness on HER and OER were analyzed, and results are discussed.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0255-5476			INSPEC:15876373

Herein, an electrically conducive porous NiCuC substrate was adopted to develop a mull-porous NiCuOx/NiCuC hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst using a one-step oxidation method in this research. The NiCuOx hybrids were characterized as three typical layers: an outer layer with NiCuO2 solid solution phase, a partially oxidized intermediate layer, and an inner layer with limited stable oxygen content. The NiCuOx/NiCuC possesses abundant Ni(II)-Cu(II) sites to accelerate the Volmer step via the electrostatic effect with OH-, numerous metallic NiCu sites to facilitate the H adsorption, and highly accessible channels to promote the Heyrovsky step during HER catalysis. As a result, high electrocatalytic performance was obtained with an overpotential of 116 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M potassium hydroxide, and a stable catalytic performance during the HER process for more than 24 h.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000525637300080

People have been committed to the development of alternative precious metal-free OER electrocatalysts, especially electrocatalysts for alkaline media. In this study, we report the application of Sr-6(Co0.8Fe0.2)(5)O-15 (SCF-H) perovskite oxide with a hexagonal phase structure in the field of OER electrocatalysis. Synthesized by a simple and universal sol-gel method, the SCF-H perovskite oxide shows prominent OER activity with an overpotential of 318 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of only 54 mV dec(-1), which is significantly better than the cubic phase structure SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (SCF-C), benchmark noble-metal oxide RuO2 and Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF). Compared with cubic SCF-C, the hexagonal SCF-H perovskite oxide has abundant surface oxygen species (O-2(2-)/O-), a faster charge transfer rate, and a higher electrochemical surface area. In addition, the DFT calculation results show that the center of the O p-band of SCF-H is closer to the Fermi level than that of SCF-C, which leads to the better OER activity of SCF-H. This work finds that the new hexagonal structure perovskite may become a promising OER electrocatalyst.									3	0	0	0	0	0	2			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000784945500001	35451444

In this work, we have prepared new Al-doped Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays grown on Ni foam (Al-Ni3S2/NF) as an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Al-Ni3S2/NF electrode obtained only requires extremely low overpotentials of 86 and 223 mV for the HER and OER to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, respectively. Moreover, the electrolytic cell assembled using this electrode as both cathode and anode provides a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an extremely low battery voltage of 1.58 V relative to that with Ni3S2/NF (1.71 V). Additionally, both experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the increased electrochemical active surface area and optimized intermediate adsorption free energies are responsible for the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. This work provides a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for water electrolysis in alkaline media with broad application prospects.									19	1	0	0	2	0	20			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000600106100035	33291125

Here, the sacrificial template-assisted transformation of cobalt hydroxide nanowire (Co(OH)(2) NW) into a metal-organic framework network (MOF) is conceived as a porous structure that provides extremely active and durable electrochemical energy conversion characteristics. After this, the 1D MOF modified Co NWs can be further transformed into a hybrid structure (MOF CoSeO3 NWs) by selenization. The self-template transformation strategy allows the interconnected porous conductive network to be exposed to abundant reactive sites and to improve electronic conductivity/structural integrity. Thus, the obtained catalyst established by electrocatalytic activity in the course of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 M KOH solution requires overpotentials (ii) of 290 and 150 mV to achieve a current density of 50 and 10 mA cm(-2) for both OER and HER. Interestingly, as a full cell water electrolyzer (MOF CoSeO3 NWs (+) // MOF CoSeO3 NWs (-)), the MOF CoSeO3 NW's modified electrode exhibits an affordable cell voltage of 1.675 Vat a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). This work involves a viable and systematic strategy to prepare many other functional integrated MOFs that can be used for energy storage and conversion in multiple applications.									25	0	0	0	5	0	25			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000526414000050	32090552

Water electrolysis for H-2 production is an efficient process but it demands the development of resourceful, low-cost electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work aims to apply carbon supported PdCu3 nanoparticles as electrocatalysts in HER, seeking to understand the influence of atomic chemical environment changes on their activities. Since thermal treatments affect chemical bonds, thus electrodes produced with these nanocatalysts are heated either in air or under vacuum. XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) yields precise information on metallic sites evolution, and our analyses infer that thermal treatment in air favours the formation of Pd-O bonds and a strong Cu oxidation. Concomitantly, these electrodes achieve the highest exchange current density and improved catalytic activity. In contrast, the electrodes treated in vacuum form Cu-F bonds and exhibit low activity. These findings strongly indicate that our methodology leads to economically viable copper rich Pd-Cu electrodes, whereas the presence of CuO on the nanoparticles surfaces is a key factor for their improved activity owing to Cu leaching and/or CuO metallization mechanism during HER, and consequent Pd-enrichment of the nanoparticles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000724307800001

In this paper, we prepared a nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (NCNT)-enhanced threedimensional self-supported electrocatalyst with CoP and Co2P coexistence by a two-step strategy of high-temperature carbonization and low-temperature phosphorylation. Furthermore, the induced three-dimensional carbon network skeleton facilitates rapid charge transfer. In addition, the active sites of the carbon foam (CF) are greatly increased by the construction of hollow structures. As a bifunctional electrocatalyst, CoP/Co2P/NCNT@CF exhibited excellent catalytic activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media, requiring low overpotentials of 133 and 289 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm-2, respectively. Additionally, the synthesized catalysts also exhibit good long-term stability, maintaining high catalytic activity after 20 h of continuous operation. We also confirmed the main driving force to improve the electron transfer between the heterostructures of Co and P by XPS spectra. The excellent electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to the close synergy between the highly active CoP/Co2P/NCNT and CF. This study provides a new strategy for the design of highly active bifunctional self-supporting electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-1343			WOS:000812765500001	35474771

In this study, with MOFs as precursors, a facile coprecipitation method is designed to realize in-situ growth of the CoNi anchored carbon nanoparticle/nanotube (CoNi/N-CNN) hybrid, which can achieve the simultaneous maximum exposure of both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) active centers. Benefiting from the unique structure, the CoNi/N-CNN catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for ORR (Eonset = 1.183 V, E1/2 = 0.819 V) and a low operating voltage of 1.718 V at 10 mA cm-2 (Ej=10) for OER. Delightfully, the home-made rechargeable Zn-air battery with CoNi/N-CNN delivers a high discharge power density up to 209 mW cm-2, and an outstanding charge-discharge cycling stability. The boosted bifunctional elec-trocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the strong coupling effect between Co/Ni center sites and defect -rich N-anchored carbon featured with porous and nanotube structure, which can introduce uniformly dispersed active sites, tailored electronic configuration, superb conductivity and convenient charge trans-fer process. The hybrid non-precious bimetal based electrocatalyst provides the possibility to develop the low-cost and high-efficient ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalysts in rechargeable metal-air battery.

Herein, Fe-doped NiS2 crystals grown on the surface of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) encapsulated with NiFe alloy nanoparticles ((Ni,Fe)S2/NiFe-CNFs) are fabricated through an electrospinning-calcination-vulcanization process, which has been used as a splendid electrocatalyst for OER. Benefitting from the abundant electrochemical active sites from the incorporation of Fe element in NiS2 and the synergistic effect between NiFe-CNFs and surface sulfides, the obtained (Ni,Fe)S2/NiFeCNFs catalyst exhibits highly electrochemical activities and satisfactory durability toward OER in an alkaline medium with a low overpotential of only 287 mV at a high current density of 30 mA cm-2, and with a little decline in the current retention after 48 h, suggesting its superior OER performance even compared with some noble metal-based electrocatalysts. Additionally, a two-electrode system conducted by using the (Ni,Fe)S2/NiFe-CNFs and commercial Pt/C as electrodes, only needs a cell voltage of 1.54 V to afford 10 mA cm-2 for overall water splitting, which is even much better than the RuO2||Pt/C electrolyzer.

This is due to their exceptional properties and advantages over con-ventional materials. They have appealing two-dimensionalities, crystallinity, connecting metal ions with organic linkers, ultrahigh surface areas, nanoscale structures, tunable cage/porous sizes, large surface-to -volume ratios, a larger number of active metal ion sites, flexible skeletons, proficiency in electron trans-ports and transfer capability, and reasonable design strategies. Distinctly, the current study presents recent advances in the 2D MOFs for environmental remediations, energy conversion, and biomedical applications. It started with a comprehensive review of the synthesis strategies of the 2D materials, fol-lowed by the strategic modification approach for 2D MOFs for different applications. Unlike the available reviews in the field, the study includes detailed discussions in the biomedical (including biosensing, ther-apeutic delivery, bioimaging, biocatalysis, photodynamic therapy, biocompatibility, and toxicity), envi-ronmental remediations of pollutants (focusing on the various organic and inorganic pollutants remediations), and energy conversion (including nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), overall water splitting, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with the corresponding performance of 2D MOFs in these fields, fundamental concepts and mechanisms. The new engineering strategic protocols for accelerating the performance of 2D MOF materials for various applications and some insights into future research dis-cussed in the present study were absent in the available literature. To bridge the knowledge gaps, some associated weaknesses and strengths, and the treatment strategies of the past studies were discussed. In addition, some vital outlooks and recommendations for advancing the 2D MOFs and the corresponding applications in biomedical, environmental remediations of organic and inorganic pollutants, NRR, CO2RR, OER, ORR, HER, and overall water splitting toward realistic industrial expectations were dis-cussed.

J	Duan, Yanjie; Huang, Zhixiong; Ren, Jingyu; Dong, Xiangbin; Wu, Qingsheng; Jia, Runping; Xu, Xiaowei; Shi, Shaojun; Han, Sheng								Highly efficient OER catalyst enabled by in situ generated manganese spinel on polyaniline with strong coordination								DALTON TRANSACTIONS				51	23			9116	9126		10.1039/d2dt01236g		JUN 2022		JUN 13 2022	2022	The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as the rate-determining step of electrochemical water splitting, is extremely crucial, and thus it is a requisite to engineer feasible and effective electrocatalysts to shrink the reaction energy barrier and accelerate the reaction. Herein, monodisperse Mn3O4 nanoparticles on a PANI substrate were synthesized by polymerization and in situ oxidation. Combining Mn3O4 nanoparticles and PANI fibers can not only maximize the strong coupling effect and synergistic effect but also construct a well-defined three-dimensional structure with extensive exposed active sites, where the permeation and adherence of the electrolyte are made exceedingly feasible, thus displaying excellent OER activity. Benefiting from the outstanding structural stability, the resulting Mn3O4/PANI/NF is able to deliver a low overpotential of 262 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which outperforms the commercial RuO2 catalyst (275 mV) as well as presently reported representative Mn-based and PANI-based electrocatalysts and state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts. The synthetic method for Mn3O4/PANI not only provides a brand-new avenue for the rational design of inorganic material/conductive polymer composites but also broadens the understanding of the mechanism of Mn-based catalysts for highly enhanced OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000806471900001	35666657

The evolution of oxygen and hydrogen by m-ZrO2-supported ferrite powders was studied, and reproducible and stoichiometric oxygen/hydrogen productions were demonstrated through a repeatable two-step reaction. Subsequently, a ceramic foam device coated with NiFe2O4/m-ZrO2 powder was made and examined as a water splitting device by the direct irradiation of concentrated Xe-light in order to simulate solar radiation. The reaction mechanism of the two-step water splitting cycle is associated with the redox transition of ferrite/wustite on the surface of m-ZrO2. A hydrogen/oxygen ratio for these redox powder systems exhibited good reproducibility of approximately two throughout the repeated cycles. The foam device loaded NiFe2O4/m-ZrO2 powder was also successful with respect to hydrogen production through 10 repeated cycles. A ferrite conversion of 24-76% was obtained over an irradiation period of 30 min. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									93	5	0	0	4	0	94			0038-092X			WOS:000265170700010

The direct nucleation and growth of electrochemically active LDH materials on chemically modified MWCNTs exhibit considerable electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution from water oxidation. CoMn-based and NiMn-based hybrids were syntheSiied using a facile chemical bath deposition method and thews-synthesized materials exhibited three-dimensional hierarchical configurations with tunable Co/Mn and Ni/Mn ratio. Benefiting from enhanced electrical conductivity with MWCNT backbones and LDH lamellar structure, the Co5Mn-LDH/MWCNT and Ni5Mn-LDH/MWCNT could generated a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of similar to 300 and similar to 350 mV, respectively, in 1 M KOH.

J	Chen Jianpo; Ren Bowen; Cui, Hao; Wang Chengxin								Constructing Pure Phase Tungsten-Based Bimetallic Carbide Nanosheet as an Efficient Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Overall Water Splitting								SMALL				16	23					1907556	10.1002/smll.201907556		MAY 2020		JUN 2020	2020	Carbides are commonly regarded as efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts, but their poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activities seriously limit their practical application in overall water splitting. Here, vertically aligned porous cobalt tungsten carbide nanosheet embedded in N-doped carbon matrix (Co6W6C@NC) is successfully constructed on flexible carbon cloth (CC) as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting via a facile metal-organic framework (MOF) derived method. The synergistic effect of Co and W atoms effectively tailors the electron state of carbide, optimizing the hydrogen-binding energy. Thus Co6W6C@NC shows an enhanced HER performance with an overpotential of 59 mV at a current density of -10 mA cm(-2). Besides, Co6W6C@NC easily in situ transforms into tungsten actived cobalt oxide/hydroxide during the OER process, serving as OER active species, which provides an excellent OER activity with an overpotential of 286 mV at a current density of -10 mA cm(-2). The water splitting device, by applying Co6W6C@NC as both the cathode and anode, requires a low cell voltage of 1.585 V at 10 mA cm(-2) with the great stability in alkaline solution. This work provides a feasible strategy to fabricate bimetallic carbides and explores their possibility as bifunctional catalysts toward overall water splitting.									74	6	0	0	5	0	75			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000530653600001	32378323	
J	Karasuda, T; Aika, K								Isotopic oxygen exchange between dioxygen and MgO catalysts for oxidative coupling of methane								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				171	2			439	448		10.1006/jcat.1997.1829				OCT 15 1997	1997	The isotopic oxygen exchange between dioxygen and MgO based catalysts (Li/MgO, Zr/MgO, and MgO) was investigated at 773 to 1173 K in order to clarify the mechanism behind the generation of the active sites. The rate analysis was successful when two exchange steps having different rates (fast and slow) and different amounts of exchangeable (surface and lattice) oxygen atoms were assumed. The fast step was proposed as the exchange between dioxygen and the surface oxygen anion, whereas the oxide anion flow from the bulk to the surface was proposed for the slow step. However, both the MgO and Zr/MgO catalysts exhibited similar results regarding the two different rates and exchangeable oxygen atoms as well as their temperature dependencies. Zr/MgO had slightly higher rates due to the Zr4+ added, in contrast to the results for Li/MgO; a faster exchange per surface area and a larger amount of exchangeable oxygen (8.8 times as large as surface oxygen atoms at 1073 K). Li/MgO was proposed as having both O- (MgO) and Li+O- as the active sites. The isotopic oxygen exchange (fast and slow) becomes measurable above ca 873 K, where hydrogen evolution starts during the TPD run (generation an O- defect) while the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction becomes appreciable. This suggests that both the exchange and the OCM reactions occurred through the active sites of O- produced at above 973 K. The exact rate of oxygen transfer in the exchange was much lower than the rate of the OCM reaction. From these results, we have concluded that the measurable ''fast'' exchange was the rate of exchange between the surface oxygen and the active center O-, while the exchange between dioxygen and O- (also a step of OCM) may be much faster.

However, the difficulty of storage and shipment of concentrated H2O2 and the generation of iron sludge limit its broad application. Therefore, highly efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts are in great need. Herein, a graphene catalyst is proposed for the electro-Fenton process, in which H2O2 is generated in situ by the two-electron reduction of the dissolved O-2 on the cathode and then decomposes to generate OH in acidic solution with Fe2-. The a bond of the oxygen is broken whereas the G bond is generally preserved on the metal-free reduced graphene oxide owing to the high free energy change. Consequently, the oxygen is reduced to H2O2 through a two-electron pathway. The thermally reduced graphene with a high specific surface area (308.8 m(2)g(-1)) and a large oxygen content (10.3 at%) exhibits excellent reactivity for the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction to H2O2. A highly efficient peroxide yield (64.2%) and a remarkable decolorization of methylene blue (12 mg L-1) of over 97% in 160 min are obtained, The degradation of methylene blue with hydroxyl radicals generated in situ is described by a pseudo first-order kinetics model. This provides a proof-of-concept of an environmentally friendly electro-Fenton process using graphene for the oxygen reduction reaction in an acidic solution to generate H2O2.									69	7	0	0	11	0	70			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000378635500018	27098063

The preparation of new active energy-saving materials has become a very active research field, depending on the synergistic effects of active particles and active oxides. In this research, a composite material, alpha(beta)-PbO2, doped with Co3O4 and CNTs on the porous Ti substrate was prepared via one-step electrochemical deposition and the corresponding electrochemical performance was investigated in simulated zinc electrowinning solution. The composite material showed a porous structure, finer grain size and larger electrochemical surface area (ECSA), which indicated excellent electrocatalytic activity. Compared with the Pb-0.76 wt% Ag alloy, the overpotential of oxygen evolution for the 3D-Ti/PbO2/Co3O4-CNTs composite material was decreased by about 452 mV under the current density of 500 A m(-2) in the simulated zinc electrowinning solution. The decrease in the overpotential of oxygen evolution was mainly ascribed to the higher ECSA and lower charger transfer resistance. Moreover, it showed the lowest self-corrosion current density of 1.156 x 10(-4) A cm(-2) and may be an ideal material for use in zinc electrowinning.									8	3	0	0	1	0	9				2046-2069		WOS:000507296300017	35494685

On the clean surface, 2-propanol reacts via a 2-propoxide intermediate, followed by beta-hydride elimination (the reaction-limiting step), producing acetone and adsorbed hydrogen at 225 K. Reactive scattering measurements show that the acetone production from the reaction of 2-propanol reduces with increasing Surface temperature from 333 to 600 K. At 600 K, 2-propanol reacts mainly via nonselective decomposition, producing CO, H-2, and adsorbed C. No acetone production was observed when a beam of 2-propanol was impinged oil the sample at 600 K. We speculate that at high surface temperature (600 K) the formation of acetone in the eta(1) (O) binding configuration is inhibited, leaving only eta(2) (C, O) acetone species, which tend to nonselectively decompose to CO, H-2, and C-ad. On the O-covered Ir(111) surface, the thermal-induced reaction of 2-propanol also occurs via a 2-propoxide intermediate with beta-C-H bond activation. The reaction mechanism changes with surface concentration of oxygen, causing changes in the kinetics of acetone and water evolution. Interestingly, acetone is formed upon impinging a 2-propanol beam oil O-Ir(111) at 600 K. We propose that the role of surface oxygen includes (1) acting as a Bronsted base, (2) acting as a precursor of a nucleophilic attacker in the beta-C-H cleavage step, and (3) altering the surface interaction with the produced acetone.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000272936400041

It has been found that doping of Si with both Sri and Ge results in an increase of the efficiency rate of formation of self-interstitial oxygen-related defects I2OI. Doping with germanium does not affect reactions with the participation of carbon interstitials C-I, whereas tin atoms turn to be effective sinks for C-I in silicon. Two types of (CISn)-related centers were found to appear under the C-I annealing. Disappearance of the (CISn) complexes under annealing is accompanied by occurrence of CIOI and CICS centers.

At the same time, the role of grain boundaries, and particularly, mirror twinboundaries (MTBs), whose concentration in TMDs can be quite high, is not fully understood. Using density functional theory calculations, we investigate the interaction of water, hydroxyl groups, as well as oxygen and hydrogen molecules with MoSe2 monolayers when MTBs of various types are present. We show that the adsorption of all species on MTBs is energetically favorable as compared to that on the basal plane of pristine MoSe2, but the interaction with Se vacancies is stronger. We further assess the energetics of various surface chemical reactions involving oxygen and hydrogen atoms. Our results indicate that water dissociation on the basal plane should be dominated by vacancies even when MTBs are present, but they facilitate water clustering through hydroxyl groups at MTBs, which can anchor water molecules and give rise to the decoration of MTBs with water clusters. Also, the presence of MTBs affects oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the MoSe2 monolayer. Unlike Se vacancies which inhibit ORR due to a high overpotential, it is found that the ORR process on MTBs is more efficient, indicating their important role in the catalytic activity of MoSe2 monolayer and likely other TMDs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2516-0230			WOS:000712541400001	36132369

The screen avoids lysis procedures and the addition of reagents to assay intracellular contents. Less laborious screening procedures will be useful in engineering more powerful H2O2 generators as tools in quantitative redox biology, and increasing the utility of enzymes that produce H2O2 as a by-product alongside a valuable compound.									10	0	0	0	7	0	10			1741-0126	1741-0134		WOS:000350976300003	25691762

It was confirmed that H2O can dissociatively chemisorb through highly exothermic reactions on the active sites of clean zigzag and armchair carbonaceous models to yield stable intermediates such as hydroxyl, semiquinone, and cyclic ether functional groups. Since the main products of the carbon-steam gasification process are molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide, several pathways for their evolution are proposed, all of which are endothermic reactions. The interaction of H2O with an oxidized surface in some cases is even more exothermic than the interaction with the active sites of a clean surface. However, it becomes endothermic when H2O interacts with a hydrogen saturated surface. Thus, the presence of hydrogen hinders the gasification reactions by blocking of the active sites rather than by removing surface oxygen. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, Mn2V2O7-based hierarchical spiked ball structures (MVO SBs) were synthesized using a simple hydrothermal technique as a bifunctional oxygen catalyst for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. The linear sweep voltammetry by a rotating disc electrode was used to investigate the ORR and OER properties and their mechanisms, and the charge transfer mechanism was also studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis. When compared with platinum with carbon black (Pt/C), the MVO SB catalyst material exhibited comparable ORR and OER properties. Furthermore, the MVO SB material revealed a 4e(-) transfer pathway in an electrolyte solution. Furthermore, the prepared MVO SB material demonstrated a lower charge-discharge voltage gap when compared with Pt/C material, which is lower than 180 mV at 45 mA cm(-2). The cycling test result of MVO SB catalyst sample revealed excellent cycling stability over 50 charging and discharging cycles (similar to 800 min) than the Pt/C sample (30 cycles [similar to 520 min]). The good catalytic activity and excellent structural stability of the MVO SB material are especially due to the more active sites enhanced by the unique spiked ball-like morphology and high specific surface area (11.70 m(2) g(-1)) properties. The achieved results suggest that the synthesized catalyst material could be employed as an oxygen catalyst material for rechargeable Zn-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000794936200001

Therefore, a novel cathode is the key to solving the above issues. Here, in-situ growing molybdenum disulfide on carbon cloth (MoS2/CC) as a binder-free cathode is prepared by a simple and facile hydrothermal method. When this cathode is tested in Na-O-2 batteries, it presents enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity as well as large discharge capacity. What's more, Na-O-2 batteries with the MoS2/CC cathode simultaneously produce sodium superoxide (NaO2) and poor crystalline sodium peroxide (Na2O2), which greatly reduces the charge potential.

Zhurnal evoliutsionnoi biokhimii i fiziologii				49	1			55	9						2013 Jan-Feb	2013	Reaction of hemoglobin oxygenation is known to occur for 40 femtoseconds (40 x 10(-15) s). However, the process of oxygen diffusion to hemoglobin under physiologic conditions decelerated this reaction approximately billion times. In mammalian lungs, blood is moving at a high rate and in a relatively high amount. The human lung mass is as low as 600 g, but the complete cardiac output approaches 6 1/min. In rat, from 20 to 40 ml of blood is passed for q min through the lung whose mass is about 1.5 g. Such blood flow rate is possible, as in lungs of high animals there exists a dense network of relatively large microvessels with diameter from 20 to 40 microm and more. In spite of a large volume and a high blood flow rate hampering oxygen diffusion, the complete blood oxygenation occurs in lung alveoli. This is due to peculiar mechanisms that facilitate markedly the oxygen diffusion and that developed in alveoli of mammals in the course of many million years of evolution of their respiratory system. Thus, alveolus is not a bubble with air, but a complex tool of fight with inertness of diffusion. It is interesting that in lungs of the low vertebrates, neither such system of blood vessels nor alveoli exist, and their blood flow rate is much lower than in mammals.									0	0	3	0	0	0	3			0044-4529			MEDLINE:23662482	23662482

But this is still a long-term and formidable challenge. In this work, a two-phase synergistic effect between transition metal sulfides is applied in the design of ORR/OER bifunctional catalysts. Co-based zeolite imidazolate framework (MOF) is used as a precursor to prepare the hollow Co9S8 through vulcanization and heat treatment. At the same time, the phase transformation occurs to form some Zn0.76Co0.24S on surface during the heat treatment due to the Zn-polydopamine coating. The hollow structure Zn0.76Co0.24S-Co9S8 composite has been verified and promotes the diffusion of reactants and products, and the interaction between two phases greatly promotes the catalytic reactions. The coating of Znpolydopamine forms uniform carbon layer on surface, enhancing the conductivity of Zn0.76Co0.24S-Co9S8 composite. The Zn0.76Co0.24S-Co9S8 composite shows much better performance of ORR and OER compared to any of them. The overpotential of OER at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) is 330 mV, and the half-wave potential of ORR is 0.83 V. Additionally, the Zn0.76Co0.24S-Co9S8 composite displays better cyclic stability. The synergistic effect of Zn0.76Co0.24S and Co9S8 can be considered as the foremost factor for the improvement of catalyst performance, which provides new possibilities for the development of non-precious metal bifunctional catalysts.

Enhanced hydrogen/oxygen evolution and stability of nanocrystalline (4-6 nm) copper particles								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				1	15			4728	4735		10.1039/c3ta01194a				2013	2013	The exploration of nanomaterials as catalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution is highly desirable for renewable and clean energy applications. We have obtained highly efficient and stable copper nanoparticles (4-6 nm) by thermal decomposition of aligned copper oxalate nanorods (obtained by a microemulsion method) in an argon atmosphere. Hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) were carried out on glassy carbon as well as platinum as working electrodes in KOH solution. In the case of HER the current densities were found to be 12 mA cm(-2) (glassy carbon electrode) and 46 mA cm(-2) (Pt electrode) which are significantly higher than reported values (maximum 1 mA cm(-2)). In the case of OER the current density was found to be 1.6 mA cm(-2) (which is slightly higher) for the glassy carbon electrode and 15 mA cm(-2) for Pt as the working electrode which is 4-30 times higher than earlier reports. The high efficiency can be related to the high surface area (34 m(2) g(-1)) of these tiny well-crystalline copper nanoparticles obtained by the microemulsion mediated synthesis. The copper nanoparticles obtained by us show excellent stability as electrocatalysts and retain their activity even after 50 cycles.									50	0	0	0	2	0	51			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000316282800016

Here, the 1-butyl-3-methlyimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BmimPF(6)) is explored as the precursor to offer phosphorus and fluorine, and melamine as a supporter to provide nitrogen. The N, P, F-tridoped mesoporous carbons are obtained by pyrolyzing the homogeneous mixture of melamine and BmimPF(6), without any post-processing. This composition of the carbon can be used as a potential metal-free electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Notably, the optimized N, P, and F tri-doped mesoporous carbon obtained at 900 degrees C, exhibits good electrocatalytic performance for ORR, with high electron-transfer number, great methanol crossover tolerance, and outstanding durability. This work may provide a new case to synthesis heteroatom-tridoped carbon for energy conversion and storage.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000534445300001

Herein, a hybrid photoanode integrating a high-quality light absorber, a bilayer TiO2 nanorod-inverse opal (NR-IO) semiconductor and an efficient OER cocatalyst consisting of colloidal Ni2P nanocrystals is constructed via a spin-coating process. The resulting TiO/Ni2P NR-IO photoanode yields an impressive photocurrent density of 1.93 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under simulated solar illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm(-2)), corresponding to a more than 2-fold increase compared to the pristine TiO2 NR-IO. The photoelectrochemical electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) and photoluminescence (PL) results reveal that the Ni2P cocatalyst not only accelerates the interfacial charge transfer from TiO2NR-IO to Ni2P but also efficiently transmits the holes to participate in aqueous OER. Moreover, the Ni2P cocatalyst effectively prevents the substantial dark current observed with fully covered transition-metal-phosphide shell modification. This work is expected to spur more insights into integrating semiconductors with proper OER cocatalysts for highly efficient and stable solar water spitting.									38	1	0	0	1	0	38			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000507465200015

However, there is a dearth of understanding in the literature regarding the underlying galvanic cell, electrode reactions and their controlling factors which limits the application of the technique.This work presents a parametric electrochemical investigation into a zinc-copper galvanic system using salt (NaCl) solution analogues at physiologically-relevant concentrations (1.71, 17.1 & 154 mM). The potential difference at open cell, closed cell maximum current and the internal resistance (based on published characterisation methods) were measured. Additionally, independent and relative polarisation scans of the electrodes were performed to improve understanding of the system.Our findings suggest that the prominent reaction at the cathode is that of oxygen-reduction, not hydrogen-evolution. Results indicate that cell potentials are influenced by the concentration of dissolved oxygen at low currents and maximum closed cell currents are limited by the rate of oxygen diffusion to the cathode. Characterised internal resistance values for the salt solutions did not correspond to theoretical values at the extremes of concentration (1.71 and 154 mM) due to electrode resistance and current limitation. Existing biogalvanic models do not consider these phenomena and should be improved to advance the technique and its practical application. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Simple single-step electrospinning successfully fabricated a hierarchical nanostructure having Au nanoparticles formed on fibrous main frames of Ir/IrO2. Different solvent composition in the electrospinning solution induced the formation of main frames with distinct nanostructures; nanoribbons (AuxIr1-xOy-70) with ethanol/DMF = 70:30; and nanofibers (AuxIr1-xOy-50) with ethanol/DMF = 50:50. The pure Ir or Au counterparts (IrOy and Au) were also prepared by the same synthetic procedure as AuxIr1-xOy. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of as -synthesized AuxIr1-xOy were investigated in 0.5 M H2SO4 and compared to those of IrOy, Au, and commercial iridium (Ir/C, 20% Ir loading on Vulcan carbon). Among them, Au0.10Ir0.90Oy-50 exhibited the best OER activity, even better than previously reported catalysts containing both Ir and Au. The high OER activity of Au0.10Ir0.90Oy-50 was mainly attributed to the fiber frame structure and the optimal interfacial areas between Au and Ir/IrO2, which are electrophilic OER active sites. The stability of Au0.10Ir0.90Oy-50 was also evaluated to be much higher than that of Ir/C during OER. The current study suggests that the presence of Au on the Ir/IrO2 surface improves the OER activity of Ir/IrO2.									33	2	0	0	1	0	34			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000456351100027	30582793

Understanding the structure - composition-property relationships is the key for engineering improved electrocatalysts. We herein report a rational design on Ru-RuO2 hybrid nanoparticles decorating carbon nanotubes composites electrocatalysts (RuRuO2/CNT), which shows impressively high activity toward hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) in all pH aqueous electrolytes. The Ru-RuO2/CNT, as an OER catalyst, requires ultralow overpotentials of 0.18 V, 0.27 V and 0.21 V to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic, neutral and alkaline media, respectively. Meanwhile, the catalyst also exhibits superior HER activity with the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at - 0.063 V, -0.048 V and -0.012 V in acidic, neutral and alkaline media, respectively. Systematic characterizations and comprehensive electrochemical studies coupling with theoretical calculations verify that Ru favorably works with RuO2 and CNT to synergistically contribute such highly desirable electrocatalytic activity. The bifunctional catalytic properties, in conjunction with its pH-universal compatibility, inspire us to an asymmetric-electrolyte electrolyzer was set up, which can harvest the electrochemical neutralization energy with implementing electrolysis H-2 generation with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an applied voltage of 0.73 V. The as-developed asymmetric-electrolyte electrolyzer, by coupling high-activity but not too expensive electrocatalysts with optimizing the catalytic efficiency in their favorable electrolyte, potentially provides an environmental-friend and energy-saving avenue for the future electrolysis H-2 generation.									100	6	0	0	8	0	100			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000471201800067

Here, well-defined Ni/Co3O4 nanoparticles coupled with N-doped carbon hybrids (Ni/Co3O4@NC) were synthesized via a facile impregnation-calcination method as efficient electrocatalysts for OER in alkaline media. Notably, the impregnation of the polymer with Ni and Co ions in the first step ensured the homogeneous distribution of metals, thus guaranteeing the subsequent in situ calcination reaction, which produced well-dispersed Ni and Co3O4 nanoparticles. Moreover, the N-doped carbon matrix formed at high temperatures could effectively prevent the aggregation and coalescence, and regulate the electronic configuration of active species. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between the Ni, Co3O4, and NC species, the obtained Ni/Co3O4@NC hybrids exhibited enhanced OER activities and remarkable stability in an alkaline solution with a smaller overpotential of 350 mV to afford 10 mA cm(-2), lower Tafel slope of 52.27 mV dec(-1), smaller charge-transfer resistance, and higher double-layer capacitance of 25.53 mF cm(-2) compared to those of unary Co3O4@NC or Ni@NC metal hybrids. Therefore, this paper presents a facile strategy for designing other heteroatom-doped oxides coupled with ideal carbon materials as electrocatalysts for the OER.

Importantly, the reasonable Co/Zn molar ratio in the ZIF-L is the key to the emergence of the encapsulated microstructure. Specifically, high-dispersed cobalt nanoparticles are fully encapsulated in the tips of N-CNTs, leading to the full formation of highly active Co-N-C moieties for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER). As a result, the obtained Co-N-CNTs present superior electrocatalytic activity and stability toward ORR and OER over the commercial Pt/C and IrO2 as well as most reported metal-organic-framework-derived catalysts, respectively. Remarkably, as bifunctional air electrodes of the Zn-air battery, it also shows extraordinary charge-discharge performance. The present concept will provide a guideline for screening novel 2D metal-organic frameworks as precursors to synthesize advanced multifunctional nanomaterials for cross-cutting applications.									283	17	0	0	14	0	285			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000423512300013

A significant enhancement of oxygen mobility has been recently established in the intermediate temperature range from 500 to 700 degrees C, but materials showing notable room temperature oxygen diffusion are still rare. While devices for energy storage or transformation generally employ polycrystalline electrodes, we report here on the electrochemical oxygen permeation capacity of single-crystalline Pr2NiO4+delta electrodes, showing remarkably high oxygen diffusion under ambient conditions, with 60 mu m thickness. The electrochemically performed oxygen reduction was followed up by in situ single-crystal synchrotron diffraction, revealing oxygen mass transport corresponding to a chemical diffusion coefficient of D* = 6.3 x 10(-11) cm(2) s(-1). Rapid oxygen diffusion becomes possible due to the predominant absence of grain boundaries, as revealed from the evolution of the individual twin domains. For the first time, the formation of anti-phase domains, organized on a length scale of 7 nm, could be evidenced during a chemical reaction, indicated by sharp satellite reflections of the second order. Our results demonstrate the yet unexplored potential of single crystals as stand-alone electrodes for high-throughput solid oxygen ion conductors under already ambient conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000735968300001

However, the great challenge is to ensure the stability of oxygen vacancies (V-O) during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process. Herein, we implement an innovative approach to produce a highly active and stable OER electrocatalyst by plasma-enabled Fe doping of Co-based 2D metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets, followed by a carbonization process to fabricate unique triangular-shaped "cheese-like" Fe/Co-carbon nanosheets with a mesoporous structure, and densely and evenly distributed reactive centers, and without damaging the frameworks. The O-2-Ar radio frequency (RF) plasma ensured two critical effects, namely oxygen vacancy generation, and forming and modifying the oxidation states of the catalytically active metals in the framework leading to high OER performance. It is shown that filling the oxygen vacancies with Fe heteroatoms helps tune the atomic sites of the two metals in the MOFs and achieve a unique heterostructure where electron currents can be directed between metal sites of different oxidation states. Benefiting from the demonstrated unique advantages of our plasma-enabled approach, the optimized Fe1Co3/V-O-800 exhibits a significantly enhanced OER performance and long-term stability, evidenced by a low overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1). This work provides a new effective approach for the development of next-generation electrocatalysts for diverse applications in environmental and energy fields.									60	3	0	0	3	0	61			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000458682100013

Glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs) have been often used as an electrode platform in water-splitting experiments, mostly due to their suitable physicochemical properties and omnipresence. However, the OER kinetics on carbon electrodes are reported to be limited. Passivation of the electrode surface due to slow scavenging of the formed oxygen is presumably the major reason for such a decline. Attempts have been made to improve the OER efficiency on the carbon electrode by improving its hydrophobicity and hence reducing the size of the passivating oxygen bubble. In this direction, we put forward an altogether different approach. A two-component polymer composite working electrode has been used. Two distinct phases of varying wettability discourage the bigger size bubble and help less passivation of the electrodes. Moreover, the highly rough surface of PCE compared to that of GCE increases the hydrophobicity of the tailored electrode. These two factors show improved OER activity, which has been demonstrated using Ru-based catalysts since the Ru-based catalysts are considered as a benchmark for OER. A Ru-triazine covalent organic framework catalyst has been loaded on PCE. Bare and modified electrodes were characterized for their scanning electron microscopy, water wettability, and electrochemical active surface area measurements. Followed by various OER parameters, such as linear sweep voltammetry and stability (chronoamperometry), Tafel slopes have been evaluated. The charge-transfer resistance has been measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis. The activity of the modified PCE has been compared with that of the GCE, and the yield of oxygen has been compared using gas chromatography.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2574-0962			WOS:000703338600097

Herein, alpha-Co1-mFem(OH)(x) is synthesized and systematically engineered to study the effect of Fe content on the morphology, crystalline structure, electronic structure, and OER activity. As the Fe content is changed, the basic crystalline phase of alpha-Co1-mFem(OH)(x) is consistent whereas the micromorphology changes. Much smaller and thinner nanoplates with more edge/defect sites are fabricated because of increased Fe incorporation. When the Fe content is more than 0.1, twin nanoparticles emerge at the edge/defect sites of the sister nanoplate. Additionally, the OER activity of alpha-Co1-mFem(OH)(x) against Fe content can be plotted as a volcano curve. These data thus support a hypothesis that the edge/defect sites in alpha-Co1-mFem(OH)(x) are responsible for the OER performance. The incorporation of Fe leads to not only the accelerated intrinsic reactivity of each active site, which is attributed to the strong electronic interaction between Co and Fe but also changes the number of edge/defect sites.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000478761200033	30946530

Moreover, 2D lateral heterostructure with the coupled interface in-plane rather than the vertical direction enables to expose more active sites to catalyst surface, and thus facilitates the OER catalytic activity. Here, 2D FeCo layered double hydroxide/cobalt oxide (FeCo LDH/CoO) nanosheets are synthesized via an instantaneous method utilizing molten alkali as both solvent and reactant. Upon a selective low-temperature phosphorization, 2D Fe-containing cobalt phosphide/cobalt oxide (Fe-CoP/CoO) lateral heterostructure with the optimized electronic structure and activated electronic coupling interface is obtained and exhibits superior catalytic activity (eta= 219 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) compared to most of the reported electrocatalysts towards OER in alkaline electrolyte. Besides, both of the experimental characterization and DFT calculation are performed to illustrate the detailed mechanism of the attractive OER activity. It is uncovered that the coupled interface between CoP and CoO induces the redistribution of electrons, facilitates the adsorption of OFF anions easily, and thus optimizes Gibbs free energies for water oxidation.									156	8	0	0	8	0	157			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000455264600012		
J	Ivanov, K. P.								Function of Alveoli as a Result of Evolutionary Development of Respiratory System in Mammals								JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY				49	1			78	83		10.1134/S002209301301009X				JAN 2013	2013	Reaction of hemoglobin oxygenation is known to occur for 40 femtoseconds (40 x 10(-15) s). However, the process of oxygen diffusion to hemoglobin under physiologic conditions decelerated this reaction approximately billion times. In mammalian lungs, blood is moving at a high rate and in a relatively high amount. The human lung mass is as low as 600 g, but the complete cardiac output approaches 6 l/min. In rat, from 20 to 40 ml of blood is passed for one minute through the lung whose mass is about 1.5 g. Such blood flow rate is possible, as in lungs of high animals there exists a dense network of relatively large microvessels with diameter from 20 to 40 mu m and more. In spite of a large volume and a high blood flow rate hampering oxygen diffusion, the complete blood oxygenation occurs in lung alveoli. This is due to peculiar mechanisms that facilitate markedly the oxygen diffusion and that developed in alveoli of mammals in the course of many million years of evolution of their respiratory system. Thus, alveolus is not a bubble with air, but a complex tool of fight with inertness of diffusion. It is interesting that in lungs of the low vertebrates, neither such system of blood vessels nor alveoli exist, and their blood flow rate is much lower than in mammals.									1	0	1	0	1	0	1			0022-0930	1608-3202		WOS:000320111400009

Developing high-efficiency non-precious metal ORR catalysts is urgent and still challenging. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are considered to be one of the promising substitutes for Pt due to their maximum atom utilization efficiency and mass activity. Despite considerable efforts in preparing various SACs, the reaction mechanism and intrinsic activity modulation during the ORR reaction are still not understood in-depth. In this review, the latest advances in the current synthetic strategies for SACs are summarized. The effect of various coordination environments including central metal atoms, coordination atoms, environmental atoms, and guest groups on the intrinsic ORR activity of SACs are discussed. The electrocatalytic mechanisms are clarified by combining density functional theory calculations with in situ advanced characterization technologies. Then, the applications of SACs in FCs and Zn-air batteries are reviewed. Finally, the prospects and challenges for further development of SACs are highlighted.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2366-9608			WOS:000695156500001	34927931

Herein, the urchin-like Ni-doped W18O49/NF with enriched active sites was prepared by solvothermal method followed by a low-temperature pyrolysis treatment was reported. Results demonstrate that the incorporation of Ni-doping triggers the lattice distortion of W18O49 for the increasement of oxygen defects. Further, high-valent W6+ are partially reduced to low-valent W4+, wherein the electrons originate from the oxidation process of Ni2+ to Ni3+. The Ni3+ ions show an enhanced orbital overlap with the OER reaction intermediates. The generated W4+ ions contribute to release oxygen vacancies, eventually reorganizing Ni-doped W18O49/NF to unique electrochemical active species with a special amorphous-crystalline interface (AM/NiWOx/NiOOH/NF). Simultaneously, the reconstruction results in an optimized valence band and conduction band. Eventually, the resultant AM/NiWOx/NiOOH/NF with abundant active sites and improved oxidation/reduction capability exhibits more superior catalytic performance compared with the Ni-doped W18O49/NF counterpart. This study gives more insights in the electrochemical evolution of the tungsten-based oxide and provides effective strategies for optimizing the catalytic activity of materials with inherent hydrogen evolution reaction limitations.

Here, three nanostructured manganese oxide catalysts - namely Mn3O4, Mn5O8 and alpha-Mn2O3 - are investigated with regard to their activity for the ORR in a LiTFSI/DMSO electrolyte. In cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements an overall decrease of potential gaps and an increase of re-oxidation efficiencies on carbon powder-based electrodes in comparison to glassy carbon (GC) was observed, which is attributed to the presence of more active centers, e.g. edges and kinks. Increased ORR potentials and the kinetic evaluation of the rate-determining step, namely the one-electron reduction of oxygen, point to a significantly enhanced activity of alpha-Mn2O3/C compared to pure carbon powder, Mn3O4/C and Mn5O8/C electrodes. This is discussed in terms of the electrocatalytic effect of alpha-Mn2O3 for aprotic ORR processes. The ORR activity is proposed to originate from a different reaction pathway due to coordinatively unsaturated Mn3+ ions on the surface of alpha-Mn2O3, which act as active centers for associative adsorption and reduction of molecular O-2.

Here, an excellent platform to investigate the roles of the composition and structure in tuning the electron configuration for higher OER efficiency is provided by layered perovskite oxides with subtle variations of composition and structure (doping with 0%, 50%, and 100% cobalt in the Bi7Fe3Ti3O21). The crystal structures were analyzed by X-ray diffraction refinement, and the electronic structures were calculated based on X-ray absorption spectroscopy and magnetization vs temperature plots according to the Curie-Weiss law. The results indicate that the elongation of oxygen octahedra along the c-axis in layered perovskite could stabilize Co ions in the intermediate spin (IS) (t(2g))(5)(e(g))(1) state, resulting in dramatically enhanced electronic conductivity and absorption capacity. Subsequently, the OER efficiency of sample with 100% Co was found to be (incredibly) 100 times higher than that of the sample with 0% Co, with the current density increased from 0.13 to 43 mA/cm(2) (1.8 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode); the Tafel slope was reduced from 656 to 87 mV/dec; and double-layer capacity enhanced from 174 to 4193 mu F/cm(2). This work reveals that both the composition and structure should be taken into account to stabilize a suitable electronic structure such as IS Co ions with moderate absorption and benign electronic conductivity for high-efficiency catalysis of the OER.									51	1	0	0	3	0	51			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000459642000045	30669840

Surface modification is a novel strategy to enhance the activity of OER catalysts, however, it is commonly done under harsh and energy intensive conditions. Herein, we present a facile approach of solvent treatment to hydroxylate the surface of a layered perovskite, Sr3FeCoO7-delta. The catalytic activity correlates with the degree of surface hydroxylation, which influences the absorption energy of intermediates on the surface. The optimized catalyst exhibits higher activity than the current benchmark perovskite OER catalysts. This work introduces a mild and convenient method for surface modification, which may be applicable for the improvement of other nanoscale electrocatalysts.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000443116700025

Attempts to recover the initial inventory of volatiles lead toward a model in which nitrogen was originally supplied as NH(3), essentially unmodified from its relative abundance in the outer solar nebula. Titan's atmospheric methane, in contrast, appears to have been formed from carbon and other carbon compounds, either by gas phase reactions in the subnebula or by accretional heating during the formation of Titan. These conclusions can be tested by further studies of abundances and isotope ratios in Titan's atmosphere, augmented by studies of comets. The possible similarity of carbon and nitrogen inventories on Titan to those on the inner planets makes this investigation particularly intriguing. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) being a sluggish step, the use of precious metal-based catalysts is the main impediment toward the viability of water splitting. In this work, amorphous copper oxide and doped binary- and ternary-metal oxides (containing Co-II, Ni-II, and Cu-II) have been prepared on the surface of fluorine-doped tin oxide by a facile electrodeposition route followed by thermal treatment. The fabricated electrodes have been employed as efficient binder-free OER electrocatalysts possessing a high electrochemical surface area due to their amorphous nature. The cobalt-nickel-doped copper oxide (ternary-metal oxide)-based electrode showed promising OER activity with a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at 1.65 V versus RHE that escalates to 313 mA cm(-2) at 1.76 V in alkaline media at pH 14. The high activity of the ternary-metal oxide-based electrode was further supported by a smaller semicircle in the Nyquist plot. Furthermore, all metal-oxide-based electrodes offered high stability when tested for continuous production of oxygen for 50 h. This work highlights the synthesis of efficient and costeffective amorphous metal-based oxide catalysts to execute electrocatalytic OER employing an electrodeposition approach.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2470-1343			WOS:000697781900009	34368529

Zirconia was reduced to oxygen-deficient zirconia (ZrO2-x) with an O/Zr ratio as low as 1.53, causing the evolution of oxygen. Part of the oxygen could accumulate at grain boundaries, the remainder being dissolved in titanium as alpha-Ti(O). An ordered titanium suboxide (Ti3O) could be formed from a solid solution of alpha-Ti(O) during cooling. A fine crystalline ZrO2-x phase (O/Zr approximate to 2) was also found along with alpha-Zr near the interface on the zirconia side. The alpha-Zr was twinned with one of the twin planes being indexed as {10 (1) over bar 2}. The yttria stabilizer was excluded from zirconia as the reaction was progressing, existing as oxygen-deficient yttria, Extensive dissolution of zirconia in titanium gave rise to the formation of alpha-Ti(Zr,O) solid solution. On cooling, lamellae of Ti2ZrO precipitated from alpha-Ti(Zr,O) with an orientation relationship of {110}(Ti2Zro)//{100}(alpha-Ti) and [111](Ti2ZrO)//[011](alpha-Ti).									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			0002-7820			WOS:000085763800037

The process makes use of a regeneration system specifically designed and successfully tested. This system is built around an electrolysis cell, that is called "regeneration cell", where an electro-reduction reaction of V(V) is coupled with an oxygen evolution reaction catalyzed by a Ti-IrO2 electrode. The rebalancing of three different unbalanced electrolytes was tested: V3.55+, V3.60+ and V-3.65+, namely: 45% V(III)/55% V(IV), 40% V(III)/60% V(IV) and 35% V(III)/65% V(IV) respectively. The behavior of the VRFB cell during the rebalancing process was investigated both numerically and experimentally. An end-point strategy for the rebalancing process without additional sensors has been developed by using of a specific mathematical model capable of simulating the current response and concentrations profile during the rebalancing process. This strategy allowed to improve the performance of the rebalancing process. After rebalancing, the resulting electrolyte oxidation states were respectively: V3.483+, V3.482+, V3.484+. Since a perfectly balanced electrolyte is V3.50+ (50% V(III), 50% (VIV) such results demonstrated that the electrolyte imbalance was drastically reduced and the rebalancing process was successful.									29	1	0	0	2	0	30			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000621234200001

In this study, we developed an efficient, stable and bifunctional Ni-Co-S/Ni-Co-P bistratal electrocatalyst on Ni foam (NF) using simple electrodeposition methods. The efficient contact at the Ni-Co-P/NF interface along with the porous Ni-Co-S surface results in the superior electrocatalytic activity of the bistratal layer in a basic solution for both the OER and HER. Only -0.11 V vs. RHE is required at a current density of -20 mA cm(-2) for the HER and 1.47 V vs. RHE at 50 mA cm(-2) for the OER, significantly outperforming bare Ni-Co-S or Ni-Co-P on NF. Most crucially, when functioning as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting, a small cell potential of 1.49 V can drive 10 mA cm(-2) which can be sustained for more than two days. Subsequently, 10.8%-efficient overall solar water splitting was achieved when driven by three ordinary Si solar cells. Such a bistratal structure is expected to provide a new platform for the design of highly efficient, low-cost and durable catalysts for water electrolysis systems.									32	1	0	0	1	0	32			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448412700043

The macro and microstructure of the oxide, obtained by compacting and sintering lithium-doped Co3O4 powder in atmosphere of dry air and in conditions of controlled temperature and time was analyzed by metallographic techniques. The porous material was characterized by XRD, SEM and EDS combined techniques. For working temperatures up to 1200 degreesC, the pellet was constituted of particles with varying sizes over a wide range of particle size and, at higher temperatures CoO is formed and polymorphic transformation was observed.

The electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction is a well-studied electrochemical reaction which involves the reduction of protons for hydrogen production. It requires highly efficient and robust catalysts to lower the overpotential and energy consumption. Platinum (Pt) remains the first choice among electrocatalysts because of its excellent activity and high current density. Since Pt is limited by its high cost and scarcity, extensive research is devoted for the development of non-Pt-based cost-effective electrocatalysts. According to the volcano plot, palladium (Pd) can be used as a substitute for Pt towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we review various Pd-based electrocatalysts in the form of nanoparticles, alloys, bimetallics and intermetallics reported for the HER. In this review we have emphasized various synthesis techniques employed for these electrocatalysts and the strategies used for improving the catalytic performance. We conclude with a perspective on the future aspects of electrocatalysts based on Pd.									128	7	0	0	5	0	130			2052-1553			WOS:000445217200001

Remarkably, the creation of oxygen vacancies on BaTiO3 can mediate the piezocatalytic activity. The piezocatalytic activity exhibited a volcano-type trend with increasing oxygen vacancies. Results from first-principles density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations and O-2-temperature programmed desorption (O-2-TPD) measurement indicated that the presence of oxygen vacancies could efficiently adsorb and activate O-2 on the surface of BaTiO3 nanobelt and consequently enhance piezocatalytic activity. Importantly, with the aid of piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) measurement, the intrinsic reason of volcano-type trend of oxygen vacancy-activity was well unveiled. This work reveals the effect and mechanism of oxygen vacancy occupancy on enhancing piezocatalytic activity of BaTiO3 nanobelt and will shed light on design of efficient piezocatalysts in the future.									83	3	0	0	8	0	85			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000566454800004		
J	Wang, Fangfang; Zhang, Cheng; Yang, Hong								Mixed B-site ruddlesden-popper phase Sr-2(RuxIr1-x)O-4 enables enhanced activity for oxygen evolution reaction								JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY				70				623	629		10.1016/j.jechem.2022.02.0512095-4956				JUL 2022	2022	Development of high performance electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media remains a challenge for direct water splitting using an electrolyzer. Recently, Ruddlesden-Popper phase Sr2IrO4 was discovered to be an efficient OER catalyst because of its unique structure, which consists of layers of both rock salt and perovskite phases simultaneously. In this study, we prepared a series of B-site mixed, Ruddlesden-Popper phase of Sr2(RuxIr1_x)O4 and examined their electrocatalytic properties for OER in acidic media. Through partial substitution of Ru in the B-site of Ruddlesden-Popper phase materials, we achieved much enhanced OER performance for this series of Sr2(RuxIr1_x)O4 electrocatalysts, among which Sr2(Ru0.5Ir0.5)O4 exhibited the best catalytic activity with a current density of 8.06 mA/ cm2 at 1.55 V and a Tafel slope of 47 mV/dec. This current density is three times higher than that of Sr2IrO4. The B-site mixed Sr2(Ru0.5Ir0.5)O4 retained good stability in acidic conditions for > 24 h at 10 mA/cm2. A range of techniques were used to characterize the crystal and electronic structures of the Sr2(RuxIr1_x)O4 samples. Our data indicate that the improved OER performance can be correlated to the formation of high level of hydroxyl groups and the enhanced overlap between Ir/Ru 4d and O 2p orbitals, revealing a new way for the design of efficient OER electrocatalysts by regulating their composition and electronic structures.

Here, we report a sulfate-functionalized Ni(OH)(2) nanobelt (S-Ni(OH)(2)) electrocatalyst, which exhibited self-enhanced OER activity due to its self-renewed surface during anodic oxidation. The S-Ni(OH)(2) was in situ grown on the nickel foam (NF) surface in potassium peroxydisulfate solution through one-step hydrothermal treatment. This material outperformed all the existing electrocatalysts in the intensity and duration of the OER activity enhancement. An overpotential drop of 70 mV is shown by the S-Ni(OH)(2)/NF electrode during 110 h reaction at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), and the overpotential remains as low as 358 mV at a current density of 200 mA cm(-2). Such activity enhancement during OER is mainly ascribed to the formation of a highly active NiOOH/Ni(SO4)(0.3)(OH)(1.4) composite on the S-Ni(OH)(2) surface as a result of gradual sulfate release. Given the facile and environmentally benign fabrication process (without external addition of a Ni source and surfactant) and good electrochemical properties (high activity and long lifetime), the S-Ni(OH)(2) holds great potential for practical OER application. The surface self-renewal strategy developed here might also be expanded to other electrocatalysts and electrochemical processes.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000507146100040	31814385

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an essential reaction in water splitting process and requires efficient electrocatalyst to lower the overpotential. However, current electro-catalysts are limited by the complicated synthetic protocols, especially long synthesis time, along with poor intrinsic catalytic activity. Here we report a low-cost and scalable electrochemical method to synthesize efficient water oxidation electrode via potential pulses. In a two-electrode setup, two water oxidation electrodes are synthesized in merely 10 s. These two electrodes need overpotentials of 240.7 +/- 6.8 mV and 239.5 +/- 3.4 mV to catalyze OER at 10 mA/cm(2) current density normalized by geometric area. Remarkably, when normalized by electrochemically active surface area, the intrinsic catalytic activity outperformed the state-of-the-art catalysts. And the electrode is durable to catalyze OER at 100 mA/cm(2), even after repeated ultrasonication treatment, the overpotential only shift 25-51 mV. We postulate that the highly disordered defective sites of nickel hydroxide modified with iron species are the most active OER catalytic sites. In addition, the attempt to synthesize 10 water oxidation electrodes using this concept is very successful, further reducing the cycle time to 1 s per electrode. The super facile synthesis procedures, as well as the excellent catalytic performance make these materials highly suitable for large scale applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000721715400005

Herein, we report for the first time on a novel multicomponent metal selenide electrocatalyst based on CoSe2/FeSe2 double-shelled hollow nanocuboids (CoSe2/FeSe2 DS-HNCs) with the highly oxidative Co3+ species, which is synthesized via a facile sequential ion exchange strategy. The solid Co-precursor nanocuboids are first converted into the intermediate Co-2[Fe(CN)(6)] with a mesoporous and double-shelled hollow structure produced through a facile ligand exchange at room temperature, and then the final CoSe2/FeSe2 DS-HNCs are obtained by a subsequent Se ion exchange reaction. The intermediate product of Co-2[Fe(CN)(6)] plays an important role not only in constructing a double-shelled hollow structure but also in providing the Fe source for the growth of the final multicomponent metal selenides. Benefiting from the nanosized double-shelled hollow structure and mesoporous double-metal selenide shells with the highly oxidative Co3+ species, the as-prepared CoSe2/FeSe2 DS-HNCs exhibit superior OER performance to state-of-the-art metal selenides, including a small overpotential of 240 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and the excellent electrochemical durability over 50 h. This work opens up a new avenue towards developing highly active multicomponent noble-metal-free electrocatalysts.									58	4	0	0	2	0	58			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000470756000015	31120471

Such material structures do not only increase the surface area and stability of metal nanoparticles (NPs) but also modify the electrocatalytic performance. Here, we introduce, for the first time, multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) functionalized with nitrogen-rich emeraldine salt (ES) (denoted as ES-MWNT) as a promising catalyst support to boost the electrocatalytic activity of magnetic maghemite (gamma-Fe2O3) NPs. The latter component has been synthesized by a simple and upscalable one-step pulsed laser ablation method on Ni core forming the core-shell Ni@gamma-Fe2O3 NPs. The catalyst (Ni@gamma-Fe2O3/ES-MWNT) is formed via self-assembly as strong interaction between ES-MWNT and Ni@gamma-Fe2O3 results in NPs' encapsulation in a thin C-N shell. We further show that Ni does not directly function as an active site in the electrocatalyst but it has a crucial role in synthesizing the maghemite shell. The strong interaction between the NPs and the support improves notably the NPs' catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in terms of both onset potential and current density, ranking it among the most active catalysts reported so far. Furthermore, this material shows a superior durability to most of the current excellent OER electrocatalysts as the activity, and the structure, remains almost intact after 5000 OER stability cycles. On further characterization, the same trend has been observed for hydrogen evolution reaction, the other half-reaction of water splitting.									49	1	0	0	4	0	49			1944-8244			WOS:000445439900040	30113811

In this work, we demonstrate defect rich cobalt (oxy)hydroxides (Co(O)OH) as an excellent cocatalyst nanolayer sheathed on BiVO4 to substantially improve the PEC water oxidation activity. The self-transformation of metal-organic framework produces an ultrathin Co(O)OH layer rich in oxygen vacancies, which could serve as a powerful hole extraction engine to promote the charge transfer/separation efficiency as well as an excellent oxygen evolution reaction catalyst to accelerate the surface water oxidation kinetics. As a result, the BiVO4/Co (O)OH hybrid photoanode achieves remarkably inhibited surface charge recombination and presents a prominent photocurrent density of 4.2 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is around 2.6-fold higher than that of the pristine BiVO4. Moreover, the Co(O)OH cocatalyst nanolayer significantly reduces the onset potential of BiVO4 photoanodes by 200 mV. This work provides a versatile strategy for rationally preparing oxygen-vacancy-rich cocatalysts on various photoanodes toward high-efficient PEC water oxidation. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

In general, the treatment causes the destruction and removal of oxides from the surface of metallic substrates resulting in the subsequent increase in the working surface area and its depassivation. Rowland's effect is of great importance for electrocatalysis of hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction as well as for surface pretreatment of substrates and catalytic coatings (Raney nickel, composite Raney alloys, and other catalysts) leading to an enhanced contact between the substrate and the catalytic coating.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1023-1935			WOS:A1995RP12300002

To promote oxygen ion exchange at the interface, a thin layer of cerium oxide decorated by an amorphous cobalt oxide overcoating was introduced to function as a fast oxygen ion transport pathway at the interface. The peak power density (PPD) of the modified cell achieved 767 mW/cm(2) at a low operation temperature of 550 degrees C, which is almost 3 times the power output of the unmodified cell. Oxygen isotope exchange confirmed that the oxygen reduction active cobalt oxide nanolayer drastically reduced the energy barrier for oxygen transport across the solid-solid interface. Such interface modification successfully demonstrates an effective route to enable fast ORR and oxygen transport across the cathode/electrolyte interface at low temperature.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2574-0962			WOS:000473116600015

The absence of photosynthetic oxygen evolution by PSII membranes without artificial electron acceptors, but in the presence of [CuL2]Br-2, has shown that it is not able to act as a PSII electron acceptor. In the presence of artificial electron acceptors, [CuL2]Br-2 inhibits photosynthetic oxygen evolution. [CuL2]Br-2 also suppresses the photoinduced changes of the PSII chlorophyll fluorescence yield (F-V) related to the photoreduction of the primary quinone electron acceptor, Q(A). The inhibition of both characteristic PSII reactions depends on [CuL2]Br-2 concentration. At all studied concentrations of [CuL2]Br-2, the decrease in the F-M level occurs exclusively due to a decrease in Fv. [CuL2]Br-2 causes neither changes in the F-0 level nor the retardation of the photoinduced rise in F-M, which characterizes the efficiency of the electron supply from the donor-side components to Q(A) through the PSII reaction center (RC). Artificial electron donors (sodium ascorbate, DPC, Mn2+) do not cancel the inhibitory effect of [CuL2]Br-2. The dependences of the inhibitory efficiency of the studied reactions of PSII on [CuL2]Br-2 complex concentration practically coincide. The inhibition constant Ki is about 16 mu M, and logKi is 4.8. As [CuL2]Br-2 does not change the aromatic amino acids' intrinsic fluorescence of the PSII protein components, it can be proposed that [CuL2]Br-2 has no significant effect on the native state of PSII proteins. The results obtained in the present study are compared to the literature data concerning the inhibitory effects of PSII Cu(II) aqua ions and Cu(II)-organic complexes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4409		WOS:000851037800001	36078088

The presence of 40% Ir in the coating yielded 300 times higher stability in comparison with the coating of pure ruthenium. In addition, a square-wave pulsing between - 0.25 and 1.25 V vs. the saturated calomel electrode produced an oxide film with electrochromic properties which were directly related to the charge enhancement factor of the grown oxide.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:A1992JJ30100019

Herein, we have studied the stability upon oxygen exposure of gold copper NPs supported on rutile. We have used in situ scanning tunneling microscopy to follow the evolution of individual Au, Cu and Au-Cu NPs with various compositions grown on the TiO2(110) surface, during each step from their nucleation to their modification with oxygen. We demonstrated a direct relation between the stability of the nanoparticles and their Au concentration. Whereas pure Cu nanoparticles dissociate under O-2, Au Cu NPs containing at least 20% Au are stable. This is explained by a modification of the local density of states of Cu atoms upon alloying.									12	2	0	0	0	0	12			1948-7185			WOS:000355894000011	26266501

Here, we report that the activity of nickel foam (NF) towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be enhanced remarkably through simple immersion in a ferric nitrate (Fe(NO3)(3)) solution at room temperature. During this immersion process, the oxidation of the NF surface by NO3 ions increases the near-surface concentrations of OH- and Ni2+, which results in the in situ deposition of a highly active amorphous Ni-Fe hydroxide (a-NiFeOxHy ) layer. Specifically, the OER overpotential of the NF electrode decreases from 371 mV (bare NF) to 270 mV (@10 mA.cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH) after immersion in a 20 mM Fe(NO3)(3) solution for just 1 min. A longer immersion time results in further increased OER activity (196 mV@10 mA.cm(-2) in 1 M KOH). The overall water splitting properties of the a-NiFeOx H-y@NF electrode were evaluated using a two-electrode configuration. It is worth noting that the current density can reach 25 mA.cm(-2) in 6 M KOH at an applied voltage of 1.5 V at room temperature.									55	4	0	0	6	0	57			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000440733100001

However, the sluggish kinetics (large overpotential) and the expensive cost of noble metal-based electrocatalysts (RuO2 and IrO2) restrain the widespread usage of OER. Hence, the discovery of non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts with tiny overpotential, satisfactory current density and outstanding stability has become urgent. In this work, we have prepared ultra-thin layered g-C3N4 by a two-step thermal peeling method and synthesized Ni(OH)(2)/g-C3N4 composite by a simple one-step solvothermal method. Benefiting from the layered g-C3N4 as substrate, the overpotential of Ni(OH)(2)/g-C3N4 composite was just 240 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which gives an unexpected improvement in the electrochemical performance of the composite samples compared to pure Ni(OH)(2) (eta = 460 mV). Additionally, the formation of heterojunction effectively reduces the resistance to electron transport in OER, the resistance of Ni(OH)(2)/g-C3N4 (R-ct = 38.8 Omega) is far smaller than those of bare Ni(OH)(2) (R-ct = 41.6 Omega) and layered g-C3N4 (R-ct = 43.6 Omega) at the open circuit potential. Ni(OH)(2)/g-C3N4 composite samples display outstanding electrochemical stability, maintaining 85% of initial current density for 12 h. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that Delta G(3) of Ni(OH)(2)/g-C3N4 composite (eta = 0.46 V) is much lower than that of bare Ni(OH)(2) (eta = 0.64 V). These undeniable results demonstrate that Ni(OH)(2)/g-C3N4 composite materials is promising alternative materials to replace precious metal-based OER electrocatalysts in the field of water splitting.

Here, a unique particle on a stick approach is used to grow a single metal-organic framework (MOF; ZIF-67) nanoparticle on a nanoelectrode surface which is pyrolyzed to generate a cobalt/nitrogen-doped carbon (CoN/C) composite nanoparticle that exhibits very high catalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a current density of up to 230mAcm(-2) at 1.77V (vs. RHE), and a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 29.7s(-1) at 540mV overpotential. Identical location transmission electron microscopy (IL-TEM) analysis substantiates the self-sacrificial template nature of the MOF, while post-electrocatalysis studies reveal agglomeration of Co centers within the CoN/C composite during the OER. Single-entity electrochemical analysis allows for deriving the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and furnishes insight into the transient behavior of the electrocatalyst under reaction conditions.									55	3	0	0	4	0	55			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000474806700054	30993849

It provided 10 mA cm-2 current density at an overpotential of 300 mV for OER and 254 mV for HER on a glassy carbon prepolymer was grafted on to poly(vinyl alcohol) and cross-linked via thermal annealing followed by quaternization using methyl iodide to obtain thermoset anion exchange membrane (NMPi). Composite NMPi membranes were synthesized using additives tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and zirconium oxychloride. The water splitting performance on the fabricated membrane electrode assembly was tested and compared with commercially available Neosepta membrane. The obtained faradic efficacy of the water splitting was 94.33% for ZrO2-NMPi membrane followed by 80.23%, 77.70%, and 65.10% for SiO2NMPi, NMPi, and Neosepta membranes, respectively. The best membrane ZrO2-NMPi achieved maximum current density of similar to 0.776 A cm-2 in 5 M KOH electrolyte at 80 degrees C and 2 V applied constant voltage. The excellent alkaline stability of MEA indicates its potential utility in hydrogen generation applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-1343			WOS:000812833700001	35571787

However, only a limited number of hybrid MLD processes are demonstrated with electrochemically relevant elements, such as manganese. Here, a "manganicone" manganese hybrid MLD chemistry is developed using the precursors bis(ethylcyclopentadienyl)manganese and ethylene glycol. The resulting manganese alkoxide coordination networks are shown to have many interesting properties, including the ability to seamlessly fill high aspect ratio vias and the chemical conversion into manganese carboxylate in air over several hours at room temperature. Linear, self-saturating growth is reported. Importantly, hybrid manganicone films annealed to 480 degrees C in air demonstrate a greater stability to restructuring during electrochemical testing than their inorganic counterparts grown by atomic layer deposition, without reducing the activity of the reactive sites on the manganese surface. Thus, hybrid manganese films grown by MLD have significant promise for use as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction and as electrodes in thin film batteries.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000481142200001

A simple, yet efficient, H2O-mediated method has been developed to synthesize a mesoscopic core shell W@WC architecture with a dodecahedral microstructure, via a one-pot reaction. The H2O plays an important role in the resistance of carbon diffusion, resulting in the formation of the W core and W terminated WC shell. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that adding W as core reduced the oxygen adsorption energy and provided the W-terminated WC surface. The W@WC exhibits significant electrocatalytic activities toward hydrogen evolution and nitrobenzene electroreduction reactions, which are comparable to those found for commercial Pt/C, and substantially higher than those found for meso- and nano-WC materials. The experimental results were explained by DFT calculations based on the energy profiles in the hydrogen evolution reactions over WC, W@WC, and Pt model surfaces. The W@WC also shows a high thermal stability and thus may serve as a promising more economical alternative to Pt catalysts in these important energy conversion and environmental protection applications. The current approach can also be extended or adapted to various metals and carbides, allowing for the design and fabrication of a wide range of catalytic and other multifunctional composites.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			1944-8244			WOS:000404090000037	28562013

It is significant to explore facile and effective methods to improve their electrocatalytic activity. A simple self template strategy is demonstrated to fabricate a hollow bipyramid constructed by P-doped FeNi alloys/NiFe2O4 nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon network (P-Ni0.5Fe@C). Bimetallic analogous MIL-101 (Fe) precursor (Ni0.5Fe-BDC CP) with uniform morphology and stable structure was synthesized through a solvothermal reaction. By subsequent carbonization and phosphorization steps, P element was doped into the composite FeNi alloys/NiFe2O4 nanoparticles. Benefiting from the efficient mass and electron transfer of the hollow structure, the precise adjustment for the electron structure of P dopants, and carbon-encapsulated active components that could provide large numbers of active sites as well as prevent the aggregation and dissolution of active components, the optimal P-Ni0.5Fe@C catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 256 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1), and remarkable long-term stability toward oxygen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH, which is better than that of commercial IrO2 (318 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for overpotential and 120 mV dec(-1) for Tafel slope, respectively). More remarkably, when it was employed in a two-electrode configuration based on P-Ni0.5Fe@C as anode and commercial Pt/C as cathode catalysts (P-Ni0.5Fe@C parallel to Pt/C), a potential of only 1.49 V (corresponding overpotential of 260 mV) was required to achieve 10 mA.cm(-2). This work provides insight into the rational composition and morphology design of an earth-abundant electrocatalyst with highly efficient electrocatalytic activities toward overall water splitting.									22	0	0	0	2	0	22			2168-0485			WOS:000456631800051

However, photobleaching of the chlorophyll a was relatively higher than beta carotenoid. The results on the N,N-dimethyl-p-nitrosoaniline (RNO) bleaching in the presence of oxygen radical quenchers exhibited maximum effect of sodium azide and indicated about the generation of singlet oxygen. The chlorophyll a-sensitized production of singlet oxygen by a type II reaction cannot be ruled out because of maximum oxidative damage to the cells at or beyond the photosynthesis saturating light intensity, i.e., 12 W/m(2), when the availability of triplet chlorophyll is maximum.									20	2	0	0	13	0	22			0343-8651	1432-0991		WOS:A1995QY59200010

Until now, the critical scientific challenges facing Li-O-2 batteries are the absence of advanced electrode architectures and highly efficient electrocatalysts for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which seriously hinder the commercialization of this technology. In the last few years, a number of strategies have been devoted to exploring new catalysts with novel structures to enhance the battery performance. Among various of oxygen electrode catalysts, carbon-based materials have triggered tremendous attention as suitable cathode catalysts for Li-O-2 batteries due to the reasonable structures and the balance of catalytic activity, durability and cost. In this review, we summarize the recent advances and basic understandings related to the carbon-based oxygen electrode catalytic materials, including nanostructured carbon materials (one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers, 2D graphene nanosheets, 3D hierarchical architectures and their doped structures), and metal/metal oxide-nanocarbon hybrid materials (nanocarbon supporting metal/metal oxide and nanocarbon encapsulating metal/metal oxide). Finally, several key points and research directions of the future design for highly efficient catalysts for practical Li-O-2 batteries are proposed based on the fundamental understandings and achievements of this battery field.

N-2) was investigated thermo-gravimetrically at 10 degrees C min(-1) heating rate over a temperature range from ambient to 1000 degrees C. Significant mass loss (similar to 55%) was observed at the temperature of 300-500 degrees C, where the thermal degradation rate was almost identical and independent of oxygen concentrations due to simultaneous volatilization and oxidation. A series of gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) measurements taken from the effluent of a thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) unit at temperature of 300-5000 degrees C leads to the overall thermal degradation mechanisms of waste tires and some insights for understanding evolution steps of air pollutants including volatile organic carbons (VOCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In order to describe the fundamental mechanistic behavior on tire combustion, the main constituents of tires, styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) and polyisoprene (IR), has been investigated in the same experimental conditions. The thermal degradation of SBR and IR suggests the reaction mechanisms including bond scissions followed by hydrogenation, gas phase addition reaction, and/or partial oxidation.									40	0	1	0	20	0	41			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000311810800022	23145576

Nowadays, the robust coupling of TMDs and LDH based materials emerged as an efficient electrocatalyst for significant electrochemical applications. The binder-free, flexible, bi-functional catalysts, 3D hybrid nanostructures of coupled TMDs/LDH on the carbon cloth (CC) electrode substrate. Initially, the hierarchical NiS nanoflowers were self assembled on a flexible CC substrate via hydrothermal approach. Herein, the Sr-Fe LDH nanosheets are vertically anchored on high conductive and flexible NiS/CC electrodes without destroying the original architecture by the electrodeposition method. This enriched 3D hybrid NiS@ Sr-Fe OH/CC nanostructure provides enormous nucleation active sites with interconnected layers leading to the enhancement of electrocatalytic behaviour. The outstanding structural and morphological advantages accelerate the electrochemical activities and reaction kinetics of prepared NiS/CC, Sr-Fe OH/CC and NiS@ Sr-Fe OH/CC flexible electrode based supercapacitor exhibits the specific capacitance of 556, 1151 and 1553 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 current density respectively.

J	Chretien, Steeve; Metiu, Horia								O-2 evolution on a clean partially reduced rutile TiO2(110) surface and on the same surface precovered with Au-1 and Au-2: The importance of spin conservation								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				129	7					074705	10.1063/1.2956506				AUG 21 2008	2008	We have used spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) to study O-2 evolution on a clean partially reduced rutile TiO2(110) surface (i.e., a surface having oxygen vacancies) and its interaction with Au-1 or Au-2 cluster adsorbed on it. We assume that the total spin of the electronic wave function is related to the number of unpaired spins (N-s) and calculate the binding and the activation energies involved in O-2 evolution for fixed values of N-s. In addition to keeping N-s constant, we assume that reactions in which the N-s of the reactants differs from that of the products are very slow. The potential energy surfaces obtained in this way depend strongly on N-s. For example, O-2 dissociation at the vacancy site on a clean partially reduced TiO2(110) surface is exothermic by 0.85 eV in the triplet state and the highest activation energy in the chain of reactions leading to the O-2 dissociation is 0.67 eV. In the singlet state, O-2 dissociation is endothermic by 0.11 eV and the activation energy leading to dissociation is 1.30 eV. These observations are in qualitative agreement with scanning tunneling microscopy experiment in which O-2 dissociation on a partially reduced rutile TiO2(110) surface is observed at temperature as low as 120 K. In contrast, O-2 dissociation is predicted to be endothermic and is prevented by an activation barrier larger than 1 eV in all the previous DFT calculations, in which the DFT program varies N-s to get the lowest energy state. We find that on a partially reduced rutile TiO2(110) with Au-1 and Au-2 preadsorbed on its surface, O-2 dissociates at the vacancy site: One oxygen atom fills the oxygen vacancy and the other becomes available for oxidation chemistry. This means that Au-1 and Au-2 supported on a partially reduced TiO2(110) surface is not an oxidation catalyst since the presence of oxygen turns it into a stoichiometric Au-n/TiO2(110) surface. Finally, we find that the evolution of oxygen on Au-1 and Au-2 in the gas phase is very different from the evolution on the same clusters supported on the partially reduced TiO2(110) surface. For example, the molecular adsorption of O-2 is favored in the gas phase (except on Au-1(-) and Au-2(-) in the quartet state), while the dissociative adsorption is favored by more than 1 eV when Au-1 and Au-2 are supported on the partially reduced TiO2(110). Furthermore, the activation energies associated with O-2 dissociation in the gas phase (Delta E-act>2.4 eV) are reduced by at least a factor of 2 when the clusters are supported on TiO2(110).

The sintering characteristics were checked by measuring the surface areas and dimensional changes. The neck growth of the silver ultrafine powders occurred at room temperature and the densification occurred at temperatures above 473 K. The evolved gases, detected with a quadrupole mass spectrometer, were mainly CO, CO2, H2O and H2. The peaks of these gases were observed around 370, 480, 530, 620 and 710 K. These evolution peaks are explained as follows. The peak at 370 K was the evolution of CO and CO2 produced by the reaction of adsorbed oxygen with a surface carbon impurity. The peak at 480 K was the evolution of CO2 due to the decomposition of the adsorbed surface carbonate CO3 (ad). The peak at 620 K was the evolution of CO3 CO2 and H2O with hydrocarbon accompanying the decomposition of Ag2O. The peak at temperatures above 710 K was the evolution of CO and CO2 by the reaction of subsurface oxygen with a surface carbon impurity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0453-9222			INSPEC:3841911

Here, we report a highly efficient Fe-V based hybrid electrocatalyst by fabricating active metal nitrides (FeN, Fe3N and VN) on the Fe-V oxide surface. Structural and chemical state characteristics reveal that the Fe-N and V-N moieties are confined to the Fe-V oxide surface lattice, which not only gives rise to electrochemically active sites, but also facilitates electron transfer for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). More importantly, the metal-nitrogen moieties undergo surface reconstruction to form an iron (oxy)hydroxide active layer during the OER process, which promotes electron flow from V to Fe sites via the bridging oxygen, greatly benefiting the O-2 release from the Fe sites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000804235100001

The results revealed that the rate of corrosion does not monotonically increase with concentration. Moreover, the maximum degradation occurs at the concentration where the anodic process (oxygen evolution) proceeds hardly. According to polarization curves, the electrode exhibited obvious electrocatalytic activity (for anode reaction) by forming oxide layer. To scrutinize the localized damage, occurring at the bottom of anode, we also took some scanning electron micrographs with energy dispersive X-ray analyses. The investigations suggested a new mechanism, that is, a complicated migration phenomenon, resulting from an electrodissolution/sedimentation/deposition process.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2090-9063	2090-9071		WOS:000325879100001

Unexpectedly, its electrocorrosion (with the concomitant loss of Ga) leads simultaneously to three crystalline types of MnOx minerals with distinct structures and induced defects: birnessite delta-MnO2, feitknechtite beta-MnOOH, and hausmannite alpha-Mn3O4. The abundance and intrinsic stabilization of Mn-III/Mn-IV active sites in the three MnOx phases explains the superior efficiency and durability of the system for electrocatalytic water oxidation. After electrophoretic deposition of the MnGa4 precursor on conductive nickel foam (NF), a low overpotential of 291 mV, comparable to that of precious-metal-based catalysts, could be achieved at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a durability of more than five days.									37	2	0	0	4	0	39			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000492255100001	31483557

Herein, we develop a facile and controllable approach to engineer a series of structurally tiered bimetallic Ni-Fe phosphide nanocomposites with well-designed architectures and compositions through the topological conversion of the flowerlike precursor of Ni-Fe layered double hydroxides (LDHs). Remarkably, benefitting from their special physicochemical features and desirable synergistic effect, the resultant bimetallic phosphides can serve as a class of advanced high-performance electrocatalysts for water oxidation with an extremely low overpotential of 233 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 42.5 mV dec(-1), and strong durability (30 h of continuous water electrolysis), favourably representing the state-of-the-art level.

Low overpotential, better stability, and rapid kinetics are the key features to be considered while designing a competent OER catalyst. Herein, we have developed a rapid and efficient wet chemical route for the synthesis of a cobalt- and silver- based precatalytic oxalate (CoC2O4/Ag2C2O4) framework via a rapid precipitation method at room temperature. The optimized catalyst required an overpotential of 260 mV to reach the benchmark current density of 10 mA/cm(geo)(2), with a Tafel slope value of 47 mV/dec. It has also shown 72 h of chronopotentiometry stability as well as 1000 cycles of potentiodynamic stability along with 90% Faradaic efficiency in 1(M) KOH for OER. Addition of a minimal amount of silver component assists in the reduction of overpotential up to 120 mV compared to CoC2O4. Furthermore, the minimal amount of silver inclusion improved the charge migration property via lowering the charge-transfer resistance besides tuning the charge storage mechanism (b value). The paradigm shift in catalytic efficiency can be manifested by calculating both intrinsic (persite activity) and geometric (based on the effective area of electrode materials) activities. Interestingly, significant improvement in C-dl (double-layer capacitance) from 10.25 to 19.59 mF/cm(2) is achieved upon silver component inclusion, indicating a higher number of accessible catalytic sites for alkaline OER. The turnover frequency value further authenticates the importance of silver component in the precatalytic oxalate network for intrinsic catalytic activity under alkaline conditions. The mechanistic trajectory is also investigated from the proton reaction order (rho RHE), revealing the occurrence of the proton-decoupled electron transfer process for the optimized catalyst. The results reveal the efficient electrochemical surface reconstruction in the cobalt- and silver-based precatalytic oxalate framework for improved alkaline water oxidation through exposing the surface as well as bulk active centers for easy electrolyte diffusion in alkaline medium.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000809046600006

The results show that the composite plate can be used as current collectors replace the graphite plate in a vanadium battery, but there are some deterioration of its conductivity and some microstructure changes of the testing battery on the surface of the plate after more than 40 charge-discharge cycles.

As a model system a quasi-ternary materials library of Ni1-y-zFeyCrzOx was synthesized by combinatorial reactive magnetron sputtering, characterized by XAS, and an automated scanning droplet cell. The presence of Cr was found to increase the OER activity in the investigated compositional range. The electronic structure of Ni-II and Cr-III remains unchanged over the investigated composition spread. At the Fe L-edge a linear combination of two spectra was observed. These spectra were assigned to Fe-III in O-h symmetry and Fe-III in T-d symmetry. The ratio of Fe-III O-h to Fe-III T-d increases with the amount of Cr and a correlation between the presence of the Fe-III O-h and a high OER activity is found.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			2045-2322			WOS:000396424000001	28287134

Cobalt hydroxide (alpha-Co(OH)(2)) is one of the most encouraging electrocatalysts for the OER under alkaline conditions, but its catalytic activity is still unsatisfactory possibly due to its unfavorable electronic structure. The construction of heterogeneous catalysts has been considered as an effective strategy to change the interface and modulate the electronic structure of electrocatalysts, resulting in improved activities. Herein, novel self-supported alpha-Co(OH)(2) coated Co3O4 nanosheet arrays on conductive carbon cloth have been constructed and fabricated via a simple electrodeposition method (alpha-Co(OH)(2)/Co3O4/CC), serving as efficient catalysts for the OER. The as-prepared heterostructure with optimal proportions of alpha-Co(OH)(2) to Co3O4 exhibits an enhanced overpotential of 275 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) (322 mV for alpha-Co(OH)(2)/CC and 359 mV for Co3O4/CC), a low Tafel slope of 76 mV dec(-1) and excellent durability for 22 h. The further electrochemical results show that the formation of heterostructure can optimize the electronic structure of the catalysts through interfacial coupling effect, improve the charge transfer ability and increase the electrochemical active sites, all of which are beneficial to the OER performance enhancement. This work not only develops a highly efficient and stable non-precious metal catalyst toward the OER, but also opens up new ways for boosting the performance by regulating the electronic structure through interface engineering of electrocatalysts and beyond.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000641430400001

Here, CoNi nanoparticles embedded in the bamboo-like N-doped carbon tubes (CoxNiy@NC) were synthesized, where the optimized catalyst of Co2Ni1 @NC exhibits superior bifunctional electrocatalytic activity, showing a low overpotential of 300 mV under the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and a large limiting current density of 3.76 mA cm(-2) under 0.40 V for ORR in an alkaline solution. In addition, the Co2Ni1@NC also shows excellent electrocatalytic activity in acidic and neutral solutions. Importantly, primary Zn-air batteries based on Co2Ni1@NC affords an excellent specific capacity of 834 mAh/g(Zn) with a discharge potential of 1.25 V at 5 mA cm(-2).

J	Lv, Chao-Nan; Zhang, Lei; Huang, Xin-Hua; Zhu, Yuan-Xin; Zhang, Xin; Hu, Jin-Song; Lu, Shih-Yuan								Double functionalization of N-doped carbon carved hollow nanocubes with mixed metal phosphides as efficient bifunctional catalysts for electrochemical overall water splitting								NANO ENERGY				65						103995	10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.103995				NOV 2019	2019	A double functionalization approach was developed to create efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for electrochemical overall water splitting. Uniform Ni-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)center dot 12H(2)O nanocubes were taken as the starting material to fabricate the bifunctional catalysts through ammonia carving, conformal polydopamine coating, precursor metal ion coordination, and thermal phosphorization. N-doped carbon carved hollow nanocubes were loaded with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) active (Ni-Co) phosphides in the interior cyanide-derived carbon layers and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) active (Ni-Fe) phosphides on the exterior polydopaimne-derived carbon layers. The product catalyst exhibited excellent electrolytic performances, achieving overpotentials of 251 and 142 mV for the OER and HER, respectively and a working cell voltage of 1.63 V for the overall water splitting all at 10 mA/cm(2). Holes of several tens nanometers in size located at the eight vertices of the hollow cube allow easy access of the electrolyte to and fast rejection of evolving gas bubbles from the interior of the cube. The N-doped carbon nanocubes, providing fast charge transport pathway, and the positive synergistic effects arising from the mixed metal phosphides, significantly enhanced catalytic performances of the product catalyst. Both quantity and quality of the active sites are largely improved with the doubly functionalized N-doped carbon carved hollow nanocubes, which is a superior catalyst design for all electrocatalytic applications.									98	7	0	0	6	0	98			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000496445600024

In this work, we investigated the ORR catalyzed by iron(II) phthalocyanine (FePc), which has a structure similarity to the heme group of O-2-binding proteins and reducing enzymes, at the polarized water/1,2-dichloroethane interface. Using the four-electrode cyclic voltammetry and the shake-flask biphasic reaction under chemically controlled polarization, it was demonstrated that FePc could catalyze the molecular oxygen reduction by lipophilic electron donors, such as 1,1'-dimethylferrocene (DFc) or tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), at the heterogeneous phase boundary. The overall process essentially can be equivalent to an interfacial proton transfer coupled ORR, which proceeds preferentially via a four electron reduction pathway to produce mainly H2O with only minority of H2O2 (less than 5%). The catalytic activity of FePc was compared with all previously studied porphyrins and phthalocyanines. The reaction mechanism was also analyzed, in which a hydroperoxo intermediate was probably involved. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, uniform FeS/Fe3C nanoparticles embedded in a porous N,S-dual doped carbon honeycomb-like composite (abbr. FeS/Fe3C@NS-C-900) have been conveniently fabricated by pyrolysis of a single-crystal Fe-MOF, which has a low potential gap Delta E of ca. 0.72 V, a competitive power density of 90.9 mW/cm(2), a specific capacity as high as 750 mAh/gZn, and excellent cycling stabilities over 865 h (1730 cycles) at 2 mA/cm(2) when applied as a cathode material for rechargeable zinc-air batteries. In addition, the two series-linked Zn-air batteries successfully powered a 2.4 V LED light as a real power source. The efficient ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalytic activity and long-term durability of the obtained composite might be attributed to the characteristic honeycomb-like porous structure with sufficient accessible active sites, the synergistic effect of FeS and Fe3C, and the N,S codopedporous carbon, which provides a promising application potential for portable electronic Zn-air battery related devices.									68	4	0	0	3	0	68			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000579956100030	32902956

The function of Ce3+ on the improvement of chloroplast photoreduction activity and oxygen evolution damaged by linolenic acid in spinach by in vitro investigation was studied. Results showed that adding Ce3+ to the linolenic acid treated chloroplast could greatly decrease the reduction linolenic acid exerted on the whole chain electron transport rate and the photoreduction activity of photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI) as well as the oxygen evolution rate of chloroplast.

However, its use was largely confined to morphologies of particles and thin films. Here, we assembled NiO nanoparticles into mesoporous polyhedra with better active-site exposure for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis. It needs an overpotential of 280 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2)in 1.0 M KOH, outperforming many reported transition-metal oxides. Its activity can be mantained for at least 20 hours. High surface area of mesoporous polyhedra affirmed by Brunner-Emmet-Teller measurement contributes to the outstanding catalytic activity. Using one of the most abundant metal elements to constuct high-performance OER catalysts will provide great convenience for industrial applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2365-6549			WOS:000545756700001

Here, on the basis of first-principles calculations, we predicted a two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic framework (MOF) bifunctional electrocatalyst, namely, bis(iminothiolato)nickel (NiIT) monolayer, for overall water splitting. The semi-metallic properties and low HER/OER overpotentials (-0.15/0.50 V) ensure the remarkable electrocatalytic performance of the 2D MOF electrocatalyst. The spatially separated HER and OER active sites with different electronegativities facilitate the electrocatalytic processes. Our findings highlight a promising precious-metal-free bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient overall water splitting, as well as a novel strategy in catalyst design.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000492803300015

Here we report triple-hierarchical nanoporous Ni(Cu)@NiFeP onto nickel foam (NM) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for HER and HzOR. The as-prepared catalyst with a 54-fold increased electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) presents remarkable HzOR activity, requiring a potential of 6 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, which is comparable to commercial Pt/C. Assembling in an electrolyzer for HER and HzOR, the Ni (Cu)@NiFeP/NM cell requires a cell voltage of 0.491 V to offer 100 mA cm(-2), far lower than that of overall water splitting. The superior catalytic performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect from crystalline Ni (Cu) alloy and amorphous NiFe P-derivatives, as well as structural advantages of the unique 3D hierarchical porous nanostructures. The study also presents a strategy for accurate design and construction of multiple hierarchy of nanomaterials for energy storage and conversion devices. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, a series of Ni-Co precursors supported by carbon cloth (CC) were prepared by hydrothermal method and subsequently treated with phosphating and oxidation, respectively. The phosphating products and oxidation products were used for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR), respectively. The materials morphology and electron configuration were also controlled by adjusting relative Ni-Co content in the precursors. Furthermore, the effects of different Ni-Co ratios on electrocatalytic activity under the same crystal structure were discussed in detail. Benefited from the optimum electron structure and maximum active sites, Ni2Co1-P/CC displayed the best HER catalytic performance, with an overpotential of 79 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2). On account of the comparatively low theoretical oxidation voltage of urea, NixCo3-x-O/CCs displayed a much lower working potential in urea-containing electrolyte than the urea-free electrolyte. Thereinto, Ni1.5Co1.5-O/CC showed the best UOR catalytic performance, with a potential of 1.362 V at eta(10) in 1.0 M KOH and 0.33 M urea. With the combination of the above catalysts, it needed only 1.47 V to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the electrolytic cell for hydrogen production via UOR. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, thin carbon coated nickel-based nanosheets (Ni@C NSs) were designed and synthesized by controlling the successive assembly and carbothermal reduction under an inert atmosphere. The nanosheets were assembled by partially reduced Ni nanoparticles and NiO nanoparticles wrapped in thin graphitic carbon. Dodecyl amine played a vital role in the structuredirecting of the interconnected nanosheets by suppressing the nanoparticles growth and providing a protective effect on the low-valence nickel. The resulting metallic Ni and NiO were the effective active sites for hydrogen and oxygen evolution, respectively; moreover, the neighboring other nickel species could exert a good synergetic effect on the electrocatalytic reaction. The outside thin carbon film was also conducive to the electrochemical stability. Furthermore, based on the practical application considerations, the Ni@C NSs were directly grown on the Ni foam surface. The water electrolyser made up of Ni@C NSs/Ni foam electrodes presented a 1.57 V cell voltage in an alkaline medium accompanied with long-term durability. The highly active transition-metal catalysts with two valences is promising for full water splitting devices.									60	3	0	0	3	0	60			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000376035300027

This issue severely limits the implementation of certain strategies like the synergistic thermal effect. Here, by developing a combined monitor method based on open-circuit potential decay, we demonstrate that semiconductor-cocatalyst interfacial electron transfer occurring on a decisecond to second time scale dominates photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. This time scale is approximately 6-12 orders of magnitude larger than the widely reported values of picoseconds to microseconds and is comparable to that predicted by Durrant et al. To improve photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, we manage to create more intermediate sites by electronically doping the semiconductor surface. This measure promotes semiconductorcocatalyst interfacial electron transfer by charge recombination and makes the synergistic thermal effect very evident.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1948-7185			WOS:000687716600002	34351768

In this study, TiO2 possessing different types and concentration of oxygen vacancies were prepared by annealing nanotube titanic acid (NTA) at various temperatures in air or vacuum atmosphere. TiO2 with the unitary bulk single-electron-trapped oxygen vacancies (SETOVs) formed when NTA were calcined in air. Whereas, TiO2 with both bulk and surface oxygen vacancies were obtained when NTA were annealed in vacuum. The series of TiO2 with different oxygen vacancies were systematically characterized by TEM, XRD, PL, XPS, ESR, and TGA. The PL and ESR analysis verified that surface oxygen vacancies and more bulk oxygen vacancies could form in vacuum atmosphere. Surface oxygen vacancies can trap electron and hinder the recombination of photo-generated charges, while bulk SETOVs act as the recombination center. The surface or bulk oxygen vacancies attributed different roles on the photo-absorbance and activity, leading that the sample of NTA-A400 displayed higher hydrogen evolution rate under UV light, whereas NTA-V400 displayed higher hydrogen evolution rate under visible light because bulk SETOVs can improve visible light absorption because sub-band formed by bulk SETOVs prompted the secondary transition of electron excited.

Using cluster-expansion theory to study alloys of PtXnY2-n monolayers at various concentrations, for half coverage (n = 1), our results indicate that Janus-type structures are not energetically the most favorable for PtXY monolayers; however, they are dynamically and thermally stable. To distinguish Janus PtXY structures, we report the Raman-active modes and compared them with those of bare PtX2 monolayers. The electronic band gaps calculated with use of hybrid functionals are on par with available experimental data. Spin-orbit coupling significantly modifies the electronic band structure of PtXY monolayers. Because of the electronegativity differences of different chalcogen atoms on each surface of Janus PtXY structures, the arising dipole moment significantly modifies the band alignments on both surfaces. We find that hydrogen-evolution and oxygen-evolution reactions occur on different surfaces and that applied strain enhances the catalytic activity. We also investigate the monovacancy and stacking effects on the electronic properties of PtX2 and PtXY structures. Our results indicate that due to their intrinsic dipole moments and band gaps, Janus PtXY monolayers are perfect candidates for water-splitting reactions.									33	1	0	0	0	0	33			2331-7019			WOS:000537317200001

In this research, novel hybrid electrocatalysts based on coupling a hierarchical porous NiCo-mixed metal sulfide with a nanosheet structure (denoted as NiCoS) and a novel three-dimensional (3D) mesoporous open-cage/framelike structure of CoFeS are designed for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this regard, the single-step synthesis of a cobalt iron Prussian blue analog (CoFe PBA) frame/cagelike structure was performed without any etching step. Following a comparative study, CoFe PBA precursors were converted and doped with S, Se, and P vapors (CoFeS, CoFeSe, and CoFeP) by annealing the precursors with sulfur, selenium, and sodium hypophosphite powders, respectively. The electrochemical measurements demonstrated that CoFe doped with S and Se almost have similar performances for OER and are better than the P-doped one. In the last step, NiCoS nanosheet arrays were electrodeposited as a shell layer on CoFe (S, Se, and P) to examine their effect on the catalytic activity toward OER, and CoFeS@NiCoS showed better catalytic activity than CoFeSe@NiCoS and CoFeP@NiCoS. It can show the lowest overpotential of 293 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 40.6 mV dec(-1) and has pre-eminent long-range catalytic durability in 1.0 M KOH. This performance was comparable to those of noble-metal-free and commercial RuO2 catalysts. Its excellent electrocatalytic activity benefits from the frame/cagelike and nanosheet structures and good synergistic effects between multiple hybrid components (Ni, Co, Fe, and S), which leads to producing highly exposed active sites and accelerating mass and electron transport. This study represents an efficient approach to rationally design and synthesize three-dimensional porous architecture catalysts based on transition metals as highly efficient nonprecious electrocatalysts for the energy-pertinent reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000813033100001

We now report a hierarchical co-assembly of interacting MoS2 and Co9S8 nanosheets attached on Ni3S2 nanorod arrays which are supported on nickel foam (NF). This tiered structure endows high performance toward HER and OER over a very broad pH range. By adjusting the molar ratio of the Co:Mo precursors, we have created CoMoNiS-NF-xy composites (x:y means Co:Mo molar ratios ranging from 5:1 to 1:3) with controllable morphology and composition. The three-dimensional composites have an abundance of active sites capable of universal pH catalytic HER and OER activity. The CoMoNiS-NF-31 demonstrates the best electrocatalytic activity, giving ultralow overpotentials (113, 103, and 117 mV for HER and 166, 228, and 405 mV for OER) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline, acidic, and electrolytes, respectively. It also shows a remarkable balance between electrocatalytic activity and stability. Based on the distinguished catalytic performance of CoMoNiS-NF-31 toward HER and OER, we demonstrate a two-electrode electrolyzer performing water electrolysis over a wide pH range, with low cell voltages of 1.54, 1.45, and 1.80 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline, acidic, and neutral media, respectively. First-principles calculations suggest that the high OER activity arises from electron transfer from Co9S8 to MoS2 at the interface, which alters the binding energies of adsorbed species and decreases overpotentials. Our results demonstrate that hierarchical metal sulfides can serve as highly efficient all-pH (pH = 0-14) electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									397	19	0	0	26	0	398			0002-7863			WOS:000474669700036	31244177

Inspired by the Mn4CaO5 cluster in nature, substantial works have been performed to develop efficient manganese (Mn)-based heterogeneous catalysts. Despite improvements in catalytic activity, the underlying mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is not completely elucidated owing to the lack of direct spectroscopic evidence for the active Mn-oxo moieties. We identify water oxidation intermediates on the surface of Mn3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) in the OER at neutral pH by in situ Raman spectroscopy. A potential-dependent Raman peak was detected at 760 cm(-1) and assigned to the active Mn-IV=O species generated during water oxidation. Isotope-labeling experiments combined with scavenger experiments confirmed the generation of surface terminal Mn-IV=O intermediates in the Mn-oxide NPs. This study provides an insight into the design of systems for the observation of reaction intermediates.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000605686000001	33417273

However, its widespread application is limited owing to issues associated with oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, including activity and stability. Thus, it is necessary to develop highly active and durable catalysts in this regard. Herein, an IrOx@IrO2 catalyst with an ultrahigh surface area (G-450) was synthesized by a simple Adams fusion method and calcined at 450 degrees C with glycine as an additive. Owing to its micro/mesoporous structure, this catalyst exhibited an ultrahigh specific surface area (SSA) of 403 m(2) g(-1) and an amorphous structure with average oxidation states of Ir(IV). A trade-off between its OER activity and stability was achieved by controlling its SSA and Ir oxidation states via the optimization of the calcination temperature. Surface-rich Ir(III) species and high SSA enhanced the OER activity of G-450 (309 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2)) compared with the IrO2 catalyst prepared without glycine (A-450, 351 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2)). Further, the G-450 exhibited an Ir dissolution rate that was 2.5-fold lower than that of the IrO2 catalyst prepared at 350 degrees C (G-350) after 6 h chronopotentiometry at 10 mA cm(-2), implying a higher stability owing to the presence of Ir(IV) species. Additionally, G-450 was introduced into the anode of the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer single cell and demonstrated higher performance than A-450. The balanced activity and stability of IrOx@IrO2 enhanced the PEM water electrolyzer performance. Moreover, this facile synthetic method is also applicable to the synthesis of binary oxide compounds and other transition metal oxides. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Compared to carbide MXenes, nitride MXenes feature metal-nitrogen bonds that are expected to impart unique electronic and structural characteristics for electrocatalysis. Recently, we showed that the HER activity can be enhanced by modifying a pristine exfoliated Ti4N3Tx MXene with various metal ions to produce mixed-metal nitride MXenes M-Ti4N3Tx (M = V, Cr, Mo, and Mn; T-x = O and/or OH). Here, we use in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to elucidate the mechanisms of HER activity in these 2D M-Ti(4)N(3)Tx MXenes. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) results confirm the presence of multiple oxidation states in the Ti4N3Tx and M-Ti4N3Tx MXenes during electrochemical and HER activities. In most cases, metal-ion oxidation states are unaffected over the potential range studied except for the Cr-Ti(4)N(3)Tx MXene that undergoes a partial reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ during HER. The structural analysis of the M-Ti4N3Tx MXenes under electrochemical and HER conditions is provided by the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), which further reveals that the mechanism of HER catalysis involves the creation of oxygen vacancies on the basal planes. The XAS data are clear that these oxygen vacancies are coincident with metal-ion reduction, which combined generate active sites for HER. We find that the alloyed metal can either change the reduction potential of the Ti4+ ions (in the Mo-Ti4N3Tx MXene) or act as a single-atom catalyst (in the Cr-Ti4N3Tx MXene), both of which can be exploited to tune the activity in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis schemes.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000626844200060

Herein, a facile and general synthesis of highly ordered two-dimensional metal oxides nanomaterials includes Co3O4, NiO, CuO, and Fe3O4 nanosheets as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is demonstrated. Among the synthesized 2D transition metal oxides, the Co3O4 nanosheet exhibits smallest overpotential (eta) of similar to 384.0 mV at a current density of 10.0 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of similar to 52.0 mV dec(-1), highest mass activity of similar to 112.3 A g(-1) at the overpotential of similar to 384.0 mV, and high turn over frequency (TOF) of 0.099 s(-1), which is relatively favorable with state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst. The present synthetic approach may unlock a brand new pathway to prepare shape-controlled Earth-abundant transition metal oxides nanomaterials for electrocatalytic OER.									29	1	0	0	1	0	29			0743-7463			WOS:000530653700019	32275444

The electrolyte contained up to 0.8 mM dissolved cobalt and the preanodization current, i(a), ranged from 0.05 to 5 A cm-2. In the presence of dissolved cobalt, an anodic coating of CoOOH/Co3O4 is formed on the nickel substrate. The electrocatalytic activity increases as i(a) or the concentration in dissolved cobalt is increased. With 0.4 mM dissolved cobalt, the improved electrocatalytic activity is due to a linear increase in exchange current density through the charge associated with the reduction of the loading. The Tafel slope remains unaffected.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17			0021-891X			WOS:A1991FT51400007

It was found that a combination of classical steady-state voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy can help to elucidate dilemmas concerning the role of the Heyrovsky and Tafel steps in the mechanism of this reaction. Thus, within the potential region - 0.95 > E > - 1.1 V (SHE) (curvilinear part of the polarization curve) the mechanism of the her is a consecutive combination of the Volmer step, followed dominantly by a rate controlling Tafel step, while the contribution of the parallel Heyrovsky step is negligible. At potentials E < (approximately - 1.2 V) a Tafel line with a slope of - 0.121 V dec(-1) is obtained, with almost full coverage by H-ads (<theta>(H) -->1). In this potential region the mechanism of the her is a consecutive combination of a Volmer step, followed by a Heyrovsky step, while the contribution of the Tafel step is negligible. The comparison of the calculated partial rate constants for these two steps shows that the rate of the her is controlled by the Heyrovsky step.

Thanks to the integrating effect, close to 100% conversion of benzylamine (75.2 h(-1) turnover frequency), 97% selectivity for imine with 21.4 mmol g(-1) h(-1) hydrogen evolution rate ( > 420 nm) and 11.2% apparent quantum yield (450 nm, 10 mg catalyst) have been achieved at room temperature and ambient pressure. In comparison with the use of common sacrificial agents like TEOA or Na2S/Na2SO3, by the coupling of amines to imines, the H-2 evolution rate increases by two orders of magnitude. The aforementioned integrating strategy has been extended to diverse amines, and an outstanding photocatalytic performance for H-2 and imine production was obtained. Besides, the catalyst can be recycled several times without evident activity loss, suggesting a bright prospect for sustainable chemistry and solar utilization. This new discovery may open a new horizon for efficiently boosting solar hydrogen evolution and simultaneously clean producing diverse high value-added fine chemicals under mild conditions.									29	3	0	0	0	0	28			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000448338700004

It results in ultra-low metal loading (0.42 mu g cm(-2)) and remarkably large TOF of 14.03 s(-1)for the oxygen evolution reaction, which is three orders of magnitude higher than that of state-of-the-art FeNi catalysts. A "volcano"-shaped activity trend in specific activity and TOF was found to depend on the Fe content in FeNi oxyhydroxide.

The correlation between the coating preparations and their electrochemical performances was investigated by analysis of the electrochemical data. The efficiency of the NiCo2O4 electrodes changed significantly with the changing of the preparation method. Two Tafel slopes for the OER were observed in most cases.

However, the catalytic performance of up-to-now reported CoSe2-based OER catalysts is still far below commercial expectation. Herein, we report a hybrid catalyst consisting of CoSe2 nanosheets grafted on defective graphene (DG). This catalyst exhibits a largely enhanced OER activity and robust stability in alkaline solution (overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2): 270 mV; Tafel plots: 64 mV dec(-1)). Both experimental evidence and density functional theory calculations reveal that the outstanding OER performance of this hybrid catalyst can be attributed to the synergetic effect of exposed cobalt atoms and carbon defects (electron transfer from CoSe2 layer to defect sites at DG). Our results suggest a promising way for the development of highly efficient and low-cost OER catalysts based on transition metal dichalcogenides.									29	1	0	0	0	0	29				2589-0042		WOS:000449735000012	30267676

Thus, identifying the OER rate limiting step is a cornerstone to enhancing the current under low applied potential. Different measurement techniques showed similar absorption difference spectra during a change in applied potential on the hematite anode below and above the onset of the OER in the dark and under light. This absorption change was shown to result from surface modification during the OER, but the specific surface species could not be resolved. On the basis of ab initio calculations, we analyze the calculated absorption spectra in relation to previous measurements. We provide for the first time solid evidence to specify H2O + *O -> *OOH + H+ + e(-) as the rate limiting step and *O as the bottleneck intermediate of the hematite OER.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000405422900037	28640300

In this paper, we utilized a simple electroless deposition method to deposit Co-W-P on carbon cloth (CC), to construct a bifunctional Co-W-P/CC self-supported electrode for electrochemical water splitting in 1.0 M KOH. The Co-W-P on CC is amorphous and displays nodular structure. The molar ratio of Co2+/WO42- in the synthesis process makes remarkable influence on the catalytic activity of Co-W-P/CC. For optimized Co-W-P/CC-3 (Co2+/WO42- molar ratio about 6:1), an overpotential of 150 mV at -10 mA.cm(-2) is required with a Tafel slope of 137.3 mV.dec(-1) toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and an overpotential of 350 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) is required with a Tafel slope of 113.2 mV.dec(-1) toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Furthermore, when functioned as a bifunctional electrode for overall water splitting, the electrolyzer of Co-W-P/CC(-)//Co-W-P/CC(+) shows the cell voltage of 1.74 V at 10 mA.cm(-2), as well as superior stability with negligible increase of cell voltage (0.05 V) over 20 h. The work provides an efficient and inexpensive electrode material, which can be used to replace the noble metal-based catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2053-1591			WOS:000488098800004

Different NiOx films adhered rigidly on nickel foam (NF) and fluorine-doped tin oxide substrates were prepared via a mixed metal-imidazole casting method from precursor solutions containing Ni salts with four different counter anions of SO42-, NO3-, Cl- and CH3COO- (Ac) in methanol/1-methyimidazole mixed solvents (3:1) followed by calcination at 450 degrees C. The counter ions of Ni salts are significantly influential on the structure and characteristics of the formed NiOx films. In the case of the film (SO4-NiOx) prepared from the NiSO4 precursor, an amorphous (NiOx)-O-III nanosheet film was formed in contrast to face-centered cubic (NiO)-O-II crystalline nanoparticle films formed using the other precursors, under the same conditions. The special characteristics of the SO4-NiOx film are caused by the inhibition effect of the SO42- ions on the thermochemical formation of (NiO)-O-II from the precursor complex, leading to the formation of a (NiOx)-O-III intermediate. The SO4-NiOx/NF electrode demonstrated superior OER performance with an overpotential, eta(10) = 228 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline KOH solutions, which is lower by 145 similar to 165 mV than those (eta(10) = 373 similar to 393 mV) of the other NiOx/NF electrodes. The OER performance of the SO4-NiOx/NF electrode compares advantageously with that of state-of-the-art Ni-based anodes reported to date.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000757762900001

The driving force for the SDDG is supersaturation, which could be controlled by the concentration of the different precursors, thus achieving non-uniform structures of the edges and inner sheets.

The chrysanthemum-like NiCo2O4/AgO composites mounted on nickel foam (NF) were synthesized by a hydrothermal-calcination method. AgO upgraded the ratio of Co3+/Co2+ and thus regulated the intrinsic activity of the species. The highly hierarchical structure of NiCo2O4/AgO composed of 0D AgO nanoparticles, 1D NiCo2O4 needles, 2D NiCo2O4 nanosheets, and 3D chrysanthemum-like bundles grown on NF bestowed the high surface area and mesoporous structure for the easy evolution of O-2. The Ni atoms in NiCo2O4 originating in situ from NF in the process of AgO formation produced an integrated electrode of the active component of NiCo2O4 bound on NF with a superb highway for charge transfer. AgO significantly tuned the structure and physicochemical properties of NiCo2O4. As a result, NiCo2O4/AgO/NF exhibited excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 232 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) in an alkaline electrolyte, and the catalyst showed a small loss of the initial catalyst activity for 50 h and over 5000 cycles. This study provides a pathway for developing high-performance OER electrocatalysts.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000524947900025	32195496

However, implementing an activation procedure to optimize the steel electrode surface is necessary. In this work, we activated 316 stainless steel (SS316) in KOH electrolytes of increasing concentration by applying an optimized potential of +1.70 V vs RHE for 18 hours. The electrocatalytic activity increased significantly with increasing the KOH concentration of the activation electrolyte, which is linked to a beneficial change in the surface composition during activation. The surface was analysed using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Glow Discharge Optical Emission Spectroscopy (GDOES) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). XPS showed an increasing Ni content (41% to 73%) in the surface with simultaneous removal of Cr (3.4% to 0%) and Fe (55% to 27%) with increasing KOH concentration of the activation electrolyte. Activation in minimum 7.5 M KOH gave the best performing OER electrode with an electrode potential (E) of +1.525 V vs. RHE at a current density (j) of 10 mA cm-2. Tafel slopes of around 40 mV dec-1 were found for all activated samples, indicating the same OER mechanism independent of the resulting surface composition. Reaction orders of 1.5 and 1.3 were found in the low and high potential regions, respectively. A negligible performance change was observed for the activated electrodes over a 48 h test at 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH. This work shows that the electrochemical activation of 316 stainless steel in high pH KOH electrolytes improves the OER activity significantly and that the surface composition can be tailored with KOH concentration up to 73% Ni. Through optimizing the surface composition, steel materials offer a cost-effective alternative to bulk nickel electrodes as OER electrodes in commercial AWE.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000809849800001

Influence of the electrolyte composition on the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction and ozone production processes								Journal of the Brazilian Chemical Society				17	4			446	757		10.1590/S0103-50532006000400017				2006-08	2006	The influence of electrolyte composition (pure sulphuric or perchloric acid and their mixtures) on the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the electrochemical ozone production (EOP) on beta-PbO2 electrodes was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and quasi-stationary polarisation curves. Analysis of the impedance spectra revealed a dependency of the electric double layer capacity and the adsorption pseudocapacitance, due to reaction intermediates, on electrolyte composition. The pseudocapacitance is a function of electrode potential and electrolyte composition, indicating the surface coverage by the reaction intermediates depends on these parameters. Tafel slope data support primary water discharge as rate determining step of the OER and EOP electrode processes. EOP current efficiency data (phiEOP) show pure electrolytes lead to maximum O3 production when compared to mixed electrolytes. According to the theoretical analysis of the electrode mechanism, this behaviour is a consequence of the reduction in surface concentration of the active centres leading to EOP caused by anion adsorption.		A influência da composição do eletrólito (ácido sulfúrico, ácido perclórico e suas misturas) sobre a cinética eletródica da reação de desprendimento de oxigênio (RDO) e a produção eletroquímica de ozônio (PEO) em eletrodo de beta-PbO2, foi investigada empregando-se a espectroscopia de impedância eletroquímica e curvas de polarização quase-estacionárias. A análise dos espectros de impedância revelou uma dependência da capacitância da dupla camada elétrica e da pseudo-capacitância de adsorsão dos intermediários da reação com a composição do eletrólito. A pseudo-capacitância é função do potencial do eletrodo e da composição do eletrólito, indicando que a cobertura superficial pelos intermediários da reação depende destes parâmetros. Os valores do coeficiente de Tafel apoiam a descarga primária da água como sendo a etapa determinante da velocidade do mecanismo eletródico descrevendo a RDO e a PEO. Os valores da eficiência da corrente para a PEO (fiPEO) mostram que os eletrólitos puros resultam numa produção máxima de ozônio quando comparados aos eletrólitos mistos. Baseada na análise teórica do mecanismo eletródico, este comportamento é conseqüente da redução na concentração superficial dos centros ativos responsáveis pela PEO ocasionada pela adsorsão de ânions.							2	1	0	0	0	0	2			1678-4790			SCIELO:S0103-50532006000400017

Amongst several predicaments, the presence of chloride ions in seawater competes with the OER as a more kinetically facile anodic reaction that results in the formation of toxic chlorine products. Herein, we propose a novel material combination, which exhibits higher OER activity and selectively over chlorine evolution reaction (CER) during simulated saline water electrolysis under neutral pH conditions. The proposed hybrid nanocomposite system, based on electroactive mixed metal oxides-decorated reduced graphene oxide (MnFeCoO4/rGO) which is incorporated with manganese carbonyl sulfide (Mn2S2(CO)(7)), are fabricated by a single-step hydro thermal technique. Benefiting from their heterogeneous interfaces, lower charge transfer resistance, and higher electrochemical (EC) and BET surface area, the hybrid graphene MnFeCoO4/Mn2S2(CO)(7)& nbsp;nano composite (HGNC) yields the best performance among various options towards OER from pH-neutral seawater (1 M PB thorn 0.6 M NaCl; pH 7.0) electrolysis, with small Tafel slope of 74.1 mVdec(-1) and correspondingly low overpotential of ~310 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mAcm(-2). The high activity at the aforementioned current density allows for overpotential operation below the minimum thermodynamic requirement needed for activating CER, thus ruling out progression of CER. Further, benefiting from the strong coupling effect between the MnFeCoO4/Mn2S(2)(CO)(7) species and the graphene support, appreciable stability was achieved for 15 h to deliver steady-state current stability without obvious decay, which demonstrating that HGNC is a promising candidate as an OER electrocatalyst for neutral seawater electrolysis.

Herein, trifunctional catalyst by coupling FeNx, FePx into N, P, S codoped carbon framewrok (Fe-N-C/FePx/NPSC) can be realized via salt assisted strategy by using sodium hypophosphite as the salt template and sodium ligninsulfonate chelated with iron element as the precursor. The Fe-N-C/FePx/NPSC with large specific surface area (782 m2 g-1), high pore volume (0.52 cm3 g-1) and multiple active sites exhibits excellent catalytic performances for ORR (E1/2 = 0.9 V), OER (Ei=10 = 370 mV in alkaline solution) and HER (Ei=10 = 125/198 mV in acidic/alkaline solution). The Zn-air battery based on Fe-N-C/FePx/NPSC displays a high power density of 216.88 mW cm-2 and strong stability, and the water-splitting electrolyzer assembled by Fe-N-C/FePx/NPSC only needs 1.57 V to reach 10 mA cm-2, which are better than those of Pt/C + IrO2 based devices. The flexible Zn-air batteries assembled by Fe-NC/FePx/NPSC exhibit high reliability under various deformation conditions, proving the potential for application in wearable devices. This work provides a potential way to design multifunctional carbon based electrocatalysts by using sustainable biomass precursors.									38	2	0	0	0	0	39			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664131800004

However, poor OER kinetics on the surface restricts the performance of the FeOOH electrocatalyst. Herein, a highly efficient and stable Ni(OH)(2)/beta-like FeOOH electrocatalyst is obtained by facile electroactivation treatment. The activated Ni(OH)(2)/beta-like FeOOH sample indicates an overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mAcm(-2) for the OER, and no clear current decay after 50 h of testing; this is comparable to the most efficient nickel- and cobalt-based electrocatalysts on planar substrates. Furthermore, studies suggest that beta-like FeOOH plays a key role in remarkably enhancing the performance during the electroactivation process owing to its metastable tunnel structure with a lower barrier for interface diffusion of Ni2+ ions between the bilayer electrocatalyst. This study develops a new strategy to explore efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts and deepens understanding of bilayer electrocatalysts for the OER.									24	2	0	0	0	0	25			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000413354300015	28795514

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the core of many renewable energy technologies. Developing low-cost and high-performance OER electrocatalysts is the key to implementing efficient energy conversion processes. Here, we synthesize ordered mesoporous iron-cobalt oxides using a hard template strategy. As a mesoporous oxide catalyst, meso-CoFe0.05Ox exhibits low OER overpotentials of 280 and 373 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, and does not show deactivation for at least 18 hours at 100 mA cm(-2). The introduction of iron can change the electronic structure of Co, and the orbital electrons are easily transferred from cobalt to iron. The enhanced OER performance can be attributed to concerted catalysis between the iron and cobalt sites that lowers the OER energy barrier, and the large specific surface area of the porous oxide providing efficient active sites for the reaction.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000711102900001	34698742

The development of cost-effective yet efficient electrocatalysts towards OER is highly desirable but still a great challenge at current stage. Herein, a new type of hybrid nanostructure, consisting of two-dimensional (2D) Cerium-doped NiFe-layered double hydroxide nanoflakes directly grown on the 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene surface (denoted as NiFeCe-LDH/MXene), is designed using a facile in situ coprecipitation method. The resultant NiFeCe-LDH/MXene hybrid presents a hierarchical nanoporous structure, high electrical conductivity and strong interfacial junction because of the synergistic effect of Ce doping and MXene coupling. As a result, the hybrid catalyst exhibits an excellent catalytic activity for OER, delivering a low onset overpotential of 197 mV and an overpotential of 260 mV at a current density of 10 mAcm (-2) in the alkaline medium, much lower than its pure LDH counterparts and IrO2 catalyst. Besides, the hybrid catalyst also displays a fast reaction kinetics and a remarkable stable durability. Further theoretic studies using density function theory (DFT) methods reveal that Ce doping could effectively narrow the bandgap of NiFe-LDH and reduce the overpotential in OER process. This work may shed light on the exploration of advanced electrocatalysts for renewable energy conversion and storage systems.

However, the shortage and sumptuosity of these noble metals limit their commercial applications. Herein, we prepared Ni0.33Co0.67MoS4 nanosheets on carbon fiber cloth (Ni0.33Co0.67MoS4/CFC) as bifunctional electrolytic water catalysts for both HER and OER. In the HER process, Ni0.33Co0.67MoS4/CFC exhibited an overpotential of only 48.0mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slope was 73.5 mV dec(-1). Moreover, in the OER process, Ni0.33Co0.67MoS4/CFC displayed a low overpotential of 283 mV at current densities of 10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slope was 68.8 mV dec(-1). More importantly, Ni0.33Co0.67MoS4/CFC could act as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to split water under a cell voltage of 1.55 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, negligible decay occurred after 20 h of continuous electrolysis testing. Such noble-metal-free electrocatalysts may provide a strategy for the design of high efficiency overall water splitting catalysts, which are expected to be applied to the actual electrolysis water industry.									37	1	0	0	3	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448413100027

By computing the Pourbaix diagrams, O-H binding energies, and C-H activation barriers, we determined that although none of these catalysts were able to activate methane, one was able to hydroxylate ethane to ethanol with facile kinetics, making it a promising electrocatalyst for natural gas oxidation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000610956600001	33458962

A major cause of failure for lead acid batteries is sulphation, i.e., accumulation of lead sulfate in the electrodes on cycling. Carbon additives help to convert lead sulfate formed during discharge into active materials by creating additional electroactive surface area for oxidation and reduction of Pb2+ ions (to PbO2 and Pb, respectively). However, it can also produce additional gassing at high temperature under overcharge conditions. There is a very delicate equilibrium between these competing reactions, that are mainly controlled by the electrochemically active area. Other materials (organics or inorganics) can also interfere with carbon by hindering or catalyzing the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions.					11th International Conference on Lead-Acid Batteries (LABAT)11th International Conference on Lead-Acid Batteries (LABAT)	JUN 08-11, 2021JUN 08-11, 2021	Inbatec; Kustan; Terranova Papers; Elhim Iskra; Wavetech; Cabot; CMWTEC; Microporous; Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Electrochemistry & Energy Syst, Lead Acid Batteries DeptInbatec; Kustan; Terranova Papers; Elhim Iskra; Wavetech; Cabot; CMWTEC; Microporous; Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Electrochemistry & Energy Syst, Lead Acid Batteries Dept	ELECTR NETWORKELECTR NETWORK	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					*****************	WOS:000719299600030

Light-dependent damage and repair occur in PSII under conditions of high light stress. The core reaction center complex is composed of the D1, D2, CP43, and CP47 intrinsic polypeptides. In this study, a new chromophore formed from the oxidative post-translational modification of tryptophan is identified in the CP43 subunit. Tandem mass spectrometry peptide sequencing is consistent with the oxidation of the CP43 tryptophan side chain, Trp-365, to produce N-formylkynurenine (NFK). Characterization with ultraviolet visible absorption and ultraviolet resonance Raman spectroscopy supports this assignment. An optical assay suggests that the yield of NFK increases 2-fold (2.2 +/- 0.5) under high light illumination. A concomitant 2.4 +/- 0.5-fold decrease is observed in the steady-state rate of oxygen evolution under the high light conditions. NFK is the product formed from reaction of tryptophan with singlet oxygen, which can be produced under high light stress in PSII. Reactive oxygen species reactions lead to oxidative damage of the reaction center, D1 protein turnover, and inhibition of electron transfer. Our results are consistent with a role for the CP43 NFK modification in photoinhibition.									49	0	0	0	38	0	49			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000291719900070	21527632

Recently, the usage of cyanometallate based coordination polymers as electrocatalysts for water oxidation has acquired an expanding measure of attraction attributable to their high surface area and stability. In this study, a homo-metallic Ni based cyanometallate coordination polymer [{Ni-II(4,4'-dipy)(4)}{Ni(CN)(4)}](n).(4,4'-dipy). 3H(2)O.C2H6O2 (1) (4,4'-dipy = 1,3-di(4-pyridyl)propane) is presented as an efficacious and robust electrocatalyst towards water oxidation reaction at pH = 13. The inimitable 3-D zig-zag topology of 1 has directed to similar to 28 times enhanced surface concentration (Gamma) i.e. 39.5 nmol/cm(2) as compared to the reported CoFe(CN)(6) (Gamma = 1.4 +/- 0.2 nmol/cm(2)). The 1 presents a TOF of 0.25 s(-1) at an overpotential (eta) of 381 mV (vs. RHE) which is much larger than those reported for other cyanide bridged and Ni based coordination polymers for instance: CoFe(CN) 6 (TOF = 2 x 10(-3) s(-1), eta = 300 mV), CoFe(CN)(5)-PVP (TOF = 2 x 10(-3) s(-1), eta = 284 mV), Codca2 (TOF = 2 x 10 3 s(-1), eta = 358 mV), Ni-UMOFNs (TOF = 0.18 s(-1), eta = 300 mV), bulk NiCo-MOFs (TOF = 0.15 s(-1), eta = 300 mV) and Ni-MOF/NF (TOF = 0.25 s(-1), eta = 400 mV).The overpotential (eta) of of 315 mV is required to produce a current density (J) of 1 mA/cm(2). Controlled potential electrolysis (CPE), PXRD and FT-IR experiments confirm that 1 remains active and chemically integrate over a 36,000 s test reaction. The outcomes of the comprehensive electrochemical investigations are prophesied to direct the imminent development in designing noble metal free, efficient and low-priced electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0020-1693	1873-3255		WOS:000693354900013

Bandarenka, Aliaksandr/AAO-1553-2021	Watzele, Sebastian/0000-0003-4154-5886			Quick Determination of Electroactive Surface Area of Some Oxide Electrode Materials								ELECTROANALYSIS				28	10			2394	2399		10.1002/elan.201600178				OCT 2016	2016	Quick and accurate determination of the real electroactive surface area of oxide electrodes remains one of the most challenging but at the same time important unsolved methodological tasks in the field of electroanalysis. For instance, the widely used Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method unfortunately provides no direct connection to it. On the other hand, its assessment through the double layer capacitance is complicated and not accurate enough, as the bulk oxide films themselves contribute to the measured capacitance, not mentioning the double layer frequency dispersion and other poorly understood factors. In this work, we propose a relatively simple methodology for a quick assessment of the electroactive surface area of some electron conducting oxide and perovskite materials. The methodology involves several steps. Initially, "calibration" experiments are performed aiming to form the thinnest (practically below similar to 100-200 nm) flat oxide films, which exhibit necessary functional properties (close to those expected for the bulk material) without significant side influence of the substrate. Then, AFM measurements are implemented to estimate the surface roughness of the resulting samples. Finally, electrochemical impedance measurements are done at a small overpotential related to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) aiming to extract not the double layer but the capacitance of adsorption Ca of the OER intermediates. The Ca values can then be used to evaluate the electroactive surface area of "real-world" high surface area oxide electrodes composed of the same material. Other words, similar to the hydrogen underpotential deposition or CO oxidation in the case of metals, we propose to use the oxygen evolution reaction as the probing reaction to evaluate the surface area of oxide electrocatalysts. However, instead of cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is used as the main probing technique. Due to relatively high reproducibility, clear physical meaning and exclusive connection to the electroactive area, the measurements of Ca can become a viable method in numerous electrochemical applications. An example using Ni-oxide electrodes is given to illustrate the methodology.									37	1	0	0	3	0	37			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000387886500018

Based on the high cost and limited supply of iridium, approaches that result in iridium-based OER catalysts with increased catalytic activity are of significant interest. We report a carbon-free, self-supported hydrous iridium nickel oxide two-dimensional nanoframe structure synthesized by thermal treatment of iridium-decorated nickel oxide nanosheets under reducing conditions and subsequent chemical leaching in acid. The catalyst nanoarchitecture contains an interconnected network of metallic iridium nickel alloy domains with hydrous iridium oxide and nickel oxide located in the surface region. The electrochemical oxidation step maintains the three-dimensional nanoarchitecture and results in a thin (similar to 5 angstrom) oxide/hydroxide surface layer. The temperature used for thermal reduction was found to strongly affect the catalyst surface structure and OER activity. Using a lower thermal reduction temperature of 200 degrees C was determined to provide a higher relative surface concentration of hydroxides and nickel oxide and result in higher OER activities compared with materials treated at 300 degrees C. The 200 degrees C-treated hydrous iridium nickel oxide electrocatalyst showed 15 times higher initial OER mass activity than commercial IrO2, and the activity remained 10 times higher than IrO, after accelerated durability testing. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and analysis of the experimental Tafel slopes support that the second electron transfer step is the rate-limiting step for the reaction. The DFT calculations demonstrate that Ni substitution on the IrO, surface lowers the activation energy for adsorbed intermediates of the second electron transfer step of the OER reaction. This work establishes that noble metal-decorated metal oxide nanosheets can be transformed into high surface area, carbon-free electrocatalyst nanostructures with high catalytic activities and molecular accessibility and reveals the importance of using controlled thermal reduction temperatures to alter the surface structure and OER activity.									69	0	0	0	3	0	69			2155-5435			WOS:000449723900064

Two conventional gelators, colloidal and fumed silica, are investigated. A novel gel electrolyte is prepared by mixing the gelators with sulphuric acid. The physical property testing demonstrates that the mixed gel electrolyte is more mobile, has a longer gelling time, greater stability and a better crosslinking structure than its counterparts as compared with any single gelling agent. The electrochemical properties indicate that the mixed gel electrolyte can suppress the oxygen evolution reaction, reduce the resistance to charge transfer at open circuit potential, increase the initial capacity, demonstrating that it is a promising gel electrolyte for lead acid batteries.

However, the current transition-metal electrocatalysts still suffer from low activity and durability on account of poor interfacial reaction kinetics. In this work, a facile solid-state synthesis strategy is developed to construct transition-metal sulfides heterostructures (denoted as MS2/NiS2, M = Mo or W) for boosting OER electrocatalysis. As a result, MoS2/NiS2 and WS2/NiS2 show lower overpotentials of 300 mV and 320 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), and smaller Tafel slopes of 60 mV.dec(-1) and 83 mV-dec(-1) in 1 mol.L-1 KOH, respectively, in comparison with the single MoS2, WS2, NiS2, as well as even the benchmark RuO2. The experiments reveal that the designed heterostructures have strong electronic interactions and spontaneously develop a built-in electric field at the heterointerface with uneven charge distribution based on the difference of band structures, which promote interfacial charge transfer, improve absorptivity of OH , and modulate the energy level more comparable to the OER. Thus, the designed transition-metal sulfides heterostructures exhibit a remarkably high electrocatalytic activity for OER. This study provides a simple strategy to manipulate the heterostructure interface via an energy level engineering method for OER and can be extended to fabricate other heterostructures for various energy-related applications.

In this electrocatalyst, nanoparticles of the cluster based coordination compound disperse homogeneously on mesoporous carbon matrix doped by nitrogen atoms. The size of the nanoparticles ranges from 6 to 8 nm. Surface area of the electrocatalyst is 296.4 m(2).g(-1). In 1.0 M KOH, this electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). To achieve current of 10 mA.cm(-2), the overpotential is only 60 mV and Tafel slope 63 mV.dec(-1). This electrocatalyst also shows outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Under the same condition, to obtain a current of 10 mA.cm(-2), its overpotential is only 298 mV. The electrocatalyst possesses excellent durability; after 2000 cycles as well as 10 h long-term HER and OER tests, the current remains stable. To achieve overall water splitting, an electrolyzer is constructed with this bifunctional electrocatalyst as both cathode and anode at the same time. With 1.55 V of voltage, this electrocatalyst can obtain a current of 10 mA.cm(-2). The electrolyzer possesses excellent stability, which remains constant for 48 h in overall water splitting. We expect this bifunctional electrocatalyst can act as a new material for H-2 production.									18	1	0	0	1	0	19			2168-0485			WOS:000441475500082

Bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts with low cost are urgently needed to realize practical application. Herein, metal-free porous S and N co-doped carbon nanosheets (SNCs) were prepared through facile two-step thermal treatment. Owing to the synergistic effect of S and N, superior bifunctional electrocatalytic activity toward both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions was achieved, much better than that of singly doped carbon nanosheets. Computations further confirm that the introduction of S into N-doped carbon nanosheets can effectively increase their OER catalytic activity and even the overall catalytic performance. Additionally, Zn-air batteries fabricated with SNCs showed high power density and excellent rechargeability, outperforming most reported metal-free and even metal-based electrocatalysts, and fully demonstrating good prospects for practical application.									62	4	0	0	4	0	63			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000519704200019

The formation can be divided into three stages. The first is before 15% charge amount. At this stage, the conductivity of the positive paste is dominant. At the second stage, from about 15 to 62% charge, the formation rate depends on both the electrochemical reactions and ohmic polarization. At the final stage, the electrochemical reactions are a rate-limiting step. At the beginning of the formation, the distributions of the potential, current and polarization resistance are uneven, depending on the evolution of the conductive PbO2 zones. In comparison with the tubular positive plate, the distributions of potential and current are more uniform in the formation of the flat positive plate and the polarization is much smaller. The violent oxygen bubble evolution at the beginning will result in high contact resistance of local active mass. (C) 2005 The Electrochemical Society.

In the first hydrothermal step, flower-like arranged HNRs have been synthesized, and in the second hydrothermal step, the pure phase of NiMnO3 as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) co-catalyst is decorated on the HNRs surface. NiMnO3-HNRs photoanode has been characterized by scanning electron microscopy, highresolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The interlinked dynamic concurrence of different valence states of Ni and Mn in NiMnO3, caused by the incorporation of Ni in the Mn-O based catalyst, facilitates the photogenerated charge-carriers transfer in HNRs surface. It is the reason why NiMnO3-HNRs shows higher photocurrent density as compared to MnO2-HNRs and HNRs. The NiMnO3-HNRs photoanode presented an enhanced photocurrent density of 2.96 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE applied potential, which is superior photocurrent density to MnO2-HNRs (0.76 mA cm(-2)), and pristine HNRs photoanode (0.16 mA cm(-2)). Furthermore, the NiMnO3-HNRs photoanode is stable in alkaline medium and shows only a similar to 3 % reduction in the photocurrent value in 8 h. A significant cathodic shift in onset potential corresponding to OER photocurrent, from 1.03 V vs. RHE to 0.66 V vs. RHE, is observed due to the combined effect of enhanced OER activity and efficient electron-hole separation on NiMnO3-HNRs surface. NiMnO3 co-catalyst suppresses the photogenerated charge-carriers recombination on HNRs surface, intrinsically maintains good interfacial contact, and significantly decreases photoanode-electrolyte interface charge-transfer resistance.									10	1	0	0	1	0	10				2352-4928		WOS:000691739200005

Herein, we report a one-step solvothermal method employed for the fabrication of nickel selenide hybrids (NiSe-Ni3Se2) and a series of nickel selenide hybrid/multiwalled carbon nanotube composites (NiSe-Ni3Se2/MWCNT) as electrocatalysts for the OER in alkaline media. The catalytic activities of these electrocatalysts were investigated via several electrochemical characterization techniques, such as linear sweep voltammetry, chronoamperometric studies at constant potential, electrochemical surface area determination, and Tafel slope calculation, under alkaline conditions. Morphological observations demonstrated the agglomeration of non-uniform NiSe-Ni3Se2 microspheres around carbon nanotubes (CNTs), demonstrating the successful synthesis of NiSe-Ni3Se2/MWCNT nanocomposites. Among the tested electrocatalysts, the 20% NiSe-Ni3Se2/MWCNT nanocomposite demonstrated the highest activity, exhibiting an overpotential of 325 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) in 0.1 mol.dm(-3) KOH solution. The NiSe-Ni3Se2/MWCNT nanocomposites showed improved activity toward the OER compared to bare NiSe-Ni3Se2 hybrids and MWCNTs, exhibiting an overpotential of 528, 392, and 434 mV for 10%, 30%, and 50% NiSe-Ni3Se2/MWCNT nanocomposites, respectively. These results compare favorably to the overpotential of noble electrocatalysts, such as RuO2 and IrO2. Our results imply that the addition of MWCNTs increased the activity of NiSe-Ni3Se2 hybrids due to an increased number of catalytic sites, dispersion of NiSe-Ni3Se2 hybrid nanoparticles, and electronic conductivity of the nanocomposites. These nanocomposites also demonstrated better long-term stability compared to NiSe-Ni3Se2 hybrids and MWCNTs. Hence, NiSe-Ni3Se2/MWCNT nanocomposites possess the potential as effective electrocatalysts for the OER in alkaline media.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000508387800004

Density functional theory calculation and electrochemical measurements reveal that the electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity are closely associated with the Co2P/CoP mixed phase behaviors upon Cu metal doping. This relationship is found to be the decisive factor for enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Moreover, the precise control of Cu content in Co-host lattice effectively alters the Gibbs free energy for H* adsorption, which is favorable for facilitating reaction kinetics. Impressively, an optimized performance has been achieved with mild Cu doping in Cu0.3Co2.7P/nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) which exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 0.19 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and satisfying stability for OER. Cu0.3Co2.7P/NC also shows excellent HER activity, affording a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 0.22 V. In addition, a homemade electrolyzer with Cu0.3Co2.7P/NC paired electrodes shows 60% larger current density than Pt/RuO2 couple at 1.74 V, along with negligible catalytic deactivation after 50 h operation. The manipulation of electronic structure by controlled incorporation of second metal sheds light on understanding and synthesizing bimetallic transition metal phosphides for electrolysis-based energy conversion.									303	12	0	0	15	0	304			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000393580900017

In this work, we firstly report a class of COF based S-scheme heterojunction hybrids with oxygen vacancy (OVs) for efficient visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution. The black TiO2 (TiO2-x) was chosen to integrate with TpPa-1-COF to facilitate the efficient separation of photogenerated charges and enhance photo catalytic activity. The existence of oxygen defect was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Free radical trapping experiments confirmed the successful integration of COF based S-scheme heterojunction hybrids with oxygen defect. The results of H-2 evolution experiments verify that H-2 evolution rate of TiO2-x/TpPa-1-COF (6:4) reaches an optimum of 15.33 mmol & BULL;h-1 & BULL;g- 1 (with the TOF of 235.74 h-1), which is about 8 and 10.5 times that of pure TpPa-1-COF and TiO2,-xrespectively. Moreover, it was demonstrated that TiO2-x/TpPa-1-COF also exhibited apparent higher H2 evolution activity (3.5 times) than that of TiO2/TpPa-1-COF (6:4) without oxygen defect in TiO2. Further investigations about photoelectric properties verify that S-scheme heterojunction with oxygen defect can better promote separation of photogenerated charges from COF in comparison with defect-less TiO2.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000810320000001

Unfortunately, 2D COFs capable of visiblelight-driven photocatalytic overall water splitting are rare, partly due to rigorous requirements to their band alignments and coexistence of catalytic sites for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, 12 2D nitrogen-linked COFs are designed based on first-principles calculations and topological assembly of molecular segments with catalytic activities toward either HER or OER, respectively. The electronic band structures calculated with HSE06 method indicate that 2D COFs are semiconductors with a widely tunable bandgap ranging from 1.92 to 3.23 eV. The positions of both conduction and valence band edges of nine 2D COFs match well with the chemical reaction potential of H-2/H+ and O-2/H2O, which are capable of photocatalytic overall water splitting. Of particular importance is that three of them based on 2,4,6-tris(4-methylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (TST) can split water into hydrogen and oxygen under visible light. Our results agree with respect to the literature, with three of them having been studied for photocatalytic HER or CO2 reduction. In addition, we further experimentally demonstrate that I-TST presents both HER and OER activity under visible light. Our findings present a route to design practical 2D COFs as metal-free and single-material photocatalysts for overall water splitting under visible light.									111	10	0	0	6	0	111			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000518700800049	32043354

Many methods for the preparation of 2D materials have been explored. It is crucial to develop a high-yield, rapid, and low-temperature method to synthesize 2D materials. A general, fast (5 min), and low-temperature (approximate to 100 degrees C) salt (CoCl2 center dot 6H(2)O)-templated method is proposed to prepare series of 2D metal oxides/oxychlorides/hydroxides in large scale, such as MoO3, SnO2, SiO2, BiOCl, Sb4O5Cl2, Zn2Co3(OH)(10) 2H(2)O, and ZnCo2O4. The as-synthesized 2D materials possess an ultrathin feature (2-7 nm) and large aspect ratios. Additionally, these 2D metal oxides/oxychlorides/hydroxides exhibit good electrochemical properties in energy storage (lithium/sodium-ion batteries) and electrocatalysis (hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction).									14	1	0	0	2	0	14			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000495643600018	31556236

The qualitative picture of both metals' dissolution is pH-independent. Oxidation/reduction of the metal's surface leads to the transient dissolution peaks which we label A(1) and C-1 on the dissolution profiles. Commencement of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) results in the additional dissolution peak A(2). Quantitatively, there are important differences. The amount of gold transiently dissolved in alkaline medium is more than an order of magnitude higher in comparison to that in acidic medium. Oppositely, steady-state gold dissolution in base in the potential region of OER is hindered. The transient dissolution of platinum is by a factor of two higher in base. It is suggested that variation of the pH does not change the mechanism of the OER on platinum. Consequently, the dissolution rate of platinum is equal in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. As an explanation of the observed difference in gold dissolution, a difference in the thickness of compact oxide formed in acid and base is suggested. Growth of a thicker compact oxide in the alkaline medium explains the increased transient and the decreased steady-state dissolution of gold. (C) The Author(s) 2014. Published by ECS.

Herein, composite catalysts of N-doped carbon wrapping Cox P hollow spheres have been successfully prepared by pyrolysis of precursors from self-assembly of cobalt salt, terephthalic acid and PVP followed by carbonization and phosphatization in the presence of sodium hypophosphite. The resulted composites showed high specific surface areas, pore volumes and nitrogen contents, especially more than 47% of pyridinic-N. The electrocatalytic activity tests showed that the optimized CoxP-NC-420 sample exhibited superior multifunctional performances and high stabilities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under alkaline conditions. A low overpotential of 125/273 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope of 66/81 mV dec(-1) was obtained for HER and OER, respectively. As for ORR, as high as 0.860 V of half-wave potential was obtained, which is even 36 mV higher than that of Pt/C (20%). The catalyst also exhibited high practical performances on water electrolysis and Zn -air battery. Only 1.61 V of cell voltage was needed to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for water electrolysis, and 1.374 V of open-circuit potential and 52 mW cm(-2) of power density were obtained for Zn -air battery, which was 16 mW cm(-2) higher than that of Pt/C (20%). Moreover, a highly effcient self-driven water electrolyzer has been designed with CoxP-NC-420 as both anode and cathode catalyst, powered by two-series-connected CoxP-NC-420-based Zn-air batteries. This work provides a new strategy for fabrication of non-precious multifunctional electrocatalysts. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report the synthesis of Co-MOF crystals with controllable morphologies, sizes and S/N ratios in water/NaOH and ethylene glycol/NaOH systems using thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylate (Tdc) and 4,4'-bipyridine (Bpy) as S, N dual organic ligands by a "pillar-layer" assembly method. Water and ethylene glycol with different viscosities result in various crystallization processes of [Co(Tdc)(Bpy)](n) crystals in the corresponding reaction system, thus respectively obtaining three-dimensional (3D) Co-MOF ([Co(Tdc)(Bpy)](n)) bulk and cuboid structures in water/NaOH and ethylene glycol/NaOH reaction systems. The as-prepared Co-MOF crystals in two different reaction systems were further pyrolytically treated at 800 degrees C in a N-2 atmosphere to obtain Co9S8@S,N-doped carbon materials with different surface areas, pore distributions and S/N doping ratios. As electrocatalysts, the Co9S8@S,N-doped carbon cuboid (Co9S8@SNCC) obtained in the ethylene glycol/NaOH system demonstrates superior bifunctional electrocatalytic activities toward both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions resulting from Co9S8 and S, N doping in the carbon structure providing catalytic active sites, better than that of Co9S8@S,N-doped carbon bulk (Co9S8@SNCB) obtained in the water/NaOH system and comparable to commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. Owing to its high surface area and porous structure, Co9S8@SNCC also exhibits great potential as the electrode material for application in supercapacitors, with high performance and recycling stability.									89	2	0	0	2	0	90			2052-1553			WOS:000398182200011

Herein, self-supported NiFe-MOF nanoplates grown on Ni foam (NF) were prepared with iron carbonate hydroxide nanosheets (FeCH NSs) as a semisacrificial template and evaluated for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this approach, the porous FeCH NSs not only serve as the iron source of NiFe-MOF, but also slow down the leaching of Ni ions from the substrate, thus playing a unique role in regulating the morphology of NiFe-MOF with reduced thickness and sizes, enabling rapid electron transfer and mass transport. The resultant NiFe-MOF/FeCH-NF electrode showed higher activity than FeCH template-free electrodes and superior OER performance over other MOF based binder-free OER electrodes. A current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was obtained at a low overpotential of 200 mV with excellent durability in alkaline solution. Raman and TEM measurements reveal the partial transformation of NiFe-MOF to hydroxide during water oxidation.									28	1	0	0	1	0	28			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000501305100011	31755486

The phosphate-ion-modified NiFe2O4 (PNiFe2O4) nanosheets are readily grown on a carbon cloth by a simple hydrothermal method and followed by a phosphating process. The introduction of phosphate ions on the NiFe2O4 surface is highly beneficial for increasing the charge transport rate and electrocatalytic active sites. As a result, the as-prepared P-NiFe2O4 nanosheets show outstanding electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with a low overpotential (231 mV at 10 mA/cm(2)) and Tafel slope (49 mV/dec). Furthermore, the P-NiFe2O4 electrode has a remarkable stability with no activity fading after 50 h. In addition, the as-fabricated water electrocatalysts exhibit excellent flexibility at the foldable state. These features make the phosphate-ion-functionalized NiFe2O4 electrodes open a new way to develop OER electrocatalysts with high electrochemical property.									40	1	0	0	5	0	41			2470-1343			WOS:000460237300111	31459564

This process does not elevate the temperature of the substrate and thus conformal films can be coated on a range of substrates, including rigid glass and flexible plastic. The formation of the oxide films were confirmed by a combination of powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy techniques. Amorphous oxide films of iron, nickel and a combination of iron and nickel demonstrated oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalytic activities commensurate with films of the same compositions prepared by widely used electrodeposition and sputtering methods. These results illuminate a potential route to amorphous oxides at scale using simple metal precursors without vacuum or heat.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000418783600011	29215268

The preparation of Prussian blue (PB) Au nano composites for the enhancement in the electrocatalytic properties of PB on glassy carbon electrode has been reported by us. The incorporation of Au nano particles in Cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF) films on Glassy carbon by co-electrodeposition is expected to benefit its interfacial electron transfer properties. The present work describes the effect on the interfacial properties by incorporated Au particles in CoHCF (CoHCF(Au)) modified electrodes. The CoHCF(Au) modified electrodes were characterized by UV-Vis spectrophotometry, Cyclic Voltammetry, AC Impedance, FE-SEM etc., Influence on the electrocatalytic properties of CoHCF(Au) films have been explored by performing two important reactions i) Hydrazine elecrtro-oxidation ii) Oxygen evolution reaction. Our results reveal that CoHCF(Au) modified GC electrode perform better in terms of charge transport in the redox film and also for the electrooxidation of hydrazine in comparision with simple CoHCF modified electrodes. By using the current-transient technique (chrono method i vs t curve) the hydrazine diffusion coefficient (D-0) were calculated. Diffusion coefficient of hydrazine was approximately three times higher on CoHCF(Au) electrode, 9.5 x 10(-5) cm(2) s(-1) compared with simple CoHCF modified electrode, 3.3 x 10(-5) cm(2) s(-1). Similarly, we also discuss results which reveal that CoHCF(Au) electrodes enhances electrocatalytic activity in splitting water to oxygen in 0.1 M NaOH solution compared to simple CoHCF and Au deposited on GC electrodes.

Herein, a topology-guided bottom-up synthesis of a novel hexagonal 2D MOF nanoplate is realized. The hexagonal channels constructed via the distorted (3,4)-connected Ni-2(BDC)(2)(DABCO) (BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, DABCO = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) framework serve as the template for the specifically designed morphology. Under the inhibition and modulation of pyridine through a substitution-suppression process, the morphology can be modified from hexagonal nanorods to nanodisks and to nanoplates with controllable thickness tuned by the dosage of pyridine. Subsequent pyrolysis treatment converts the nanoplates into a N-doped Ni@carbon electrocatalyst, which exhibits a small overpotential as low as 307 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the oxygen evolution reaction.									91	7	0	0	8	0	92			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000529156100014	32248690

The electrodeposited alpha-Ni(OH)(2) is firstly transformed to gamma-NiOOH as an active phase in OER. In the reducible potential region, however, gamma-NiOOH was partially reduced to beta-Ni(OH)(2), isolating the rest, which is the first stage of degradation. In the following anodic potential region, beta-Ni(OH)(2) is readily converted to beta-NiOOH, which is mostly reversible, but only a small portion of beta-NiOOH is overcharged to unstable gamma-NiOOH, being responsible for the second stage degradation. It was noted that Ni(OH)(2) catalysts electrodeposited on a low-density carbon paper (Ni-LC) underwent a severe degradation in the first stage, losing at least 56.9 % current density at 0.65 V (vs Hg/ HgO), followed by a steady degradation in the second stage, while the use of a high-density carbon substrate (Ni-HC) effectively improved redox stability, maintaining a minimal loss of overpotential less than 5%, particularly with the second stage degradation being negligible even under potential changes, providing an important insight into designing durable and active Ni-LDH catalysts for the OER.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000623588500004		
J	Hosseini, Mir Ghasem; Hosseini, Mir Majid; Ahadzade, Iraj								The use of silica in IrO2-based DSA type electrode: An efficient approach to construct cost-effective, potent electrodes for oxygen evolution reaction								MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS				285						126086	10.1016/j.matchemphys.2022.126086				JUN 1 2022	2022	Two types of coating, coatings, i.e. IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti and IrO2-Ta2O5-SiO2/Ti were fabricated by the sol-gel method to investigate the effect of silica on the electrode characteristics. The characterization of the coatings was performed by the scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping (EDS), and Xray diffraction (XRD). The analysis of surface morphology indicated that the presence of SiO2 in the coatings decreased the size of cracks, where the minimum crack size was observed for the coating containing 35% of SiO2. The catalytic activities of the prepared electrodes to conduct the oxygen evolution reaction were evaluated in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution by electrochemical measurements including cycling voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electrodes constructed were named hereafter as IT-0, ITS-35, and ITS-55 with the compositions of IrO2 (70%)-Ta2O5 (30%)/Ti, IrO2 (35%)-Ta2O5 (30%)-SiO2 (35%)/Ti and IrO2 (15%)-Ta2O5 (30%)-SiO2 (55%)/Ti, respectively. The accelerated lifetimes measured for the IT-0, ITS-35, and ITS-55 electrodes were obtained as 210, 230, and 173 h, respectively. Such a result was remarkable from the point of view that the optimization of SiO2 quantity in the coating composition not only decreased the content of IrO2 but also improved the stability of the electrode. Furthermore, the resulted electrode (ITS-35) exhibited no significant reduction in its catalytic activity when compared to the electrode with a higher amount of IrO2 (IT-0). Due to the high service lifetime of prepared electrodes, these electrodes are good candidates for OER processes such as electrowinning.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000793620400003

In this work, we present a novel, scalable and efficient method for the fabrication of high surface area iridium-based electrocatalysts. Using alternating sputtering of iridium and cobalt, followed by selective leaching, we produce a self-supported and highly active OER electrocatalysts for acidic environments. Nanostructured IrOx-networks present a bulk-like behaviour, with a site-specific activity similar to that of extended polycrystalline IrOx surfaces. Moreover, in terms of mass activity, the IrOx-networks are among the most active Ir-based catalysts reported, presenting a mass activity enhancement by a factor of eight over commercial Ir-black nanoparticles. These novel self-supported Ir-based networks are very stable, which, combined with their enhanced mass activity, makes them promising anode catalysts for PEM electrolyzers.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000508855700009

However, the electrochemical splitting of water for large-scale hydrogen generation is still impeded by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. Considering the synergistic effect of Co and Fe on the improvement of OER catalytic activity, we prepared Co-Fe hydroxide nanotubes through a facile sacrificial template route. The resultant Co0.8Fe0.2 hydroxide nanotubes exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic performance for OER in 1.0 M KOH, with a small overpotential of about 246 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1). The Co0.8Fe0.2P nanotubes were further prepared by a phosphidation treatment, exhibiting excellent OER catalytic performance with an overpotential as low as 240 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Besides, the Co0.8Fe0.2P nanotubes supported on a Ni foam (Co0.8Fe0.2P/NF) used as both positive and negative poles in a two-electrode system achieved a cell voltage of about 1.67 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibited outstanding stability. A water splitting system was constructed by Co0.8Fe0.2P/NF electrodes connected with a crystalline silicon solar cell, demonstrating the application as an electrocatalyst.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000582345700089	32997942

NiCo2O4 nanostructures with square sheets, hexagonal sheets, and spherical form have been synthesized using a solvothermal route by tuning of reaction conditions as well as selection hydrolyzing agents. The synthesized nanostructures exhibited significant shape dependent electrochemical behavior with improved supercapacitance as well as good electrocatalytic properties toward oxygen evolution reaction. Among all the three morphologies, the square sheets, assembled from nanoparticles similar to 5 nm diameter, exhibited higher specific capacitance with good stability. Due to high surface area (similar to 100 m(2)/g) and the mesoporous nature of the square sheets, NiCo2O4 reveals better pseudocapacitance.									66	1	0	0	2	1	66			1932-7447			WOS:000340222300018

However, as a representative, the tungsten disulfide (WS2) shows an insufficient HER performance and is still needed to be further improved. Herein, we report the synthesis of CeO2-modified WS2 nanosheets with abundant heterostructures on carbon cloth (CeO2/WS2/CC) as an efficient self-supported integral electrode for HER. Experimental results and theoretical calculations imply that the intimate electronic interaction between CeO2 and WS2 promotes the production of more oxygen vacancies in CeO2 to regulate the electronic structure of WS2, endowing extra active sites, high electron transfer efficiency, and downshifted d-band center of W, which can lead to thermoneutral hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energies (Delta G(H*)) and thus boosts HER. The optimized CeO2/WS2/CC electrode displays an improved HER performance with an overpotential of 128 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution, 87 mV smaller than that of the WS2/CC electrode. Meanwhile, it also could maintain a 20 h of stable HER activity. Our work provides an effective approach to achieve various hybrid catalysts of rare earth compounds-transition metal compounds with highly active sites for superior electrocatalysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000742842800004

Therefore, the development of low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts for the OER is of great scientific and technological importance. Although promising iron oxide-based electrocatalysts have been recently developed for the OER, an in-depth experimental and theoretical analysis of the OER mechanism on iron oxide-based electrocatalysts is still needed to provide guidelines to optimize the performance of iron oxide-based electrocatalysts further. To address this need, we synthesized a series of monodisperse iron oxide nanoparticles to analyze their intrinsic OER activities. Using nanoparticles of the same size but different crystallinity, we show that amorphous iron oxide nanoparticles have better OER activity than crystalline ones. The size effect studies further revealed that the edge/defect sites are the active sites for the OER. Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the edge/defect sites provide bridge sites to adsorb OER intermediates, resulting in low OER overpotential. These calculations confirm that the high OER activity of amorphous nanoparticles results from a high concentration of defect sites on their surface. These results provide novel strategies to increase the performance of iron oxide-based and likely other oxide-based OER electrocatalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000635717900001

In this study, we monitored the compositional and surface structural evolution of CaMnO3 under redox conditions at selected temperatures. The redox efficiency and stability of CaMnO3 was found to be temperature dependent. Despite enhanced sintering resistance and phase stability at 600 degrees C, the amount of oxygen release/uptake was low. At 750 degrees C, phase changes were found to diminish the redox efficiency in the long run. In contrast, at higher temperatures (900 degrees C) a stable oxygen uptake/release capacity was observed despite significant sintering and the associated structural and phase changes. The present study indicates that material composition and temperature determine the redox chemistry of CaMnO3 perovskite oxides. Interestingly, no noticeable amount of surface carbon deposition was detected under any stages of operation for this material.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0008-4034	1939-019X		WOS:000471711700018

However, this can be modified by the loading of cocatalysts on the surface of a semiconductor which could form heterojunctions to boost the charge separation and lower the activation potential for O-2 evolution. In this paper we demonstrate that the poor O-2 evolution activity of photocatalytic water splitting of the multiferroics BiFeO3 can be enhanced when a proper cocatalyst like IrO2 nanoparticles are deposited on the surface and proper electron scavenger is used. The choice of the persulfate, S2O8 as electron scavenger is influenced by its high redox potential and its close position to the valence band of BiFeO3 compared to other commonly used scavengers. Another interesting information was revealed by using transient absorption spectroscopy under different environment namely, inert, oxidizing and reducing. The absorption peak of holes was identified and correlated to the strong absorption around 560 nm The hole absorption peak showed a 50% decrease in the absorption intensity after 2.5 mu sec indicating that holes are captured by IrO2 nanoparticles on the surface. O-2 evolution of multiferroics, especially BiFeO3 has been less investigated. Therefore, the development of efficient photocatalytic materials has relied on both photocatalysts and cocatalysts. Identification of the photogenerated charge absorption peak from transient absorption spectra facilitate the evaluation of the IrO2 loading effect on the charge separation and the overall O-2 evolution process.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0927-0248	1879-3398		WOS:000696982200002

Nickel foam (NF) dipped into FeCl3 solution is treated with N-2 plasma, and a composite structure of NiFeN and Ni2Fe2N is obtained with nitride nanoparticles uniformly distributed on the surface of the nickel foam (donated as NiFeNx/NF). The prepared NiFeNx/NF shows a low overpotential of 286 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 330 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), which is lower than RuO2 loaded on NF (0.5 mg cm(-2)). There is no obvious increase in the overpotential after 20 h stability test. The excellent performance of NiFeNx/NF is attributed to the synergistic effect of NiFe bimetallic nitrides.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0167-577X	1873-4979		WOS:000681128800007

Herein, ultrafine Co nanoparticles embedded in the surface layer of nitrogen doped carbon microspheres are prepared through an in-situ co-coordination strategy, and its d-band is modulated by introducing different Ni amounts. The introduction of Ni in the Co crystal lattice can tune the d-band center and unpaired electrons, which collectively result in an enhancement of OER activity and kinetics. By investigating the catalysts with Ni content from 0% to 75%, it is concluded that the catalyst with 25% Ni shows optimal OER activity, lower overpotential (285 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and higher current densities (73.75 mA cm(-2) at 1.63 V). Moreover, the good stability is also demonstrated with the negligible decrease on current densities after 3000 CV cycles or 100 h of continuous test in alkaline media. This concept of modulating the d-band structure by introducing a transition metal with different contents in another transition metal crystal lattice could present an alternative pathway to the development of highly active catalytic materials for OER and beyond.

Ultrathin nanosheets are generally synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, exfoliation, or surfactant-assisted synthesis, which either require special equipment and reaction conditions, or is limited by the low yields and the difficulty in controlling the lateral size and structure of the nanosheets. In addition, achieving a high loading of ultrathin nanosheets on the electrodes without compromising their catalytic activity still remains a challenge. Herein, we report a simple electrodeposition method for preparing Co3O4 and Co(OH)(2) ultrathin nanosheet arrays (UNA) without using templates or surfactants. The obtained arrays exhibit high activity for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, in both alkaline and neutral media. The electrolyzer based on Co3O4 and Co(OH)(2) UNA shows superior activity and stability than that based on IrO2 and Pt/C, which demonstrates the potential of the present electrodeposition method for developing active and stable electrocatalysts for water splitting.									42	4	0	0	2	0	42			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000419002100026

The combustion of single coal pellet in 21 similar to 50% oxygen concentration was observed with IR pyrometry and high-speed cinematography to obtain temperature-time-size histories. Based on the combined mass measurement and gaseous product analysis, a comprehensive understanding of the effects of oxygen concentration on single coal pellet combustion behaviours was developed. Distinctive three-stage processes were proposed with characteristical temperature and cinematography variations. No obvious flame duration was detected in 21% or 30% O-2 while transient but luminous flames were clearly observed in 40% and 50% O-2 and formed notable temperature peaks in the second stage during combustion of all the three ranks coal pellets. Volume and density both changed non-linearly during combustion and such processes were accelerated with the increase of oxygen concentration. High concentrations of CO and CH4 were detected due to the suppression of volumetric reactions. CO accounted for about 9.3% of the gaseous products and consistently exhibited two peaks with the first peak independent from oxygen concentration. Three-stage combustion process was further validated by CO2/CO ratio and the effective reaction orders of oxygen concentration were 1.91 (bituminous coal), 1.81 (sub-bituminous coal) and 1.26 (lignite).									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000520021800014

It acts as a superiorly active and durable electrocatalyst in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from water under alkaline conditions. While electrophoretically deposited Mn3N2 on fluorine tin oxide (FTO) requires an overpotential of 390 mV, the latter is substantially decreased to merely 270 mV on nickel foam (NF) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a durability of weeks. The high performance of this material is due to the rapid transformation of manganese sites at the surface of Mn3N2 into an amorphous active MnOx overlayer under operation conditions intimately connected with metallic Mn3N2, which increases the charge transfer from the active catalyst surface to the electrode substrates and thus outperforms the electrocatalytic activity in comparison to solely MnOx-based OER catalysts.									101	3	0	0	10	0	101			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000419594700013	29205790

However, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) largely impedes the industrial application due to its sluggish four-electron-transition kinetics. Although various materials have been developed to accelerate the OER rate, still some issues should be addressed to meet the industrial demand: (i) considerable 200-300 mV overpotential as extra onset energy input, (ii) limited survival and performance in acidic electrolyte for the majority of oxide/hydroxide composite materials, (iii) unsatisfying long-term durability and (iv) the need for facile and scalable preparation methods. Here, we emphasize on multi-metallic composites with enhanced OER activity based on both precious and nonprecious elements that outperform the unary and binary composites. The regulation effect from multi-metal incorporation is also summarized systematically: (i) introducing foreign metal atoms to the host material boosts the physical properties such as conductivity, surface area, defect density, morphology, wettability, etc., (ii) metal doping can synergistically regulate the electronic features of the host material, e. g. oxygen vacancy, e(g) orbit filling, coordinative number and covalence state, which can optimize the absorption/desorption energy of the M-O intermediate, (iii) chaotic impact from the added atoms twists the catalyst lattice into a more aggressive and higher energy state, which is more feasible to transform to an active intermediate with lower required energy supply. This review aims to provide a practical approach to further improve the OER performance via multi-metallic-based catalysts.									30	3	0	0	2	0	30			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000476457300001	31264336

In this work, uniform porous yolk-shell MnCo2O4 (denoted as YSM-MCO) microrugby balls have been synthesized by simple annealing treatment of metal carbonates with a microrugby ball shape in air. Benefiting from the desired porous structure and composition, the as-synthesized YSM-MCO exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance when investigated as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries and electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. The YSM-MCO demonstrates remarkable lithium storage properties with a good cycling stability (94% capacity retention over 200 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1)) and superior rate capability (414 mA h g(-1) at 5 A g(-1)). In addition, the YSM-MCO also exhibits better OER activity than most of the reported MnCo2O4-based electrocatalysts.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000498690100019	31693037

However, present methods of engineering nano-interfaces remain to be improved. Here, we present a nitrate-pyrolysis method to create a sulfide-oxide interface on Cu2S for the first time. Specifically, a CoOx decorated Cu2S nanowire array on Cu foam (Cu2S-CoOx/CF) is prepared successfully, and the XPS result demonstrates the interfacial connection between Cu2S and CoOx. To afford a current density of 25 mA cm(-2), Cu2S-CoOx/CF needs an overpotential of 255 mV, lower than that of Cu2S/CF (354 mV) and CoOx/CC (378 mV). These results indicate that the introduction of the sulfide-oxide interface is an efficient means to enhance the OER activity of Cu2S. And this paper should provide a novel route for more explorations in interface engineering for TMSs.									11	1	0	0	1	0	12			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000585555100013	33151225

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), possessing abundant active metal sites and tunable porous crystalline structures, are promising as OER catalysts. In this paper, a MOF based on benzotriazole-5-carboxylate (Co-3-btca) that contains unsaturated coordinated metal centers and a 1D channel was selected to act as an OER catalyst. To optimize the OER performance, isostructural bimetallic and trimetallic frameworks were obtained by doping with Fe and/or Ni ions. The optimized Co2.36Fe0.19Ni0.45-btca possesses the lowest overpotential of 292 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 72.6 mV dec(-1). The enhanced catalytic performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect between the unsaturated coordinated Co, Fe and Ni sites, which are beneficial for the nucleophilic attack of OH- forming adsorption intermediates.									19	4	0	0	1	0	19			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000509360800020	31850467

Over a range of potentials and charging depths, V3+ was selectively reduced with >99.8% faradic efficiency. The V2+ species produced in the catholyte was then passed subsequently on demand over a MoCx-based HER catalyst to produce H-2 (g) and regenerate V(3+ )for subsequent reduction. Under a base hydrogen pressure of 1, 10, and 100 atm, the discharge efficiency of the V3+ to hydrogen was 83%, 65.2%, and 59.8%, respectively. In conjunction with a solar tracker and a photovoltaic device, the V3+/ 2+ (aq,H2SO4)IKOH(aq) cell was charged outdoors under sunlight and discharged at night with a daily averaged energy conversion efficiency of 3.7% and a STH conversion efficiency of 5.8% during diurnal solar-to-hydrogen (STH) daylight operation.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			2380-8195			WOS:000464889300024

Optical microscopy was used to record the bubble growth on single-crystal strontium titanate immersed in basic aqueous electrolyte and illuminated with UV light at 351/364 nm from a focused argon laser. By analyzing the bubble size as a function of time, the water-splitting reaction rate was determined for varying light intensities and was compared to photocurrent measurements. Bubble nucleation was explored on an illuminated flat surface, as well as the subsequent light scattering and electrode shielding due to the bubble. This technique allows a quantitative examination of the actual gas evolution rate during photoelectrochemical water splitting, independent of current measurements.

The comparison of the activity between Mn oxides/carbon (Mn/C), iridium oxide/carbon (Ir/C) and platinum/carbon (Pt/C) under the same condition in PEM electrolysers showed that the gamma-MnO2/C exhibited a voltage efficiency for water electrolysis comparable to the case with Pt/C, while lower than the case with the benchmark Ir/C OER catalyst. The rapid decrease in the voltage efficiency was observed for a PEM electrolyser with the Mn/C, as indicated by the voltage shift from 1.7 to 1.9 V under the galvanostatic condition. The rapid deactivation was also observed when Pt/C was used, indicating that the instability of PEM electrolysis with Mn/C is probably due to the oxidative decomposition of carbon supports. The OER activity of the four types of Mn oxides was also evaluated at acidic pH in a three-electrode system. It was found that the OER activity trends of the Mn oxides evaluated in an acidic aqueous electrolyte were distinct from those in PEM electrolysers, demonstrating the importance of the evaluation of OER catalysts in a real device condition for future development of noble-metal-free PEM electrolysers.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2054-5703			WOS:000470127300040	31218053

In this work, a unique NiOOH-decorated a-FeOOH nanosheet array (ASF) has been fabricated, with the help of alkaline oxidative etchant solution (AOES), using sintered 316L stainless steel felt (SF) as substrate, which can be viewed as a "pancake", while the a-FeOOH nanosheet, as well as the other elements uniformly embedded in it, acts as the skeleton. The formation mechanism of the ASF was discussed in detail based on X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and density functional theory calculations. The results indicate that the oriented growth of a-FeOOH was influenced by the surface adsorption for reducing the surface energy of the facet and electrostatic repulsion effect, to form the unexpected nanosheet structure. The 2-dimensional nanosheets could afford large specific surface area, and the active components (including Fe and Ni elements) distributed uniformly on the a-FeOOH nanosheets, enabling the sufficient exposure of electrochemical active sites and facilitating the effective contact between them and the electrolyte. As a consequence, the ASF shows an outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER, the overpotential is only 256 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), with low Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1)) and supercapacitor performance (the specific capacity is 748.13 mF cm(-2) at 1.5 mA cm(-2) (554.17 F g(-1), 1.1 A g(-1)), with good rate capacity and cyclic stability) performances.									29	5	0	0	1	0	31			2168-0485			WOS:000459367400087

However, the effect of alloy composition has not been systematically studied. Herein, using metallic anodes with defined Fe-Ni-Co atomic ratios prepared via arc melting, we report the relationship between the initial alloy composition, the OER performance, and the emergent active catalyst composition. After 50 h operation at 0.5 A cm(-2) the most active initial alloys (having a moderate amount of cobalt <40 at. %, an iron proportion between 30 and 80 at. % and a nickel ratio below 60 at. %) gave average overpotentials for 10 mA cm(-2) ca. 300-320 mV and Tafel slopes of 35-50 mV dec(-1). Iron and nickel-rich alloys performed poorer. The oxyhydroxide OER catalyst formed on the anode surface generally showed an increased concentration of Co and Ni and a depletion of Fe compared to the initial metal composition, giving the most active OER catalyst at a composition of Ni and Co of ca. 40 at. % with Fe at ca. 20 at. %. However, the initial alloy composition of Fe12.5Co12.5Ni75, showed a nearly invariant surface metal composition, indicating this as the most stable composition. Further analysis of the surface identified no correlation of the mass of metals leached from the anode surface, the electrochemically active surface area, or the presence of active Ni2+/3+ redox surface sites to the OER performance suggesting these factors do not influence the results.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200040

Herein, a facilely prepared NiCoFe(OH)(x)/NiOOH/NF electrode affords current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 223 and 254 mV, respectively, and a Tafel slope as low as 33.5 mVdec(-1) in 1 M KOH, which is superior to NiCoFe(OH)(x)/NF electrodes electrodeposited with a traditional method. This electrode also displays surprisingly high durability at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for over 50 hours under alkaline conditions. Component analysis and an electrochemical study revealed that the catalytic activity enhancement of this newly prepared electrode is mainly attributed to the formation of the electrically conductive NiOOH interlayer.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2192-6506			WOS:000440287000005	31950623

Density functional theory (DFT) revealed the characteristic of Ni-Ni bonding interactions within Ni5P4, Ni(5)P(2)and Ni3P were different and could influence their phase stabilities during the OER. Ni(5)P(2)and Ni3P exhibited very robust OER performances at high current density (>350 mA cm(-2)) over 12 h whereas, for Ni5P4, obvious deterioration was observed.In situ/ex situX-ray near-edge structure, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the phase stability of Ni5P4, Ni(5)P(2)and Ni3P behaved differently during the OER. These materials transformed to Ni oxyhydroxide but the process for Ni(5)P(2)and Ni3P was much slower even under high anodic potential 1.6 V (Vvs.RHE). These results supported the theoretical prediction and provide a refreshing viewpoint for designing reliable electrocatalysts for the OER.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000550563800012	32542250

Perhaps the largest hurdle has been gaining experimental insight into the active site of the electrocatalyst used to facilitate this chemistry. Decades of study have clarified that a range of transition-metal oxides have particularly high catalytic activity for the OER. Unfortunately, for virtually all of these materials, metal oxidation and the OER occur at similar potentials. As a result, catalyst surface topography and electronic structure are expected to continuously evolve under reactive conditions. Gaining experimental insight into the OER mechanism on such materials thus requires a tool that allows spatially resolved characterization of the OER activity. In this study, we overcome this formidable experimental challenge using second harmonic microscopy and electrochemical methods to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of OER activity on polycrystalline Au working electrodes. At moderately anodic potentials, we find that the OER activity of the electrode is dominated by <1% of the surface area and that there are two types of active sites. The first is observed at potentials positive of the OER onset and is stable under potential cycling (and thus presumably extends multiple layers into the bulk gold electrode). The second occurs at potentials negative of the OER onset and is removed by potential cycling (suggesting that it involves a structural motif only 1-2 Au layers deep). This type of active site is most easily understood as the catalytically active species (hydrous oxide) in the so-called incipient hydrous oxide/adatom mediator model of electrocatalysis. Combining the ability we demonstrate here to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of OER activity with a systematic program of electrode surface structural modification offers the possibility of creating a generation of OER electrocatalysts with unusually high activity.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900013	32551180

The assembly involves growth of layers of NiO on the surface of few-layer MoO3, which in turn is dispersed on Vulcan carbon (NiO@MoO3/VC) through a sequential hydrothermal process. The hydrothermal process played a key role in establishing the coexisting few-layer assembly of NiO and MoO3 on Vulcan carbon, which involved conversion of preformed MoS2 sheets to MoO3 and concomitant growth of Ni(OH)(2) layer prior to its conversion to NiO during the subsequent heat treatment process. The NiO sheets have exposed edges, and they are instrumental in enhancing the OER activity of NiO@MoO3/VC. The higher activity is also credited to the lower charge transfer resistance (R-CT) value possessed by NiO@MoO3/VC, which arises from the optimum combination of MoO3 and Vulcan carbon in the system. The overpotential of NiO@MoO3/VC for achieving the 10 mA cm(-2) current density is 280 mV, which is an improved value over the 292 mV obtained in the case of the state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst. NiO@MoO3/VC also demonstrates outstanding stability for 15 h in 1 M KOH solution at 1.51 V. The presence of surface nickel molybdate (NiMoO4) prevents the dissolution of MoO3 in the alkaline environment and provides excellent stability to the NiO@MoO3/VC in 1 M KOH solution.									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			2574-0962			WOS:000477074700047

Herein, the potential of a series of single transition metal atoms anchored on nitrogenated holey graphene (TM@C2N, TM = Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Rh, Ru, Pd, Pt, Au, Ag, and W) as catalysts for the HzOR was systematically explored by means of comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) computations. Our results revealed that these TM atoms anchored on a C2N monolayer exhibit high stability due to their strong interactions with the N atoms on the C2N monolayer. Furthermore, on the basis of the computed free energy profiles, Ru@C2N, Mo@C2N, Ti@C2N, Co@C2N, and Fe@C2N were shown to display high HzOR catalytic activity due to their lower (or comparable) limiting potential compared to the well-established Fe-doped CoS(2)nanosheet. In particular, Ru@C2N is identified as the best catalyst with the lowest limiting potential of -0.24 V due to its optimum difference between the adsorption strength of N2H3* and N2H2* species. More interestingly, we found that single Mo and Ti atoms also exhibit excellent catalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction, suggesting their bifunctional activity towards hydrazine splitting for H(2)production. Our findings provide a new avenue to develop an efficient single-atom electrocatalyst for experimental validation to convert hydrazine into hydrogen.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000556485900018	32658242

The reaction was monitored via in situ UV-vis spectroscopy, taking advantage of the color change accompanying the iron oxide colloid formation, allowing measurement of the induction time for nucleation. Features of the synthesis such as the size control and reproducibility are related to the occurrence of the observed delayed nucleation process.

Nandan, Ravi/0000-0001-9244-3594			Maximizing the utilization of Fe-NxC/CNx centres for an air-cathode material and practical demonstration of metal-air batteries								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				5	38			20252	20262		10.1039/c7ta06254k				OCT 14 2017	2017	Noble-metal free carbon-based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) in an alkaline medium have drawn significant attention in the search of suitable/potential replacement of commercial expensive Pt/Ru/Ir-based electrocatalysts. In this regard, nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) have emerged as potential candidates for ORR/OER and they emulate Pt/Ru-based catalysts. However, the unexposed/unused active sites rendered by N-doping, responsible for bamboo-shaped compartment formation, in NCNTs are hardly accessible to the reactant species and thus barely contribute to ORR/OER. To maximize the utilization of the active centres, Fe-Fe3C nanoparticles entrapped in the graphitic layers and hollow structures of NCNTs are fabricated by pyrolyzing melamine with excess of ferrocene. Annealing at 375 degrees C in an oxygen environment removes the protective graphitic layers around Fe-Fe3C, and acid-treatment provides an opening to the bamboo compartments of NCNTs (ANCNTs); this offers maximum accessibility of the active sites via the creation of more edges and roughness that enhances the ORR/OER activity. Interestingly, more positive ORR onset and halfwave potentials with excellent accelerated stability (similar to 98% current retention) and fuel tolerance along with lower onset and E-j=10(OER) potential with high OER current density as compared to those of commercial state-of-the-art electrocatalyst suggest the superior bifunctional behaviour of ANCNTs. The poisoning study with NaSCN on ANCNTs shows the direct involvement of Fe-based centres in oxygen electrochemistry. The overall oxygen electroactivity Delta E = E-j(OER)=10 - E-1/2(ORR) = 0.72 V for ANCNTs is much lower than that of the commercial and recently reported various state-of-the-art bifunctional catalysts. Finally, a prototype battery arrangement using NCNTs as a cathode electrode for powering a light-emitting diode has been demonstrated. Overall, NCNTs can serve as non-precious electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy devices.									38	3	0	0	1	0	38			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000412781700020

In this Letter, we propose a strategy to regulate the magnetic behavior of Fe atoms in hematene by introducing structural defects to enhance its OER activity. Hematene is proved to be thermodynamically stable at electrolyte pH values >= 3 under the OER working potential according to the Pourbaix diagram. Among all the defective structures, the most stable DVFe1-O defect exhibits superior OER activity, which originates from the unique spin state of the active Fe atom. We further propose a novel descriptor of the magnetic moment difference on active Fe to efficiently evaluate the OER activity. We believe that our strategy of combining the defect modulation in the geometric structure and spin-state control in the electronic configuration could provide a guideline to design highly active Fe-based electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1948-7185			WOS:000844697000001	35952374

However, the evolution of the redox potential is difficult to trace from a magma's source at depth to the surface. The key is knowing that electron transfer is the twin face of the acid-base exchanges that drive charge transfer in the many reactions that occur in multiphase and chemically complex systems. The deduced redox reactivity can reveal many features about the evolution of a system's composition and the external factors that control it. As such, redox potential analysis is an important geochemical tool by which to monitor volcanoes and to explore geothermal systems.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1811-5209	1811-5217		WOS:000546728700008

Conventional electrocatalysts based on precious metals are rare and very-expensive for large-scale production of hydrogen, demanding the exploration for low-cost earth abundant alternatives. In this context, extensive works from both theoretical and experimental investigations have shown that two-dimensional (2D) layered materials have gained considerable attention as highly effective electrocatalytic materials for electrical-driven hydrogen production because of their unique layered structure and exciting electrical properties. This review highlights recent advancements on 2D layered materials, including graphene, transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), layered double hydroxides (LDHs), MXene, and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as cost-effective and highly efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen production. In addition, some fundamental aspects of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process and a wide ranging overview on several strategies to design and synthesize 2D layered material as HER electrocatalysts for commercial applications are introduced. Finally, the conclusion and futuristic prospects and challenges of the advancement of 2D layered materials as non-precious HER electrocatalysts are briefly discussed.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2073-4344		WOS:000667452200001

The composite presents suitable morphological and electrical properties to be used as support for water electrooxidation catalysts based on non-noble metals. AAO substrates were decorated with FTO via spray pyrolysis, followed by deposition of catalyst nanoparticles consisting of a cobalt-analogue of Prussian Blue that promotes the oxygen evolution reaction. The electrodes were characterized by X-ray Diffraction, Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy and resistivity measurements. A promising electrocatalytic activity of the optimized AAO/FTO/PB electrode was observed at neutral pH and ambient conditions. The obtained results open a feasible strategy in the search for competitive water oxidation electrodes based on the combination of earth-abundant metal catalysts on FTO-covered anodized alumina supports.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2196-0216			WOS:000477022600020

However, the underlying mechanisms in the reaction between AHNPs and energetic materials are poorly understood. The evolution of AHNPs in 2,2 ',4,4 ',6,6 '-hexanitrodiphenyl ethylene (HNS) was simulated by reactive dynamic based on ReaxFF force field. As a whole, adding AHNPs unexceptionally increases heat release, and the particle size, passivation shell, and contents of AHNPs influence the morphological evolution and hydrogen release performance. AHNPs with smaller size can rapidly release hydrogen under the drastic micro-explosion. In addition, the aggregation mechanism of AHNPs is revealed at the earlier and later stages of the reaction. Al-O, Al-C, and Al-N bonds are generated during the reaction. A large amounts of H of AHNPs and C of HNS cause O to be desorbed from the Al-contained cluster. For the core-shell structure or/and larger size AHNPs, their oxidation process undergoes a transformation of H-2-H2O in the gas cavity. Carbon clusters formed during the reaction depend on the distribution of Al. The addition of AHNPs could promote the graphitization of carbon clusters. This work is expected to deepen insight into the reaction mechanism of AHNPs-containing energetic materials with negative oxygen balance.									3	1	0	0	1	0	4			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000618609900002

To develop economically viable secondary Zn-air batteries, several properties need to be improved: choking of the cathode, catalyzing the oxygen evolution and reduction reactions, limiting dendrite formation and suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Understanding and alleviating HER at the negative electrode in a secondary Zn-air battery is a substantial challenge, for which it is necessary to combine computational and experimental research. Here, we combine differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the fundamental role and stability when cycling in the presence of selected beneficial additives, that is, In and Bi, and Ag as a potentially unfavorable additive. We show that both In and Bi have the desired property for a secondary battery, that is, upon recharging they will remain on the surface, thereby retaining the beneficial effects on Zn dissolution and suppression of HER. This is confirmed by DEMS, where it is observed that In reduces HER and Bi affects the discharge potential beneficially compared to a battery without additives. Using a simple procedure based on adsorption energies calculated with DFT, it is found that Ag suppresses OH adsorption, but, unlike In and Bi, it does not hinder HER. Finally, it is shown that mixing In and Bi is beneficial compared to the additives by themselves as it improves the electrochemical performance and cyclic stability of the secondary Zn-air battery.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000435934200007	29601151

Hence, this study reports that a nickel oxide-nickel hybrid nanoarray on nickel foam (NiO-Ni/NF) could act as a versatile anode for superior water and urea oxidation. Impressively, this anode could attain high current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) at extremely low overpotentials of 292 and 323 mV for OER, respectively. Besides, this electrode also shows excellent activity for urea oxidation with the need for just 0.28 and 0.36 V (vs SCE) to attain 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea, respectively. The enhanced oxidation performance should be due to the synergistic effect of NiO and Ni, improved conductivity, and enlarged active surface area.									35	0	0	0	0	0	35			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000430437400054	29613791

Overall, Ir: Ru had the highest activity toward OER (i.e., current per gram of metal) compared to the other multimetallic combinations studied. This bimetallic supported on anatase TiO2 had a 53% higher current per gram of metal than an unsupported electrocatalyst of the same composition. The higher catalyst utilization of the supported electrocatalysts for OER is consistent with small, well-dispersed nanoparticles, which were observed in high resolution transmission electron microscopy images.

Herein, the composites of Ni3S2/Fe2O3/N-doped carbon on Ni foam (Ni3S2/Fe2O3/NC/NF) were prepared by a facile one-step thermal process and were used as a binder-free electrode for overall water splitting. Specifically, the Ni3S2/Fe2O3/NC/NF-600 electrode exhibits excellent catalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a small overpotential of 188 mV at current density of 52 mA cm(-2) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with overpotential of 78 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2). An overall water splitting device comprised of Ni3S2/Fe2O3/NC/NF-600 electrodes displays low voltages of 1.478 and 1.605 V to drive current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, and can even induce overall water splitting only by a 1.5 V of dry battery. The advantages of the Ni3S2/Fe2O3/NC/NF-600 electrode include strong coupling of the composite with Ni foam skeleton, high electronic conductivity, unique hierarchical structure and abundant heterointerfaces for catalytic active sites, all of them contribute to the superior OER, HER, and overall water splitting performances. Our results can inspire a new method to design and synthesize advanced electrochemical catalysts for overall water splitting.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000564202400008

However, the activity of Fe sites appears strongly dependent on the electrode-substrate material and/or the elemental composition of the matrix in which it is embedded. A fundamental understanding of these interactions that modulate the OER activity of FeOxHy is lacking. We report the use of cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry to assess the substrate-dependent activity of FeOxHy on a number of commonly used electrode substrates, including Au, Pt, Pd, Cu, and C. We also evaluate the OER activity and Tafel behavior of these metallic substrates in 1 M KOH aqueous solution with Fe3+ and other electrolyte impurities. We find that the OER activity of FeOxHy varies by substrate in the order Au>Pd approximate to Pt approximate to Cu>C. The trend may be caused by differences in the adsorption strength of the Fe oxo ion on the substrate, where a stronger adhesion results in more adsorbed Fe at the interface during steady-state OER and possibly a decreased charge-transfer resistance at the FeOxHy-substrate interface. These results suggest that the local atomic and electronic structure of [FeO6] units play an important role in catalysis of the OER as the activity can be tuned substantially by substrate interactions.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000481185700001	31287609

In these hybrid materials the MnOx phase, their morphology and Mn surface valency were guided by the functional molecules, their concentration and the duration of reaction, which in turn significantly affected the ORR activity. During the growth in the presence of TMA, agglomerated nanostructures were formed at 2 h reaction, which transformed to well dispersed 4-7 nm particles at 6 h over a large area of NG. However, in the presence of BA, MnOOH nano-flecks were formed at 2 h and transformed to MnOOH nanowires and oval shaped Mn3O4 particles at 8 h of reaction. The valency of surface Mn on the different MnOx nanostructures was ascertained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The ORR activity of samples were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and rotating disc electrode (RDE) in alkaline medium. Among all the studied samples, the highest ORR activity with most efficient 4e(-) transfer process is observed for TMA modified NG-MnOX obtained at 6 h of reaction, which is due to its well dispersed nanostructure morphology.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2046-2069		WOS:000486203200025	35530452

The observation revealed that the morphology of deposited PbO2 could be controlled by simply changing deposition parameters. Under the condition of oxygen evolution, which dominates the electrode process, uniformly distributed high porous structured PbO2 was formed. The results indicated that large current density or high potential polarization should be one of the most important and necessary factors for forming high surface area PbO2 deposit. Only beta-PbO2 was identified by X-ray diffraction measurement for the deposit prepared by present methods and solution. One potential application of this method is to prepare nanoscaled PbO2 parallel lines. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The behavior of oxygen-related defects, particularly of the VO and the VO2 centers, is mainly studied using samples subjected to heat treatment under hydrostatic pressure. It is observed that (1) pressure accelerates the annealing process of the VO defects and enhances the growth of the VO2 complexes and (2) the VO2 concentration is larger than expected from the corresponding decay of the VO defects. The faster decay of the VO defects is attributed to a pressure-induced decrease of their migration energy. The larger VO2 concentration is also discussed. One possible explanation is that pressure stimulates an additional mechanism for the formation of the VO2 defects, which involves the reaction of oxygen dimers with vacancies.

The micron sized CuScO2 with well-defined hexagonal plate morphology was prepared through a facile hydrothermal method. Moreover, its crystal structure, morphology, surface chemical states, thermal stability, and electrocatalytic performance were studied. The CuScO2 powder exhibits efficient catalytic activity and good long-term stability towards the OER in 1.0 M KOH.

In this work, to investigate the effect of the underlying substrate on the electrocatalytic activity of NiFe hydroxides for the OER, NiFe hydroxides were prepared on various substrates including Au, Cu, C, ITO, and Ti via an electrodeposition technique. The whole preparation process is extremely clean since it avoids the introduction of any surfactants, binders, reducers or capping agents, ensuring the clean surface of NiFe hydroxides and thus allowing a true comparison of the effect of the substrate composition on the electrocatalytic performance of NiFe hydroxides. The surface morphology and chemical element distribution of the electrodes were studied by a scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and the chemical composition was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The NiFe hydroxides electrodeposited on various substrates exhibit similar thin film surface morphologies and are grown horizontally on the surface of the substrate, possessing some small wrinkles approximately vertically aligned to the surface. Among the NiFe hydroxides formed on the various substrates, the NiFe hydroxides on the Au substrate exhibit the most remarkable enhancement in electrocatalytic activity towards the OER, and the current density reaches 149 mA cm(-2) at 0.8 V (vs. saturated calomel electrode). The catalytic current density shows no evident decay after an accelerated durability test of 10000 s. This work provides a systematic study on the influence of the substrate composition on the electrocatalytic activity of electrodeposited NiFe hydroxides and demonstrates new ways to develop high-performance catalysts.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1452-3981			WOS:000467818200012

Herein, a liquid-state transformation process from hexagonal-phase CuS NPs is employed to fabricate the cubic-phase Cu2S NPs. The CuS NPs were converted into Cu2S NPs but maintained the morphology. The Cu2S NPs exhibit better oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity than CuS NPs. Furthermore, the OER activity of Cu2S NPs can be improved by the addition of a glycine (Gly) solution. The Cu2S NPs with Gly in a phosphate buffer solution exhibit excellent OER activity and durability, which approaches that of the best known commercial Ir/C (20%) nanocatalyst. In this Work, a good strategy for fabricating a noble-metal-free OER catalyst has been proposed, which could provide insight into developing new water oxidation catalysts with high activity.									89	2	0	0	3	0	89			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000352518600028	25797063

Among the numerous electrocatalysts, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising due to their high specific surface area, tunable porosity, and diversity of metal centers and functional groups. It is believed that combining MOFs with conductive nanostructures could significantly improve their catalytic activities. In this study, an MXene supported CoNi-ZIF-67 hybrid (CoNi-ZIF-67@Ti3C2Tx) was synthesized through the in-situ growth of bimetallic CoNi-ZIF-67 rhombic dodecahedrons on the Ti3C2Tx matrix via a coprecipitation reaction. It is revealed that the inclusion of the MXene matrix not only produces smaller CoNi-ZIF-67 particles, but also increases the average oxidation of Co/Ni elements, endowing the CoNi-ZIF-67@Ti3C2Tx as an excellent OER electrocatalyst. The effective synergy of the electrochemically active CoNi-ZIF-67 phase and highly conductive MXene support prompts the hybrid to process a superior OER catalytic activity with a low onset potential (275 mV vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) and Tafel slope (65.1 mV.dec(-1)), much better than the IrO2 catalysts and the pure CoNi-ZIF-67. This work may pave a new way for developing efficient non-precious metal catalyst materials.									48	2	0	0	2	0	48				2079-4991		WOS:000479007900117	31137579

While a number of studies have reported different Li2O2 morphologies formed during discharge, the influence of the morphology and structure of Li2O2 on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and pathways is not known. Here, we show that two characteristic Li2O2 morphologies are formed in carbon nanotube (CNT) electrodes in a 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) electrolyte: discs/toroids (50-200 nm) at low rates/overpotentials (10 mA g(C)(-1) or E > 2.7 V vs. Li), or small particles (<20 nm) at higher rates/overpotentials. Upon galvanostatic charging, small particles exhibit a sloping profile with low overpotential (<4 V) while discs exhibit a two-stage process involving an initially sloping region followed by a voltage plateau. Potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT) measurements reveal that charging in the sloping region corresponds to solid solution-like delithiation, whereas the voltage plateau (E = 3.4 V vs. Li) corresponds to two-phase oxidation. The marked differences in charging profiles are attributed to differences in surface structure, as supported by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data showing that oxygen anions on disc surfaces have LiO2-like electronic features while those on the particle surfaces are more bulk Li2O2-like with modified electronic structure compared to commercial Li2O2. Such an integrated structural, chemical, and morphological approach to understanding the OER kinetics provides new insights into the desirable discharge product structure for charging at lower overpotentials.									353	12	0	0	19	1	356			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000321983800025

Here, the potential of a core-shell structure of hydrous NiMoO4 microrods conformally covered by Co3O4 nanoparticles via atomic layer depositions is demonstrated. In situ Raman and synchrotron-based photoemission spectroscopy analysis confirms the leaching out of Mo facilitates the catalyst reconstruction, and it is one of the centers of active sites responsible for higher catalytic activity. Post OER characterization indicates that the leaching of Mo from the crystal structure, induces the surface of the catalyst to become porous and rougher, hence facilitating the penetration of the electrolyte. The presence of Co3O4 improves the onset potential of the hydrated catalyst due to its higher conductivity, confirmed by the shift in the Fermi level of the heterostructure. In particular NiMoO4@Co3O4 shows a record low overpotential of 120 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), sustaining a remarkable performance operating at a constant current density of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2) with negligible decay. Presented outcomes can significantly contribute to the practical use of the water-splitting process, by offering a clear and in-depth understanding of the preparation of a robust and efficient catalyst for water-splitting.									33	0	0	0	3	0	33			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000673277700001

To tackle climate change and provide a cleaner environment for the air we breathe and water we consume, the existing energy mix needs to be changed into fossil-free, clean, renewable energy with zero emission (e.g., fuel cells). While providing a promising and scalable strategy to the energy and environmental challenges, renewable energy processes often involve noble-metal-based catalysts (i.e., Pt, RuO2). However, the disadvantages of noblemetal-based catalysts, including their high cost and scarcity, have hampered the large-scale application of renewable energy technologies. In 2009, we discovered earth-abundant carbon materials functioning as efficient low-cost, carbon-based metal-free electrocatalysts (C-MFECs) attractive for renewable energy and environmental remediation. Since then, C-MFECs have become an emerging new research field over the world. They are demonstrated to be efficient multifunctional catalysts for various key reactions important to renewable energy and environmental technologies, including oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), and N-2 reduction reaction (NRR), to name a few. Charge transfer/redistribution induced by heteroatom (e.g., N) and/or defect doping was recognized as the driving force for the metal-free catalytic activities. This finding has been used as a guidance to design and develop various new and multifunctional C-MFECs for many reactions even beyond the renewable energy and environmental remediation. In this Account, we first summarize our previous work on the development and mechanistic understanding of C-MFECs for ORR, HER, and OER to promote renewable energy conversion and storage. Then, we present recent advances in C-MFECs for new important reactions for environment remediation (e.g., CO2RR, NRR), seawater splitting, and metal-CO2 batteries. However, different dopant locations for C-MFECs even with the same doping element and content can cause variable catalytic properties for heteroatom-doped carbon materials. Therefore, vast opportunities remain for further developing numerous innovative C-MFECs with defined structures to gain a better understanding of their structure-based properties. In this context, we finally conclude with the current challenges and future perspectives in this exciting field.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2643-6728		WOS:000736496600011

Herein, a facile electrodeposit-phosphating-electrodeposit strategy is developed to obtain Mo-doped Co(OH)(2) nanofilms coupled with CoP nanosheets loaded on nickel foam (denoted as MoCo(OH)(2)/CoP/NF). Benefitting from the unique structural merits, MoCo(OH)(2)/CoP/NF exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance both for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The results indicate that the dopant of Mo in the Co(OH)(2) can further improve the electrocatalytic performance. To achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), only 15 and 287 mV are required for HER and OER in 1 M KOH solution, respectively. When MoCo(OH)(2)/CoP/NF simultaneously employed as cathode and anode for overall water splitting, it only requires 1.593 and 1.853 V to achieve 10 and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. The electrocatalytic activity of MoCo(OH)(2)/CoP/NF for overall water splitting even exceed the benchmark electrode couple of Pt/C/NF vertical bar vertical bar RuO2/NF, and MoCo(OH)(2)/CoP/NF perform excellent durability for overall water splitting. This work opens up new avenues for large-scale commercial production of overall water splitting catalysts due to its low-cost and facile method. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In this study, we present the sprout-shaped Mo-doped CoP (denoted CP) as a catalyst for efficient water splitting electrode under alkaline environment. The electrode possesses a unique nanoarray type 'pillar' and microscale 'tip' structure, which promotes high hydrophilicity and effective gas bubble release, hence achieving a future goal of highly efficient water splitting device for practical use. For both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER), the electrode shows remarkable catalytic activity together with reliable stability in alkaline solution, which makes CP a promising electrocatalyst to date. By investigating the gas releasing efficiency regarding various nano/microstructured electrodes, as-prepared CP surpasses the compared samples, indicating maximized nano/microstructures specialized for gas evolution electrode. When the CP performed as an overall water splitting electrode, only 1.49 V of overpotential is needed to achieve the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) and maintained 10 and 200 mA.cm(-2) for over 35 h with little degradation of catalytic activity. This work would give inspiration to many investigators who work on optimizing structures of transition metal-based nano materials, promoting their applications in other renewable energy options.									24	2	0	0	1	0	24			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000613284400007

Owing to the lack of metal sites in pristine COFs constructed only by metal-free organic building units, it generally exhibits extremely low electrocatalytic activity. Thereby, linking metal sites on the backbone of pyrolysis-free COFs but not loading them on the surface to enhance the electrocatalytic activity is highly desirable but still remains a huge challenge. To this end, herein, we report an efficient and general cation-exchange strategy to synthesize Ni/Fe metal-ion-incorporated COFs (NixFe1-x@COF-SO3) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) based on the fundamental structure design of COFs. Impressively, the turnover frequency (TOF) value in Ni0.5Fe0.5@C0E-SO3 reaches 0.14 s(-1) at the overpotential of 300 mV, which outperforms most recently reported OER electrocatalysts, indicative of ultrahigh metal-atom utilization efficiency.									35	3	0	0	1	0	36			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000526414400084	32163270

In an effort to gain insight into the role of Fe in these catalysts, we have performed operando Mossbauer spectroscopic studies of a 3:1 Ni:Fe layered hydroxide and a hydrous Fe oxide electrocatalyst. The catalysts were prepared by a hydrothermal precipitation method that enabled catalyst growth directly on carbon paper electrodes. Fe4+ species were detected in the NiFe hydroxide catalyst during steady-state water oxidation, accounting for up to 21% of the total Fe. In contrast, no Fe's was detected in the Fe oxide catalyst. The observed Fe4+ species are not kinetically competent to serve as the active site in water oxidation; however, their presence has important implications for the role of Fe in NiFe oxide electrocatalysts.									495	21	0	0	44	0	499			0002-7863			WOS:000366339900008	26601790

Co3O4 has been developed as a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst, but it has almost no activity for HER. In a previous study, it has been demonstrated that the formation of oxygen vacancies (V-O) in Co3O4 can significantly enhance the OER activity. However, the stability of V-O needs to be considered, especially under the highly oxidizing conditions of the OER process. It is a big challenge to stabilize the V-O in Co3O4 while reserving the excellent activity. Filling the oxygen vacancies with heteroatoms in the V-O-rich Co3O4 may be a smart strategy to stabilize the V-O by compensating the coordination numbers and obtain an even surprising activity due to the modification of electronic properties by heteroatoms. Herein, we successfully transformed V-O-rich Co3O4 into an HER-OER electrocatalyst by filling the in situ formed V-O in Co3O4 with phosphorus (P-Co3O4) by treating Co3O4 with Ar plasma in the presence of a P precursor. The relatively lower coordination numbers in V-O-Co3O4 than those in pristine Co3O4 were evidenced by X-ray adsorption spectroscopy, indicating that the oxygen vacancies were created after Ar plasma etching. On the other hand, the relatively higher coordination numbers in P-Co3O4 than those in V-O-Co3O4 and nearly same coordination number as that in pristine Co3O4 strongly suggest the efficient filling of P in the vacancies by treatment with Ar plasma in the presence of a P precursor. The Co-O bonds in Co3O4 consist of octahedral Co3+(Oh)-O and tetrahedral Co2+(T-d)-O (Oh, octahedral coordination by six oxygen atoms and T-d, tetrahedral coordination by four oxygen atoms). More Co3+(Oh)-O are broken when oxygen vacancies are formed in V-O-Co3O4, and more electrons enter the octahedral Co 3d orbital than those entering the tetrahedral Co 3d orbital. Then, with the filling of P in the vacancy site, electrons are transferred out of the Co 3d states, and more Co2+(T-d) than Co3+(Oh) are left in P-Co3O4. These results suggest that the favored catalytic ability of P-Co3O4 is dominated by the Co2+(T-d) site. P-Co3O4 shows superior electrocatalytic activities for HER and OER (among the best non-precious metal catalysts). Owing to its superior efficiency, P-Co3O4 can directly catalyze overall water splitting with excellent performance. The theoretical calculations illustrated that the improved electrical conductivity and intermediate binding by P-filling contributed significantly to the enhanced HER and OER activity of Co3O4.									626	37	0	0	19	0	629			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000417255900009

Moreover, as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts, the obtained product presents an overpotential of 270 mV at 20 mA cm-2 and excellent cycle stability.

Under certain conditions, the oxidation causes plastic deformation. An inhomogeneous growth strain formulation is proposed based on evolution equations. Using the inhomogeneous growth strain, a reaction-diffusion-stress coupling elastic-plastic model, which accounts for factors, such as the chemical reaction, kinetics of the oxide scale and diffusion of reactant species, is developed for the analysis of stress and effects of stress on these factors in the oxide scale during high-temperature oxidation. Numerical results reveal large compressive stresses and a significant stress gradient in the oxide scale with the largest compressive stress at the oxide/substrate interface and the lowest compressive stress at the oxygen/oxide interface, which is consistent with experimental observations. The stress developed in the oxide scale has an influence on the oxidation reaction rate and distribution of the reactant species concentration, which in return affects the stress distribution.									29	5	0	0	0	0	30			0030-770X	1573-4889		WOS:000353826700006

Rechargeable Aqueous Lithium-Ion Battery of TiO2/LiMn2O4 with a High Voltage								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				158	12			A1490	A1497		10.1149/2.094112jes				2011	2011	Rechargeable aqueous TiO2/LiMn2O4 lithium-ion battery is fabricated by combining the TiO2 nanotube arrays on metallic titanium foil as anode and LiMn2O4 as cathode in aqueous solution with mixed lithium salts (LiCl and Li2SO4). It is shown from cyclic voltammograms that the lithium insertion/extraction peaks of the cathode are highly symmetrical before the oxygen evolution, which can ensure a good lithium utilization of the LiMn2O4. Importantly, a higher anodic hydrogen evolution overpotential in TiO2 anode is observed, which is essential for the facile lithium insertion in preference to the hydrogen evolution. Meanwhile, the gas (hydrogen and oxygen) evolution in the anodic and cathodic processes can be effectively suppressed in aqueous electrolyte with mixed lithium salts as compared with that in pure LiCl and Li2SO4 solution, respectively. Correspondingly, the fabricated TiO2/LiMn2O4 battery presents a high discharge voltage plateau of above 2 V, which is well beyond the average discharge voltage of current aqueous battery system. Therefore, the combination of the appropriate anode/cathode-active materials with a relatively large potential difference and high gas evolution overpotential is an ideal strategy for developing new aqueous battery system based on reversible lithium insertion/extraction reactions in aqueous electrolyte.

Density functional theory simulations within a simple thermodynamic model of the more difficult half-reaction, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with a single-walled carbon nanotube as a model catalyst, show that the presence of 0.3-1% nitrogen reduces the required OER overpotential significantly compared to the pristine nanotube. We performed an extensive exploration of systems and active sites with various nitrogen functionalities (graphitic, pyridinic, or pyrrolic) obtained by introducing nitrogen and simple lattice defects (atomic substitutions, vacancies, or Stone-Wales rotations). A number of nitrogen functionalities (graphitic, oxidized pyridinic, and Stone-Wales pyrrolic nitrogen systems) yielded similar low overpotentials near the top of the OER volcano predicted by the scaling relation, which was seen to be closely observed by these systems. The OER mechanism considered was the four-step single-site water nucleophilic attack mechanism. In the active systems, the second or third step, the formation of attached oxo or peroxo moieties, was the potential-determining step of the reaction. The nanotube radius and chirality effects were examined by considering OER in the limit of large radius by studying the analogous graphene-based model systems. They exhibited trends similar to those of the nanotube-based systems but often with reduced reactivity due to weaker attachment of the OER intermediate moieties.									50	1	0	0	1	0	51			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000451101400017	30467515

Transition metal-based electrocatalysts have emerged as promising materials that can significantly reduce the hydrogen production costs. Among the available electrocatalysts, transition metal-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have demonstrated outstanding OER performance owing to the abundant active sites and favorable adsorption-desorption energies for OER intermediates. Currently, cobalt doped nickel LDHs (NiCo LDHs) are regarded as the benchmark electrocatalyst for alkaline OER, primarily owing to the physicochemical synergetic effects between Ni and Co. We report effects of heat-treatment of the as-grown NiCo LDH on electrocatalytic activities in a temperature range from 250 to 400 degrees C. Electrocatalytic OER properties were analysed by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The heat-treatment temperature was found to play a crucial role in catalytic activity. The optimum heat-treatment temperature was discussed with respect to their OER performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1225-1429	2234-5078		WOS:000714004900006

One of the reasons for the low OER performance is related to the existence of different types of surface states at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface: recombining surface states (r-SS) and surface states due to intermediate species (i-SS). Since the impact of surface states on OER is still under debate, we investigate how different types of surface states affect PEC water oxidation and how they impact experimental measurements. In a new computational approach, we combine a microkinetic model of the OER on the semiconductor surface with the charge carrier dynamics within the semiconductor. The impact of r-SS and i-SS on the current-voltage curves, hole flux, surface state capacitance, Mott-Schottky plots, and chopped light measurements is systematically investigated. It is found that (a) r-SS results in a capacitance peak below the OER onset potential, while i-SS results in a capacitance peak around the onset potential; (b) r-SS leads to an increase in the OER onset potential and a decrease in the saturation current density; (c) r-SS leads to Fermi-level pinning before the onset potential, while i-SS does not result in Fermi-level pinning; and (d) a smaller capacitance peak of i-SS can be an indication of the lower catalytic performance of the semiconductor surface. Our approach in combination with experimental comparison allows distinguishing the impact of r-SS and i-SS in PEC experiments. We conclude that r-SS reduces the OER performance and i-SS mediates the OER.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500025		
J	Xu, Jie; Zhu, Xiao; Jia, Xilai								From Low- to High-Crystallinity Bimetal-Organic Framework Nanosheet with Highly Exposed Boundaries: An Efficient and Stable Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction								ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING				7	19			16629	16639		10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b03952				OCT 7 2019	2019	One critical problem of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) limiting their applications lies in the inherent instability of the frameworks constructed by the metals ions and organic ligands, which can be destroyed in water or many other solvent environments. It is one of the great disadvantages for the existing MOFs; while here, we first put forward to utilize this property to prepare hierarchically structured two-dimensional (2D) MOFs based on as-developed two-step synthesis including ultrasound-assisted synthesis of 2D MOFs followed with a solvothermal treatment, in which the second-step treatment can remove unstable MOF domains and in situ create continuous mesopores on the 2D MOFs, which generates high crystalline and stable MOFs with abundant boundaries. As exampled with CoFe-MOFs, the as-obtained MOF from the two-step method exhibits hierarchical porosity interpenetrating on the ultrathin crystalline nanosheets (1.3 nm), and more importantly, more active sites were generated, as much of the metal ions transform from M-OOC into M-O/M-OH after the second solvothermal step. By comparison, the MOF made by only ultrasound has no such pores, while the MOF made from direct solvothermal method displays a much larger thickness. The resulting hierarchical 2D CoFe-MOF yields a low overpotential of 277 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2), and Tafel slope of 31 mV.dec(-1) with respect to the MOFs made from only ultrasonic (300 mV, 40 mV dec(-1)) and solvothermal method (310 mV, 57 mV dec(-1)). Apart from the more exposed active sites, the arising of the hierarchical pores can significantly accelerate the charge transport in oxygen evolution reaction based on the mass transport simulation. Additionally, the synthesis method is facile and general, which helps to synthesize a large variety of 2D MOFs desired for hierarchical 2D morphologies and stable structural properties.									33	2	0	0	1	0	33			2168-0485			WOS:000489986400087

These catalysts, ideally based on cheap and earth abundant metals, have to display high activity at low overpotential and good stability and selectivity. While numerous examples of Co, Mn, and Ni catalysts were recently reported for water oxidation, only few examples were reported using copper, despite promising efficiencies. A rationally designed nanostructured copper/copper oxide electrocatalyst for OER is presented. This material derives from conductive copper foam passivated by a copper oxide layer and further nanostructured by electrodeposition of CuO nanoparticles. The generated electrodes are highly efficient for catalyzing selective water oxidation to dioxygen with an overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1M NaOH solution.									156	9	0	0	7	0	161			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000398576000018	28374445

Herein, a facile and scalable strategy is developed to preparein situsupported MoS(2)coupled with CoB with Se doping on carbon cloth (MoS2/CoB-Se/CC)viaa solvothermal process and subsequent selenylation treatment. For the HER, MoS2/CoB-Se/CC delivers the smallest overpotential (93 mV) to reach 10 mA cm(-2)compared to MoS2/CoB/CC (158 mV), MoS2/CC (234 mV), and CoB/CC (410 mV) in 1 M KOH, indicating that the coupling effects of MoS(2)and CoB with Se doping are responsible for boosting the catalytic performance. Impressively, the designed MoS2/CoB-Se/CC also presents outstanding catalytic activity for the OER, with only a small overpotential of 270 mV needed to drive 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the developed MoS2/CoB-Se/CC used as both anode and cathode also shows remarkable catalytic performance for overall water-splitting, with a small cell voltage of 1.58 V needed to drive 10 mA cm(-2). This work provides an efficient and promising protocol to design bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water-splitting.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			2398-4902			WOS:000573449300009

The results of elecirocatalytic tests indicated that the ORR activities of these three Mno(2) microspheres followed a sequence: alpha-MnO2>gamma-MnO2>beta-MnO2. The alpha-MnO2 sample exhibited the best electrocatalytic performance towards ORR with an onset potential of 0.92 V (vs RHE) and a potential of 0.77 V (vs RHE) at -3 mA . cm(-2). The superior ORR activity of urchin-like alpha-MnO2 microspheres was mainly related to the larger amount of Mn3+, more surface oxygen vacancies and better conductivity. Specially, the Mn3+ could promote the dissociation of O-O bond and conduce to one-electron transfer to adsorbed oxygen, thereby accelerating the exchange of O-2(2-)/OH- that regarded as the rate-limiting step of the ORR.									2	2	0	0	0	0	3			1001-4861			WOS:000539207600009

Engineering the interfacial structure of hybrid catalysts often induces synergistically enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Herein, a new strongly coupled heterogeneous catalyst with proper interfacial structures, i.e., CoO nanoclusters decorated on CoFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) nanosheets, is prepared via a simple one-step pulsed laser ablation in liquid method. Thorough spectroscopic characterizations reveal that strong chemical couplings at the hybrid interface trigger charge transfer from Co-II in the oxide to Fe-III in the LDHs through the interfacial Fe-O-Co bond, leading to considerable amounts of high oxidation state Co-III sites present in the hybrid. Interestingly, the CoO/CoFe LDHs exhibit pronounced synergistic effects in electrocatalytic water oxidation, with substantially enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity and stability relative to both components. The hybrid catalyst achieves remarkably low OER overpotential and Tafel slope in alkaline medium, outperforming that of Ru/C and manifesting itself among the most active Co-based OER catalysts.									79	9	0	0	3	0	80			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000430922100027	29577621

In this study, two novel Mn-4-oxido complexes have been synthesized and characterized, in which the peripheral ligands of the [ Mn-4(III)] core are provided by eight mu(2)-carboxylate groups and two neutral terminal ligands (pyridine or isoquinoline). This type of peripheral ligation is very similar to the Mn4Ca-oxide model complexes recently reported to mimic the OEC. The new Mn-4-oxide complex can catalyze the oxygen-evolving reaction in the presence of ButOOH as an oxidant. The structure and redox properties comparison of the Mn-4-oxido and Mn4Ca-oxido complexes provide important clues to understanding the functional role of Ca in the OEC in natural photosynthesis, and develop more efficient artificial catalysts for the water-splitting reaction in the future.

The recently determined PSII 3D structures from cyanobacteria provide a considerable amount of new knowledge about the OE architecture (K.N. Ferreira, T.M. Iverson, K. Maghlaoui, J. Barber, S. Iwata, Architecture of the photosynthetic oxygen-evolving center, Science 303 (2004) 1831-1838; B. Loll, J. Kern, W Saenger, A. Zouni, J. Biesiadka, Towards complete cofactor arrangement in the 3.0 A resolution structure of photosystem II, Nature 438 (2005) 1040-1044). Most of the intrinsic core PSII polypeptides have been well conserved through evolution from ancient cyanobacteria to modem plants, keeping the essence of PSII light driven reactions from prokaryotes to eukaryotes; but what is striking is the large number of changes that have occurred in the oxygen-evolving extrinsic proteins (OEEp) associated to PSII lumenal side. For unknown reasons plant PSII has required the "invention" of three OEEps: PsbP (23 kDa), PsbQ (16 kDa) and PsbR (10 kDa); associated to the ubiquitous OEEp PsbO (33 kDa). This set of proteins seems to be required in plants for the full activity and stability of the OE center in vivo, but their specific function is not clear. In this paper, bioinformatics and functional data show that the OEEps present in plants and green algae are very distinct from their prokaryotic counterparts. Moreover, clear differences are found for PsbQ from higher plants and green algae; and a relationship has been found between PsbR and the Mn cluster. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Density functional theory calculations in combination with experimental study are used to establish a multi-site engineering strategy for developing robust WS2-based hybrid electrocatalyst on mesoporous bimetallic nitride (Ni3FeN) nanoarrays for bifunctional water splitting. This ingenious design endows the catalyst with numerous edge sites chemically bonded with the conductive scaffold, which are favorable for water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption. Benefiting from the synergistic advantages, the N-WS2/Ni3FeN hybrid exhibits exceptional bifunctional properties for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) in base with excellent large-current durability, requiring 84 mV to afford 10 mA cm(-2) for HER, and 240 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) for OER, respectively. Assembling the catalytic materials as both the anode and cathode to construct an electrolyzer, it is actualized very good activities for overall water splitting with only 1.5 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming the IrO2(+)//Pt(-) coupled electrodes and many non-noble bifunctional electrocatalysts thus far.

Among these metal oxides, oxide-based diluted magnetic semiconductors have also been proposed for fuel cell applications, especially for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction.

Herein, an acid-etching strategy is applied to Co, in which the composition and morphology of the resultant materials are tunable. Specifically, a novel two-tiered Co(CO3)(0.5)(OH)center dot 0.11H(2)O nanosheet is formed, part of which decomposes to produce hierarchical Co(CO3)(0.5)(OH)center dot 0.11H(2)O/Co3O4 nanocomposite by tuning the etching condition. The composite shows bifunctional electrocatalytic capability towards the oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER). Moreover, the phosphorous dopant is introduced to boost the catalytic activity, especially in the HER. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the phosphorous dopant can dramatically push the binding energy to the ideal value, thus improving the HER performance. Computed results indicate that partial orbitals of the P atom are above the Fermi level and the P atom enhances the charge density of the neighboring Co atom, which optimizes the H* binding. In addition, an efficient overall water splitting configuration is performed with the integration of the P-doped Co compound catalysts. The acid-etching methodology inspires more novel nanostructured and multicomponent metal compounds for prominent electrocatalysis.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000643138100001		
J	Wen, Linyuan; Li, Mingtao; Shi, Jinwen; Yu, Tao; Liu, Yingzhe; Liu, Maochang; Zhou, Zhaohui; Guo, Liejin								Rational design of covalent heptazine framework photocatalysts with high oxidation ability through reaction-dependent strategy.								Journal of colloid and interface science				630	Pt B			394	402		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.10.121				2022-Oct-28	2022	Due to structural tunability, high surface area, abundant pore structures, and abundant active sites, covalent heptazine frameworks (CHFs) constructed from heptazine and other molecular blocks are especially prominent. Here, we proposed a reaction-dependent strategy for designing two dimensional CHFs including high-throughput precursors screening, structure generation, and performance evaluation. Assuming that oxamide-like precursors can undergo the same thermal polymerization reaction as producing C6N7, seven precursors were screened from more than 109 molecules in the ZINC20 database in terms of molecular weight, number of substructures, shape index, and symmetry. Furthermore, CHF-L1 to CHF-L7 were constructed from urea and the seven precursors according to the topologically assembling scheme in thermal polymerization. The designed CHFs had band gaps ranging from 1.89 to 3.10eV. Among them, CHF-L3 assembled structurally by urea and 1,2,4,5-tetrazine-3,6-dicarboxamide with the smallest bandgap and an oxidative potential bias of 1.38V for oxygen evolution reaction was screened as the candidate with high oxidative ability. The negative formation energy based on the synthesis route indicated the synthetic feasibility of CHF-L3, and negative cohesive energy as well as the stable structure under ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stability of CHF-L3. The present work is expected to provide a powerful design strategy for two-dimensional CHFs design and is broadly applicable to various computational covalent organic framework design systems and experimental studies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1095-7103		MEDLINE:36332432	36332432

Journal of colloid and interface science				630	Pt A			512	524		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.10.031				2022-Oct-17	2022	Electrocatalytic water splitting has become one of the most promising and effective ways to solve energy crises and environmental pollution.In this work, a series of M-doped Co3O4 materials with foreign ions (M=Ce, Ni and Fe) were grown on a Ni foam substrate through classical hydrothermal and calcination methods.It is worth noting that not all doping of foreign ions can promote the electrocatalytic performance of intrinsic materials.The Ce-doped Co3O4 material shows excellent oxidation properties of water (overpotential of 320mV at 50mAcm-2) and urea (potential of 1.39V at 50mAcm-2).However, the doping of Ni reduces the water oxidation performance of the intrinsic material (overpotential of 410mV@ 50mAcm-2), and the doping of Fe reduces the urea oxidation performance of the inherent material (potential of 1.45V@ 50mAcm-2).A series of experimental results indicate that the improved activity of the Ce-Co3O4 electrode is attributed to faster electron transport capacity, higher exposure to active sites, and improved conductivity due to doping of Ce. It is noteworthy that the doping of these ions does alter the rate-determination step for the water oxidation reaction. The stability test demonstrated that the current density of water oxidation and urea oxidation of the catalyst had no significant attenuation after a long electrocatalytic activity test. This work provides a new idea for improving the electrocatalytic activity of catalysts by a doping strategy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1095-7103		MEDLINE:36270172	36270172

Powders were characterized by XRJD, PL, DRS and BET. Using Fe3+ as electron acceptor at pH 2.0 under UV irradiation and visible radiation, the effects of various Nb5+ doping concentration on the photocatalytic oxidation activity of Nb5+ doped rutile TiO2 particles were investigated. The relationships between the DRS, PL spectra with the photaocatalytic activity were also discussed. The results show that with appropriate concentration in 0.5%-3.0%, Nb5+ is doped into rutile TiO2 lattice without causing any change in rutile TiO2 crystal structure. Therefore, surface oxygen vacancies and the donor energy level near the bottom of the conduction band lead to easier separation of photoinduced electrons from holes to achieve stronger photocatalytic activity. The highest photocatalytic oxygen evolution and PL spectra intensity are achieved with the O2 evolution speed of 480 mumol/(L-h) and 78 mumol/(L-h)under UV irradiation and visible radiation respectively when the Nb5+ concentration was 1.0 mol%, which demonstrated certain relationship between photoluminescence performance affected by Nb5+ concentration and the photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic oxidation activity also corresponds to the concentration of Fc3+ as electron acceptor, the best initial concentration of Fe3+ is 8.0 mmol/L.									3	3	0	0	0	0	6			1004-0609			INSPEC:9846217

The experimental results show that the diffusion of oxygen from the oxide to the alloy is the restrictive link of the solid-state reaction between MnO-SiO2-FeO oxide and steel matrix at low heating temperatures. With increasing heating time or temperature, more FeO in the oxide decomposed, and the resulting oxygen diffused into the alloy and reacted with Mn and Si elements. The critical heating temperature at which the interfacial reaction can occur was determined to be 1173 K. And a dynamic model that predicts the change in the width of the particles precipitation zone at low temperatures was also established based on Wagner equation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0334-6455	2191-0324		WOS:000460414600039

Water oxidation is considered as a crucial reaction to attain sustainable energy systems. Inspired by the biological Mn4CaO5 cluster, considerable effort has been devoted to developing highly efficient Mn-based heterogeneous catalysts and exploring intrinsic mechanism for water oxidation. This review begins with describing the structural characteristics of the Mn4CaO5 cluster and the proposed catalytic cycle. Then, the structural characteristics of synthetic Mn-based heterogeneous catalyst are summarized, with emphasis on the understanding of reaction mechanisms and the rate-determining steps. Finally, the strategy of understanding the catalytic mechanism of Mn-based water oxidation is prospected.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0254-5861			WOS:000791003300003

Furthermore, it has been reported to be an excellent catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction, a key step for obtaining energy from water through environmentally friendly processes. In this context, a detailed knowledge of the RuO2-water interface is important for a better understanding of the electrochemical process, the water oxidation reaction and some oxidative reactions involving RuO2. Here, we use periodic boundary condition DFT (PBE-D2) calculations to analyze the influence of the surface morphology and water coverage in the adsorption energies and degree of water deprotonation. We have considered the four nonpolar ((110), (011), (100), and (001)) most relevant surfaces and three degrees of water coverage: isolated molecules, half monolayer and full monolayer. Results indicate that three effects are crucial for determining the adsorption energy and degree of deprotonation: (i) the intrinsic acidity of the unsaturated ruthenium cations and the intrinsic basicity of the O-br. centers; (ii) the presence of strong cooperative effects, already observed in the half monolayer situation of the (110) and (011) surfaces that favors 50% of deprotonation and leads to the formation of the (H3O2)(-) motif; and (iii) an increase of the surface O-br basicity by the adsorption of water molecules on Ru centers bonded to Obr groups, which is more important in the (100) and (001) surfaces.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000463844500028

The durability of materials depends intrinsically on the molecular structure, and degradation mechanism influences the long-term stability of products. The intimate transformations of macromolecules can be reliably characterized by chemiluminescence (CL), which depicts the evolution of oxidation state by the reaction of free radicals with molecular oxygen. The isothermal and nonisothermal CL spectra are complementary proofs for the interpretation of oxidation behavior involving hydroperoxide as the initiators of oxidation. The degradation of PLA takes place by decomposition and fragmentation to lactide. The values of five kinetic parameters (initial CL intensity, CL intensity at the first peak, temperature corresponding to the first peak, oxidation induction time and oxidation rate) obtained for oxidative degradation of PLA lead to the activation energies ranged between 49 and 99 kJ mol(-1). The evolution of thermal degradation for poly(lactic acid) is an excellent example for the explanation of the decay fate of radical intermediates.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000396056500018

Here, graphene-like nitrogen and phosphorus dual-doped porous carbon nanosheets are prepared by calcinating a homogeneous mixture of glucose, melamine and phosphoric acid with montmorillonite as the nanoreactor. The as-prepared N,P dual-doped porous carbon nanosheets show satisfactory ORR catalytic performance in both alkaline and acidic media due to the synergistic effect of N, P dual-doping, abundant micro-/meso-pores and large specific surface area (835.91m(2)g(-1)). Its catalytic activity in 0.1M KOH outperforms the bench-mark Pt/C catalyst with more positive half-wave potential and larger diffusion current density; its catalytic activity in 0.1M HClO4 is comparable to that of Pt/C. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent tolerance towards methanol crossover and long-term stability, showing great promise as an alternative to Pt/C for application in fuel cells and metal-air batteries.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000445176700018

The IrO2/TiO2 catalysts, which has a porous composite nanostructure, are prepared according to molar ratio of Ir and Ti element with a specific surface area of 34.1-55.3 m2 g-1. It is found that crystal structure of TiO2 is more dominated by the rutile phase than by Anatase. For a SPE system, total catalyst loading of anode which made of TiO2 and IrO2 is prepared as low as 0.77 mg cm-2 or less, in which the loading amount of the IrO2 only is set to 0.6 mg cm-2 or less. The anode catalyst layer of about 10 &#x339b; thickness is coated on the membrane (Nafion 212) for the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) by the decal method. The strong adhesion between the catalyst electrode the membrane is observed by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results shows that the nano-composite IrO2/TiO2 catalysts has better oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than that of the synthesis IrO2 only. Finally, the IrO2/TiO2 catalysts is applied as anode electrode for SPE cells and it is observed that in spite of the lower loading amount of the IrO2 less than 0.5 mg cm-2, working voltage of 1.68 V is observed at a current density of 1 A cm-2 and operating temperature of 80 degrees C.

To address this issue, we introduce a methodology combining identical-location transmission electron microscopy (IL-TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical measurements, and apply it to iridium nanoparticles (NPs) covered by a thin oxide layer (IrOx) in OER conditions. The results show that, whatever the initial OER activity of the IrOx nanocatalysts, it gradually declines and reaches similar values after 30 000 potential cycles between 1.20 and 1.60 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). This drop in OER activity was ascribed to the progressive increase of the Ir oxidation state (fast change during electrochemical conditioning, milder change during accelerated stress testing) along with the increased concentrations of hydroxyl groups and water molecules. In contrast, no change in the mean oxidation state, no change in the hydroxyl/water coverage, and constant OER activity were noticed on the benchmark micrometer-sized IrO2 particles. In addition to chemical changes, Ir dissolution/redeposition and IrO(x )nanoparticle migration/agglomeration/detachment were made evident during the conditioning stage and in OER conditions, respectively. By combining the information derived from IL-TEM images and XPS measurements, we show that Ir(III) and Ir(V) are the best performing Ir valencies for the OER. These findings provide insights into the long-term OER activity of IrOx nanocatalysts as well as practical guidelines for the development of more active and more stable PEMWE anodes.									56	1	0	0	1	0	56			2155-5435			WOS:000467335600090

The intrinsically slow OER kinetics can only be mitigated by effective catalysis. The search for low-cost alternatives to the conventional noble metal-based catalysts is a research priority and has thus far been focused mostly on metal oxides. It is the purpose of this review to outline the opportunities and available options besides the noble metals and metal oxides. These unconventional catalysts include transition metal phosphates, borates, chalcogenides, phosphides, nitrides and borides as well as metal-free carbon-based materials. They are all based on earth-abundant elements with some of them showing higher catalytic performance than the common metal oxides in aqueous solution. The review begins with the introduction of the evaluation criteria for OER catalysts. The development and breakthroughs in the unconventional catalysts are then succinctly summarized with discussion of some current scientific issues. We then present our perspectives on these issues and suggest some areas of further work. We hope this review can raise the interest in less common options to broaden the search for practical OER catalysts to beyond the metal oxides.									58	2	0	0	1	0	58			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000434624800002

Herein, a Co-doped NiCu mixed oxide film on Ni foam as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is synthesized by a facile solvothermal method using methanol as a reactant followed by annealing in air and it exhibits remarkably enhanced HER and OER activities. The well-constructed surface and porous skeleton structure with a large volume provide a large number of catalytically active sites during the electrochemical reaction. Notably, CuO plays an important role in improving the catalytic activity of the electrode; meanwhile, Co doping is beneficial for increasing the conductivity and activating the Ni sites at lower overpotentials via the charge transfer effect. Accordingly, the optimized CuO-NiO/Ni foam electrode exhibits a comparatively low overpotential of 38 mV and 172 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Moreover, the electrode shows excellent long-term stability for 1000 cyclic voltammetric cycles in both the HER and OER. A self-assembled overall water splitting device using this electrode as both the anode and cathode achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.51 V. This study is promising and provides a simple method for depositing a multimetal mixed oxide on a metal substrate resulting in an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst, holding great significance for future energy applications.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000514861300008	31967134

Herein, we present unique three-dimensional (3D) ultrathin cobalt telluride nanoflakes (CoTe-NF) as single electrocatalyst with exceptionally high bifunctional activity both for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The hydrothermally synthesized CoTe material exhibits nanoscale and highly porous structural morphology and characterized by various techniques. For OER, the CoTe 3D electrode demonstrates a low onset potential of 1.44 V vs RHE with Tafel slope value of 66 mV dec(-1) indicating a proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism and well-balanced kinetics. On the other hand, the electrocatalyst also executes HER at low onset potential of 0.07 V vs RHE with a modest Tafel slope of 143 mV dec(-1). The materials also showed excellent stability. This work may also reveal valuable insights for developing cog-effective, efficient and low overpotential single electrocatalyst executing overall water splitting using 3D architecture Co-chalcogenide precursors posing a great alternative to noble-metals derived materials.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000562045900003

Despite tremendous effort, the development of low-cost electrode catalysts with high activity remains a great challenge. In this study, we report the, synthesis of CoSe2 and NiSe2, nanocrystals (NCs) as excellent bifunctional catalysts for simultaneous generation of H-2 and O-2 in water-splitting reactions. NiSe2 NCs exhibit superior electrocatalytic efficiency in OER, with a Tafel slope (b) of 38 mV dec(-1) (in 1 M KOH), and HER, with b = 44 mV dec(-1) (in 0.5 M H2SO4). In comparison, CoSe2 NCs are less efficient for OER (b = 50 mV dec(-1)), but more efficient for HER (b = 40 mV dec(-1)). It was found that CoSe2 NCs contained more metallic metal ions than NiSe2, which could be responsible for their improved performance in HER. Robust evidence for surface oxidation suggests that the surface oxide layers are the actual active sites for OER, and that CoSe2 (or NiSe2) under the surface act as good conductive layers. The higher catalytic activity of NiSe2 is attributed to their oxide layers being more active than those of CoSe2. Furthermore, we fabricated a Si-based photoanode by depositing NiSe2 NCs onto an n-type Si nanowire array, which showed efficient photoelectrochemical water oxidation with a low onset potential (0.7 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode) and high durability. The remarkable catalytic activity, low cost, and scalability of NiSe2 make it a promising candidate for practical water-splitting solar cells.									330	11	0	0	9	0	331			1944-8244			WOS:000371453600031	26848805

This in situ carbonization not only promotes the development of a heterointerface with a high content of oxygen vacancies, but also facilitates the formation of N-doped graphitic carbon with high conductivity. Benefiting from its favorable composition and the formed heterostructures, the resulting Ni/NiO/NC exhibits improved activity and durability for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an alkaline electrolyte, which makes it a promising electrode catalyst for hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cells. It is demonstrated that the abundant Ni/NiO interfaces and oxygen vacancies significantly improve the efficiency of hydrogen oxidation, and the large amount of pyridine-N atoms is considered to be the main factor responsible for the enhanced oxygen reduction capability. This work demonstrates the significant effect of heterointerfaces on the electrochemical reactions, thus providing novel inspiration for advanced electrocatalyst design.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2052-1537		WOS:000626507700024

Herein, by means of phosphating CoV-LDH impregnated with Ru (Ru-CoV-LDH/NF), a vanadium (V)-doped flower-like CoP/Ni2P heterostructure coupled with ultralow Ru (RuV-CoNiP/NF) is constructed. The electronic modulation caused by V doping effectively stimulates the activity of the CoP/Ni2P heterostructure assisted by ultrasmall Ru nanoparticles, thus the formed RuV-CoNiP/NF effectively drives the HER (eta(10) = 28 mV) and OER (eta(20) = 214 mV) in alkaline media. Impressively, during the overall water decomposition, it requires only an overpotential of 1.469 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), demonstrating almost the most remarkable catalytic performance compared to the past literature. Notably, the catalyst can still positively promote the electrolysis of alkaline seawater: when achieving 20 mA cm(-2), the required overpotential is only 1.538 V, which is almost the best experimental result at present. This work provides an idea for achieving low-cost high-performance bifunctional catalysts toward hydrogen production from water and seawater splitting.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000721940300001

This research work addresses the above concern by grafting CoSe2 nanorods onto 2D gC(3)N(4) using a simple hydrothermal process. The catalytic activity of the synthesized material has been determined by its ability to degrade bisphenol A-an endocrine disruptor and a carcinogen. The photocatalytic results showed 92.37% bisphenol A degradation within 210 min mediating CoSe2-g-C3N4. The pollutant mineralization was verified by carrying the total organic carbon (TOC). The CoSe2- gC(3)N(4) catalyst exhibited 90.31% pollutant mineralization, whereas it was found to be 41.65% and 35.12% for bare CoSe2 and gC(3)N(4), respectively. The catalyst was characterized using XRD, XPS, DRS and HR-TEM. Further, the catalyst large electrochemical active surface area demonstrates a higher potential of 380 mV at a current density of 50 mA/cm(2) (oxygen evolution reaction, OER) and-210 mV at 50 mA/cm(2) (hydrogen evolution reaction, HER). The remarkable specific capacitance of 153F/g at 0.5 A/g (retention of > 80% after 9000 cycles) is evidence of the multifaceted applications of CoSe2-gC(3)N(4) catalyst for energy storage/harvesting concomitant with water remediation.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000810433200002

The electrode is comprised of three levels of porous structures including the bottom supermacroporous Ni foam (approximate to 500 mu m) substrate, the intermediate layer of vertically aligned macroporous NiCo2O4 nanoflakes (approximate to 500 nm), and the topmost NiFe(oxy)hydroxide mesoporous nanosheets (approximate to 5 nm). This hierarchical architecture is binder-free and beneficial for exposing catalytic active sites, enhancing mass transport and accelerating dissipation of gases generated during water electrolysis. Serving as an anode catalyst, the designed hierarchical electrode displays excellent OER catalytic activity with an overpotential of 340 mV to achieve a high current density of 1200 mA cm(-2). Serving as a cathode catalyst, the catalyst exhibits excellent performance toward HER with a moderate overpotential of 105 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).

An efficient and stable anodic electrocatalyst is extraordinarily important since the harsh acidic environment is corrosive to the metal-based catalyst, especially at high voltage. In this work, we deposited ultrasmall AuIr alloyed nanoparticles (1.7 nm) on carbon nanotubes (AuIr@CNT) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for acidic water splitting. Due to the incorporated Au atoms, the neighboring Ir atom is positively charged, resulting in the electronic delocalization of Ir, which is favorable for reducing the energy barrier of the rate-limiting step (O* -> OOH*) in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER); thus, the overpotential for 10 mA cm(-2)is 257 mV for AuIr@CNT in 0.5 M H(2)SO(4)electrolyte, which is comparatively lower than that of Ir@CNT (279 mV) and commercial IrO2(332 mV). Moreover, the mass activity of AuIr@CNT is 70 orders of magnitude higher than that of benchmark IrO(2)at a potential of 1.6 Vvs.RHE. More importantly, the formed AuIr@CNT electrocatalyst exhibits promising stability compared to commercial IrO(2)and Ir@CNT, which is ascribed to the strong electronic interaction between Au and Ir. Subsequently, AuIr@CNT shows superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic activity, which is 6.3 times better than that of the benchmark Pt/C due to the well-constructed AuIr alloy structure at the atomic level triggering a more moderate hydrogen adsorption-desorption strength. The assembled water splitting device requires only 1.51 V to attain an electrocatalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2)for AuIr@CNT, which is lower than that of the Pt/C-IrO(2)system (1.6 V); in addition, an excellent stability is also recorded.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000575366700042

In this paper, we report the successful synthesis of CuCo2S4 ternary sheet arrays (CuCo2S4 TSAs) via a simple rational one-pot solvothermal procedure. The CuCo2S4 TSA was transformed from CuCo-dihydroxide and uniformly distributed on the microfibre of carbon felt, which effectively enhanced the charge transfer rate. Benefiting from the uniform freestanding sheet structure, the coordination effect of the metal species and the high-conductive carbon skeleton, the ternary composite exhibits excellent OER and HER activity, with the lowest overpotentials of 210 and 69 mV and Tafel slopes of 43.8 and 55.4 mV dec(-1), respectively, outperforming the other ternary composites of FeS2/CoFe2O4 and CuS/CuFeS2, mono-metal sulfides and commercial RuO2 and Pt/C. Besides, the CuCo2S4 TSAs exhibit superior long-term stability relative to noble metal catalysts. Moreover, the excellent overall water-splitting performance was obtained by using CuCo2S4 TSA as a catalyst, providing an effective low-cost and large-scale synthetic strategy for high-efficiency binder-free catalysts in renewable energy conversion.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000511170800021

However, the insufficient number of active sites causes unsatisfactory activity. Herein, we prepare Mn-3(PO4)(2) center dot 3H(2)O nanosheets via simple liquid-phase precipitation with hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant, which conduces to expose more Mn3+ active sites, thereby accelerating the four-electron transfer pathway during oxygen reduction reaction. Accordingly, the optimal catalyst (MnPi-1.0) possesses excellent catalytic performance with a half-wave potential of 0.81 V and a diffusion-limited current density of 5.38 mA cm(-2) in contrast to the 0.73 V and 5.07 mA cm(-2) of the pristine one, respectively. Furthermore, the zinc-air battery based on MnPi-1.0 delivers a high peak power density (132 mW cm(-2)) and outstanding spcific capacity(797 mAh g(Zn)(-1)). This work provides a facile and feasible solution to tune the density of active sites of manganese phosphate-based materials for favorable electrochemical performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2199-692X			WOS:000827778600001

The crystallites of oxides with x <= 1 have the monoclinic crystal structure. The OER study shows that replacement of Fe in the Fe-2(MoO4)(3) matrix by 0.25-1.0 mol Cu increases the apparent electrocatalytic activity. However, 1.5 mol Cu-addition is detrimental to the OER activity. At E = 1.51 V (vs. RHE) in 1 M KOH, the catalytic activity of the oxide with x = 1 was approximately 50 times the activity of the base oxide (i.e. Fe-2(MoO4)(3)). The Tafel slope of oxides with 0.25 <= x <= 1.5 ranged between 31 and 37 mV. The reaction order of OH- concentration was nearly unity for oxides with x = 0.25 and 1.5 and it was similar to 2 for oxides with x = 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0.

Herein, a hierarchical structure of CuO nanowires decorated with nickel hydroxide supported on 3D Cu foam is constructed. Combined theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate the high reactivity and selectivity of CuO and Ni(OH)(2) toward the UOR instead of the oxygen evolution reaction. The hierarchical structure creates a synergistic effect between the two highly active sites, enabling an exceptional UOR activity with a record low potential of 1.334 V (vs the reversible hydrogen electrode) to reach 100 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 14 mV dec(-1) in 1 m KOH and 0.5 m urea electrolyte. Assembling full urea electrolysis driven by this developed UOR electrocatalyst as the anode and a commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst as the cathode provides a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of approximate to 1.36 V with promising operational stability for at least 150 h. This work not only enriches the UOR material family but also significantly advances energy-saving hydrogen production.									8	0	0	0	1	0	7			2366-9608			WOS:000723130500001	35041274

Herein, we systematically investigate the role of transition metal-functionalized N-doped carbon nanosheets (M-N-C, M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, and Ag) as the multifunctional electrocatalyst supports toward hydrogen evolution/oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) in alkaline media. The results demonstrate that all the M-N-C nanosheets, except Cu-N-C and Ag-N-C, can promote the alkaline HER/HOR electrocatalytic activity of Pt by accelerating the sluggish Volmer step, among which Mn plays a more significant role. Analyses reveal that the promotion effect of M-N-C support is closely associated with the electronegativity of the metal dopants and the relative filling degree of their d-orbitals. For one, the metal dopant in M-N-C with smaller electronegativity would provide more electrons to oxygen and hence tune the electronic structure of Pt via the M-O-Pt bonds at the interface. For another, the transition metal in M-N4 moieties with more empty d orbitals would hybridize with O 2p orbitals more strongly that promotes the adsorption of water/hydroxyl species.

This nano-sized trinuclear cluster with a seperated core structure that covalently connected by a central oxygen may show advantages for excellent separation and directional transfer of photogenerated electrons, promising a qualified substitute for noble metal cocatalysts. By combining with polyoxometalate as photocatalyst, the photocatalytic system proved a higher H2 production than with commercial TiO2. In addition, the polyoxometalate accelerated the H2 production efficiency and made the reaction processes observable by the change in solution color. Cyclic experiments for over 40 h proved the stability and regenerability of the cocatalyst. Furthermore, this cluster was 19 times more efficient than equimolar iron salt in H2 evolution. This new attempt of applying multinuclear metal-oxo clusters in photocatalytic H2 evolution may offer novel design strategies and low-cost cocatalyst candidate for enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution efficiency.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000637698200006

In this regard, carbonized zeolite imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), as precursors of M-NC catalysts, have been extensively studied because of their porosity and ligand composition containing nitrogen and carbon. In this study, we synthesize Co-doped ZnO@ZIF-8 particles from a Co-doped ZnO sphere via the spray pyrolysis method and pseudomorphic replication. Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis is an attractive approach to operate mass production with high-purity homogeneous structures. Further, pseudomorphic replication makes it possible to control the morphology of the metal organic framework (MOF) particles and easily prepare MOF composite particles. In the study, the pyrolyzed ZIF particles are applied to oxygen reduction reactions in alkaline media, and our results indicate that particles show a high half-wave potential of 0.904 V, which makes them suitable for diverse electrochemical applications.									33	0	0	0	2	0	33			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000496894300057

In an in-situ method, Pt and TiO2 particles were generated from tetra-n-butyl orthotitanate and chloroplatinic acid, and hydrothermally-prepared TiO2 colloidal dispersion served as Pt support in an ex-situ USP approach. USP-synthesized Pt/TiO2 composites were generated in the form of a solid mixture, morphologically organized in nesting huge hollow and small solid spheres, or TiO2 core/Pt shell regular spheroids by in-situ or ex-situ method, respectively. This paper exclusively reports on characteristic mechanisms of the formation of novel two-component solid composites, which are intrinsic from the USP approach and controlled precursor composition. The generation of the two morphological components within the in-situ approach, the hollow spheres and all-solid spheres, was indicated to be caused by characteristic sol-gel/solid phase transition of TiO2. Both the walls of the hollow spheres and the cores of all-solid ones consist of TiO2 matrix populated by 10 nm-sized Pt. On the other hand, spherical, uniformly-sized, Pt particles of a few nanometers in size created a shell uniformly deposited onto TiO2 spheres of ca. 150 nm size. Activities of the prepared samples in an oxygen reduction reaction and combined oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions were electrochemically tested. The ex-situ synthesized Pt/TiO2 was more active for oxygen reduction and combined oxygen reduction and hydrogen reactions in comparison to the in-situ Pt/TiO2 samples, due to better availability of Pt within a core/shell structure for the reactions.									11	0	0	0	1	1	11				2075-4701		WOS:000516827800011

Herein, an integrated mesoporous heterostructure array is reported by a hydrogenation/nitridation-induced in situ growth strategy. Highly conductive oxygen-vacancies-rich tungsten oxynitride (V-o-WON) nanorod array acts as the backbone encapsulated by ultrathin nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) nanolayers, forming high-quality shell/core NC/V-o-WON heterostructures. Density functional theory calculations reveal that defect-rich heterostructure arrays not only enhance the conductivity and modulate electronic structure but also promote the adsorption and dissociation of reactants and offer substantial potential sites. As expected, porous NC/V-o-WON array exhibits a small overpotential of 16 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 33 mV per decade in alkaline media, accompanied by negligible loss upon a large current density over 100 h. Benefiting from outstanding electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction performance and stability, this defective heterostructure could serve as a prominent alternative electrocatalyst for renewable energy applications.									65	4	0	0	2	0	65			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000463288400010

Green and sustainable development is deemed as the demands of the new age, thus green battery and green electrocatalysis is urgently required. Achieving green and efficient battery and electrocatalytic reaction is a fundamental requirement for green chemistry and sustainable development. One of the key factors is the selection of electrolytes with high efficiency and the selection of solvents for synthesizing efficient electrode materials. Previous study mainly focused on the utilization of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and ionic liquids. However, the high volatility of VOCs would lead to high air pollution and thus endanger human health; the high price, high instability and complex synthesizing procedure of ionic liquids would also hinder the wide application of ionic liquids. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are new type of green electrolytes and solvents. Compared with traditional solvents and electrolytes (such as ionic liquids, water, and supercritical carbon dioxide), DESs have the advantages of simple synthesis, low price, high biocompatibility, and high designability. Therefore, DESs have great application prospects in the field of battery and electrocatalysis. However, there is not a large amount of literature reports or a review of systematical conclusion. It is necessary to review the field of DESs application in battery and electrocatalytic reaction. The contents of this review include (1) DESs as green electrolytes for batteries and electrocatalytic reaction, which includes solar cells, flow redox cell, lithium ion battery, aluminum battery, sodium battery, zinc battery, supercapacitor, carbon dioxide electroreduction, nitrogen electrocatalysis, oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, water splitting reaction and ethanol electrochemical oxidation; (2) DESs for preparation electrode materials in battery and electrocatalytic reaction; (3) DESs as a solvent for recycling electrode materials; (4) Outlook and related issues. This review would be helpful to design new types of DESs for achieving efficient and green battery and electrocatalysis.			绿色且高效的电池和电催化反应是可持续发展的基本要求,其关键因素之一在于选择能提高效率的绿色电解质和合成高效电极材料的绿色溶剂。低共熔溶剂(DESs)是一种新型环境友好的电解质和溶剂。与传统的溶剂和电解质(如离子液体、水、超临界二氧化碳)相比,DESs具有合成简便、价格低廉、可设计等优点,在电池和电催化领域有着广阔的应用前景。这方面的研究还处于起步阶段,未见有综述系统介绍。本综述内容包括以下几个部分。(1) DESs作为电池和电催化反应的电解质,其中电池包括太阳能电池、锂离子电池、钠电池、锌电池、铝电池、液流电池、超级电容器,电催化反应包括析氧反应、析氢反应、氧还原反应、全解水反应、氮气电催化反应、二氧化碳电还原反应;(2) DESs作为制备电池和电催化反应电极材料的溶剂;(3) DESs作为回收电极材料的溶剂;(4)结论和展望。						2	1	0	0	0	0	3			0438-1157			CSCD:6651087

Herein, we report a facile synthesis of N-doped hollow mesoporous carbon spheres (NHSs) using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as a silica precursor and dopamine hydrochloride (DHC) as carbon and nitrogen precursors through which uniform hollow sphere mesopores can be attained by adjusting the temperature and DHC loading. At the optimum temperature of 900 degrees C, a concentration ratio (0.5 mL:0.4 g) of TEOS/DHC leads to high-surface-area (1452 m(2)/g) carbon with pore volume (0.3 cm(3)/g), enriched defect sites, and a large number of pyridinic and graphitic-N sites offering an outstanding activity toward ORR. Further electrochemical studies demonstrated a positive onset potential of 0.84 V, an excellent current density of 4.9 mA/cm(2), and a four-electron pathway with a lower Tafel slope of 65 mV/dec, respectively.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			2574-0970			WOS:000575846000036

This indicated that Cu(II) affected the reducing side of the photosystem II. The inhibition curves of Cu(II), o-phenanthroline and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), were compared; the inhibitory patterns of Cu(II) and o-phenanthroline were very similar and different in turn from that of DCMU. Cu(II) did not eliminate or modify the electron paramagnetic resonance signal at g = 8.1 ascribed to the non-heme iron of the photosystem II reaction center, indicating that the inhibition by Cu(II) was not the result of the replacement of the iron by Cu(II). Controlled trypsin digestion of thylakoid membranes inhibited oxygen evolution using 2,6-dichlorobenzoquinone, but had no effect when using ferricyanide or silicomolybdate. Using ferricyanide, oxygen evolution of trypsin-treated thylakoids was insensitive to DCMU but became even more sensitive to Cu(II) and o-phenanthroline than nontreated thylakoids; however, trypsinized thylakoids were insensitive to inhibitors in the presence of silicomolybdate. We conclude that Cu(II) impaired the photosystem II electron transfer before the Q(B) niche, most probably at the pheophytin-Q(A)-Fe domain.									72	2	1	0	59	1	74			0021-9258			WOS:A1991GT48300014	1744077

Recently, some electrocatalysts with hollow and porous structures have attracted much attention because of their large surface-to-volume ratio and highly exposed active edge sites. In this study, the hierarchical Fe-based glycolate hollow microspheres composed of nanosheet subunits are synthesized by the solvothermal method. The morphology and microstructure of Fe-based glycolate hollow microspheres can be controlled by adjusting the amount of ethylenediamine. After phosphorizing in nitrogen, the Fe-based glycolate can be converted into FeP with well-retained structure. Furthermore, the hierarchical FeP hollow microspheres have been used as electrocatalysts for HER. Benefitting from its high surface area, the FeP hollow microspheres exhibited high catalytic activity toward HER with low onset overpotential, small Tafel slope, and good stability under acidic conditions. The excellent catalytic activity and long-term stability suggest promising application potential of FeP hollow microspheres in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			2196-0216			WOS:000410498700035

The microstructure features and the electrochemical performance of the impregnated LSCN-GDC oxygen electrodes with various LSCN loadings are evaluated and investigated. Electrochemical tests show that the impregnated LSCN-GDC oxygen electrodes present great enhancement of oxygen evolution performance, due to the good nanoparticle LSCN dispersion on the GDC scaffold surface to maximize the active reaction sites. The cell with 30 wt% LSCN loaded LSCN-GDC as the oxygen electrode presents a polarization resistance of 0.072 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C with 60 vol% absolute humidity (AH), only about half of that for the screen-printed LSCN electrode. The hydrogen production rate is 484 mL cm(-2) h(-1) at 750 degrees C at 1.5 V with 60 vol%AH. For stability test in galvanostatic SOEC operation up to 100 h, the solution impregnated cell shows a very stable performance without obvious degradation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The materials were prepared by granulation of fine powders of CuO and fly ash (FA), with 40-60-80 wt% CuO loading (Cu4OFA, Cu6OFA and Cu8OFA), using a high shear granulator. CLC and CLOU activities were investigated in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) in the presence of a reactive fuel or an inert atmosphere, respectively. A rather stable CLOU capacity (Ro-CLOU) in the range of 4-8 g O-2/100 g OC was found over 42 redox cycles, in agreement with the stoichiometry of the prepared samples. CLC oxygen carrying capacity (Ro-CLC) with gaseous fuel, on the other hand, has evidenced a quick decline for the material with higher copper loading (80 wt% CuO). Furthermore, both oxygen carriers with 40-60 wt% CuO were tested for combustion of coal in a macro-TGA rig using CO2 as carrier gas and different OC:fuel ratios. First, a blank test in the absence of the OC was carried out to characterize the fast devolatilization and slow gasification reactions taking place due to the exposure of the fuel to high temperature and CO2-rich atmosphere. The comparison of the weight loss curve evolution with and without oxygen carrier, and the measured residual carbon after test, enabled to extract the CLOU effect for each combination of material/solid fuel.									14	1	0	0	1	0	15			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000413391300014

In this work, hetero S atoms were introduced into the MoO2 to enhance the catalytic activity by simultaneously adjusting electron structure, engineering lattice defect, and increasing oxygen vacancies. And the S doped MoO2 nanosheets with proper S doping amount show the enhanced performance for HER. The optimized catalyst shows a small onset overpotential as low as 120 mV, a low overpotential of 176 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) which is decreased 166 mV compared to that of the pristine MoO2 nanosheets, a low Tafel slope of 57 mV/decade, and a high turnover frequency of 0.13 H-2/s per active site at 150 mV. This finding proposes an effective strategy to prepare nonprecious metal oxide catalyst for enhancing HER performance by rationally doping hetero atoms.									39	4	0	0	2	0	39			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000500888100001

Char electrodes enriched with Co show a maximum positive shift of 40 mV with respect to raw char electrodes with a number of exchanged electrons per O-2 molecule close to 4 (as for Pt) for the best sample. This corresponds to a reduction of the production of unwanted oxygen peroxide from 23% for raw char to 1%. Sample structure evolution before and after electrochemical deposition and electro-catalysis was investigated by scanning transmission electron microscopy and XPS. Such electrochemical treatments open new possibilities of refining waste chars and finding an economic alternative to noble metals-based catalysts for alkaline fuel cells.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5				1996-1073		WOS:000588875100001

The NAC were employed as negative additives of lead-acid or lead-carbon batteries that can not only restrain hydrogen evolution, but also enhance the specific capacitance and cycle life. The electrochemical measurements results show that the obtained nitrogen-doped activated carbon has higher over-potential toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in sulfuric acid solution compared to original activated carbon. What's more, the specific capacitance value of nitrogen-doped activated carbon is 51.57% higher than the original activated carbon in sulfuric acid solution. The XPS results show that these excellent electrochemical properties of the nitrogen-doped activated carbon is due to the role of nitrogen in the material, especially pyrrole nitrogen which is easy to combine with hydrogen atoms in the hydrogen evolution reaction process, thereby inhibiting the hydrogen atoms into hydrogen gas, and inhibiting the hydrogen evolution in sulfuric acid solution. Therefore, the NAC can be considered as promising negative additives for lead-acid batteries.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000439338500080

So far, it is still big challenge to exploit their fine tuning to enhance the catalytic performance and have insight into their advantages. In this paper, we report an ideal platform construed by COFs and multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to illustrate key factors in COFbased electrocatalysts towards oxygen evolution. Fine tuning of COF layers reveals the optimized catalytic performance relies on the proper loadings of molecular catalyst on MWCNTs to balance the mass and electron transfer. Moreover, a novel strategy of diluting the active sites to enhance their intrinsic activity is proposed to further enhance the electrocatalytic performance. The generality of the fine regulation is fully demonstrated with different COFs. This work elucidates the fine tuning of COF-based electrocatalysts and sheds light on the broad applications of molecular catalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000643727600005

Although atomically dispersed supported metal catalysts often exhibit excellent catalytic performance with maximized atom efficiency, the fabrication of single-atom catalysts remains a great challenge because of their easy aggregation. Herein, a simple ionothermal method was developed to fabricate atomically dispersed Fe-N-x species on porous porphyrinic triazine-based frameworks (FeSAs/PTF) with high Fe loading up to 8.3 wt %, resulting in highly reactive and stable single-atom ORR catalysts for the first time. Owing to the high density of single-atom Fe-N-4 active sites, highly hierarchical porosity, and good conductivity, the as-prepared catalyst FeSAs/PTF-600 exhibited highly efficient activity, methanol tolerance, and superstability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under both alkaline and acidic conditions. This work will bring new inspiration to the design of highly efficient noble-metal-free catalysts at the atomic scale for energy conversion.									205	20	0	0	9	0	206			2380-8195			WOS:000430369600019

Herein, 2LaCo(0.7)Fe(0.3)O(3)/N-doped carbon is prepared by sol-gel method using g-C3N4 nanosheets as carbon source and nitrogen source. The LaCo0.7Fe0.3O3 nanoparticles have excellent dispersibility on the N-doped carbon substrate and the composite material has higher oxygen vacancy concentration, showing enhanced bifunctional electrocatalytic activity (?E=Ej=10,OER-E1/2,ORR=1.03 V) compared with the original LaCo0.7Fe0.3O3 (?E = 1.12 V). Moreover, 2LaCo(0.7)Fe(0.3)O(3)/N-doped carbon-based Zn-air battery presents excellent cycling stability (over 24 h) and high peak power density of 116 mW cm-2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed the mechanism of improvement electrocatalytic activity of 2LaCo(0.7)Fe(0.3)O(3)/N-doped carbon, which comes from the regulated electronic structure, including enhanced conductivity and the covalence of Co-O bond, reducing the free energy change of rate-determining step.

In this review, rather than overviewing recent progress completely, we aim to give an in-depth digestion of present achievements, focusing on the different roles of nanocarbons and material design principles. The multifunctionalities of nanocarbon substrates (accelerating the electron and mass transport, regulating the incorporation of active components, manipulating electron structures, generating confinement effects, assembly into 3D free-standing electrodes) and the intrinsic activity of nanocarbon catalysts (multi-heteroatom doping, hierarchical structure, topological defects) are discussed systematically, with perspectives on the further research in this rising research field. This review is inspiring for more insights and methodical research in mechanism understanding, material design, and device optimization, leading to a targeted and high-efficiency development of energy electrocatalysis.

Among these metal oxides, oxide-based diluted magnetic semiconductors have also been proposed for fuel cell applications, especially for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction. However, the catalytic mechanism has been proposed to follow a two-electron pathway, forming hydrogen peroxide, instead of the four-electron pathway. Herein, we report cobalt-doped zinc oxide (CoxZn1-xO, 0 < x < 0.018) materials prepared using a coprecipitation method suitable for the electrocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide. The electrocatalytic performance of CoxZn1-xO materials showed up to 60% hydrogen peroxide production with onset potentials near 649 mV, followed by the two-electron ORR mechanism. Ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments at the Co K-edge demonstrated the presence of Co(II) ions at tetrahedral sites within the ZnO lattice.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000818980200001

Herein, we prepared highly reactive and stable cobalt-embedded nitrogen-rich carbon nanosheets (Co-N/CNs). Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experiments, the as-prepared Co-N/CNs showed outstanding catalytic activities toward both OER and ORR. The optimized Co-N/CNs-800 catalyst revealed outstanding bifunctional catalytic activities for both ORR and OER with high catalytic efficiency and long-term durability, which were even comparable with those of the state-of-the-art Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. Furthermore, we observed that different cobalt salt precursors affected the size of Co nanoparticles, and both ORR and OER catalytic activities displayed completely consistent variations (sulfate < acetate < chloride < nitrate). An all-solid-state Al-air battery device comprising this hybrid catalyst showed superior performance when compared with the device containing the Pt/C catalyst.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2046-2069			WOS:000436031800058	35541703

The 6-electrode cell allows the operation of two working electrodes independent from each other one of which serves as a detection electrode. A current at the detection electrode signifies the formation of soluble species at the generator electrode. This approach is reminiscent of an RRDE arrangement.However, the 6-electrode cell allows combination of RRDE-analogue experiments with differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS). Volatile products formed at the detection electrode, therefore, can be identified via mass spectroscopy, which is not possible with an RRDE-arrangements. At the same time it is possible to identify volatile products formed at the generator electrode.We demonstrate the application of the 6-electrode cell for the oxygen reduction reaction in Li+-containing DMSO based electrolyte. We will show that soluble products that react at the detection electrode are due to the oxidation of superoxide.

Here, one-pot synthesized iron covalent porphyrin polymers (FePor-CPP), with carefully placed Fe, N atoms, a regular porous structure, Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2 )and NaH2PO2 precursors were carbonized into N,P-doped carbon nanospheres with the active species of both bimetallic CoFe phosphides and CoCx nanoparticles (denoted as CoCx/(Co0.55Fe1.945)(2)P@C). By employing the CoCx/(Co0.55Fe1.945)(2)P@C as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrode catalysts, superior catalytic activity is achieved with E-1/2 of 0.84 V for ORR, and overpotential of 0.39 Vat 10 mA cm (2) for OER in an alkaline medium, respectively. Furthermore, CoCx/(Co0.55Fe1.945)(2)P@C as air electrode for rechargeable Zn-air battery shows power density as high as 131 mW cm (2) and charge-discharge cycle stability, and this suggests the potential application of CoCx/(Co0.55Fe1.945)(2)P@C in energy transformation systems. The high electrocatalytic performances are revealed to originate from the change of electronic structure of bimetallic (Co0.55Fe1.945)(2)P via introducing P into the Co0.55Fe1.945 alloy, resulting in a decreased energy gap of CoCx/(Co0.55Fe1.945)(2)P@C relative to that of CoCx/Co0.55Fe@C.

Here, we prepare a unique concave octahedral Pd@PdPt electrocatalyst, which integrates three structural types, core-shell, concave and alloy structures, using an ethylene glycol system. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) line-scan, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses reveal that the concave octahedral Pd core is surrounded by a PdPt alloy shell. Through some control experiments, a possible mechanism for the formation of the nanostructure is proposed. The as-prepared Pd@PdPt NCs exhibit a superior enhanced bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for both the ORR and the HER, even better than that of 20% Pt/C. When used in the ORR, the concave octahedral Pd@PdPt NCs exhibit a superior half-potential of 0.91 V (vs. RHE), a large mass activity of 0.95 A mg(Pt)(-1), and a superior stability over 1000 cycles in 0.1 M KOH. When used in the HER, these NCs present a positive onset potential of -5 mV (vs. RHE), a small Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1), a lower overpotential of similar to 39 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a long-term durability over 4000 cycles in 0.5 M H2SO4.

Herein, ultrafine CoFe alloyed nanoparticles (NPs) homogeneously decorated on N-doped carbon nanosheets (CoFe@NCS) are syn-thesized by annealing the precursor of NCS supported CoFe-based Prussian-blue-analogues. The optimal CoFe@NCS delivers prominent electrocatalytic behaviors for both the ORR (0.88 V of half-wave potential) and OER (340 mV of overpotential at 10 mA cm-2) in an alkaline electrolyte. The outstanding bifunctional elec-trocatalytic activities are ascribed to the synergistic interplay of structural and compositional advantages, including the hierarchically porous structure as well as the strong coupling of ultrafine CoFe species and NCS. Simultaneously, the assembled flow ZAB with CoFe@NCS as the air-cathode catalyst manifests a superior battery performance to the device catalyzed by the noble-metal benchmark (Pt/C + RuO2). This work may pave an avenue for developing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts and promoting the practical application of ZABs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000868930800001

Herein, combined with the impregnation method, chains of N-doped carbon spheres with abundant pores synthesized by a simple and versatile nanoemulsion assembly strategy have been used to prepare platinum catalysts (Pt-PC-300) via pore confinement and anchoring effect, which enhances the interaction between the metal and the carbon support and thus hinders the metal agglomeration and fall off during the catalytic process. The structure and composition of the materials were characterized by HRTEM, XRD, BET, TEM, SEM, XAS and XPS. Under acidic conditions, Pt-PC-300 showed better catalytic performance in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than Pt supported by carbon (XC-72) and commercial Pt/C. Specifically, the Pt-PC-300 catalyst exhibited a similar half-wave potential but much better stability in comparison with the commercial Pt/C because of the pore-confined structure and anchoring effect, the synergy of which provides a new way to develop stable ORR catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000773652500001

Herein, a series of iron oxides including alpha-Fe2O3 nanoplates, alpha-Fe2O3/Fe3O4 composites, and Fe3O4 material was prepared via a controllable reduction treatment on alpha-Fe2O3 precursor. When these iron oxides were characterized as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), it was found that alpha-Fe2O3 nanoplates could be effectively activated via the reduction treatment. In particular, as the combined merits of composition optimization and electroconductivity improvement, the as-reduced composite consisting of alpha-Fe2O3 (49.6%) and Fe3O4 (50.4%) achieved the best activity of reaching the current density of 4.90 mA cm(-2) at the potential of 0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) accompanied by a Tafel slope of 76 mV dec(-1) and a high selectivity for four-electron pathway, surpassing single-phase alpha-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4, as well as other congeneric iron oxide composites. This high performance may offer a great potential of developing electrocatalysts with optimized composition and physicochemical properties.									26	1	0	0	1	0	26			2168-0485			WOS:000474474800087

Herein, we identify the adverse behaviors of the GBs for bimetallic platinum-cobalt (Pt-Co) nanocatalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). As model catalysts, GB-rich Pt-Co nanowires (Pt-Co GB-NWs) and single-crystalline Pt-Co nanowires (Pt-Co SC-NWs) are synthesized. They have very similar diameters, Pt-to-Co ratios, and Pt-rich surface structures, except for the GB populations, which can be precisely controlled by applying an external magnetic field during their synthesis. The presence of GBs in Pt-Co NWs promotes Co leaching at an applied electrochemical potential, inducing significant changes in the surface Pt-to-Co ratio. The resulting Pt-Co GB-NWs perform only half the ORR activity compared with the Pt-Co SC-NWs. As a result, it is revealed that the surface GB sites are deactivated by causing elemental leaching and may not act as an ORR promoter for the Pt-Co nanowire catalyst.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000778789200022

Herein, we design and prepare a highly active catalyst by using cobalt metal-organic frameworks (Co-MOFs) as precursor. In consequence, the obtained 1D Co@SN-CNP (Co@S,N-doped carbon nanoprisms) by pyrolysis of Co-MOFs at 700 degrees C possesses similar ORR activity but superior durability to the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C in 0.1M KOH solution. The high catalytic performance could be attributed to the special nanostructure composed of cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated in S, N co-doped carbon prisms, which integrate the advantages of 1D nanostructures, encapsulated cobalt nanoparticles and S, N Co-doped carbon materials towards ORR. The present work will provide a new strategy for the development of S, N co-doped carbon-based materials with tunable non-precious metal species for electrocatalysis.					4th China-USA Symposium on Energy4th China-USA Symposium on Energy	JUN 25-27, 2017JUN 25-27, 2017	Natl Nat Sci Fdn China; Int Assoc Hydrogen Energy, ACS Energy & Fuel Div; Int Assoc Hydrogen Energy, Hydrogen Storage DivNatl Nat Sci Fdn China; Int Assoc Hydrogen Energy, ACS Energy & Fuel Div; Int Assoc Hydrogen Energy, Hydrogen Storage Div	Shanghai Univ, Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINAShanghai Univ, Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	24	1	0	0	3	0	24			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000448949300020

Non-noble metals with carbonaceous coatings, as cathodic catalysts for fuel cells, expected to replace platinum for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), have attracted the attention of researchers. This is mainly due to the low price, easy availability, high stability, and gratifying catalytic activity of these materials. However, the high density and uniform dispersion of coated particles still face a challenge. In view of this, we prepared Fe3C/Fe@G catalysts with a structure of nitrogen-doped multilayer graphene uniformly coated on iron and iron carbide (Fe3C/Fe) in a very simple way. The half wave potential of Fe3C/Fe@G-800 is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C, and it also highlights the excellent stability that is a benefit of the complete coating of graphene layers to internal particles; highly dispersed Fe3C/Fe nanoparticles with small size in the graphene layer; the equilibrium degree of graphitization and the defect density.									38	0	0	0	2	0	38			2168-0485			WOS:000429285800051

Herein, we proposed a facile and universal secondary-atom-assisted strategy to prepare atomic iron sites with high density hosted on porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanowires (Fe-NCNWs). The Fe-NCNWs showed an impressive half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.91 V and average kinetic current density (J(K)) of 6.0 mA cm(-2) at 0.9 V in alkaline media. They also held a high ORR activity in acidic solution with the E-1/2 of 0.82 V and average J(K) of 8.0 mA cm(-2) at 0.8 V. Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the high ORR activity achieved is originated from single-atom iron sites that decrease the energy barrier in the reaction path efficiently.									105	8	0	0	5	0	106			2155-5435			WOS:000474812400014

The Raman data revealed a phenomenon of stress relaxation as well as the generation of growth stress. Ex-situ atomic force microscope (AFM) was employed to assess the surface morphology of Cu film before and after the oxygen reaction. 3D nano oxide islands were observed on the oxide surface. A growth model for the oxide layer was proposed based on Stranski-Krastonov epitaxy. This model interpreted the mechanism of stresses relaxation in the oxide layer at nano level. Finally, the oxidation kinetics was analyzed qualitatively in terms of the Raman data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									11	1	0	0	0	0	12			0167-577X			WOS:000305779800006

Among many potential photoanode materials, hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) shows high promise considering its ideal band position, long-term chemical stability, and earth abundance. Unfortunately, its sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics at photoanode/electrolyte interfaces and poor bulk charge transport limit the PEC performance. Herein, the most recent developments on interfacial engineering of hematite photoanode are summarized. We first describe the optical and electronic properties of the alpha-Fe2O3 that are related to the PEC performance. Subsequently, we introduce the recent endeavors on the morphological engineering of the hematite photoanode. Then, the effective strategies of interfacial engineering are highlighted to address the limitations of alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode at the surfaces and/or interfaces, as well as at the grain boundaries within the film. And the most recent progress of alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode-based tandem cells for self-assisted overall water splitting is also discussed. Finally, an outlook is presented for future efforts on promoting the interfacial charge transport for boosted PEC performance of hematite-based photo-electrodes.									5	1	0	0	2	0	5				2577-8196		WOS:000661827900010

Herein, in this study, a graphene aerogel decorated with MoSx nanosheets (MoSx/HRG) with a three-dimensional porous framework synthesized using a one-step hydrothermal reaction followed by freeze-drying is reported. The MoSx/HRG aerogel possesses hierarchical mesopores and micropores, which could facilitate electrolyte impregnation and oxygen diffusion, and provide much more accommodation space for the reaction products. The lithium-oxygen batteries based on this MoSx/HRG aerogel cathode show improved electrochemical performance, with a high initial discharge capacity up to 6678.4 mA h g (1) at a current density of 0.05 mA cm (2) and better cycling capability with a cut-off capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 mA cm(-2), compared with the lithium-oxygen batteries based on an HRG aerogel cathode. The enhanced performance is ascribed to the excellent catalytic activity of the MoSx nanosheets and the unique three-dimensional porous architecture.									28	0	0	0	2	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000379473100030

Our group demonstrated recently that the electrochemical tuning of catalysts via lithium insertion and extraction has emerged as a powerful approach to improve catalytic activity. Here we report a novel in situ electrochemical oxidation tuning approach to develop a series of binary, ternary, and quaternary transition metal (e.g., Co, Ni, Fe) oxides from their corresponding sulfides as highly active catalysts for much enhanced water oxidation. The electrochemically tuned cobalt-nickel-iron oxides grown directly on the three-dimensional carbon fiber electrodes exhibit a low overpotential of 232 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of 37.6 mV dec(-1), and exceptional long-term stability of electrolysis for over 100 h in 1 M KOH alkaline medium, superior to most non-noble oxygen evolution catalysts reported so far. The materials evolution associated with the electrochemical oxidation tuning is systematically investigated by various characterizations, manifesting that the improved activities are attributed to the significant grain size reduction and increase of surface area and electroactive sites. This work provides a promising strategy to develop electrocatalysts for large-scale water-splitting systems and many other applications.									314	15	0	0	8	0	315			2374-7943	2374-7951		WOS:000365968800007	27162978

In this work, we prepared nanocomposites based on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), namely WS2 and MoS2, and evaluated their performance as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), relevant to fuel cells. The one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) building blocks were initially exfoliated and non-covalently functionalized by surfactants of opposite charge in aqueous media (tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide, TTAB, for the nanotubes and sodium cholate, SC, for the dichalcogenides), and thereafter, the three-dimensional (3D) MoS2@MWNT and WS2@MWNT composites were assembled via surfactant-mediated electrostatic interactions. The nanocomposites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and structural differences were found. WS2@MWNT and MoS2@MWNT show moderate ORR performance with potential onsets of 0.71 and 0.73 V vs. RHE respectively, and diffusion-limiting current densities of -1.87 and -2.74 mA center dot cm(-2), respectively. Both materials present, however, better tolerance to methanol crossover when compared to Pt/C and good stability. Regarding OER performance, MoS2@MWNT exhibits promising results, with eta(10) and j(max) of 0.55 V and 17.96 mA center dot cm(-2), respectively. The fabrication method presented here is cost-effective, robust and versatile, opening the doors for the optimization of electrocatalysts' performance.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				1996-1944		WOS:000624119900001	33668549

The reactivated particles appeared to be inhibited much more strongly: a 53% decrease in the activity (compared with 24% for the particles without the 18 kD protein) and a 89% decrease (as compared with 20% for the particles without the 18 and 24 kD proteins) was observed after a 5-min illumination. The fast component of delayed fluorescence was more sensitive to strong light than the steady-state level. Adding CaCl2 to particles devoid of the 18 kD protein did not influence the kinetics of photoinhibition of the steady-state level of fluorescence. However, reactivating the particles devoid of the 18 and 24 kD proteins modified the character of photoinhibition to the level observed in control samples. The photoinhibition of the PS II particles apparently involves the 33 kD peripheral protein located on the donor side and a locus near the reaction center.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0006-2979	1608-3040		WOS:A1993MM94800017

However, the application of conventional Pt-based catalysts is limited by its high cost and insufficient reserve. Here we synthesized TiC/C nanofibers as ORR catalyst through electrospinning. The morphology, TiC content, and interface between TiC and carbon in TiC/C nanofibers could be adjusted by changing preparation conditions. The changes in material properties affect the catalytic performance due to the synergistic enhanced effect between TiC and carbon. The best TiC/C sample (TCNFs/C) exhibited the ORR performance with the onset potential, peak potential, peak current density, and charge transfer number of 0.941 V vs. RHE, 0.812 V vs. RHE, 0.742 mA cm(-2), and 3.29, respectively, as well as good catalytic durability and excellent methanol tolerance. The results demonstrate the great research value and application potential of TiC/C nanofibers as ORR catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000575656600004

Decreasing the anodic overpotential and simultaneously changing the anodic reaction selectively to produce valuable chemicals instead of O-2 would be a major improvement of the overall cost efficiency. Some amines, when present in aqueous electrolytes, were recently shown to change the selectivity of the anodic process to generate H2O2 rather than O-2 on MnOx at pH10. This results in unusually high apparent "anodic activities". In this work, industrially relevant OER catalysts, oxyhydroxides of cobalt (CoOx), nickel-iron (NiFeOx), and nickel (NiOx) all show more pronounced effects. Moreover, as anodes they also selectively catalyzed the production of nbutyronitrile from n-butylamine at higher pH as an easily retrievable valuable product. The pH dependence of the activity was investigated at pH values closer those at which alkaline electrolyzers operate. The highest activities were observed for NiOx thin-film electrodes at pH12 in the presence of 0.4mn-butylammonium sulfate, without poisoning the active sites of Pt electrocatalysts at the hydrogen evolution electrode. (HNMR)-H-1 spectroscopy showed that n-butylamine is selectively oxidized to n-butyronitrile, an organic chemical with numerous applications. However, measurements using rotating ring-disk electrodes indicated that some H2O2 is also generated at the surface of the oxide anodes.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000418660700002	29064188

Cyclic voltammograms of V5+/V4+ redox couple suggest that the overpotential range for the kinetic analysis is limited to +/- 300 mV, after excluding V4+/V3+ redox reaction at the negative overpotential and the oxygen evolution reaction at the positive overpotential. The linear sweep-voltammograms (LSVs) are corrected for potential drop due to solution resistance (iR ( s )), mass-transfer resistance, and most importantly, for the back reaction current. These corrections are imperative to estimate the Tafel slope in the limited range of overpotential for V5+/V4+ redox reaction. The charge-transfer coefficient (alpha) estimated from the Tafel slope deviates significantly from the expected value of 0.5 for the single electron-transfer reaction. Moreover, the instantaneous slope of the Tafel plot suggests that the alpha is overpotential dependent. Therefore, Marcus theory of electrochemical kinetics is applied to estimate the alpha. The reorganization energy (lambda) calculated from the Arrhenius plots is in the range of values reported in the literature for the other redox couples.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000722724900001

J	Clausen, J; Junge, W								Detection of an intermediate of photosynthetic water oxidation								NATURE				430	6998			480	483		10.1038/nature02676				JUL 22 2004	2004	The oxygen that we breathe is produced by photosystem II of cyanobacteria and plants. The catalytic centre, a Mn4Ca cluster, accumulates four oxidizing equivalents before oxygen is formed, seemingly in a single reaction step1-8 2H(2)O(<--)(-->) O-2 = 4H(+) + 4e(-). The energy and cycling of this reaction derives solely from light. No intermediate oxidation product of water has been detected so far. Here, we shifted the equilibrium of the terminal reaction backward by increasing the oxygen pressure and monitoring ( by absorption transients in the near-ultraviolet spectrum) the electron transfer from bound water into the catalytic centre. A tenfold increase of ambient oxygen pressure (2.3 bar) half-suppressed the full progression to oxygen. The remaining electron transfer at saturating pressure ( 30 bar) was compatible with the formation of a stabilized intermediate. The abstraction of four electrons from water was probably split into at least two electron transfers: mildly endergonic from the centre's highest oxidation state to an intermediate, and exergonic from the intermediate to oxygen. There is little leeway for photosynthetic organisms to push the atmospheric oxygen concentration much above the present level.									105	0	0	0	75	0	106			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000222801400050	15269775

In this work, ternary Ni-N-P microparticles, an analogue of NiCx, are in-situ grown on nickel foam through one-step phosphorization at low temperature under atmosphere of ammonia. The unique microparticles-like morphology and suitable electronic structure render them enhanced electron and mass transfer ability, ensuring superior activity and good durability in catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under alkaline condition. Specifically, the optimal Ni-N-P microparticles can deliver 10 mA/cm(2) at the overpotential of 260 mV and 180 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for OER and HER, respectively. Additionally, only a cell voltage of 1.7 V is required to afford 10 mA/cm(2) when the prepared Ni-N-P microparticles serve as both anode and cathode in two-electrode configuration for overall water splitting. The Ni-N-P microparticles hold promise as cost-effective and efficient candidate for practical water splitting devices.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000525337000001

Hierarchical NiCo2O4 hollow rectangular nanobars (NiCo2O4 HRNBs) with ultrathin nanosheets were synthesized via the template-directed methodology, followed by sequential etching and annealing treatments. The NiCo2O4 HRNBs with advanced features of a hierarchical hollow nanoarchitecture and a high surface area expose more reaction sites and provide ample mass diffusion pathways. Meanwhile, the abundant and accessible oxygen vacancies on the surface of NiCo2O4 HRNBs can significantly accelerate the reaction kinetics of adsorbed oxygen-containing species. As a result, the as-obtained NiCo2O4 HRNBs deliver an outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, which generates a positive half-wave potential of 0.81 V for ORR (reaching Pt/C) and a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low potential of 1.59 V for OER (surpassing Pt/C) and robust stability in alkaline electrolytes. Expectedly, the rechargeable zinc-air batteries assembled by as-obtained NiCo2O4 HRNB cathodes demonstrate superior battery performance with a large specific capacity of 724.6 mA h g(Zn)(-1) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a high power density of 117.6 mW cm(-2), and long-term cycle stability with a slight increase in polarization over an entire 200 h test, showing potential application in the field of new-generation rechargeable batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000818982600001

Herein, a facile wet-chemical route followed by successive selenization and partial phosphorization treatments is presented to synthesize the heterostructure combining NiSe2 and Ni2P coupled nanowrinkles on Ni foam (NiSe2-Ni2P/NF). DFT calculation results confirm that the NiSe2 coupled with Ni2P in NiSe2-Ni2P/NF can promote the water adsorption process, speeding up the whole catalytic kinetics for overall water splitting. Benefitting from the synergistic effects between NiSe2 and Ni2P, the optimal NiSe2-Ni2P/NF electrode exhibits excellent catalytic performances toward both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Impressively, for OER such heterogeneous nanowrinkles merely require an ultralow overpotential of 220 mV to reach the current density of 50 mA cm(-2). Moreover, when utilized as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting, the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) can be delivered at an ultralow cell voltage of 1.50 V, which is among the lowest values of current non-precious metal catalysts. This work provides a unique strategy for exploring highly efficient heterostructure catalysts toward water splitting and beyond. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, cobalt- and nitrogen-coembedded three-dimensional (3D) trumpet flower-like porous carbons (CoNC) have been prepared by a simple two-step self-assembly technique, using carbon quantum dots (CQDs) as the carbon precursor and a supermolecular gel of self-assembled melamine and Co2+ ions as the nitrogen and cobalt sources. The resultant CoNC catalysts possess unique 3D trumpet flower-like structures, efficient charge transfer ability, and abundant Co-N-x active sites. As a catalyst for ORR, the optimized CoNC-800 (pyrolyzed at 800 degrees C) exhibits efficient electrocatalytic activities, longer-term stability, and strong endurance to methanol both in acidic and alkaline media. It can be worked as a prospective substitute for a commercial Pt/C catalyst for ORR in the widespread implementation of fuel cells.									50	5	0	0	0	0	52			2168-0485			WOS:000402950000096

In this context, development of catalysts for oxidation of water to molecular oxygen remains a critical bottleneck. Herein, we describe the preparation of a well-defined nanostructured RuO2 catalyst, which is able to carry out the oxidation of water both chemically and photochemically.

Nevertheless, the real active moiety is elusive and the catalyst evolution during the reaction remains unexplored to date. Herein, we decipher in situ evolved surface chemistry of a Ni-based precatalyst (Ni SAC/Ni-NiO/NC-500) during the 2e(-) ORR process that results in a reconstructed catalyst (Ni SAC/Ni-NiO/ NC-500-R). The phase transformation of the electrocatalyst is monitored by operando Raman spectroscopy and ex situ X-ray analysis. With the optimized catalyst in hand, a 2e(-) ORR potential of 0.78 V (at 1.0 mA cm(-2)) and a high selectivity of 95% in an alkaline electrolyte are harvested. More encouragingly, high-flux H2O2 is produced via photomediated electrosynthesis, enabling on-site degradation of organic pollutants with an impressive degradation rate approaching 100%.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000812499800001

Deeply analyzing the involved mechanism may be a crucial factor to break through the bottleneck of H2O2 yield. Here, nitrogen-deficient and boron-doped g-C3N4 are synthesized for PHP and the interaction mechanisms between active species and PD are revealed. The prepared photocatalyst exhibits a high H2O2 production rate (455 mu M h-1 g-1). The 1O2, center dot O2- and hole promoted by modification site dominate twelve different reaction mechanisms, respectively. For the oxidation pathways dominated by hole, H2O2 generation is limited by the dissociation of PD or desorption of H+ on catalyst surface. Interestingly, center dot O2- and 1O2 could directly attack PD, or diffuse into solution to react with PD to produce H2O2 with lower barriers. Moreover, there is a synergistic effect between doped-boron, 1O2 and water bridge, which further reduces the reaction barrier.									11	0	0	0	3	0	11			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000707882900001

The electrochemical properties of the CNT cathodes were studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Palladium-filled cathodes displayed better performance as compared to the palladium-coated ones due to the shielding of the catalysts. The mechanism of the improvement was associated to the reduction of the rate of resistances growth in the batteries, especially the ionic resistances in the electrolyte and electrodes. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and spectroscopy were used to analyze the products of the reaction that were adsorbed on the electrode surface of the battery, which was fabricated using palladium-coated and palladium-filled CNTs as cathodes and an ether-based electrolyte.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2313-0105		WOS:000464120500001

The reaction dynamics in oxygen treatments is determined down to a time scale of few minutes as well as that of dedoping process made by water vapor treatment. The interplay of strain modification and doping effects is separated. The strain is clarified to be strongly influenced by the cooling time. The doping removal is dominated by the water vapor, showing that the concentration of molecular water in gas phase governs the process rate. The opportune choice of heating/cooling and atmosphere enables to tune selectively the strain or doping. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The system of evolution equations for the free radical chain mechanism for the oxidation of polyolefines, which accounts for branching, diffusion of polymer chains and stresses, is derived. Unlike the majority of the studies, the derived equations model the change of fractions caused not only by chemical reactions or oxygen diffusion, but also by the motions of polymer chains. It is shown, that this system has two threshold levels of controlling parameters. Under the lower level no deviations occur: every fluctuations of fractions from the uniform state diminish in time. Above the higher level the trivial distribution can not exist. At intermediate level localized peaks on top of the homogeneous distribution can occur.					11th Biennial European Conference on Fracture (ECF 11)11th Biennial European Conference on Fracture (ECF 11)	SEP 03-06, 1996SEP 03-06, 1996	European Struct Integr Soc; ENSMA, Lab Mecan & Phys Mat; Federat European Mat SocEuropean Struct Integr Soc; ENSMA, Lab Mecan & Phys Mat; Federat European Mat Soc	POITIERS FUTUROSCOPE, FRANCEPOITIERS FUTUROSCOPE, FRANCE	0	0	0		0	0	0					0-947817-90-5	WOS:A1996BJ84T00287

In the present work, we demonstrate a simple, one-step organometallic chemical deposition (OMCD) of IrO(2)nanoparticles onto Sb-doped SnO2(ATO) high-surface area support. The resulting IrO2/ATO electrocatalyst was characterised using high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to develop an understanding towards the structural and chemical properties of the prepared materials. The OMCD method produced crystalline IrO(2)nanoparticles of 2.3 +/- 0.7 nm that were uniformly dispersed over the ATO support surface. Most interestingly, structural metal-support interactions were observed in the form of epitaxial anchoring of IrO(2)nanoparticles on the ATO support. These characteristics yielded outstanding oxygen evolution performance: a 7-fold increase in Ir mass-specific activity was observed compared to an IrO2-TiO(2)commercial benchmark, in combination with excellent stability of our crystalline IrO2.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000543417300009

However, controversies on the true photoreactivity of a specific facet in heterogeneous photocatalysis still exits. Herein, we exemplified well-defined BiOBr nanosheets dominating with respective facets, (001) and (010), to track the reactivity of crystal facets for photocatalytic water splitting. The real photoreactivity of BiOBr-(001) were evidenced to be significantly higher than BiOBr-(010) for both hydrogen production and oxygen evolution reactions. Further in situ photochemical probing studies verified the distinct reactivity is not only owing to the highly exposed facets, but dominated by the co-exposing facets, leading to an efficient spatial separation of photogenerated charges and further making the oxidation and reduction reactions separately occur with different reaction rates, which ordains the fate of the true photoreactivity.									135	9	0	0	22	0	138			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000516813900001	31994300

Herein, a comprehensive investigation on the synergetic contribution of nitrogen (N) and fluorine (F) species in porous carbon for ORR/OER catalyses is firstly conducted. The metal-free N, F co-doped porous carbon (NFPC) possesses appealing catalytic activities in zinc-air batteries and is superior to many other catalysts. Combined with the careful exploration of N and F dopants, seventeen optimized carbon cluster structures with all possible co-doping of N and F species are considered for density functional theory calculations. It can be inferred that the F doping with graphitic and pyridinic N triggers active paramagnetic centers. The co-doping of covalent F and graphitic N especially gives the lowest free energy barrier for both ORR/OER, which could account for the notable performance of NFPC catalysts in zinc-air batteries.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000697269300001

Here, Co9S8 nanospheres with hollow structure anchored on N and S dual-doped graphene oxide (Co9S8-NSGO) are synthesized by solvothermal strategy. After pyrolyzed, advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts with feature of sea-island architecture of Co9S8 polyhedrons evenly dispersed on N and S co-doped graphene sheets (Co9S8-NSG) are obtained, in which Co9S8 polyhedrons stem from the derivative of Co9S8 nanospheres. Ascribed to large surface area, sea-island structure of uniform dispersion of Co9S8 nanoparticles on graphene, synergistic effect between Co9S8 and graphene and more active sites based N and S doping, the as-prepared Co9S8-NSG catalyst exhibits excellent OER performance with a small overpotential (240 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and satisfactory ORR performance with half-wave potential (0.79 V). Notably, a zinc-air battery using Co9S8-NSG as air cathode shows high peak power density (120 mW cm(-2)) and outstanding cycling stability (120 h at 10 mA cm(-2)).									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2452-2139			WOS:000609174800007

However, iron species and supports suffered from severe sintering, leading to the deactivation of this OC during multiple redox reaction. In this work, a series of silica modified alumina were used as supports of Fe2O3 and found that the OC with the addition of 5% Si (Si-5) exhibited the highest performance for CLC of CH4 during 60 redox cycles. Si was discovered to be incorporated into Al rich coordination environment and the formed Si-O-Al structure inhibited phase transformation of gamma-Al2O3 to alpha-Al2O3, which stabilized the support with high specific surface area. This led to the best dispersion of iron oxides during reaction (77%), confirmed by the formation of the highly dispersed epsilon-Fe2O3 phase identified in the reaction, which resulted in the largest amount of active FeAl2O4 (47%) in the reduction step.									18	4	0	0	3	0	18			2168-0485			WOS:000446413100036

Despite the enhanced catalytic activity versus Pt, the electrocatalytic performance of Pt-bimetallic catalysts is however limited by the lack of long-term durability, primarily due to the leaching of the non-noble element under harsh electrochemical conditions. Our study shows that the core-shell nanostructure comprising a Pt shell and a cobalt core (denoted as Co(alPt) could overcome this limitation, demonstrating similar to 10 times improvement in catalytic activity versus commercial Pt catalysts and no more than 13% of loss after 30000 potential cycles. The evolutions of nanoscale and surface structures over the course of extensive potential cycling were followed by combining electron microscopic elemental mapping and electrochemical studies of CO stripping. Atomistic simulations and density functional theory calculations suggest that the core-shell nanostructure could protect the non-noble cobalt from leaching under the "electrochemical annealing" conditions while maintaining the beneficial mechanisms of bimetallic systems for catalytic activity enhancement.									53	4	0	0	3	0	53			2155-5435			WOS:000419751100006

The addition of Zn to the coating results in smaller surface cracks and greater roughness. When Cu and Zn coexist, high-index crystal planes are generated on smaller-sized grains formed on the coating surface, which allows the coating surface to adsorb oxygen. Sb5+ and the adjacent Cu2+-Zn2+ on the surface of the Cu-Zn co-doped coating are the advantageous active sites for adsorbed oxygen. The electrode exhibits a larger electrochemically active surface area and smaller electrochemical reaction resistance. The appearance of high-index crystal planes is beneficial to improve the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode, although the oxygen evolution potential of the electrode is not greatly improved. Cu-Zn co-doping produces synergistic mineralisation and enhances the ability to degrade AR18, and OH is the main active species. During the thermal decomposition of the coating, Zn induces Cu to form more active sites on the high-index crystal planes of SnO2, a phenomenon that may be responsible for the synergistic production of more reactive oxygen species on the electrode surface.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000849193900001

This work reports rational design and controllable fabrication of metal oxide hybrid catalyst CoNiFe2O5 center dot 2CuO with unique biphasic microstructures for electrochemical water splitting. Benefited from the presence of CuO nanoparticles as the second phase, more defects and active sites were formed around the interfaces of CoNiFe2O5 and CuO, which led to excellent performances for electrocatalytic water splitting. In particular, the catalyst exhibited outstanding activity for hydrogen evolution reaction with a small over potential of 30 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and showed a higher turnover frequency (0.3 s(-1)) than commercial catalyst Pt/C (0.1 s(-1)) under an overpotential of 50 mV. Moreover, it also displayed good activity for oxygen evolution reaction with an overpotential of 264 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Using CoNiFe2O5 center dot 2CuO as the catalyst for electrode pair to construct a cell, a very low cell voltage of 1.53 V is enough to achieve overall water splitting at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH electrolyte, and the cell could maintain the stable performance at 10 mA cm(-2) within 100 h. The as-prepared metal oxide hybrids with biphasic microstructures may have promising application potentials in water splitting. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

It was shown that the recombination activity of permeated oxygen and evolved hydrogen within the cathodic catalyst layer correlates with the activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) which was determined ex situ with linear sweep voltammetry. We found that the investigated PGM-free cathode catalysts had a low activity for the ORR resulting in higher measurable oxygen in hydrogen volume fractions compared to the PGM catalysts, which are more active for the ORR. Out of the three investigated PGM-free catalysts, only one commercially available material based on a Ti suboxide showed a similar good polarisation behaviour as the state of the art cathode catalyst platinum, while its recombination activity was the lowest of all catalysts. In addition to the recombination of hydrogen and oxygen on the electrocatalysts, we found that the prevalent carbon-based cathodic porous transport layers (PTL) also offer catalytically active recombination sites. In comparison to an inactive PTL, the measurable oxygen flux using carbon-based PTLs was lower and the recombination was enhanced by microporous coatings with high surface areas.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000721062900001		
J	Wu, Haitao; Sun, Wang; Shen, Junrong; Rooney, David W.; Wang, Zhenhua; Sun, Kening					Wang, Zhenhua/0000-0003-3476-0924			Role of flower-like ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets in water splitting and non-aqueous Li-O-2 batteries								NANOSCALE				10	21			10221	10231		10.1039/c8nr02376j				JUN 7 2018	2018	The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are both fundamental and essential processes for various energy conversion and storage systems. The kinetics of ORR and OER play a critical role in their energy efficiency and practicality. Here, flower-like ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets synthesized through a facile solvothermal technique were studied as a bifunctional catalyst for both water splitting and non-aqueous Li-O-2 batteries. Due to the novel structure and highly active {110} and {100} exposed facets, which can effectively facilitate mass transfer and enhance catalytic capability, Co3O4 nanosheets exhibit better stability and higher ORR/OER activity than Co3O4 nanoparticles, Co3O4 bulks, Pt/C, and RuO2 in alkaline solution. More importantly, Li-O-2 batteries with ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets catalyst can enhance the initial discharge capacity from 6400 to 8600 mA h g(-1) and improve the cyclability up to 160 cycles at 500 mA g(-1). Unexpectedly, XRD and UV/Vis techniques suggest that the main product in Co3O4 nanosheets based cathodes is LiOH, with resulting LiOH also demonstrating reversible formation/decomposition behavior, rather than Li2O2 in pure Super P based cathodes. Further investigation confirms that Co3O4 can also catalyze the electrolyte decomposition responsible for the formation of LiOH, and a reaction mechanism was illustrated. This work highlights that the traditional high-efficiency bifunctional catalyst in aqueous media may not be suitable for non-aqueous Li-O-2 batteries, and the effect of catalyst on electrolyte besides the discharge product should also be carefully considered for the design of more stable and practical Li-O-2 systems.									51	4	0	0	4	0	51			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000434313200046	29790548

Herein, Co2N nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on N-doped carbon from cattail were verified with excellent catalytic performances for ORR. The onset and half-wave potentials over the optimal catalyst reach to 0.96 V and 0.84 V, respectively. Current retention rates of 96.8% after 22-h test and 98.8% after running 1600 s were obtained in 1 M methanol solution. Density functional theory simulation proposes an apparently increased electronic states of Co2N in N-doped carbon layer close to the Fermi level. Higher charge density, favorable adsorption, and charge transfer of intermediates originate from the coexistence of Co2N NPs and N atoms in carbon skeleton. The superior catalytic activity of composites also was confirmed in zinc-air batteries. This novel catalytic property and controllable preparation approach of Co2N-carbon composites provide a promising avenue to fabricate metal-containing catalytically active carbon from biomass.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6				2575-0356		WOS:000682876400001

Here, an in situ formation of OER active NiFe2O4-NiOOH nanosheet arrays is demonstrated as a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst by the anodization of Fe2O3 domains anchored on Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet arrays. The as-converted product can deliver the current density of 30 mA cm(-2) with a small overpotential of 240 mV, and only requires an overpotential of 410 mV to achieve an amazing huge current density of 3000 mA cm (2). In situ potential-dependent Raman spectroscopy reveals that Ni(OH)(2) in the composite is easier to be oxidized to NiOOH than pure Ni(OH)(2), and the newly formed NiOOH reacts with the nearby Fe2O3 to produce hybrid NiFe2O4-NiOOH. It is found that the cooperative effect of the in situ formed NiFe2O4 and NiOOH as well as the hydrophilic and aerophobic electrode surface make main contribution to the outstanding OER activity of the catalyst. This work will bring new perspectives to the recognition of the origin of NiFe composite materials for OER and provide a mild method to synthesize amorphous spinel materials at room temperature.									91	10	0	0	5	0	91			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000401869700005

However, the activity and stability of single atoms and their interaction with support still remains a mystery. Here we show a stable single atomic ruthenium catalyst anchoring on the surface of cobalt iron layered double hydroxides, which possesses a strong electronic coupling between ruthenium and layered double hydroxides. With 0.45 wt.% ruthenium loading, the catalyst exhibits outstanding activity with overpotential 198 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1) for oxygen evolution reaction. By using operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy, it is disclosed that the isolated single atom ruthenium was kept under the oxidation states of 4+ even at high overpotential due to synergetic electron coupling, which endow exceptional electrocatalytic activity and stability simultaneously.									303	23	0	0	19	1	309			2041-1723			WOS:000464338100022	30979899

Thus, far, a measurement of kinetics constants for such processes is limited. In this study, scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is employed to investigate the charge transfer kinetics at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface in the feedback mode in order to simulate the oxygen evolution process in PEC system. The popular photocatalysts BiVO4 and Mo doped BiVO4 (labeled as Mo:BiVO4) are selected as photoanodes and the common redox couple [Fe(CN)(6)](3-)/[Fe(CN)(6)](4-) as molecular probe. SECM characterization can directly reveal the surface catalytic reaction kinetics constant of 9.30 x 10(7) mol(-1) cm(3) s(-1) for the BiVO4. Furthermore, we find that after excitation, the ratio of rate constant for photogenerated hole to electron via Mo:BiVO4 reacting with mediator at the electrode/electrolyte interface is about 30 times larger than that of BiVO4. This suggests that introduction of Mo6+ ion into BiVO4 can possibly facilitate solar to oxygen evolution (hole involved process) and suppress the interfacial back reaction (electron involved process) at photoanode/electrolyte interface. Therefore, the SECM measurement allows us to make a comprehensive analysis of interfacial charge transfer kinetics in PEC system.									32	3	0	0	2	0	32			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000369044100010	26720831

These materials have received renewed attention in the last decade due to its potential to substitute noble metals mainly in biomass and energy transformations, the decomposition of ammonia being one of the most studied reactions. The reactions considered in this review are limited to thermal catalysis. However the potential of these materials spreads to other key applications as photo- and electrocatalysis in hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. Mono, binary and exceptionally ternary metal nitrides have been synthetized and evaluated as catalysts and, in some cases, promoters are added to the structure in an attempt to improve their catalytic performance. The objective of the latest research is finding new synthesis methods that allow to obtain smaller metal nanoparticles and increase the surface area to improve their activity, selectivity and stability under reaction conditions. After a brief introduction and description of the most employed synthetic methods, the review has been divided in the application of transition metal nitrides in the following reactions: hydrotreatment, oxidation and ammonia synthesis and decomposition.									42	1	0	0	0	0	42				2079-4991		WOS:000483604500024	31382459

Herein, a hydrothermally designed oxygen-defective Sm2O3/Fe2O3 composite with gyroid morphology provides superior active sites with high porosity and mass charge transport in a catalytic system. All of the fabricated materials were characterized via different analytical techniques. The Sm2O3/Fe2O3 hierarchical composite displays an outstanding lower overpotential (272 mV) to attain a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and a lower Tafel slope (75 mV/dec) compared to the individual materials Sm2O3 and Fe2O3 in alkaline media. The remarkable electrocatalytic intrinsic OER performance of oxygen-defective Sm2O3/Fe2O3 is ascribed to the strong synergistic effect among both materials due to their unique gyroid structure, and such architecture exhibits extraordinary electrical properties due to its porous structure. Hierarchical Sm2O3/Fe2O3 exhibits marvelous activity and stability at an applied potential (0.7 V) with a slight decrease in current density. All of the extraordinary results acquired from electrochemical activity make Sm2O3/Fe2O3 a promising electrocatalyst for electrochemical energy generation.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000716453500058

In both glass series, paramagnetic defects concentration shows a non-linear variation with Na content. The defect nature is also affected and more particularly boron oxygen hole center versus oxygen hole center relative proportion. By Raman spectroscopy, we show that polymerization increases and molecular oxygen production, linked to the alkali migration, was minimized for some irradiated glass compositions. Mixed alkali effect blocks structural changes under electron irradiation in Na/Li glasses while for Na/K glasses, structural evolutions were smaller than in pure alkali glasses but non-completely annihilated.

However, unavoidable factors such as degree of oxidation of TMSs have been hardly considered for the origin of this catalytic activity of TMS-graphene composites. To accomplish the reliable application of TMS-based electrocatalytic materials, a clear understanding of the thermodynamic stability of TMS and effects of oxidation on catalytic activity is necessary. In addition, the mechanism of charge transfer at the TMS-graphene interface must be studied in depth to properly design composite materials. Herein, we report a comprehensive study of the physical chemistry at the junction of a Co1-xNixS2-graphene composite, which is a prototype designed to unravel the mechanisms of charge transfer between TMS and graphene. Specifically, the thermodynamic stability and the effects of oxidation of TMSs during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the reaction mechanism are systematically investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental observations. Cobalt atoms anchored on pyridinic N sites in the graphene support form metal semiconductor (SC) junctions, and the internal band bending at these junctions facilitates electron transfer from TMSs to graphene. The junction enables fast sinking of the excess electron from OH- adsorbate. Partially oxidized amorphous TMS layers formed during the OER can facilitate adsorption and desorption of OH and H atoms, boosting the OER performance of TMS graphene nanocomposites. From the DFT calculations, the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of TMS graphene nanocomposites originates from two important factors: (i) increased internal band bending and (ii) parallelized OER pathways at the interface of pristine and oxidized TMSs.									83	6	0	0	4	0	83			2155-5435			WOS:000431727300042

Here, NiSe/CP, Ni0.85Se/CP, and NiSe-Ni0.85Se/CP heterostructure catalysts with different phase constitutions are successfully prepared through in situ selenylation of a NiO nanoflake array oriented on carbon paper (CP) by tuning the original Ni/Se molar ratio of the raw materials. The relationship between the crystal phase component and electrocatalytic activity is systematically studied. Benefiting from the synergetic effect of the intrinsic metallic state, facile charge transport, abundant catalytic active sites, and multiple electrolyte transmission paths, the optimized NiSe-Ni0.85Se/CP exhibits a remarkably higher catalytic activity for both the HER and OER than single-phase NiSe/CP and Ni0.85Se/CP. A current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.62 V and a high stability can be obtained by using NiSe-Ni0.85Se/CP as both the cathode and anode for overall water splitting under alkaline conditions. Density functional theory calculations confirm that H and OH- can be more easily adsorbed on NiSe-Ni0.85Se than on NiSe and Ni0.85Se. This study paves the way for enhancing the overall water splitting performance of nickel selenides by fabricating heterophase junctions using nickel selenides with different phases.									135	4	0	0	1	0	135			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000435952100011	29806149

In this study, a novel catalyst derived from a porous interconnected network of nickel cobalt oxysulfide interfacial assembled Cu@Cu2S nanowires was rationally designed. It was recognized that the formation of multi-integrated active centers and a higher number of active sites, together with an adjusted adsorption energy towards reactants caused by the modulated surface and crystalline distortion of the NiCo oxide layer due to S insertion synergistically promoted both HER and OER. In addition, such 3D innovative core-shell structure effectively fine-tuned conductive properties and maximized interfacial contact to improve charge/mass transfer, thereby boosting catalytic activity and durability towards hydrogen and oxygen evolution. The catalyst only required an overpotential of 203 mV to achieve a current response of 20 mA cm(-2)for the HER and 295 mV to reach 50 mA cm(-2)for the OER in 1.0 M KOH medium. A developed electrolyzer enabled a small cell voltage of 1.61 V at 20 mA cm(-2)without performance decay upon long-term operation. This result suggested an exciting prospect for developing new bifunctional electrocatalysts, which could effectively accelerate both hydrogen and oxygen evolution for water splitting applications.									24	1	0	0	2	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000553632500033

The evolution of the functional groups and microscopic morphology of condensed phase were also analyzed by infrared spectroscopy (IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The semi quantitative research was realized by calculating the absorption peak area of IR, proximate and ultimate analyses. Results show that the oxygen concentration influences both the pyrolysis and combustion stages of asphalt, and the influence on the combustion of heavy components is more significant. With the decrease of oxygen concentration, the residual mass after the combustion of asphalt binder increases. Additionally, the temperature zone of combustion shifts higher, and a thermal reaction lag effect becomes more obvious. The concentration of oxygen only changes the concentration of gaseous products, instead of the types. Moreover, the concentrations of CO2, CO, H2O, SO2, etc. all decrease, and there is the biggest drop in CO2. The low oxygen concentration inhibits the dehydrogenation reaction of asphalt in the aerobic pyrolysis stage, while the complete combustion of asphalt residues is inhibited in the combustion of heavy components stage. These will all provide more scientific basis for the analysis of asphalt combustion under low oxygen conditions in tunnel fires.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0165-2370	1873-250X		WOS:000720124100004

In this article the propulsion performance of POM propellant under the constraint of a cylindrical tube-type thruster in atmospheric and nitrogen environments, respectively, has been conducted experimentally. The results indicate that the ablation masses of a single pulse under two gas environments are close, but the momentum coupling coefficient C-m and specific impulse I-sp in atmospheric environment are higher than that in nitrogen environment, which demonstrates an exothermic reaction occurred between the ablation product and the environment oxygen. To learn the mechanism of CLP the molecular spectra for ablation products of POM propellant in atmospheric and vacuum environments are measured and analyzed, respectively, and it reveals that the final product in a vacuum is CH2O, while the final products are CO2 and H2O in the atmosphere. Then the chemical reaction, composition and chemical energy release have been confirmed in the atmospheric environment. By using Arrhenius finite rate chemical reaction model with the code Fluent the flow field evolution of ablation product was simulated numerically. The results show the intensity of chemical energy release is related to the contact and mixing degree of the ablation product and the oxygen in the atmosphere, mixing more fully, the chemical energy released more intensively.					2nd International Symposium on Laser Interaction with Matter (LIMIS)2nd International Symposium on Laser Interaction with Matter (LIMIS)	SEP 09-12, 2012SEP 09-12, 2012	State Key Lab Laser Interact Matter; CIOMP, Publicat Dept; NW Inst Nucl Technol; Chinese Acad Sci, Changchun Inst Opt, Fine Mech & Phys; Chinese Opt Soc; European Laser Inst; Opt Soc; Shaanxi Opt Soc; Japan Soc Promot SciState Key Lab Laser Interact Matter; CIOMP, Publicat Dept; NW Inst Nucl Technol; Chinese Acad Sci, Changchun Inst Opt, Fine Mech & Phys; Chinese Opt Soc; European Laser Inst; Opt Soc; Shaanxi Opt Soc; Japan Soc Promot Sci	Xian, PEOPLES R CHINAXian, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0277-786X	1996-756X	978-0-8194-9639-3	WOS:000323339600002

O-1(2) was generated in the gas phase by the reaction of H2O2 with Cl-2, detected by its emission at 1270 nm, and bubbled into aqueous solution continuously. O-1(2) concentrations in solution were linearly related to the emission intensities of airborne O-1(2), and their absolute scales were established based on a calibration using 9,10-anthracene dipropionate dianion as an O-1(2) trapping agent. Products from O-1(2) oxidation were monitored by UV-Vis absorption and positive/negative ESI mass spectra, and product structures were elucidated using collision-induced dissociation-tandem mass spectrometry. To suppress electrical discharge in negative ESI of aqueous solution, methanol was added to electrospray via in-spray solution mixing using theta-glass ESI emitters. Capitalizing on this apparatus, the reaction of O-1(2) with methionine was investigated. We have identified methionine oxidation intermediates and products at different pH, and measured reaction rate constants. O-1(2) oxidation of methionine is mediated by persulfoxide in both acidic and basic solutions. Persulfoxide continues to react with another methionine, yielding methionine sulfoxide as end-product albeit with a much lower reaction rate in basic solution. Density functional theory was used to explore reaction potential energy surfaces and establish kinetic models, with solvation effects simulated using the polarized continuum model. Combined with our previous study of gas-phase methionine ions with O-1(2), evolution of methionine oxidation pathways at different ionization states and in different media is described.									12	1	0	0	5	0	13			1044-0305	1879-1123		WOS:000367014900007	26306590

The intercalation of Bi atoms into the IrSe2 framework regulates its electronic structure with the improvement of performance. Herein, novel bismuth inserted iridium-based selenide (BiIr4Se8) is synthesized via solid-state reaction. Interestingly, BiIr4Se8 exhibits impressive activities with dual functionality in pH-universal electrolytes. It achieves small overpotentials at 10mAcm(-2) toward hydrogen evolution (85mV in acid and 252mV in alkali) and oxygen evolution (379mV in acid and 364mV in alkali), which overmatches the benchmarking noble metal-based electrocatalysts. When served as the bifunctional electrocatalyst to drive a water electrolyzer, BiIr4Se8 affords 10mAcm(-2) at a voltage of 1.56 and 1.52 V-RHE in 0.5m H2SO4 and 1m KOH, far exceeding the Pt/C||RuO2 and other published materials. Theoretical calculations show that a narrow bandgap is obtained due to the induced intermediate band derived from the combination of the p orbitals of Bi atoms and structure reconstruction, which promotes the electrocatalytical performance. This research introduces a new strategy to design channel structures and sheds light on their applications for water splitting.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2699-9412			WOS:000783857000002

However, the sluggish OER kinetics at the anode severely hinders the H-2 evolution at the cathode which is a crucial procedure for energy storage. Herein, we report the synthesis of a new OER catalyst of Co(OH)(x)(WO4)yvia a one-step hydrothermal method, where the incorporation of WO42-</mml:msubsup> as a condenser greatly enhanced the electrocatalytic activity of Co(OH)(2) toward OER. Moreover, the introduction of mesoporous carbon (MC) further improves the electrocatalytic performance of Co(OH)(x)(WO4)y by forming the nanocomposites of Co(OH)(x)(WO4)y/MC. The synergism between Co(OH)(2) and WO42-</mml:msubsup> and the synergistic catalytic effect of Co(OH)(x)(WO4)y and MC majorly contributed to the apparently enhanced electrocatalysis of Co(OH)(x)(WO4)y/MC toward OER. This work provides an efficient strategy to improve the electrocatalytic activity of Co(OH)(2) by introducing WO42- and forming nanocomposites between Co(OH)(x)(WO<mml:msub>4<mml:msub>)y and MC for low-cost, convenient and highly efficient water oxidation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0218-625X	1793-6667		WOS:000612482900007

A novel and highly efficient electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in a wide pH range was synthesized via the electroless plating of FeCoNiB alloy nanoparticles on B-doped vertically aligned graphene arrays (FeCoNiB@B-VG). FeCoNiB@B-VG exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performances with a low overpotential of 31 mV in 1.0 M KOH and 148 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and an overpotential of 387 mV in 1.0 M KOH for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It also exhibited a quite low Tafel slope value of 30 mV dec(-1) and 51 mV dec(-1) for HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH respectively. In addition, FeCoNiB@B-VG also exhibited good long-term stabilities in acidic and alkaline electrolytes as a self-supported bifunctional electrocatalyst. This work may provide theoretical and technical support for design of cost-effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in a wide pH range. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, developing highly active electrocatalysts for long-term durable organic upgrading with high selectivity at large and steady current density remains challenging. Herein, hollow NiSe nanocrystals heterogenized with carbon nanotubes (h-NiSe/CNTs) are fabricated via a facile one-pot approach. The highly dispersed h-NiSe/CNTs 3D network can efficiently facilitate rapid mass/electron diffusion, thus achieving highly active and long-term stable electrocatalysis for catalyzing methanol to value-added formate at high and steady current density (approximate to 345 mA cm(-2)) with high Faradaic efficiency (>95%). This reaction replaces sluggish OER performance to reduce the energy consumption for boosting H-2 generation by six times. The critical active species and methanol activation mechanism are systematically studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption fine structure analysis, in situ Raman, and density functional theory calculations, indicating that the non-ignorable SeOx collaborated with in situ formed Ni-OOH species can synergistically modulate the d band center to achieve an optimal adsorption for methanol selective oxidation and suppress the further oxidation to CO2, thus leading to active and stable electrolysis for producing value-added formate with high selectivity and co-generating H-2 with less energy consumption.									27	2	0	0	3	0	27			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000594110900001

Therefore, in this report, we synthesized nickel, copper, and cobalt core and palladium shell nanostructure supported on nitrogen, sulfur-doped reduced graphene oxide (M@Pd/N, S-rGO, M=Ni, Cu, Co) by hydrothermal method followed by reduction of the metal nanoparticles using modified polyol method. Using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, High resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the physicochemical properties of the synthesized sample was investigated. The results confirm strong interactions between M@Pd and higher surface area support that could enhance electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

The carbons (AC) with introduced Fe, Ni and Co species of hierarchical porous structures were derived by pyrolysis of melted poly (styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid) salts. The obtained materials were used as HER, OER and water splitting catalysts. Although all samples were catalytically active, their activity differed depending on the kind of metal. The most promising results were obtained on Ni-AC. An overpotential of Ni-AC to reach 10 mA cm(-2) was 259, 382 and 640 mV for HER, OER and water splitting, respectively. Mott-Schottky tests indicated that Ni-AC has p/n-type semiconductor features. While its n-type region was responsible for HER, the p-type region governed OER. A high dispersion of the nickel-based catalytic centers in the hierarchical pore system resulted in an efficient utilization of the active sites for the electron transfer processes. Besides the satisfactory performance, the advantage of the derived catalyst is in its simple synthesis from a commodity polymer. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The secondary electron donor, Y-Z, is Tyr161 on PSII reaction center D1 protein and mediates electron transfer from the oxygen-evolving Mn4CaO5\ cluster to the primary electron donor, P680. The latest PSII crystal structure revealed the presence of a hydrogen bond network around Y-Z, which is anticipated to play important roles in the electron and proton transfer reactions. Y-Z forms a hydrogen bond with His190 which in turn forms a hydrogen bond with Asn298 on D1 protein. Although functional roles of Y-Z and His190 have already been characterized, little is known about the functional role of Asn298. Here we have generated 19 mutants from a green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, in which the Asn298 has been substituted by each of the other 19 amino acid residues. All mutants showed significantly impaired or no photosynthetic growth. Seven mutants capable of photosynthetic growth showed oxygen-evolving activity although at a significantly reduced rate. Interestingly the oxygen-evolving activity of these mutants was markedly photosensitive. The 19 mutants accumulated PSII at variable levels and showed a light-induced electron transfer reaction from 1,5-diphenylcarbazide (DPC) to 2,6-dichlorophenolin-dophenol (DCIP), suggesting that Asn298 is important for the function and photoprotection of the Mn4CaO5 cluster.									17	0	0	0	12	0	17			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000339714800008	24853102

Herein, Mn3+ within pi-conjugated carbon nitride (C3N4) in form of Mn-N-C motifs is coordinated. The spin state (e(g) orbital filling) of Mn centers is regulated by controlling the bond strength of Mn-N. It is demonstrated that Mn serves as intrinsic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) site and the kinetics is dependent on its spin state with an optimized e(g) occupancy of approximate to 0.95. Specifically, the governing role of e(g) occupancy originates from the varied binding strength between Mn and OER intermediates. Benefiting from the rapid spin state-mediated OER kinetics, as well as extended optical absorption (to 600 nm) and accelerated charge separation by intercalated metal-to-ligand state, Mn-C3N4 stoichiometrically splits pure water with H-2 production rate up to 695.1 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) under simulated sunlight irradiation (AM1.5), and achieves an apparent quantum efficiency of 4.0% at 420 nm, superior to most solid-state based photocatalysts to date. This work for the first time correlates photocatalytic redox kinetics with the spin state of active sites, and suggests a nexus between photocatalysis and spin theory.									78	12	0	0	11	0	78			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000474073700001

Pt and IrO2 are considered to be the most advanced ORR and OER catalysts; however, these expensive precious metal catalysts hinder their extensive application in practical applications. Herein, a series of La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-based perovskite catalysts (La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-PEI, La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-Fe2O3, La0.8Sr0.2FeO3) have been created by sol-gel method to achieve highly efficient catalytic performance for ORR and OER and these perovskite oxides stand out with raw material availability to substitute noble metal as bi-functional composite catalysts. The superior ORR performance (the onset potential is 1.061 V and the half-wave potential is 0.672 V), significant enhancement of OER performance (the onset potential is 1.553 V and current density is 5.53 mA cm(-2) at 1.8 V) and the electron transfer number (3.69) of La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-PEI are significantly higher than those of two others, which benefited from the introducing of carbon in the preparation of perovskite, increasing the oxygen vacancy concentration on the surface of the catalyst, adsorbing more highly reactive oxygen species O-2(2-)/O-, and enhancing the ORR and OER performance of the catalyst. This article suggests that carbon introducing is a promising strategy to improve the electrocatalytic activity for ORR and OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000819283800006

For the first time, herein we have successfully overcome its weaknesses using defect engineering approach by creating oxygen vacancies in NiFe2O4. The existence of oxygen vacancy not only shifts up the d-band center, strengthens the adsorption of H2O, and thus provides more active catalytic sites, but also tunes the electron configuration and creates massive number of defective donor states in the band gap to facilitate charge transfer processes. The optimal defective catalyst showed significantly enhanced catalytic OER performance with an OER overpotential as low as 0.35 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of only similar to 40 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the impressive specific mass and area current density of 17.5 A g(-1) and 0.106 A M-2 at 1.58 V vs. RHE have been achieved, which are similar to 23 and similar to 36 times higher than that of defect free counterpart, respectively.

Electrochemical noise measurements determined by scanning electrochemical microscopy were used to characterize Cl2 evolution at gas-evolving electrodes (GEEs). Analysis of the electrochemical noise is a powerful method to evaluate the efficiency of the catalyst layer at a GEE. The high sensitivity of the developed measurement system enabled accurate monitoring of the current fluctuations caused by gas-bubble detachment from the electrode surface. Fourier transform analysis of the obtained current responses allows extraction of the characteristic frequency, which is the main parameter of the macrokinetics of GEEs. The characteristic frequency was used as part of a methodology to evaluate the catalyst performance and, in particular, to estimate the fraction of the catalyst layer that is active during the gas evolution reaction.									45	1	0	0	2	0	46			1864-5631			WOS:000310074200006	23001744

Analysis of the behaviour of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and oxygen evolution at low light (when only state transitions - measured as qN(t) - are present) and at high light (when only photoinhibition - measured as qN(i) - is increasing) showed that the parameter qN(t) represents quenching processes located in the antenna and that qN(i) measures quenching processes located in the reaction centre but which operate significantly only when those centres are closed. The theoretical predictions of a variety of models describing possible mechanisms for high-energy-state quenching, measured as the residual quenching, qN(e), were then tested against the experimental data for both fluorescence quenching and quantum yield of oxygen evolution. Only one model was found to agree with these data, one in which antennae exist in two states, efficient in either energy transfer or energy dissipation, and in which those photosynthetic units in a dissipative state are unable to exchange energy with non-dissipative units.									103	0	1	0	97	1	105			0166-8595			WOS:A1993LH78700007	24318873

Here we developed a lignin-assisted water electrolysis (LAWE) process by using Ti/PbO2 with high OER overpotential as the anode aimed at decreasing the energy consumption for hydrogen production. The influence of key operating parameters such as temperature and lignin concentration on hydrogen production was analyzed. Compared with alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), the anode potential can be decreased from 0.773 to 0.303 (V vs. Hg/HgO) at 10 mA/cm(2) in LAWE, and the corresponding cell voltage can be reduced by 546 mV. With increasing the temperature and lignin concentration, current density and H-2 production rate were efficiently promoted. Furthermore, the anode deactivation was investigated by analyzing the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests. Results showed that the anode deactivation was affected by the temperature.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2296-598X			WOS:000728968400001

J	Lai, Youfang; Jia, Xun; Chi, Yujie				lai, youfang/AAQ-4863-2021				Modeling the effect of oxygen on the chemical stage of water radiolysis using GPU-based microscopic Monte Carlo simulations, with an application in FLASH radiotherapy								PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY				66	2					025004	10.1088/1361-6560/abc93b				JAN 21 2021	2021	Oxygen plays a critical role in determining the initial DNA damages induced by ionizing radiation. It is important to mechanistically model the oxygen effect in the water radiolysis process. However, due to the computational costs from the many body interaction problem, oxygen is often ignored or treated as a constant continuum radiolysis-scavenger background in the simulations using common microscopic Monte Carlo tools. In this work, we reported our recent progress on the modeling of the chemical stage of the water radiolysis with an explicit consideration of the oxygen effect, based upon our initial development of an open-source graphical processing unit (GPU)-based MC simulation tool, gMicroMC. The inclusion of oxygen mainly reduces the yields of e(h) and H-center dot chemical radicals, turning them into highly toxic O-2(center dot-)-HO2 center dot species. To demonstrate the practical value of gMicroMC in large scale simulation problems, we applied the oxygen-simulation-enabled gMicroMC to compute the yields of chemical radicals under a high instantaneous dose rate (D) over dot(i) to study the oxygen depletion hypothesis in FLASH radiotherapy. A decreased oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was found associated with a reduced initial oxygen concentration level due to reduced probabilities of reactions. With respect to dose rate, for the oxygen concentration of 21% and electron energy of 4.5 keV, OCR remained approximately constant (similar to 0.22 mu M Gy(-1)) for D(i')s of 10(6), 10(7) Gys(-1) mu M Gy-1108 Gys(-1), because the increased dose rate improved the mutual reaction frequencies among radicals, hence reducing their reactions with oxygen. We computed the time evolution of oxygen concentration under the FLASH irradiation setups. At the dose rate of 107 Gys(-1) and initial oxygen concentrations from 0.01% to 21%, the oxygen is unlikely to be fully depleted with an accumulative dose of 30 Gy, which is a typical dose used in FLASH experiments. The computational efficiency of gMicroMC when considering oxygen molecules in the chemical stage was evaluated through benchmark work to GEANT4-DNA with simulating an equivalent number of radicals. With an initial oxygen concentration of 3% (similar to 10(5) molecules), a speedup factor of 1228 was achieved for gMicroMC on a single GPU card when comparing with GEANT4-DNA on a single CPU.									17	1	0	0	6	0	18			0031-9155	1361-6560		WOS:000611524300001	33171449

Herein, we design a hydrothermal-assisted biomimetic strategy to anchor CoS2 nanodots on heteroatom-doped carbon layer (CoS2@HADC). Numerous CoS2 nanodots and heteroatoms rich in N and S are in situ hybridized into the carbon layer in a homogeneously dispersed manner. The preparation procedure is quite simple and moderate, avoiding the high-temperature annealing step. The optimized hybrid not only act as effective electrocatalyst, in which overpotential of 226 my is enough to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 56 mV Dec(-1) during the OER process, but also serve as electrode material with specific capacitance of 565 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1) for high-performance supercapacitor, compared with CoS2 (176 F g(-1)). Also, it exhibits superior cycling activity (similar to 100% capability retention after 10000 cycles at 2 A g(-1) in 6.0 M KOH) and remains a 57% high rate capability (320 F g(-1) at 5 A g(-1)). The rational design concept for cobalt sulfides/heteroatomdoped carbon hybrid provide a simple strategy towards superior energy conversion and storage devices.									33	1	0	0	1	0	33			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000483408400040

However, the conversion efficiency suffers great restriction due to the rapid recombination of charge carriers. Rational designed the structure and doping elements become important alternative routes to improve the performance of photocatalyst. In this work, we rational designed oxygen-doped graphitic carbon nitride (OCN) nanotubes derived from supermolecular intermediates for photocatalytic water splitting. The as prepared OCN nanotubes exhibit an outstanding hydrogen evolution rate of 73.84 mu mol h(-1), outperforming the most of reported one dimensional (1D) g-C3N4 previously. Due to the rational oxygen doping, the band structure of g-C3N4 is meliorated, which can narrow the band gap and reduce the recombination rate of photogenerated carriers. Furthermore, the hollow nanotube structure of OCN also provide multiple diffuse reflection during photocatalytic reaction, which can significantly promote the utilization capacity of visible light and enhance the photocatalytic water splitting performance. It is believed that our work not only rationally controls the nanostructure, but also introduces useful heteroatom into the matrix of photocatalyst, which provides an effective way to design high-efficiency g-C3N4 photocatalyst.

Recently, complex solid solutions consisting of at least five different elements and often named as high-entropy alloys have emerged as a new class of electrocatalysts for a variety of reactions. The multicomponent combinations of elements facilitate tuning of active sites and catalytic properties. Predicting optimal catalyst composition remains difficult, making testing of a very high number of them indispensable. We present the high-throughput screening of the electrochemical activity of thin film material libraries prepared by combinatorial co-sputtering of metals which are commonly used in catalysis (Pd, Cu, Ni) combined with metals which are not commonly used in catalysis (Ti, Hf, Zr). Introducing unusual elements in the search space allows discovery of catalytic activity for hitherto unknown compositions. Material libraries with very similar composition spreads can show different activities vs. composition trends for different reactions. In order to address the inherent challenge of the huge combinatorial material space and the inability to predict active electrocatalyst compositions, we developed a high-throughput process based on co-sputtered material libraries, and performed high-throughput characterization using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and conductivity measurements followed by electrochemical screening by means of a scanning droplet cell. The results show surprising material compositions with increased activity for the oxygen reduction reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction. Such data are important input data for future data-driven materials prediction.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000668883600001

In this work, an Fe-doped NiSe (a mixture of hexagonal NiSe and orthorhombic NiSe) nanorod/nanosheet hierarchical array on Ni foam was synthesized through a one-step solvothermal reaction, which exhibits high and stable catalytic activity for both the OER and HER in alkaline solution. The optimal Fe-7.4%-NiSe only requires a small overpotential of 231 mV to drive 50 mA cm(-2), and can provide a large current density of 500 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 269 mV, and 1000 mA cm(-2) at 291 mV for the OER. Moreover, it can afford 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 163 mV, and 500 mA cm(-2) at 296 mV toward the HER. A water electrolyzer with two Fe7.4%-NiSe electrodes only needs a low cell potential of 1.585 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2), and 1.74 V to reach 100 mA cm(-2) with great stability.

However, the sluggish oxygen reduction/ evolution reaction, the huge volume change from O-2/Li2O2 conversion and the undesired electrolyte decomposition in cathode limit their performance. Herein we show design and synthesis of RuO2-coated ordered mesoporous carbon nanofiber arrays by using a natural crab shell template as a catalyst for Li-O-2 battery, exhibiting several advantage features. First, the ordered mesopores in nanofibers facilitate electrolyte penetration and electron/ion transfer. In addition, the macrosized voids between the nanofibers provide efficient buffer space for O-2/Li2O2 accommodation and improve O-2 diffusion. Furthermore, the uniform RuO2-coating layer alleviates undesired electrolyte decomposition and enhances the surface electronic conductivity. As a result, the battery displays high performance, including high capacity (20600 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1)), high rate (9750 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 1000 mA g(-1)) and long-life (300 cycles at a fixed capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1)).

Hereby, electrochemically stable Zn anode is successfully designed by manipulating nucleation process through the introduction of hydrophilic graphene quantum dots (GQDs). Notably, the enhanced binding effect of GQDs with Zn2+ is aroused from the lower electronegativity of GQDs, which is conducive to accelerating uniform Zn deposition, resulting in the robust Zn anode without dendrites. Concomitantly, interfacial hydrogen bonds are excited by the GQDs with oxygen-containing groups, which is beneficial for mitigating water-induced side reaction and improving Zn ion reaction kinetics. Greatly, polarization voltage of symmetric cells is decreased from 80 to 50 mV at 0.8 mA cm-2, presenting a prolonged lifespan of 2200 h. As a result, the assembled ZIBs with vanadium cathode exhibit superior performance with capacity of 164.3 mAh g-1 after 600 cycles at 1 A g-1. Given this, this elaborate work might inaugurate a potential avenue for rationally tuning the electrode/electrolyte interface evolution towards advanced aqueous batteries.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000722027200001

Materials were characterized for structural and electrocatalytic surface properties using FT-IR, XRD, TEM, BET, XPS, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and anodic Tafel polarization techniques. The crystallite size of oxides ranged between similar to 17 and similar to 41 nm. For electrochemical studies, oxides obtained in powders form were produced in the thin-film form on the pretreated glassy carbon (GC) support. It has been observed that among electrocatalysts investigated, the CoMoO4/GC electrode was the greatest OER active while that the MnMoO4/GC electrode was the least active. The OER produced low Tafel slopes, similar to 36, similar to 43 and similar to 46 mV respectively on FeMoO4, CoMoO4 and CuMoO4 while it showed the higher Tafel slopes on CrMoO4(similar to 57 mV), NiMoO4(similar to 71 mV) and MnMoO4(similar to 89 mV).

Herein, a facile electrodeposition-hydrothermal process has been used to fabricate mesoporous Ag-doped Co3O4 nanowire arrays supported on FTO (AgCo/FTO) for water oxidation in 0.5 M H2SO4. The role of electrodeposited Ag includes: 1) Ag film on FTO can direct the vertical growth of Co3O4 to form nanowire arrays; 2) Ag2O in AgCo hydroxides precursors contribute to the formation of mesoporous nanostructure owing to the pyrolysis of Ag2O in calcination process. XRD confirms the diffraction peaks of metal Ag and Co3O4. SEM and TEM images display that mesoporous nanowire arrays of Ag-doped Co3O4 are uniformly distributed on FTO, which introduces more exposed active sites and shorter electron transfer paths. AgCo/FTO show excellent OER activity with the onset potential of 1.91 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Besides, AgCo/FTO shows high stability at a constant overpotential of 370 mV for 10 h. So Ag-doping greatly enhances not only the conductivity but also the stability of electrocatalyst in acidic media. Therefore, Ag-doped transition metal oxides may be promising alternative mesoporous nanostructures for efficient OER in acid. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the most important goal for developing efficient photocatalysts for overall water splitting is to design photocatalysts for which the valence band edge is sufficiently less than the oxidation potential of O-2/H2O to meet the thermodynamic requirements of the OER. This is addressed in the present work by applying first-principles density functional theory calculations to systematically investigate the effect of B, N-codoping on the electronic band structure, thermal stability, dynamic stability, and optical properties of two-dimensional graphdiyne monolayers, which is a relatively new carbon allotrope consisting of sp- and sp(2)-hybridized carbon atoms that provides a bandgap of similar to 1.0 eV. The results indicate that the bandgap energy increases with an increasing number of BN pair substitutions and that some of the B, N-codoped graphdiyne configurations representative of a BCN ternary structure provide direct bandgaps with energies of 2-3 eV appropriate for visible light absorption. Moreover, the valence and conduction band edges are appropriately matched with the oxidation and reduction potentials of water. We also demonstrate that the optimal B, N-codoped graphdiyne monolayers have excellent charge carrier mobilities and provide good separation between photogenerated electrons and holes.									26	2	0	0	2	0	26			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000526396900017		
J	Godfrey, Linda V.; Falkowski, Paul G.								The cycling and redox state of nitrogen in the Archaean ocean								NATURE GEOSCIENCE				2	10			725	729		10.1038/NGEO633				OCT 2009	2009	Organisms that produce oxygen through photosynthesis existed during the late Archaean eon, about 2,500 million years ago, but controversial evidence suggests that they may have evolved several hundred million years earlier. Oxygen is expected to react with oceanic nitrogen, altering its redox state. The reaction leaves a signature in the isotopic composition of the nitrogen bound in organic matter. Here we present a record of the nitrogen isotopic composition of kerogen extracted from minimally altered shales from the Campbellrand-Malmani platform in South Africa. Between the Palaeo-Archaean and about 2,670 million years ago, the delta N-15 values of the kerogen rose by about 2 parts per thousand. We interpret this increase as an indication of the onset of coupled nitrification and denitrification or anammox reactions in the surface oceans, which require the presence of free oxygen. A second increase in nitrogen isotopic composition around 2,520 million years ago implies instability of the N cycle with loss of fixed N. This evidence for available oxygen in the oceans occurs at least 200 million years before geochemical indications of the presence of significant levels of atmospheric oxygen. We suggest that coupled nitrification and denitrification drove the loss of fixed inorganic nitrogen, leading to nitrogen limitation, and conclude that the low levels of biologically available nitrogen limited the growth of oxygen-producing plankton, delaying the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.									158	7	0	0	66	0	164			1752-0894	1752-0908		WOS:000270355000020

Designing efficient and stable electrocatalysts, which has been recognized as one of the primary goals for anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), provides the most prospective route towards mass production of hydrogen from renewable sources. In this paper, 3D-networked, ultrathin, and crossed nanowires NiCo2S4 grown on Ni foam (NF) was successfully synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method and worked as a unprecious metal-based overall water splitting electrocatalyst. NiCo2S4/NF possess predominant catalytic activity with an overpotential of 251 mV to drive a current density of 40 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media and 191 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Moreover, NiCo2S4/NF||NiCo2S4/NF was constructed by employing NiCo2S4/NF as both the cathode and anode, the overall water splitting electrolyzer results revealed that only 1.59 V was required to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Notably, NiCo2S4/NF ||NiCo2S4/NF also shows long-term electrochemical durability with its activity being retained for over 12 h-long. The newly developed cost-effective high efficent electrocatalyst towards water splitting provides a novel approach for the design of earth-abundant transition metal sulfide for high efficiency overall water splitting electrode.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2365-6549			WOS:000457441400009

However, traditional fabrication methods such as electron-beam lithography and stereolithography are usually costly and time-consuming, precluding their production on a large scale. Herein, for the first time the ultrafast laser direct writing is combined with external magnetic field (MF) to massively produce graphene-coated ultrafine cobalt nanoparticles supported on 3D porous carbon using metal-organic framework crystals as precursors (5 x 5 cm(2) with 10 s). The MF-confined picosecond laser scribing not only reduces the metal ions rapidly but also aligns the NPs in ultrafine and evenly distributed order (from 7.82 +/- 2.37 to 3.80 +/- 0.84 nm). approximate to 400% increment of N-Q species within N compositionis also found as the result of the special MF-induced laser plasma plume. (). The importance of MF is further exmined by electrochemical water-splitting tests. Significant overpotential improvements of 90 and 150 mV for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction are observed, respectively, owing to the MF-induced alignment of the NPs and controlled elemental compositions. This work provides a general bottom-up approach for the synthesis of metamaterials with high outputs yet a simple setup.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2				2198-3844		WOS:000713199300001	34723428

However, the low Na+ transport kinetics, oxygen-redox reactions, and irreversible structural evolution at high-voltage areas hinder its practical application. Herein, a comprehensive study of a microbar P2-type Ni2/3Ni1/4Mg1/12Mn2/3O2 material with {010} facets is presented, which exhibits high reversibility of structural evolution and anionic redox activity, leading to outstanding rate capability and cyclability. The notable rate performance (53 mA h g(-1) at 20 C, 2.0-4.3 V) contributed to the high exposure of {010} facets via controlling the growth orientation of the precursor, which is certified by density functional theory calculation and lattice structural analysis. Mg substitution strengthens the reversibility of anionic oxygen redox and structural evolution in high-voltage areas that was confirmed by the in situ X-ray diffraction and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy tests, leading to outstanding cyclic reversibility (68.9% after 1000 cycles at 5 C) and slowing down the voltage fading.

Herein, a trifunctional Ni(S0.51Se0.49)(2)@NC catalyst is designed and fabricated using a dianionic regulation strategy. Synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that simultaneous sulfidation and selenization can induce the electronic delocalization of Ni(S0.51Se0.49)(2) active sites to enhance the adsorption of *OOH/*OH intermediate for ORR/OER and H* intermediate for HER. The OER and HER mechanisms are revealed by in situ Raman spectroscopy. The Ni(S0.51Se0.49)(2)@NC exhibits trifunctional catalytic activity for the HER (111 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), OER (320 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), and ORR (half-wave potential of 0.83 V). The rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs) exhibit an open-circuit voltage of 1.46 V, a specific capacity of 799.1 mAh g(-1), and excellent stability for 1000 cycles. The water electrolytic cell using Ni(S0.51Se0.49)(2)@NC electrodes delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.59 V, and it can be powered using the constructed ZABs.

Therefore, it is extremely urgent and significant to develop an inexpensive OER catalyst with fast reaction dynamics, high efficiency and long-term stability. To address such issues, herein, for the first time, we present a novel vertical Fe(OH)(3)/Ni9S8 nanoarrays electrocatalyst that can rapidly fabricated on etched stainless steel (ESS) via a facile and swift electrodeposition process. The Fe(OH)(3)/Ni9S8/ESS exhibits excellent OER performance with ultra-low overpotential of 206 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) (far better than RuO2/ESS) and shows outstanding long-term stability. The terrific OER performance can be attributed to the integration of well-designed nanoarchitecture, and the coupling effect between Fe(OH)(3) and Ni9S8. The direct nanoarrays electrodeposition on highly conductive ESS substrate not only facilitate the rapid electron transfer for enhanced performance, but also improve the mechanical properties to ensure long-term stability. Additionally, the well-designed porous nanoarray guarantees abundant catalytically active sites exposure, facilitate the electrolyte penetration and promote the O-2 bubble release. Interestingly, the systematically fabricated Fe(OH)(3) outer layer can prevent the direct contact of Ni9S8 layer with alkaline electrolyte to avoid surface oxidation during catalysis. This work provides a systematic strategy to rationally design and facilely fabricate low-cost electrocatalysts with outstanding OER performance.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000690370600001

Boosting low-cost catalysts with trace amount of noble metals supplies a promising scheme. Herein, Ru nanoparticles decorated Co(OH)(2) nanosheet array on carbon cloth substrate (Ru-Co(OH)(2)/CC) is prepared via a two-step electrodeposition strategy. Trace Ru in the sample activates the bifunctionality of Co (OH)(2) in alkaline media. For oxygen evolution, the synergism between Ru and Co(OH)(2) can generate abundant oxygen vacancies for much improved catalysis activity, achieving low overpotential of 203 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). For hydrogen evolution, Ru endows Co(OH)(2) with Pt-like catalysis activity, for instance, the exchange current density of 1.32 mA cm(-2) for Ru-Co(OH)(2)/CC that is comparable to that of Pt/C (1.44 mA cm(-2)), as well as low overpotential of 55 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) that is close to that of Pt/C (35 mV). The excellent bifunctionality is demonstrated in a Ru-Co(OH)(2)/CC constructed two-electrode configuration. The robust catalytic activity (cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) with high durability of 60 his obtained for overall water splitting.

We demonstrate that a Ni-substituted surface + subsurface catalyst can favor the electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis with the maximum Faradaic efficiency by suppressing the HER compared to the previously reported catalysts for ammonia production.

Jorge				Victoria Tafoya, Jorge Pavel/GYV-4702-2022	Victoria Tafoya, Jorge Pavel/0000-0002-9070-4508			Enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction of boron-doped reduced graphene oxide via ultrasonic treatment								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				47	8			5462	5473		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.127				JAN 26 2022	2022	Commercial polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells have relied on scares Platinum to catalyse the kinetically sluggish oxygen reduction reaction occurring at their anodes. Over the last decade organic materials, frequently based on graphitic structures have been demonstrated as promising alternative electrocatalysts to the noble metals. Researchers typically utilize ultrasonic treatment as part of the synthesis procedure to achieve homogeneous dispersion of graphitic carbon prior to. Herein we investigate the implications of the structural and compositional changes induced by the ultrasonication treatment on boron-doped reduced graphene oxide for oxygen reduction reaction. It is shown that ultrasonication pre-treatment prior to the boron doping and reduction of graphene oxide via hydrothermal process step leads to the increase of both substitutional B and electrocatalytic surface area, with associated reduction of average pore size diameter, leading to a significant improvement in the oxygen reduction reaction performance, with respect to the non-ultrasonicated material. It is proposed that the higher degree of substitutional doping of boron is a result of formation of the additional epoxy functionalities on graphitic planes, which act as a doping site for boric acid.

Considering the fact that surface local structures affect the photocatalytic activity, the activity may be changed by the surface roughening. In this paper, the photocatalytic activities for oxygen evolution of the roughened and atomically flat TiO2 single-crystal electrodes in acidic and alkaline solutions were investigated. In the low pH (acidic condition) aqueous solution, the onset potential of the roughened TiO2 for oxygen photoevolution was shifted toward the negative side by 0.20-0.15 V from that of the atomically flat TiO2, whereas the shifts of the flat-band potential between them were much smaller than that of the onset potential. This result indicated that the activation energy for oxygen photoevolution of the roughened TiO2 was lower than that of the atomically flat TiO2. On the other hand, in the high pH (alkaline condition) aqueous solution, the onset potentials of both roughened and flat TiO2 were almost the same. This result implies that the oxygen photoevolution mechanism at the TiO2 surface in the alkaline solution was different from that in the acidic solution.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			1932-7447			WOS:000333005700039

However, further enhancing their catalytic activity remains challenging due to the difficulty in identifying active species and unfavorable architectures. In this work, we synthesized ultrathin Ir-IrOx/C nanosheets with ordered interlayer space for enhanced OER by a nanoconfined self-assembly strategy, employing block copolymer formed stable end-merged lamellar micelles. The interlayer distance of the prepared Ir-IrOx/C nanosheets was well controlled at similar to 20 nm and Ir-IrOx nanoparticles (similar to 2 nm) were uniformly distributed within the nanosheets. Importantly, the fabricated Ir-IrOx/C electrocatalysts display one of the lowest overpotential (eta) of 198 mV at 10 mA cm(geo)(-2) during OER in an acid medium, benefiting from their features of mixed-valence states, rich electrophilic oxygen species (O(II-delta)-), and favorable mesostructured architectures. Both experimental and computational results reveal that the mixed valence and O(II-delta)- moieties of the 2D mesoporous Ir-IrOx/C catalysts with a shortened Ir-O(II-delta)- bond (1.91 angstrom) is the key active species for the enhancement of OER by balancing the adsorption free energy of oxygen-containing intermediates. This strategy thus opens an avenue for designing high performance 2D ordered mesoporous electrocatalysts through a nanoconfined self-assembly strategy for water oxidation and beyond.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000766221400025	35099956

In this context, photoelectro-chemical cells effectively convert solar energy directly to H-2 fuel by water photoelectrolysis, thereby monolitically combining the functions of both light harvesting and electrolysis. In such devices, photocathodes and photoanodes carry out the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Here, the focus is on photocathodes for HER, traditionally based on metal oxides, III-V group and II-VI group semiconductors, silicon, and copper-based chalcogenides as photoactive material. Recently, carbon-based materials have emerged as reliable alternatives to the aforementioned materials. A perspective on carbon-based photocathodes is provided here, critically analyzing recent research progress and outlining the major guidelines for the development of efficient and stable photocathode architectures. In particular, the functional role of charge-selective and protective layers, which enhance both the efficiency and the durability of the photocathodes, is discussed. An in-depth evaluation of the state-of-the-art fabrication of photocathodes through scalable, high-troughput, cost-effective methods is presented. The major aspects on the development of light-trapping nanostructured architectures are also addressed. Finally, the key challenges on future research directions in terms of potential performance and manufacturability of photocathodes are analyzed.									65	2	0	0	10	0	65			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000460183000012	30221413

Herein, reticular Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets were synthesized on nickel foam (NF) by hydrothermal method and then ZIF-67 nanoparticles were uniformly deposited on Ni(OH)(2)/NF through chemical synthesis. After hydrothermal vulcanization, Co-doped Ni3S2 on NF substrate (Co-Ni3S2/NF) with trunk-branch three-dimensional composite structure was obtained, and it can act as a high-efficiency dual-function electrocatalyst to achieve full water electrolysis under 1 M KOH electrolyte. The Co-Ni3S2/NF displayed low overpotential of 240 and 120 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)) for HER and OER, respectively, and had long-term electrochemical durability in alkaline conditions. The excellent catalytic activity and durability of Co-Ni3S2/NF were attributed to the lattice distortion of Ni3S2 which was caused by the Co doping derived from ZIF-67. Meanwhile, the unique trunk-branch nanoarrays resulted in Co-Ni3S2/NF with multiple exposing active sites, rapid electron transfer and the diffusion of gases/ions. Particularly, Co-Ni3S2/NF displayed a voltage of 1.69 V at 50 mA cm(-2) as bifunctional electrocatalysts to the overall water electrolysis in alkaline electrolyte. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, the cathode processes regarding oxygen reduction and evolution are sluggish in terms of kinetics, which severely limit the practical battery performances. Developing high-performance bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is of great significance, yet to achieve better bifunctional electrocatalytic reactivity beyond the state-of-the-art noble-metal-based electrocatalysts remains a great challenge. Herein, a composite Co3O4@POF (POF=framework porphyrin) bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst is proposed to construct advanced air cathodes for high-performance rechargeable zinc-air batteries. The as-obtained composite Co3O4@POF electrocatalyst exhibits a bifunctional electrocatalytic reactivity of Delta E=0.74 V, which is better than the noble-metal-based Pt/C+Ir/C electrocatalyst and most of the reported bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts. When applied in rechargeable zinc-air batteries, the Co3O4@POF cathode exhibits a reduced discharge-charge voltage gap of 1.0 V at 5.0 mA cm(-2), high power density of 222.2 mW cm(-2), and impressive cycling stability for more than 2000 cycles at 5.0 mA cm(-2).									17	2	0	0	1	0	17			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000508016200001	31845530

However, the cost, operational efficiency, and long-term durability of the electrochemical water splitting rely on the choice of the electrocatalysts. Hence, developing a superior design strategy is an important criterion to establish an efficient and sustainable water splitting system. Herein, a sulphur-rich Co-NiO heterostructure encapsulated on N-rich carbon nanofibers (SCNO@N-CNF) synthesized via a simple and efficient electrospinning technique is reported. The three-way redox active centers, viz., the electron redistributed active Co-delta (-)-NiO delta (+) interfaces, S-dopant sites with modified electronic density, and the porous N-CNF matrix, makes the prepared electrocatalyst more efficient toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The SCNO@N-CNF electrocatalyst exhibits a low OER and HER overpotentials (eta(OER) = 247 mV; eta(HER) = 169 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, SCNO@N-CNF was analyzed as the bifunctional electrocatalyst in overall electrochemical water splitting, and it is found to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) at only 1.58 V. Thus, the design and engineering of multiple active elements in a single electrocatalyst is anticipated as an effective approach to establish an efficient and sustainable water splitting system.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2365-709X			WOS:000847931500001		
J	Bothra, Pallavi; Pati, Swapan K.								Activity of Water Oxidation on Pure and (Fe, Ni, and Cu)-Substituted Co3O4								ACS ENERGY LETTERS				1	4			858	862		10.1021/acsenergylett.6b00369				OCT 2016	2016	Co-based oxides have recently emerged as suitable electrocatalysts for the water oxidation reaction due to their low cost and high activity. Here, we present a comparative study of the electrochemical behavior of pure and metal ion -substituted cobalt oxides, Co3O4(110) and MxCo3-xO4(110), (M = Fe, Ni, Cu; x = 25% and 50%) in order to elucidate the effect of the cation distribution in the surface of the crystal lattice. We have used density functional theory calculations with on-site Coulomb repulsion of the energetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on these surfaces, and substantial work has been targeted to understand the relation between structure, mechanism, and activity. The activity of the substituted spinels increases relative to that of pure Co3O4, with a considerable decrease in overpotential values. This agrees well with the experimental findings. We find the activity of the Co-based oxides toward the OER is in the following order where we have considered that 02 evolution occurs at the substituent site: Fe Co3-xO4 (x = 50%) (0.77 V) > pure Co3O4 (0.76 V) > FexCo3-xO4 (x = 25%) (0.69 V) > Ni(x)So(3-x)O(4) (x = 50%) (0.61 V) > CuxCo3-xO4 (x = 50%) (0.56 V) > NixCo3-xO4 (x = 25%) (0.53 V) > CuxCo3-xO4 (x = 25%) (0.41 V). Our results indicate that 25% Cu-substituted Co3O4 has by far the lowest overpotential value of 0.41 V.									42	1	0	0	1	0	43			2380-8195			WOS:000389620400035

The prepared sample was characterized by a delafossite crystal structure without any other crystallized phases. The catalytic properties of Ag2CuMnO4 in oxidation reactions using molecular oxygen were investigated. High catalytic activity was found for Ag2CuMnO4 in the CO oxidation at room temperature, while ammonia oxidation occurred above 100 degrees C. Ammonia oxidation resulted in the formation of N2O/N-2 or NO/NO2 products depending on the reaction temperature. As a result of the reaction exposure on Ag2CuMnO4 during heating up to 400 degrees C, a modification of surface composition with preservation of the delafossite structure was found. Oxide Ag2CuMnO4 was shown to be operating in wet CO oxidation under ambient conditions. Obtained data emphasize that Ag2CuMnO4 can be considered as a novel and prospective catalytic material with a high potential of application for oxidation processes at low temperatures including ambient conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000730339200001

However, the practical OER suffers from sluggish kinetics and thus requires efficient electrocatalysts. Transition metal-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) represent one of the most active classes of OER catalysts. An in-depth understanding of the activity of LDH based electrocatalysts can promote further rational design and active site regulation of high-performance electrocatalysts. In this review, the fundamental understanding of the structural characteristics of LDHs is demonstrated first, then comparisons and in-depth discussions of recent advances in LDHs as highly active OER catalysts in alkaline media are offered, which include both experimental and computational methods. On top of the active site identification and structural characterization of LDHs on an atomic scale, strategies to promote the OER activity are summarised, including doping, intercalation and defect-making. Furthermore, the concept of superaerophobicity, which has a profound impact on the performance of gas evolution electrodes, is explored to enhance LDHs and their derivatives for a large scale OER. In addition, certain operating standards for OER measurements are proposed to avoid inconsistency in evaluating the OER activity of LDHs. Finally, several key challenges in using LDHs as anode materials for large scale water splitting, such as the issue of stability and the adoption of membrane-electrode-assembly based electrolysers, are emphasized to shed light on future research directions.									94	2	0	0	2	0	94			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000664683900001	34160484

This can be inconsistent with experimental observations that measure the collective properties of entire samples of structures that contain distributions or mixture of structures, even when synthesized and processed with care. Metallic nanoparticle catalysts are an important example. In this study, we have used a multi-stage machine learning workflow to identify the correct structure/property relationships of Pt nanoparticles relevant to oxygen reduction, hydrogen oxidation, and hydrogen evolution reactions. By including classification prior to regression, we identified two distinct classes of nanoparticles and subsequently generated the class-specific models based on experimentally relevant criteria that are consistent with observations. These multi-structure/multi-property relationships, predicting properties averaged over a large sample of structures, provide a more accessible way to transfer data-driven predictions into the lab.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0021-8979	1089-7550		WOS:000551877800001

The gold nanoparticles in the nanofilm are charged by Fermi level equilibration with the lipophilic electron donor and act as an interfacial reservoir of electrons. Additional thermodynamic driving force can be provided by electrochemically polarising the interface. Using these principles, the biphasic reduction of oxygen by a lipophilic electron donor, decamethylferrocene, dissolved in a, a, a-trifluorotoluene was catalysed at a gold nanoparticle nanofilm modified water-oil interface. A recently developed microinjection technique was utilised to modify the interface reproducibly with the mirror-like gold nanoparticle nanofilm, while the oxidised electron donor species and the reduction product, hydrogen peroxide, were detected by ion transfer voltammetry and UV/vis spectroscopy, respectively. Metallization of the soft interface allowed the biphasic oxygen reduction reaction to proceed via an alternative mechanism with enhanced kinetics and at a significantly lower overpotential in comparison to a bare soft interface. Weaker lipophilic reductants, such as ferrocene, were capable of charging the interfacial gold nanoparticle nanofilm but did not have sufficient thermodynamic driving force to significantly elicit biphasic oxygen reduction.

However, the chemical evolution of such element in the interstellar medium (ISM) is still far from an accurate characterization, with the chemistry of P-bearing molecules being poorly understood. To provide a contribution in this direction, we have carried out an accurate investigation of the potential energy surface for the reaction between the CP radical and methanimine (CH2NH), two species already detected in the ISM. In analogy to similar systems, i.e., CH2NH + X, with X = OH, CN, and CCH, this reaction can occur-from an energetic point of view-under the harsh conditions of the ISM. Furthermore, since the major products of the aforementioned reaction, namely, E- and Z-2-phosphanylidyneethan-1-imine (HN=CHCP) and N-(phosphaneylidynemethyl)methanimine (H2C=NCP), have not been spectroscopically characterized yet, some effort has been made for filling this gap by means of accurate computational approaches.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000630518100006	33557562

However, the activation between aromatic alcohol and O-2 (oxidant) over oxygen vacancies is rarely studied. Herein, the ZnIn2S4/MIL-121 heterostructure with abundant surface uncoordinated carboxyl was rationally designed for benzyl alcohol (BA) oxidation under visible light. Oxygen vacancies on catalysts were self-induced after the surface complexation between the uncoordinated carboxyl and BA molecules. Based on the reaction results, it is concluded that the oxygen vacancy activation to BA is more effective than that to O2 for BA oxidation over ZnIn2S4/MIL-121 hybrids. Specifically, when the activation fully occurs on BA (reaction in N-2), an admirable conversion of 93.9% (corresponding production rate of benzaldehyde: 2348 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1)) is achieved, which is 3.4 times that of pure ZnIn2S4, whereas an inferior conversion of 45.9% is obtained in O-2 due to the competition effect between O-2 and BA for oxygen vacancies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000787543300043	35195388

Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) porous CoS2/FeS-MOF with adjustable Co/Fe molar ratio are in-stiu grown on a nickel foam (NF) to get a binder-free electrocatalyst electrode for HER and OER (CoS2/FeS-MOF@NF). It should be emphasized that the MOFs precursor forms abundant heterogeneous interfaces through in-situ sulfidation. Moreover, the open skeleton and ordered porous structure of MOFs will not be destroyed due to the low temperature. The redistribution of electrons at the heterogeneous interfaces will produce more catalytic active centers, providing more active sites for reactant molecules or intermediates, thus availably promoting the electrocatalytic activity of the composite. Therefore, the optimized catalyst CoS2/FeS-MOF@NF-1 displays high OER activity. The overpotential is only 136 mV at 10 mA cm-2. At the same time, the CoS2/FeS-MOF@NF-1 also shows good HER catalytic activity. Therefore, the assembled corresponding symmetric electrolyzer CoS2/FeS-MOF@NF-1||CoS2/FeS-MOF@NF-1 achieves a low cell voltage of 1.5 V at 10 mA cm-2 with long time stability for 24 h.

Modulation of electronic structure of an electrocatalyst via heterointerface engineering represents an efficient strategy to improve its electrocatalytic performance. Herein, a feasible hydrothermal synthesis of a novel heterostructured catalyst was demonstrated, comprising CoS2 nanocubes and vertically aligned MoS2 nanosheet arrays directly grown on flexible and conductive carbon cloth (CC) substrate (denoted as CoS2/MoS2@CC). Thanks to the elaborate interface engineering and vertically aligned nanosheet arrayed architecture, the resultant self-supported CoS2/MoS2@CC electrode possessed enriched exposed active sites, modulated electronic configuration, multidimensional mass transport channels, and outstanding mechanical strength, thereby affording exceptional electrocatalytic performances towards the HER and OER in alkaline electrolyte with overpotentials of 71 and 274 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. In addition, a two-electrode electrolyzer assembled by CoS2/MoS2@CC required a cell voltage of 1.59 V at 10 mA cm(-2) with nearly 100 % faradaic efficiency and remarkable durability, showing great potential for scalable and economical water electrolysis.									29	1	0	0	2	0	30			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000589666400001	33179864

Electrochemical oxidation of N-2 to nitric acid using renewable electricity could be a promising alternative to bypass the ammonia route. In this work, we discuss the plausible reaction mechanisms of electrochemical N-2 oxidation (N2OR) at the molecular level and its competition with the parasitic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We suggest the design strategies for N-2 oxidation electro-catalysts by first comparing the performance of two catalysts - TiO2(110) (poor OER catalyst) and IrO2(110) (good OER catalyst), towards dinitrogen oxidation and then establish trends/scaling relations to correlate OER and N2OR activities. The challenges associated with electrochemical N2OR are highlighted.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000639536900001	34084445

Here we report an example where the reaction stereoselectivity was significantly affected by the catalyst crystal planes. In copper-catalyzed deoxygenation reaction of aromatic epoxides, copper cubes, wires, and plates gave the olefin products with different cis/trans selectivities, whereas homogeneous copper catalysts showed poor selectivity. Scanning tunneling microscope and density functional theory studies revealed that the different adsorption mode and higher adsorption strength of epoxide oxygen on Cu{100} plane were responsible for the observed variation of selectivity. The copper-catalyzed deoxygenation reaction provided new practical access to cis-olefins from readily available aromatic epoxides. Our work also indicated that nanocrystal catalysts may provide useful stereochemical control in organic reactions.									42	5	0	0	4	0	43			0002-7863			WOS:000351972000017	25778784

In particular, their ultrathin thickness endows them with ultrahigh specific surface areas and a relatively high surface energy, making them highly favorable for surface active applications; for example, they have great potential for a broad range of fuel cell applications. First, the state-of-the-art research on the synthesis of nanosheets with a controlled size, thickness, shape, and composition is described and special emphasis is placed on the rational design of multimetallic nanosheets. Then, a correlation is performed with the performance of multimetallic nanosheets with modified and improved electrochemical properties and high stability, including for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), formic acid oxidation (FAO), methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), and methanol tolerance are outlined. Finally, some perspectives and advantages offered by this class of materials are highlighted for the development of highly efficient fuel cell electrocatalysts, featuring low cost, enhanced performance, and high stability, which are the key factors for accelerating the commercialization of future promising fuel cells.									126	14	0	0	5	0	127			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000441712800003	29611858

It is shown that the properties of this material are highly dependent on the calcination temperature. The conductivity increases from insulator (titanium dioxide type) to metallic (titanium nitride type) when the calcination temperature rose from 500 degrees C to 1000 degrees C. When the catalyst material is calcinated at 700 degrees C, the rutile structure of titanium dioxide is obtained and agrees well with those obtained with the TGA-DSC results. These results also show that the structure of the osbornite of titanium nitride appears at 1000 degrees C. The BET surface area also increases with the calcination temperature. The morphology of the calcinated samples gradually breaks into smaller conchoidal fracture particles when the sample preparation temperature increases. Electrochemical voltage-current polarization curves of the oxygen evolution reaction in sulphuric acid on these anodes electrodes confirm that the materials calcinated at 800 degrees C or even at higher temperatures exhibit a low Tafel slope and a high electrochemistry surface area which are both known as good values for the oxygen evolution in acid medium. The results of this study suggest that our titanium oxy nitride prepared by an anhydrous sol-gel method followed by calcination is an interesting anode catalyst for water electrolysis. Its performance for this reaction is compared to those of some noble metal oxides. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Catalytic microtubes play simultaneous roles of the oxygen bubble producing microreactors and oxygen bubble-driven micropumps. An autonomous pumping of peroxide fuel takes place through the microtubes by the recoiling microbubbles. Due to optimal reaction-diffusion processes, gas supersaturation, leading to favorable bubble nucleation conditions, strain-engineered catalytic microtubes with longer length produce oxygen microbubbles at concentrations of hydrogen peroxide in approximately x1000 lower in comparison to shorter tubes. Dynamic regimes of tubular nanomembrane-based oxygen microbubble generators reveal that this depends on microtubes' aspect ratio, hydrogen peroxide fuel concentration and fuel compositions. Different dynamic regimes exist, which produce specific bubble frequencies, bubble size and various amounts of oxygen. In this study, the rolled-up Ti/Cr/Pd microtubes integrated on silicon substrate are used to study oxygen evolution in different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and surfactants. Addition of Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactants leads to a decrease of bubble diameter and an increase of frequencies of bubble recoil. Moreover, an increase of temperature (from 10 to 35 degrees C) leads to higher frequencies of oxygen bubbles and larger total volumes of produced oxygen.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2072-666X		WOS:000557416000001	32610688

Herein, the aqueous rechargeable Zn-N-2 battery, assembled by coupling the bifunctional cobalt phosphate nanocrystals-loaded heteroatoms-doped carbon nanosheets (CoPi/NPCS) as cathode electrocatalyst and the commercial Zn plate as anode with KOH electrolyte, was fabricated for the sustainable reduction of N-2 to NH3 and power generation during discharge process. Benefiting from the desirable active components of cobalt phosphate nanocrystals and the synergistic effect between nanocrystals and carbon substrates, the CoPi/NPCS catalyst exhibits the enhanced NRR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in alkaline electrolyte. And the cobalt phosphates are confirmed as active components through the associative pathway toward NRR. When measured in the flow battery configuration with gas diffusion electrode by flowing N-2 during discharge, this CoPi/NPCS-catalyzed Zn-N-2 battery enables the high N-2-to-NH3 yield rate of 14.7 mu g h(-1) mg(cat).(-1) and Faradaic efficiency of 16.35% at 0.6 V vs Zn2+/Zn, which can be able to maintain stable in discharge processes during cycling tests. Moreover, the impressive power output of the peak power density of 0.49 mW cm(-2) and the energy density of 147.6 mWh g(zn)(-1) are still achieved by this Zn-N-2 battery, which are both higher than those of previously reported Zn-N-2 batteries. This work not only provides the guideline for the rational design of robust and active bifunctional NRR-OER catalysts but also develops a reasonable and promising technology for efficient electrochemical N-2-to-NH3 and power generation.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000630398500055	33677963

However, they have inherently low electronic conductivity and high corrosive nature in alkaline media. Herein, we propose a promising and facile approach to improve the conductivity and charge transport of cobalt oxide Co₃O₄ through chemical coupling with well-dispersed multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) during hydrothermal treatment. The morphology of prepared composite material consisting of nanosheets which are anchored on the MWCNTs as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A cubic crystalline system is exhibited by the cobalt oxide as confirmed by the X-ray diffraction study. The Co, O, and C are the only elements present in the composite material. FTIR study has indicated the successful coupling of cobalt oxide with MWCNTs. The chemically coupled cobalt oxide onto the surface of MWCNTs composite is found highly active towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a low onset potential 1.44 V versus RHE, low overpotential 262 mV at 10 mAcm-2 and small Tafel slope 81 mV dec-1. For continuous operation of 40 hours during durability test, no decay in activity was recorded. Electrochemical impedance study further revealed a low charge transfer resistance of 70.64 Ohms for the composite material during the electrochemical reaction and which strongly favored OER kinetics. This work provides a simple, low cost, and smartly designing electrocatalysts via hydrothermal reaction for the catalysis and energy storage applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1533-4899		MEDLINE:33500090	33500090

In this context, development of outperform, stable, and durable electrocatalysts has been identified as one of the major objectives for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we offer facile approach for the deposition of few palladium oxide (PdO) nanoparticles on the cobalt-nickel bi-metallic sulphide (CoNi2S4) microstructures represented as PdO@ CoNi2S4 using ultraviolet light (UV) reduction method. The morphology, crystalline structure, and chemical composition of the as-prepared PdO@ CoNi2S4 composite were probed through scanning electron microscopy, powder x-ray diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. The combined physical characterization results revealed that ultraviolet light (UV) light promoted the facile deposition of PdO nanoparticles of 10 nm size onto the CoNi2S4 and the fabricated PdO@ CoNi2S4 composite has a remarkable activity towards OER in alkaline media. Significantly, it exhibited a low onset potential of 1.41 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a low overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Additionally, the fabricated PdO@ CoNi2S4 composite has a marked stability of 45 h. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has shown that the PdO@CoNi2S4 composite has a low charge transfer resistance of 86.3 Ohms, which favours the OER kinetics. The PdO@ CoNi2S4 composite provided the multiple number of active sites, which favoured the enhanced OER activity. Taken together, this new class of material could be utilized in energy conversion and storage as well as sensing applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000783984800001	35354121

By mixing with single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT), application of MnO2, Cr2O3 nano architects (Mn-Cr oxides supported SWCNT) was studied as active air electrode for Li-O-2 battery which is now expecting as a new rechargeable battery with large capacity. It was found that the synergy effects between two mesoporous metal oxides with SWCNT resulted in excellent electrochemical properties of air electrode. Prepared Mn-Cr oxide supported SWCNT can sustain stable charge and discharge capacity up to 150 cycles with 500 mAh/g without capacity degradation indicating outstanding catalytic activity for oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER). Consecutive cyclic voltammetry tests also showed excellent reversibility of formation and decomposition of reaction products of Li2O2. This could be resulted from large pore volume and ordered structure of Cr2O3 , MnO2/SWCNT air electrode. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the low energy efficiency caused by the high charging voltage greatly hinders their commercialization. Herein, potassium iodide (KI) is introduced to ZABs to change the oxidation pathway from the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to I- oxidation reaction (IOR) with faster kinetics and lower oxidation potential. Unexpectedly, the commercial carbon-based catalyst Pt/C with poor OER activity exhibits remarkable IOR activity. Benefitting from its high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, the fabricated ZABs deliver a low charging voltage of 1.68 V, high energy efficiency of 76.5%, and long cycle life of over 80 h at 5 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation is conducted to reveal the IOR catalytic mechanism of the Pt/C catalyst. This work will reverse the traditional mindset on catalyst selection from ORR/OER to ORR/IOR and boost the commercialization of rechargeable ZABs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000866214600006

Understanding how ARR proceeds along with transition metal redox electrochemistry is crucial for designing the next-generation high-energy-density cathodes. In this study, we use a Na2/3Mg1/3Mn2/3O2 (NMMO) thin film as a model cathode material for Na-ion batteries to study the oxygen redox reaction. We are able to control the orientation of the thin film using a pre-conditioning step of the Pt current collector layer and, thus, tune the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). Preferential orientation along the (001) direction prevents the extraction of Na+ ions from the lattice during charge. However, the randomly oriented NMMO thin films perform similar to the slurry electrode from powder. The characteristics of the electrode surface from XPS illustrate the evolution of CEI at different states of charge in the randomly oriented thin-film electrode. Our results show that the crystalline orientation can drastically affect the availability of the electrochemical reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000552662200105

Several fundamental challenges, including poor structural stability and monotonous fibrous morphology, greatly hinder their practical applications. To the best of our knowledge, supramolecular gel-derived carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have not been reported in the literature. Herein, we present a unique strategy for controllable fabrication of metal-confined carbon nanotubes (M/CNT) from the self-templated conversion of guanosine-based supramolecular gel (GSMG) nanofibers. Benefitting from the high tunability of GSMGs, it was demonstrated that the introduction of metal source (Ni and Fe) to improve the stability of the material and simply changing the KOH concentrations in the precursor materials, the structure of GSMG nanofibers derived active materials was controllably tuned from metal-constrained solid carbon nanofiber to hollow M/CNT. The optimized NiFe/B, N-CNT showed a superior oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 355 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). By taking advantage of the unique structural features of supramolecular gels, this strategy provides a simple and effective synthetic route for functional CNT. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yohanan, Eitan; Toroker, Maytal Caspary								The effect of interlayer stacking arrangements in two dimensional NiOOH on water oxidation catalysis								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				24	2			854	860		10.1039/d1cp05383c		DEC 2021		JAN 4 2022	2022	Electrolysis of water to produce green and renewable hydrogen fuel is of great interest in the clean energy field. Water molecules can be decomposed to hydrogen and oxygen through catalysis. Catalytic materials under electrochemical operation are subject to harsh chemical environments, and as a result mechanical changes may appear in the material. In two dimensional materials, the weak van der Waals (vdW) forces holding the layers together may cause a change in the stacking order of the material. The big challenge is to understand the effect of the interlayer arrangements of two dimensional materials on their catalytic performance. In this research we use Density Functional Theory in order to explore the catalytic performance of beta-NiOOH, a two dimensional material that is one of the best known catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), under different displacements. Our results indicate that changes in the structural stacking of NiOOH could affect the catalytic properties of the system. Particularly, we find that small shifts between the layers enhance the OER activity by reducing the overpotential down to 240 [mV] due to the formation of an unstable state and the formation of new vdW bonds between the layers. The potential ability to lower the overpotential of NiOOH could give exceptional results in increasing the efficiency of the OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000730285800001	34908058

The feature of this reaction was different from titanosilicate, although the tetra-alkoxide structure of titanium alkoxides is similar to titanosilicate. Other titanium complexes with titanyl or peroxo-titanium groups were not effective. This oxidation reaction proceeded in radical mechanism, t-Butoxyl radical formed from TBHP and titanium alkoxide started the radical reaction. The evolution of oxygen (the decomopsition of peroxide) and the abstraction of hydrogen from alkane to form alkyl radical occurred competitively. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Polarization curves at ''oxide-free'' Pt electrodes show two Tafel regions with slopes of ca. 0.120 V per decade and 0.160 V per decade, whereas the polarization curves at Pt electrodes coated with an oxide film accumulated by potential cycling at 0.3 V s-1 between 0.95 V and 2.00 V show a single Tafel region. The value of the single slope decreases steadily as the thickness of the oxide film is increased to reach a limiting value of ca. 0.090 V per decade for oxide coating thicknesses greater than 2 nm. Otherwise, hydrous Pt oxide coated electrodes show two Tafel regions; the first appears between 1.6 and 1.8 V with a Tafel slope which increases as the oxide coating thickness is increased; the second region in the 1.9-2.1 V range involves a Tafel slope of ca 0.088 V per decade which is independent of the coating thickness. This electrochemical behaviour is interpreted in terms of different oxide layer structures in which a fast redox electrochemical system is involved. This system influences the kinetics of the OER, probably through the formation of an intermediate species at the outer hydrous Pt oxide layer involving oxidation states of Pt higher than Pt(IV).									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0022-0728			WOS:A1994PK19900015

Herein, a novel series of bimetallic metal-organic framework (MOF) hybrid materials were successfully designedly fabricated through an in-situ growth and MOF-on-MOF strategies, namely as NiFeMOF/NF, NiCoMOF/NF, FeMOF/NiMOF/NF, and CoMOF/NiMOF/NF. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of bimetallic centers, conductive substrate and unique fabrication, they exhibit remarking electrochemical performance.

Herein, a novel Cu-Co-Se nanotube array supported on 3D copper skeleton was synthesized as high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting via a facile two-step hydrothermal method. The rationally designed Cu-Co-Se nanotube electrocatalyst exhibited good electrocatalytic performance, with overpotential of only 152 mV to generate 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction and a small overpotential of 332 mV to drive a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction. The good electrocatalytic performance was mainly due to the large electrochemical surface area and electronic coupling synergies triggered by the self-supported bimetallic nanotube architecture. The water splitting system assembled using Cu-Co-Se nanotube as cathode and anode only needed a cell voltage of 1.65 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with long durability of 50 h for overall water splitting. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations proved that the existence of electron exchange between the neighboring bimetals as well as the coupling between Cu, Co, and Se contributed to the improvement of the water splitting performance.

Herein, the three dimensional amorphous NiCoSxOy nanosheets arrays directly grow on Ni foam (NiCoSxOy NSs/NF) through a facile one-step electrodeposition is firstly reported. The special in-situ grown 3D nanosheets arrays, largely exposed active sites and enhanced electrical conductivity enable the resultant NiCoS0.14O3.25 NSs/NF to possess remarkable electrocatalytic performance and stability towards water splitting in 1 M KOH. Specifically, the introduction of S ligand into the hydroxides through a straightforward and convenient electrodeposition method boost the robust composition and comprehensive activity of the NiCoSxOy NSs. Such binder-free, easily prepared NiCoS0.14O3.25 NSs/NF electrode requires the overpotential of 250 mV and 170 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. When functionalizing as two identical cathode and anode in an alkaline electrolyzer, NiCoS0.14O3.25 NSs/NF displays the efficient and robust property on both OER and HER. Remarkably, serving as bifunctional electrode in alkaline electrolyzer, it only needs 1.64 V to reach the current density of 20 mA cm(-2). This study provides a valuable guideline to synthesize non-noble and efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts using a time-saving but facile electrochemical method.

Subsequent TPD measurements detected an enrichment of acidic surface groups with increasing duration of the HNO3 functionalization from 2 h to 24 h. A significant amount of H2O was released during the TPD experiments, yielding H2O evolution profiles which were deconvoluted into two Gaussian peaks at 162 degrees C and 228 degrees C. The combined analysis of the CO2 and H2O profiles indicates that desorbed H2O originates from chemisorbed water bound to carboxylic acid groups and from condensation reactions of carboxylic acids and phenols. Phenols and carbonyls were found to be reduced selectively by H2 during TPR, generating a pronounced H2O peak at 650 degrees C. A new peak in the CO2 evolution profile appeared at 575 degrees C in reducing atmosphere, which is assigned to the hydrolysis of anhydrides and lactones with subsequent decomposition. Thus, taking H2O into account is mandatory for a complete quantitative analysis of the decomposition mechanisms occurring during TPD and TPR experiments.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000663730300002

Most importantly, the CoFeB-5-30 NS/NF possesses a small Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1) and excellent stability with insignificant activity degradation after successive electrolytic measurement (for over 60 h) at 20, 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, respectively.

In this paper, we demonstrate the use of a rotational Raman-based spectrometer for non-invasive quantification of several gases (H-2, O-2, N-2, CO, CO2) with short analysis times (15 s), enabling high throughput screening. Furthermore, with this device, reaction progress can be monitored in situ, by real-time simultaneous quantification of multiple gases. We have applied this instrument and developed a method to study the O-2 dependency of a prototypic light-driven hydrogen evolution reaction, showcasing the value of this approach for the artificial photosynthesis community in general.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000848116100001

Here we showed a similar increase in the rate of oxygen evolution in PSII core complexes from spinach in solution and in proteoliposomes in the presence of trehalose. Using direct electrometrical technique, we also revealed that trehalose had no effect on the kinetics of electron transfer from Mn to redox-active-tyrosyl radical, Y-Z(center dot) (S-1 -> S-2 transition), while it accelerated the kinetics of electrogenic proton transport during S-2 -> S-3 and S-4 -> S-0 transitions of the water-oxidizing complex (WOC) induced by the first, second, and third laser flashes in dark-adapted PSII samples. These observations imply that the effect of trehalose occurrs due to its interaction with the WOC.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000430309200022

Our results unify some previously reported electrochemical data of Cp*Ir complexes by showing how the solution speciation determines the electrochemical response: cationic complexes show over 1 V higher redox potentials that their neutral forms in a distinct demonstration of charge accumulation effects relevant to water oxidation. Building on previous work that analysed the activation behaviour of our pyalk-ligated Cp*Ir complexes 1-7, we assess their catalytic oxygen evolution activity with sodium periodate (NaIO4) and ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) in water and aqueous (BuOH)-Bu-t solution. Mechanistic studies including H/D kinetic isotope effects and reaction progress kinetic analysis (RPKA) of oxygen evolution point to a dimer-monomer equilibrium of the Ir-IV resting state preceding a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) in the turnover-limiting step (TLS). Finally, true electrochemically driven water oxidation is demonstrated for all catalysts, revealing surprising trends in activity that do not correlate with those obtained using chemical oxidants.									13	1	0	0	2	0	13			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000446980600014	31007774

In this work, the lattice defect-rich NiS2/MoS2 nanoflakes (NMS NFs) electrocatalysts are successfully synthesized by a simple strategy. Benefiting from the abundant lattice defects and modulated interfacial microenvironment between NiS2 and MoS2, the prepared NMS NFs show superior catalytic activity for water splitting. Particularly, the optimized NMS NFs (the molar ratio of Ni:Mo = 5:5) exhibit remarkable catalytic activity toward overall water splitting with a voltage of 1.60 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media, which is lower than that of the noble-metal-based electrocatalysts (1.68 V at 10 mA cm(-2)). The NMS NFs electrocatalysts also show exceptional long-term stability (>50 h) for overall water splitting. The density functional theory results demonstrate that the injection of NiS2 into MoS2 can greatly optimize the catalytic kinetics and reduce the energy barrier for hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions. The work does not only offer a promising candidate for a highly efficient water splitting electrocatalyst but also highlights that interfacial microenvironment modulation is a potential strategy to optimize the catalytic kinetics.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2366-9608			WOS:000726291200001	35041283

In this work, we employed a solvent evaporation induced self-assembly method to prepare a novel S-scheme heterojunction composite by combining sulfur-doped porous graphite carbon nitride (S-pCN) with tungsten oxide (WO2.72) semiconductors which manifest effective interface contact and excellent photocatalytic performance. During the formation of the heterojunction, the electron defect state of surface oxygen vacancies on WO2.72 can be filled by the lone pair electrons of sulfur and nitrogen elements on S-pCN. Through the adjustment of composite ratios, appropriate surface oxygen vacancies were retained on WO2.72, thereby fascinate the migration of electrons and the generation of free radicals. The internal electric field (IEF) and the band bending effects accelerate the transfer of photogenerated charges at the interface, thereby promotes the recombination of useless photogenerated carriers, retains photogenerated electron (e(-)) and hole (h(+)) with the higher redox potentials, improves the separation and utilization efficiency of the photogenerated carriers and enhances the photocatalytic activity of the system. This work provides new insights for the design of a novel S-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst for highly efficient simultaneous photocatalytic degradation and hydrogen evolution activity.									187	14	0	0	24	0	190			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000620328900001

Surprisingly, both surface and inner oxygen atoms in nanoribbon can be effectively activated by Cr doping for hydrogen production. Its hydrogen adsorption free energy was reduced to 0.1 eV, much close to that of Pt metal. The binding capacity of inner oxygen with adsorbed hydrogen was related to its p(y+2 )band center level. Moreover, the dependence of amendatory hydrogen adsorption ability on the band center level was also proposed to understand the mechanism of strain engineering. These insights provide a potential approach for achieving high hydrogen production activity in oxide nanomaterials.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000618306100005

IrOx nanoparticles with a uniform size of ca. 2 nm were highly dispersed on these supports. The OER activities were evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in 0.1 M HClO4 at 80 degrees C using a channel flow electrode cell. The IrOx/Ta-SnO2 catalysts exhibited an apparent mass activity (MA) of 15 A mgIr(-1) for the OER at 1.5 V vs. RHE, which was 32 times higher than that of a conventional catalyst (mixture of Pt black and IrO2 powders). This suggests a possible reduction of the loading of the noble metal anode catalyst to a level as low as 0.1 mg cm(-2) at a voltage efficiency of 90% at 1 A cm(-2). (C) The Author(s) 2017.

Oxide layers were characterized by cyclic voltammetry in H2SO4 as well as in KOH solution. The voltammetric charge exhibited a maximum at 470degreesC in both cases. H-2 evolution from KOH solution was studied by steady-state polarization curves. Only one Tafel slope close to 40 mV was observed over the explored current range. The reaction order with respect to OH- was negative and fractional. A mechanism is proposed for H-2 evolution on RhOx in KOH solution. The stability of the electrodes was tested by comparing the voltammetric charge before and after the H-2 evolution experiments. Stability was observed to increase with increasing calcination temperature. The same is the case for the electrocatalytic activity normalized to unit surface charge.

Controlling the damage progression in oxidative environments is critical for enhancing the long-term durability of these materials. The surface oxidation of the material and the damage evolution in high-temperature polymer matrix composite materials (HTPMCs) are highly coupled mechanisms. In this article, three-dimensional, finite-element methods are used to simulate both oxidation layer and damage growth in polymers subjected to bending loads and laminated composites subjected to uniaxial tension. An oxygen diffusion-reaction model determines the changes in properties due to oxidation and chemical strains induced by oxidation. The damage growth is simulated using mesh-free extended finite-element techniques and suitable damage initiation laws. The damage evolution observed with simulations is seen to be consistent with experimental observations reported in the literature.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1047-4838	1543-1851		WOS:000313064800014

Herein, we demonstrate that with the assistance of photon-induced surface plasmon resonance excitation of Au nanoparticles, the iron oxyhydroxides (FeOOH) cocatalysts could serve as a unique " hole-depletion" layer for significantly promoting the PEC performance of single crystalline alpha-Fe2O3 photoanodes. The photogenerated holes can be efficiently extracted from alpha-Fe2O3 nanoflake to FeOOH layer, and promptly depleted by the injected hot-electrons from Au nanoparticles, while the hot-holes left behind on Au participate in the oxygen evolution reaction. Accordingly, the synergy of charge separation and hole transfer could be efficiently improved by the surface plasmon excitation on Au nanoparticles. As a result, the photocurrent density for the Fe2O3/FeOOH/Au photoelectrode without additional doping reaches up to 3.2 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE, and 6.5 mA cm(-2) at 1.6 V-RHE, with a low onset potential of 0.6 V-RHE under AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight, which is 2.5 and 5 times higher than for FeOOH modified and pristine alpha-Fe2O3 photoanodes, respectively. These results thus provide the basic of a new concept and strategy toward the design of more efficient PEC water splitting systems.									74	2	1	0	3	0	74			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000400647900020

Herein we propose a distinct molecule-selective fence as a promising concept to solve this activity-stability trade-off. The fence encloses the catalyst and prevents species poisonous to the catalyst from reaching it, but allows catalytic reaction-related species to diffuse freely. We constructed a CoS2 fence layer on the external surface of highly active cobalt-doped MoS2, achieving a remarkable catalytic stability towards the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction and improved activity. In situ spectroscopy uncovered the underlying molecular mechanism of the CoS2 fence for breaking the activity-stability trade-off of the MoS2 catalyst. This work offers valuable guidance for rationally designing efficient and stable NPM catalysts.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000743430300001	34931747

The model accounts for counterdiffusion and reaction of oxygen and organic substrate within the biofilm, and predicts detailed substrate concentration profiles and the evolution over time of biofilm thickness. Good agreement was found between model predictions and organic substrate flux and biofilm thickness measured experimentally in a lab-scale single-tube extractive membrane bioreactor. Analysis using this model showed that, due to oxygen diffusion limitations, the reaction zone within the biofilm is located at the biofilm/biomedium boundary and constitutes a small fraction of the entire biofilm volume. This allows a considerable simplification of biofilm modelling. A simple diffusion model was formulated as an alternative to the more complex full diffusion-reaction model for the calculation of organic substrate flux. This simple model is based on the insight that the organic compound flux is limited primarily by the biofilm diffusion resistance. The diffusion model was combined to a yield-based expression for biofilm accumulation to give the evolution over time of biofilm thickness. The simplified model predicts, as accurately as the full mechanistic model, the biofilm thickness and organic substrate flux. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is even more challenging because the generation of only one oxygen molecule involves the transfer of four e(-) and removal of four H+ ions from water. Thus, developing highly efficient catalysts to meet industrial requirements remains a focus of attention. Herein, the prominent role of Sn in accelerating the electron transfer kinetics of Ni5P4 nanosheets in OER is reported. The post catalytic survey elucidates that the electrochemically induced Ni-Sn oxides at the vicinity of phosphides are responsible for the observed catalytic activity, delivering current densities of 10, 30, and 100 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of only 173 +/- 5.2, 200 +/- 7.4, and 310 +/- 5.5 mV, respectively. The density functional theory calculation also supports the experimental findings from the basis of the difference observed in density of states at the Fermi level in the presence/absence of Sn. This work underscores the role of Sn in OER and opens a promising avenue toward practical implementation of hydrogen production through water splitting and other catalytic reactions.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000641284700015

Taking CO32--intercalated carbonate hydroxides as initial high-crystallinity crystals, controllable interfacial structure destruction was designed on the basis of surface-wetting invasion from Fe relevant Lewis-acidic metal salts. A spontaneous self-treatment course occurs via the in situ formation of an ultrathin lattice-disordered layer (similar to 7.5 nm in thickness) due to the interfacial hydrolysis of the escaped CO32- encountering positive-valence iron ions. As-obtained NiCoCH@Fe-OH, with Co(CO3)(0.5)(OH)center dot 0.11H(2)O@Ni-2(OH)(2)CO3 (NiCoCH) as the core and amorphous Fe(OH)(3) as the shell, shows excellent catalytic performance toward water splitting, with a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 221 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction and 233.8 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction in 1.0 M KOH. Assembling a two-electrode alkaline electrolytic cell, only 1.69 V is required to drive a current density of 50 mA cm(-2). This work merges structural destruction and in situ regeneration into a one-material system through a single-step surface-wetting strategy for precise surficial nanostructure design, and it displays a mild/scalable approach for high-activity catalyst development.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000800485600001

Therefore, developing next-generation electrode materials with high energy density is of the utmost significance. There are high expectations with respect to the development of lattice oxygen redox (LOR).a promising strategy for developing cathode materials as it renders nearly a doubling of the specific capacity. However, challenges have been put forward toward the deep-seated origins of the LOR reaction and if its whole potential could be effectively realized in practical application. In the following Review, the intrinsic science that induces the LOR activity and crystal structure evolution are extensively discussed. Moreover, a variety of characterization techniques for investigating these behaviors are presented. Furthermore, we have highlighted the practical restrictions and outlined the probable approaches of Li-based layered oxide cathodes for improving such materials to meet the practical applications.									36	2	0	0	1	0	37			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000645436800016	33792291

Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)											10.1039/d2dt02781j				2022-Nov-02	2022	Designing highly active and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is indispensable for promoting the sluggish reaction kinetics of OER to achieve low overpotential. RuO2 is one of the representative oxygen evolution electrocatalysts in acid electrolytes, but it still faces the problem of poor stability. Herein, RuO2 nanocrystal with an ultra-small size of approximately 3.5 nm loaded on N-doped hierarchical porous carbon (NHC) is successfully synthesized by RuCl3 dipping, followed by an annealing process. It is found that NHC is assembled of porous nanosheets with a high specific surface area (BET up to 2107 m2 g-1), which could provide more active sites for RuO2 loading and enable decorated catalysts to be effectively utilized. Combining the advantages of porous NHC and the high electrocatalytic activity of RuO2, the optimized electrocatalyst RuO2/NHC3 achieves a low overpotential of 186 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for acidic water oxidation with a Tafel slope as low as 60 mV dec-1 and maintains excellent long-term stability throughout the 27 h chronopotentiometry test in 0.5 M H2SO4. The elevated acidic OER activity and stability can be attributed to the diminutive size, abundant oxygen vacancies, and enlarged electrochemically active surface area of RuO2/NHC3. This work could provide opportunities to explore efficient anodic electrocatalysts in acidic media.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1477-9234		MEDLINE:36322012	36322012

Aluminium-air batteries, as an important type of metal-air battery, have been considered to be promising power candidates for flexible electronics. Here, we describe electronically engineered amorphous Fe-Co-S sites embedded in Prussian blue analogue (FeCoSx-PBA) hetero-nanoframes. The experimental results and DFT calculations reveal the critical role of the introduced FeCoSx layer to PBA, which enhances the electron transfer and alleviates the overbinding effect of OH* during the OER. The FeCoSx-PBA hybrid system supplies an optimized electronic structure for the alkaline OER, which is also confirmed by the much-lowered overpotential (266 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) for the alkaline OER. Furthermore, a flexible Al-air battery based on an FeCoSx-PBA cathode catalyst exhibits a high peak power density (58.3 mW cm(-2)) and energy density (1483 W h kg(Al)(-1)), and outstanding stability for more than 50 h of operation under bending or stretching conditions, demonstrating its potential in the practical application of flexible electronic devices. Our results may provide a new strategy of modulating the electronic structure of air electrode catalysts to efficiently promote the reactivity of alkaline OER and Al-air battery processes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000765458000001		
J	PYUN, SI; RYU, YG; CHOI, SH								CORROSION BEHAVIOR OF PLATINUM-CATALYZED CARBON IN PHOSPHORIC-ACID SOLUTION								CARBON				32	1			161	164						1994	1994	The effects of gaseous oxygen have been investigated on the corrosion behaviour of platinum-free and platinum-catalyzed carbon electrodes in 85% H3PO4 solution at 145-degrees-C by using linear sweep voltammetry in connection with FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopy at room temperature. Linear sweep voltammetry experiments were made in IM H2SO4 solution on the platinum-free and platinum-catalyzed carbon electrodes previously subjected to a constant applied potential of 0.7 V(RHE) in the hot H3PO4 Solution. The faradaic reactions on the catalyzed platinum were inhibited by the selective adsorption of iodide ions onto the platinum surface. The anodic current peak increased with increasing ageing time in the hot H3PO4 solution. Oxygen-blowing reduced the amount of the surface oxide and at the same time the rate of the surface oxide formation as compared to nitrogen-blowing. The results of the surface oxide amount determined by linear sweep voltammetry analysis were substantiated by FTIR spectroscopy. With recognition of the carbon surface oxide formation, followed by the CO2 evolution, it is suggested that the reaction products, such as water molecules, generated due to oxygen reduction on the dispersed platinum surface facilitate the CO2 evolution rather the surface oxide formation on carbon surface in 145-degrees-C, 85% H3PO4 solution at 0.7 V(RHE).									11	1	0	0	0	0	12			0008-6223			WOS:A1994MZ03100019

Herein, we propose an atomic interface strategy to construct a single atom copper catalyst (denoted as Cu-SA/SNC) which exhibits enhanced ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.893 V vs. RHE in alkaline media. Moreover, synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) investigations together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the isolated bond-shrinking low-valence Cu (+1)-N-4-C8S2 atomic interface moiety serves as an active site during the ORR process, and the synergistic mechanism between the Cu species and the carbon matrix at the atomic interface plays a critical role in boosting the ORR efficiency, by adjusting the reaction free energy of intermediate adsorption. This atomic interface concept may provide an alternative methodology for the rational design of advanced oxygen electrode materials and new probability to improve their catalytic performance.									157	15	0	0	6	0	158			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000501225900004

The fundamental steps involved in CLC are gas-solid reactions, i.e., metal oxidation and oxide reduction. Gas-solid reaction kinetics is important for CLC and has been studied by many researchers. Most research focuses on macroscopic behavior, such as the effect of the solid product on the pore structure inside particles. However, the nucleation and growth of the solid product is a critical step for the gas-solid reaction, and the growth mechanism of the solid product is still not clear. In this work, the nucleation and growth process of the solid product (iron oxides) in different oxidation stages of the Fe in CLC was studied. The rate equation theory considering surface reaction and diffusion, the nucleation and growth of solid products, and Ostwald ripening was used to analyze the evolution of island density with time and its effect on the kinetics of Fe oxidation. The oxidation time, the reaction temperature, and the oxygen concentration were considered. It was found that the solid product appeared as dispersed, three-dimensional islands. At the beginning of the reaction, the islands were small and densely distributed on the reactant surface. As the oxidation time increased, the size of the islands became larger, while the density decreased at first, then increased. The temperature increase caused the islands to grow in size while the distribution of the islands grew sparser. The O-2 concentration only influenced the island density. The nucleation or growth of the islands changed the surface morphology of the solid product, and decreased the apparent reaction rate. The reaction kinetics was greatly influenced by the arrangement of the solid product. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The electron transfer between the Ti metal center and the oxygen atom of the coordinated water is demonstrated to regulate the interconvertible forms by oxidation/reduction reactions and concomitant abstraction of hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals. In the presence of hydrogen radical scavenger (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO), the hydrogen evolution reaction triggers instantaneously the concerted electron transfer from Ti3+ to the hydroxyl radical, which leads to the formation of extremely stable Ti-4-OH- configuration, significantly lowering the barrier of O-H bond fission. As a result, the reverse electron transfer only can be launched through the UV light-driven electron promotion from the OH- moiety to the Ti4+ center, restoring the reduction state of Ti3+ complex. The oxygen evolution reaction occurs effectively in the high energy of (1)nd state, completing the overall water splitting. The design strategy based on the proposed mechanism can be inferred to require generally the compromise between the oxidation and reduction abilities of the metal-based photocatalysts for the light-driven overall water splitting.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000442462400025

Herein, ternary CoFe1-XMnX (0 < X < 1) layered double hydroxides (LDHs) grown on nickel form (NF) with nanosheet-nanowires (1D/2D) hierarchical nanostructure are synthesized. The introduction of Mn causes the change of crystal phase, morphology, and electronic structure of CoFe-LDH through electron transfer from Co/Fe to Mn, which provides the whole merit structural features and synergistic effect. Further experimental results exhibit that CoFe0.75Mn0.25-LDH possesses superior OER performance, which only requires overpotentials of 243 and 298 mV to reach 20 and 100 mA cm-2. The remodeling of LDHs in the OER process is also discussed to further explore the OER catalytic mechanism. In addition, CoFe0.75Mn0.25-LDH can also be utilized to the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), which requests a low potential of 1.367 V to reach 10 mA cm-2. A solar driven water splitting system is assembled and acquires the current density of 10 mA cm-2 at the low cell voltage of 1.58 V.

J	Zhang, Tong; Zhou, Yujian; Hu, Yingnan; Wang, Zhi; Liu, Junhao; Qian, Guoyu; Gong, Xuzhong								Pressure intensified HO center dot evolution from OER and electrolysis desulfurization								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				318				202	210		10.1016/j.electacta.2019.06.080				SEP 20 2019	2019	To strengthen the formation of Hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) on anode, pressurized water electrolysis under constant temperature were carried out in this work. The HO center dot formation was verified by electrochemistry-electron spin resonance (ESR) and bauxite desulfurization in the same pressurized reactor with different cell designs. With increasing pressure, the current density was increased. However, the equilibrium potential of anode and the initial potential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were negative shifted with increasing pressure. Results revealed that pressure promoted the early steps of OER but inhibited subsequent transformation. The apparent transfer coefficient of the anode (b(a) and b(c)) further proved that the pressure play a positive role on the OER reserve reaction and promoted the formation of HO center dot. R-ct and R-s were all decreased with increasing pressure, demonstrating that pressure improved the mass transfer and reaction of the OER. The electrolysis desulfurization and ESR experiments have clearly supported the positive role of pressure on strengthening the HO center dot formation. From electrolysis with 0.1 MPa, HO center dot signal was detected by ESR when constant potential was 0.8 V on anode, while the signal arose at 0.7 V under 1.0MPa, indicating that HO center dot was formed in advance under pressure.

A rapid evolution of hydrogen under CH(4) pulse observed for oxidized catalysts agrees with the direct route of the methane selective oxidation into syngas. This route is favored by the Pt-support interaction and a moderate bonding strength of surface oxygen species along with a high lattice oxygen mobility.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0133-1736			WOS:000268445800026

In situ studies have revealed Co3+-site reducibility as the key factor for OER activity of cobalt oxide-based systems. In this context, we have synthesized and analyzed OER activity of two Co3O4 systems; c-Co3O4 with higher oxygen defects or Co2+/Co3+ ratio and n-Co3O4 with relatively less Co2+/Co3+ ratio but more Co3+ reducibility. The systems, n- and c-Co3O4 show overpotential of 380 and 440 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and Tafel slope of 153 and 53 mV/dec, respectively, for OER. Electrochemical characterization reveals that the lowering of OER onset potential is influenced by Co3+ reducibility rather than defects in Co3O4 systems while adsorption capacitance arising from surface irregularities, pores and their geometry, and Co3+-O-h sites cause an increase in the Tafel slope values or decrease in OER kinetics. The correlation of the key factors such as Co3+ reducibility and oxygen defects of two different Co3O4 systems toward OER activity can aid the designing of highly efficient cobalt oxide-based OER catalysts.									42	0	0	0	2	0	42			2574-0962			WOS:000543715100039

Previously, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and sulfolane (tetramethylene sulfone (TMS))-based electrolytes were reported to be stable for lithium air (Li-O-2) battery applications. Recently lithium hydroxide (LiOH) based chemistries have been demonstrated to involve supressed side reactions in water-added ether- and DMSO-based electrolytes. Herein, we investigate the impact of DMSO-based electrolyte and sulfolane co-solvent on cell chemistry in the presence of water. We found that DMSO-based electrolyte leads to formation of a peroxidehydroxide mixture as discharge products and the removal of both LiOH and lithium peroxide (Li2O2) on charging from 3.2-3.6 V (vs. Li+/Li) is observed. In the presence of sulfolane as co-solvent, a mixture of Li2O2 and LiOH is formed as major discharge products with slightly more LiOH formation than in the absence of sulfolane. The presence of sulfolane has also significant effects on the charging behaviour, exhibiting a clearer 3 e(-)/O-2 oxygen evolution reaction profile during the entire charging process. This work provides insights into understanding the effects of the primary solvent on promoting LiOH formation and decomposition in lithium iodide (Lil) mediated non-aqueous Li-O-2 batteries.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2056-5135			WOS:000439230900008

Here, coconut water is sprayed over three-dimensional (3D) nickel foam for obtaining a carbonaceous electrode material, i.e., C@Ni-F. The as-prepared C@Ni-F electrode has been used for structural elucidation and morphology evolution studies. Field emission scanning electron microscopy analysis confirms the vertically grown nanosheets of the C@Ni-F electrode, which is further employed in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), where excellent OER and HER performances with small overpotentials of 219 and 122 mV and with stumpy Tafel slopes, i.e., 27 and 53 mV dec(-1), are respectively obtained, suggesting a bifunctional potential of the sprayed electrode material. Moreover, sustainable bifunctional performance of C@Ni-F proves considerable chemical stability and moderate mechanical robustness against long-term operation, suggesting that, in addition to being a healthy drink to mankind, coconut water can also be used for water splitting applications.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2470-1343			WOS:000654303500024	34056413

Here, a novel OER electrocatalyst of Ni-Fe-OH/Ni3S2 nanoparticles on Ni foam (Ni-Fe-OH/Ni3S2/NF) was synthesized by a facile, ultrafast two-step method within 2 minutes. The obtained Ni-Fe-OH/Ni3S2/NF catalyst presents an excellent OER performance, only requiring a low overpotential of 268 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH, which was sustained for 12 h at a current density of 175 mA cm(-2) almost without any degradation. The superior OER performance of the Ni-Fe-OH/Ni3S2/NF catalyst is attributed to the increased active sites, the accelerated electron transfer between the electrode and electrolyte, and the synergistic effect between amorphous Ni-Fe-OH and Ni3S2. This work opens up a new avenue for preparing highly efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts toward the OER.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000526708900011

Materials were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, derivative thermogravimetric and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical behavior of modified carbon paste electrode (CPE) with GO-amine (GO-amine/CPE) was studied by electrochemical methods. The results showed which GO-amine/CPE catalyzes oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media with an onset potential of 0.4 V (vs. Ag|AgCl|KCl3M), showing a synergistic effect between GO and amine nanocomposite. The high electrochemical stability confirmed the improved electrocatalytic performance of GO-amine. This study affords us a GO-amine based electrocatalyst with high performance and strong durability under alkaline conditions, which can be applied to energy conversion and storage.

Additionally, studies using a thin-film rotating disc electrode, identical location transmission and scanning electron microscopy, as well as X-ray absorption spectroscopy have been performed. Extremely sensitive online time-and potential resolved electrochemical dissolution profiles revealed that Ir particles dissolve well below oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potentials, presumably induced by Ir surface oxidation and reduction processes, also referred to as transient dissolution. Overall, thermally prepared rutile-type IrO2 particles are substantially more stable and less active in comparison to as-prepared metallic and electrochemically pretreated (E-Ir) analogues. Interestingly, under OER-relevant conditions, E-Ir particles exhibit superior stability and activity owing to the altered corrosion mechanism, where the formation of unstable Ir(>IV) species is hindered. Due to the enhanced and lasting OER performance, electrochemically pre-oxidized E-Ir particles may be considered as the electrocatalyst of choice for an improved low-temperature electrochemical hydrogen production device, namely a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer.									124	2	0	0	7	0	125			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000411043900073	28810123

Compared with monolayer TMDs without GBs, the flexoelectricity induced by nonuniform deformation and strain gradient significantly enhances the charge polarizations of X and M atoms at the GB sites of monolayer TMDs, which facilitates the dissociation of water molecules on the GB sites and reduces the reaction barrier of hydrogen evolution reaction. The energy barriers of splitting water molecules and hydrogen adsorption free energies on the GB sites decrease with increasing the flexoelectric effect. These results highlight an attractive way of utilizing the flexoelectric effect of GB-containing TMDs to improve their surface catalytic capability for hydrogen generation.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000666904000004

Recently, significant progress has been made in synthesizing electrocatalytic materials with reduced overpotentials and increased turnover rates, both key parameters enabling commercial use in electrolysis or solar to fuels applications. The complexity of both the catalytic materials and the water oxidation reaction makes understanding the catalytic site critical to improving the process. Here we study water oxidation in alkaline conditions using size-selected clusters of Pd to probe the relationship between cluster size and the water oxidation reaction. We find that Pd-4 shows no reaction, while Pd-6 and Pd-17 deposited clusters are among the most active (in terms of turnover rate per Pd atom) catalysts known. Theoretical calculations suggest that this striking difference may be a demonstration that bridging Pd-Pd sites (which are only present in three-dimensional clusters) are active for the oxygen evolution reaction in Pd6O6. The ability to experimentally synthesize size-specific dusters allows direct comparison to this theory. The support electrode for these investigations is ultrananooystalline diamond (UNCD). This material is thin enough to be electrically conducting and is chemically/electrochemically very stable. Even under the harsh experimental conditions (basic, high potential) typically employed for water oxidation catalysts, UNCD demonstrates a very wide potential electrochemical working window and shows only minor evidence of reaction. The system (soft-landed Pd-4, Pd-6, or Pd-17 dusters on a UNCD Si-coated electrode) shows stable electrochemical potentials over several cycles, and synchrotron studies of the electrodes show no evidence for evolution or dissolution of either the electrode material or the clusters.									109	5	0	0	6	0	110			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000322417400020	23799858

These have been designed to perform alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) enhanced by AMF, the latter allowing to heat locally the catalyst by hysteresis and eddy current losses. The (electro)chemical effect of the aggressive alkaline environment (reducing/oxidizing potential and atmosphere) and of the temperature (mimicking the AMF-induced heating) are addressed by using dedicated (in situ) techniques. First, durability tests carried out in a rotating disk electrode setup without AMF are presented; they show the poor hydrogen evolution reaction durability but an acceptable oxygen evolution reaction durability of this material. Complementary identical location (IL) transmission electron microscopy enables us to track the associated morphology/composition changes experienced by the catalysts in these conditions. Second, IL scanning electron microscopy unveils the fate of electrodes having operated in AMF-enhanced AWE. Third, the influence of a reductive/oxidant atmosphere, combined with a high temperature exposition (up to 600 degrees C), indicates that this material undergoes crystallographic changes, which may alter the electrochemical activity in long-term experiments with repetitive AMF exposures. The combination of these tests provides insights into the possible long-term durability of this catalytic material in AMF-enhanced AWE.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000820463200001

A fast and direct synthetic route has been used based on plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition with methylamine borane as a single-source molecular precursor. The effect of growth time on the morphological and structural properties and on the chemical composition of the layers has been investigated by scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy. Flat B-C-N layers on top of an amorphous titanium oxide layer present at the Ti surface have been obtained by using short growth times, while longer growth times give rise to core/shell structures formed by vertical wall B-C-N layers and titanium carbonitride phases. The obtained layers present enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline aqueous solutions. Moreover, because of their ultrathin nature, the B-C-N layers preserve the photocurrents of the underlying titanium oxide layer, acting as transparent electrodes with high conductivity for the photogenerated charge carriers and improved electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of water to oxygen gas.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2574-0962			WOS:000516665300076

The crystal structure development, structural stability, electrical conductivity and oxygen permeation flux are investigated. The introduction of iron makes the formation of cubic perovskite structure for BCFN materials much easier. BCFN exhibits a p-type semiconductor and obeys the thermally activated small polarons hopping mechanism. The electrical conductivity of BCFN increases with increasing temperature and decreases with the Fe-doping concentration. The incorporation of Fe decreases slightly the oxygen permeability of BCFN membranes, but enhances significantly the structure stability of the oxygen permeation membrane in reducing atmosphere.

The MnO2 grew to form a quasicolumnar shape with a structure that can be controlled through the simple variation of the pH during the synthesis. This control strategy could be applied to other solvents to obtain materials with unique structures. Furthermore, composites of the as-synthesized hollow MnO2 with N-doped graphene (rGN) are electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction under mild conditions. The electrocatalysts were characterized through X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and electrochemical measurements. The prepared composite exhibited excellent catalytic performance as well as improved durability and tolerance to methanol relative to those of a commercial catalyst (20 wt.-% Pt/C); thus, such materials show potential for application as electrocatalysts.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000428394200008

Phase purity of these compounds was analysed by collecting powder. X-ray diffraction data revealed the co-existence of both BiVO4 and WO3 phases. Transmission electron microscopic measurements on these samples revealed that the average particles sizes of these heterostructures are in the submicron range. Optical band gap is found in the range of 2.30 to 2.45 eV by using UV-visible spectrometer. Optical spectra reveal two distinct absorption edges corresponding to both existing phases. Electrochemical activity of BiVO4 and BiVO4/WO3 heterostructures was studied using electrochemical workstation for applicability of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These results indicate that the electrochemical activity was improved by forming heterostructures as compared with pristine compounds. From the Tafel slope analysis, it was found that the second electron transfer step is the rate determining step in OER mechanism in BiVO4/WO3 heterostructures.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2190-5444			WOS:000466970900007

However, the realization of MOF-based thin films for optimizing and improving electrocatalysis remains a significant challenge. In this work, we report a homo-dispersed CeO2 encapsulated cobalt-porphyrin network derived thin film by epitaxial encapsulation approach for optimizing and improving OER performance. The OER activity can be optimized effectively via tuning the thicknesses and calcination temperatures of the cobalt-porphyrin network PIZA-1 thin film. After loading a Ce(III) coordination compound into PIZA-1 by the epitaxial encapsulation method and calcination at 400 degrees C, a thin film of PIZA-1 derivative with homo-dispersed CeO2 was obtained successfully for greatly improved electrocatalytic OER performance (an overpotential of 370 mV at 10.0 mA cm(-2)). The work presented here will be extended to the fabrication of other composite thin film electrode materials for high electrocatalytic performance.									34	5	0	0	0	0	36			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000412781700004

Practical realization of solar-driven synthesis of hydrogen and oxygen integrating light absorption and electrolysis of water has been challenging because of (1) the limited stability of good photovoltaic materials under the required electrochemical conditions, and (2) photovoltaic efficiency losses due to light absorption by catalysts, the electrolyte, and generated bubbles, or reflection at their various interfaces. Herein, we evaluate a novel integrated solar water splitting architecture using efficient silicon heterojunction photovoltaic cells that avoids such losses and exhibits a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency in excess of 10%. Series-connected silicon Heterojunction with Intrinsic Thin layer (HIT) cells generate sufficient photovoltage for unassisted water splitting, with one of the cells acting as the photocathode. Platinum is deposited on the back (dark) junction of this HIT cell as the catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The photocathode is protected from corrosion by a TiO2 layer deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) interposed between the HIT cell and the Pt, enabling stable operation for >120 hours. Combined with oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts deposited on a porous metal dark anode, these PEC's achieve stable water splitting with a record high STH efficiency for an integrated silicon photosynthesis device.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2398-4902			WOS:000469258600011

From the viewpoint of reaction kinetics, it is possible to modify the rate determining step through separately accelerating the adsorption and dissociation of intermediate products. In this research, we have demonstrated that OER kinetics for RuO2 could be effectively promoted with the precise control of the reaction kinetics by optimizing the equilibrium of dissociation and recombination of water molecules. It is found that increasing the concentration of OH- in the electrolyte contributes to the formation process of the peroxy species, Ru-OOH*, while the increase of temperature is helpful for the deprotonation process from a stabilized configuration of the peroxy species. With faster rate determining steps, RuO2 shows excellent OER activity and stability under high temperature and concentrated basic electrolyte conditions. It is meaningful for accelerating the practical application of hydrogen production from electrolysis of water. And this research will provide a new perspective for the study of catalytic reactions, not just limited to the OER.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2052-1537		WOS:000482454500006

Herein, a universal vapor-phase method is reported to grow well-aligned MOFs on conductive carbon cloth (CC) by using metal hydroxyl fluorides with diverse morphologies as self-sacrificial templates. Specifically, by further partially on-site generating active Co3S4 species from Co ions in the echinops-like Co-based MOF (EC-MOF) through a controlled vulcanization approach, the resulting Co3S4/EC-MOF hybrid exhibits much enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with overpotentials of 84 and 226 mV required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results reveal that the electron transfer between Co3S4 species and EC-MOF can decrease the electron density of the Co d-orbital, resulting in more electrocatalytically optimized adsorption properties for Co. This study will open up a new avenue for designing highly ordered MOF-based surface active materials for various electrochemical energy applications.									178	14	0	0	11	0	180			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000474801000005	30968484

By performing electrochemical characterizations and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, novel insights into Co/Fe oxyhydroxide catalysts and their interactions with perovskite oxides have been revealed. The addition of Fe into Co oxyhydroxide catalysts greatly enhances the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity by stabilizing the Co cations into a lower oxidation state under operative conditions compared to the case of undoped Co oxyhydroxide. A beneficial Co/Fe electronic interaction for OER can also be achieved by depositing Co oxyhydroxide on Fe-containing oxide supports, such as the LaFeO3 perovskite. Finally, it was found that, despite the lower Fe content in the Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) perovskite structure, Co oxyhydroxides supported on this perovskite exhibit the highest OER activity. Therefore, our findings suggest that perovskite structures presenting a large content of oxygen vacancies and undergoing surface reconstruction, such as BSCF, offer the best interface for Co oxyhydroxides. Finally, profiting from the beneficial Co/Fe electronic interaction and perovskite interface interaction, the highest OER activity has been achieved by depositing Co/Fe oxyhydroxide on the surface of BSCF perovskite.									29	1	0	0	1	0	28			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000488322900023	31469262

Previous to preparation of MCPE, LDH materials were characterized by different techniques, as XRD, FTIR and BET analysis. The electrochemical response of the electrodes was characterized in neutral conditions using reactive blue 69 dye as a probe molecule. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), multi-sweep cyclic voltammetry (MSCV) and open circuit potential transient techniques were employed. Different current magnitudes in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were found as a function of thermal treatment and supporting electrolyte (pH). On the other hand, in a solution containing 250 ppm of the probe molecule at neutral pH, peaks attributed to blue 69 oxidation were found at ca. 0.65 and 0.95 V/SCE. The presence of calcium, as additional divalent cation, and the rehydration of the mixed oxide, due to memory effect, have a positive performance, increasing the magnitude of the electrocatalytic process.

The electrodeposits were fabricated galvanostatically onto rotating copper electrodes and contained a small amount of Co. The OER characterized in 1 M KOH was a function of the deposit composition. The Tafel slope and the overpotential at 10 mA/cm(2) observed with ohmically corrected linear sweep voltammetry were both a function of the deposit metal ratio, Fe/(Ni + Co) with the lowest values occurring at a ratio of 1.2. An Fe-rich deposit was purposely altered upon aging to degrade the OER kinetics. The Tafel slope and overpotential were largely recovered when the aged electrocatalyst was treated with a cathodic current density of -100 mA/cm(2) for 10 min. Soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy provided insight into the changes of the electron density distribution upon aging and regenerating the electrocatalyst. Through X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), the L-edge spectra of Fe, Ni, Co, and K-edge spectra of O, suggested that the recovery is due to the redistribution of the electron density from the oxygen to Fe and Ni.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2574-0962			WOS:000563784400002

Herein, we report a low-temperature and rapid synthesis of Mo-triggered amorphous Ni3S2 nanosheets as such dual-function electrocatalysts for the first time by a simple solid-phase melting strategy. It is found that Mo engineering can not only dramatically enhance the adsorption ability of Ni active sites to the active intermediates of HER, but also generate more targeted intermediates for OER. The resulting a-Mo-Ni3S2 catalysts demonstrate exceptionally high HER/OER activity and stability in alkaline media, outperforming the baseline commercial noble-metal (Pt, IrO2 and RuO2) and other reported advanced electrocatalysts to date. A two-electrode electrolyzer assembled using the a-Mo-Ni3S2 electrocatalysts can afford a current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of only 1.97 V which is stable for over 300 h. This work provides a feasible tactic to develop efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts by engineering on surfaces and nanostructures.									39	4	0	0	1	0	39				2052-1537		WOS:000440019000006

The catalytic membrane reactor is based on a mixed ionic-electronic conducting material, i.e. Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O delta-3, which presents high oxygen flux above 750 degrees C under sufficient chemical potential gradient. Specifically, diluted ethane is fed into the reactor chamber and air (or diluted air) is flushed to the other side of the membrane. A framework based on Soft Computing techniques has been used to maximize the ethylene yield by simultaneously varying five operation variables: nominal reactor temperature (Temp); gas flow in the reaction compartment (QHC); gas flow in the oxygen-rich compartment (QAir); ethane concentration in the reaction compartment (%C2H6); and oxygen concentration in oxygen-rich compartment (%O-2). The optimization tool combines a genetic algorithm guided by a neural network model. This shows how the neural network model for this particular problem is obtained and the analysis of its behavior along the optimization process. The optimization process is analyzed in terms of: (1) catalytic figures of merit, i.e., evolution of yield and selectivity towards different products and (2) framework behavior and variable significance. The two experimental areas maximizing the ethylene yield are explored and analyzed. The highest yield reached in the optimization process exceeded 87%. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Systematic measurements indicate that pyridinic N and pyrrolitic N contents decreased from 600 to 900 degrees C, and the highest metallic Co contents, as well as well-defined MWCNTs were obtained at 800 degrees C. Taking advantage of the unique hierarchical nanostructures and adjusted compositions, the free-standing electrode shows excellent bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities. The presence of MWCNTs, metallic Co, active N species and Co-NxC sites, as well as in-situ formed Co oxides, will synergistically contribute to the electrocatalytic performance. Such free-standing film directly act as air-cathode to construct all solid-state Zn-air batteries (ZABs), showing comparable rechargeability to commercial Pt/C&Ir/C electrocatalysts, and also possessing unique flexibility. Present work opens a new avenue to improve the ORR and OER performance of Zif-67 derived nanomaterials via manipulating the hierarchical structure and chemical compositions, and sheds insights to the understanding of the electrocatalytic mechamism, also promotes the development of solid-state ZABs.

In the future, designing high-efficiency nonprecious-metal catalysts based on low-cost iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) metals for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is fairly critical for commercial applications of hydrogen fuel cells. In this study, for the first time, we design novel three-dimensional (3D) hybrid networks consisting of manganese oxide (MnO)-modified, iron carbide (Fe3C)-embedded, and boron (B)/nitrogen (N) codoped hierarchically porous carbon nanofibers (denoted FeMn@BNPCFs). After optimizing the pyrolysis temperatures, the optimal FeMn@BNPCFs-900 catalyst displays the best HER and ORR catalytic activities in an alkaline solution. As expected, the HER onset potential (E-onset) and the potential at a current density of -10 mA cm(-2) for FeMn@BNPCFs-900 in 1.0 M KOH are just 36 and 194 mV more negative than the state-of-the-art 20 wt % Pt/C catalyst with more superior stability. In particular, the FeMn@BNPCFs-900 catalyst shows excellent ORR catalytic activity with a more positive E-onset (0.946 V vs RHE), a more positive half-wave potential (E-1/2 = 0.868 V vs RHE), better long-term stability, and higher methanol tolerance surpassing the commercial 20 wt % Pt/C (E-onset = 0.943 V vs RHE, E-1/2 = 0.854 V vs RHE) and most previously reported precious-metal-free catalysts in 0.1 M KOH. The synergistic effects of 3D hierarchically macro-/mesoporous architectures, advanced charge transport capacity, abundant carbon defects/edges, abundant B (2.3 atom %) and N (4.9 atom %) dopants, uniformly dispersed Fe3C@BNC NPs, and MnO nanocrystallines are responsible for the excellent HER/ORR catalytic activities of the FeMn@BNPCFs-900 catalyst.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000787373300029	35263074

In this work, we demonstrate an outstanding electrocatalytic activity of a unique metal-(N,S)-C class of electrocatalyst composed of cobalt-coordinated sulfur-doped graphitic carbon nitride (Co-SCN) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) toward overall water splitting in alkaline media. Importantly, the optimized Co-SCN/RGO catalyst exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activities for both the HER and the OER, with low overpotentials of 150 and 250 mV vs RHE, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The cell potential required for the overall water-splitting electrolyzer was found to be approximately 1.63 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in a medium of 1.0 M KOH. The activity results obtained for this Co-SCN/RGO electrocatalyst are comparable and in many cases superior to most reported nonprecious-metal-based catalysts in alkaline media. Additionally, stability tests conducted at a constant current density confirm the exceptional durability of the present catalyst over a period of 20 h. The rational strategy demonstrated in the present work provides new insights into the development of high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									32	1	0	0	1	0	32			2168-0485			WOS:000486565900026

Water splitting is an important method for hydrogen production in high purity and large quantities. To accelerate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rate, it is highly necessary to develop high efficiency catalysts and to select a proper electrolyte. Herein, the performances of non-noble metal-based carbon composites under various pH values (acid, alkaline and neutral media) for HER in terms of catalyst synthesis, structure and molecular design are systematically discussed. A detailed analysis of the structure-activity-pH correlations in the HER process gives an insight on the origin of the pH-dependence for HER, and provide guidance for future HER mechanism studies on non-noble metal-based carbon composites. Furthermore, this Review gives a fresh impetus to rational design of high-performance noble-metal-free composites catalysts and guide researchers to employ the established electrocatalysts in proper water electrolysis technologies.									1011	75	0	0	33	0	1031			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000398357200003	28234409	
J	JAKSIC, MM; JOHANSEN, B; TUNOLD, R								ELECTROCHEMICAL-BEHAVIOR OF GOLD IN ACIDIC AND ALKALINE-SOLUTIONS OF HEAVY AND REGULAR WATER								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				18	2			91	110		10.1016/0360-3199(93)90196-H				FEB 1993	1993	The behaviour of gold as an electrode for hydrogen (protium and deuterium) and oxygen evolution in both alkaline and acidic, heavy and regular water solutions has been investigated primarily by cyclic voltammetry. All the main features, such as adsorption accompanied by absorption of hydrogen (both protium and deuterium), as well as the specific multilayer (monolayer alpha- succeeded by multilayer beta-phase) oxide growth preceding hydrogen and oxygen evolution, respectively. with characteristic desorption peaks within a wider potential range distinctive (and typical) for gold, were clearly marked in both electrolytes. Some distinctly different features, however, have been observed, revealing that heavy and regular water behave almost as different solvent ambients. In particular, twin peaks for oxygen desorption, which progressively separate along the potential axis with cyclization, were clearly marked in heavy water solutions. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in heavy water occurs at substantially more negative potentials. while oxygen evolution becomes shifted to considerably more positive potential values. The latter effect enables one to record on voltammograms the multilayer oxide (beta-phase) growth in alkaline heavy water. as distinctly indicated by the corresponding, continuously growing, characteristic potentiodynamic waves scanned successively with cyclization. Deuterium absorption has been clearly marked by the continuously growing charge capacity of the diffusional desorption peak, which exceeds one-to-one D(H)/Au atom coverage on the exposed gold surface, relative to the corresponding steady-state adsorption wave for hydrogen deposition preceding its evolution. In addition, the hydrogen oxidation peak immediately following its desorption (in particular from acidic heavy water) has also been distinctly scanned on voltammograms. Oxide formation usually starts together with deuterium oxidation and, specifically in acidic media, proceeds vigorously with higher and continuously growing rates, while evolving oxygen thereby becomes shifted to more positive potential values. These features reveal that due to its distinctly different steric factor, heavy water, in particular in acidic media, behaves as a stronger oxidizing agent than regular water. Some discernible properties of the interplay between hydrogen and oxygen on gold electrodes in both electrolytes along the potential axis have been clearly marked and pointed out.									26	0	0	0	5	0	26			0360-3199			WOS:A1993KU54900001

Herein, selfsupported F, N codoping CoP nanosheets (denoted as FN-CoP NS) are prepared as efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts. Codoping of F and N neutralizes the electronegativity of surface P-O by cleaving the Co-P-O of non-metallic P sites on the surface (O derived from the surface oxidation). This contributes to an increased Co2+ content with considerable adjustable electronegativity and also optimizes HER and OER processes. As a result, FN-CoP NS requires 66 and 241 mV overpotentials to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm-2 during HER and OER, respectively. A full water electrolyzer equipped FN-CoP NS as both cathode and anode only require 1.57 V to drive the current density of 10 mA cm-2 and to sustain 50 mA cm-2 for 48 h. This work adjusts the electronic structure of metal phosphides by a double anion codoping strategy, which provides a reference value for the rational design of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0021-9797	1095-7103		WOS:000793690800007	35398761

However, the oxygen-involving process inevitably leads to instability of the oxygen framework and ultimately lattice oxygen release from the surface, which incurs capacity decline, voltage fading, and poor kinetics. Herein, it is identified that this predicament can be diminished by constructing a spinel Li4Mn5O12 coating, which is inherently stable in the lattice framework to prevent oxygen release of the lithium-rich layered oxides at the deep delithiated state. The controlled KMnO4 oxidation strategy ensures uniform and integrated encapsulation of Li4Mn5O12 with structural compatibility to the layered core. With this layer suppressing oxygen release, the related phase transformation and catalytic side reaction that preferentially start from the surface are consequently hindered, as evidenced by detailed structural evolution during Li+ extraction/insertion. The heterostructure cathode exhibits highly competitive energy-storage properties including capacity retention of 83.1% after 300 cycles at 0.2 C, good voltage stability, and favorable kinetics. These results highlight the essentiality of oxygen framework stability and effectiveness of this spinel Li4Mn5O12 coating strategy in stabilizing the surface of lithium-rich layered oxides against lattice oxygen escaping for designing high-performance cathode materials for high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries.									264	20	0	0	8	0	269			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000438709400029	29808533

However, the sluggish kinetics of the ORR and OER strongly limit the efficiency and performance of these electrochemical systems and jeopardize the route of commercialization. Therefore, the design and development of bifunctional electrocatalysts with high activity for both the ORR and OER is challenging but urgent and crucial. Here, we took advantage of Pt/C and LiCoO2 with outstanding ORR activity and high intrinsic OER activity, respectively, to develop a composite material with ultralow Pt loading as a bifunctional catalyst for the ORR and OER in alkaline media. This catalyst was fabricated via simple ultrasonic mixing, exhibiting superb electrocatalytic activity and good stability. Its ORR activity is comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst and its OER activity is better than that of single LiCoO2, owing to the synergetic effect between Pt and LiCoO2, which has been demonstrated through the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterisation technique. Remarkably, surprisingly high ORR mass activity (2.04 A mg(Pt)(-1) at 0.8 V vs. RHE) and enhanced bifunctionality (Delta E = 0.91 V) were obtained for the Pt-LiCoO2 composite catalyst with a mass ratio of 1 : 49 for Pt/LiCoO2. Our work opens up a new track to exploit highly efficient catalysts with reduced consumption of Pt, meanwhile maintaining the optimal catalytic activity and durability.									51	1	0	0	3	0	52			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000372190800025

However, the aggregation tendency, low conductivity and poor stability hinder their electrocatalytic performance. Herein, a composite catalyst of Co9S8 nanoparticles embedded in N, S doped porous carbon (Co9S8/EWPC) was synthesized by pyrolyzing and sulfurating a prepared hydrogel of egg white, NaCl and Co(NO3)(2). After subsequent removal of NaCl templates and activation by KOH, the obtained Co9S8/EWPC achieves a hierarchical porous structure with a large specific surface area of 500.59 m(2) g(-1). Owing to the synergistic effects of the evenly embedded Co9S8 nanoparticles, N, S doped carbon matrix and large specific surface area, Co9S8/EWPC exhibits excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for the ORR (half-wave potential of 0.83 V) and OER (overpotential of 390 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). An aqueous ZAB assembled with the Co9S8/EWPC cathode catalyst displays a high peak power density of 125 mW cm(-2) and durable cycling stability over 268 cycles. Moreover, based on Co9S8/EWPC, a designed 2D coplanar flexible ZAB presents excellent electrochemical performance and favorable mechanical flexibility.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000866019300001

Herein, we fabricate a bifunctional electrocatalyst alpha-MnO2-LaNiO3/carbon nanotube (CNTs) composite to improve the activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). CNTs are used to support the bifunctional catalysts in one integrated material. The chemical and physical characterization of the bifunctional catalyst is performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical properties of the bifunctional catalyst tested by a rotating disc electrode system revealed enhanced catalytic activity toward both the ORR and OER. A four-electron reduction pathway contributes to the ORR process at different rotation speeds indicating an effective catalytic activity. A rechargeable zinc-air battery using the bifunctional catalyst achieved a maximum power density of 55.1 mW cm(-2), and its voltage polarization showed a 1.4% decrease in discharge and a 4.8% increase in charge after 75 charge-discharge (C-D) cycles. The charge transfer resistance for the ORR and OER catalyzed by the bifunctional catalyst increased from 1.24 to 4.68 Omega after 75 C-D cycles. The bifunctional electrocatalysts show satisfactory performance in an electrically rechargeable zinc-air battery.									65	4	0	0	0	0	67			2046-2069			WOS:000342761600061

Structural and morphological studies provided significant insights for the metastable phase. Furthermore, detailed electrochemical investigations showcased its activity toward energy storage and conversion, yielding intriguing results. Comparison with the stable polymorph, alpha-NiIVoO(4), has also been borne out to support the enhanced electrochemical activities of the as-obtained beta-NiMoO4. A specific capacitance of similar to 4188 F g(-1) (at a current density of 5 A g(-1)) has been observed showing its exceptional faradic capacitance. We qualitatively and extensively demonstrate through the analysis of density of states (DOS) obtained from first-principles calculations that, enhanced DOS near top of the valence band and empty 4d orbital of Mo near Fermi level make beta-NiMoO4 better energy storage and conversion material compared to alpha-NiMoO4. Likewise, from the oxygen evolution reaction experiment, it is found that the state of art current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is achieved at overpotential of 300 mV, which is much lower than that of IrO2/C. First-principles calculations also confirm a lower overpotential of 350 mV for beta-NiMoO4.									92	4	0	0	6	0	93			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000397478100046	28248074

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed discrete crystalline nanoparticles decorating the surface of the ZnO-passivated porous carbon support in which the size could be controlled in the range of 3-6 nm, depending on the number of Pd ALD cycles performed. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Pd Kedge revealed that the carbon-supported Pd existed in a mixed phase of metallic palladium and palladium oxide. The ZnO-passivated layer effectively blocks the defect sites on the carbon surface, minimizing the electrolyte decomposition. Our results suggest that ALD is a promising technique for tailoring the surface composition and structure of nanoporous supports for Li-O-2 batteries.									24	3	0	0	1	0	24			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000353109600004	25829367

Under this guideline, MIL-101@OX-metal organic framework (MOF) is constructed by the "MOF on MOF" method, then converts to MIL-101@NiFe-layered double hydroxides (LDH) by in situ transformation in alkaline solution. MIL-101@NiFe-LDH shows excellent electrochemical water oxidation performance. It needs only an overpotential of 215 mV to drive 10 mA/cm(2) of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is less than that of NiFe-LDH, MIL-101. In addition, MIL-101@NiFe-LDH has the smallest Tafel slope (55.1 mV/dec) compared with NiFe-LDH (61.1 mV/dec), MIL-101 (150.8 mV/dec). The excellent water oxidation activity is due to the high phase interfaces derived from high specific surface area of MOF. This work offers an alternative method for making MOF/LDH heterostructures with an optimized phase interfaces and provides new insights for OER.

Such interest arises from the wide range of covalent linkages employed in their construction, which offer many possibilities to design extended frameworks and to link photoactive building blocks. Thus, the potential utility of predesigned organic photoactive fragments can be synergistically added to the inherent advantages of heterogeneous catalysis, such as recyclability and easy separation of catalyst. In this overview, the current state of the art on the design of organic materials for photocatalytic oxidation reactions will be presented. The designing process of these materials is usually conditioned by the generally accepted concept that crystallinity and porosity defines the quality of the heterogeneous catalysts obtained. The care for the structural integrity of materials obtained is understandable because many properties and applications are intimately related to these features. However, the catalytic activity does not always directly depends on these characteristics. A critical compilation of the available literature is performed in order to offer a general perspective of the use of COFs and Covalent Triazine Frameworks (CTFs) in photocatalytic oxidation processes, including water oxidation, which constitute an important outcome relevant to artificial photosynthesis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2296-2646			WOS:000670426200001	34249875

This report describes 2D metal-organic framework nanosheets as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions. An ultrathin nanosheet array of a NiCo-metal-organic framework was grown on nickel foam (NiCo-MOF/NF) by a one-step solvothermal method. The catalytic OER of the NiCO-MOF/NF electrode was analysed by electrochemical methods. The resulting NiCO-MOF/NF exhibited a high current density (50 mA cm(-2)) with an overpotential of 270 mV, a Tafel slope of 35.4 mV dec(-1) and a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.68 s(-1) (eta = 0.27 V) towards the OER. The excellent catalytic activity of the MOF towards the OER was due to the two-dimensional nanosheet array of NiCo-MOF with plentiful accessible molecular active sites and excellent mass transport properties. Faster electron transport was also achieved due to the synergetic effect of Co and Ni present on the MOF.									41	1	0	0	2	0	41			2516-0230			WOS:000536705700030	36132501

However, the key for the large-scale application of this technique is to develop highly efficient electrocatalysts with low-cost to replace the noble-metal-based ones. To date, a series of transition-metal-based bifunctional electrocatalysts for both anode and cathode have been already developed for the overall water splitting. Herein, the characteristics of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions on the electrodes of water electrolysis cell and the basic methods for the evaluation of the performance of electrocatalysts are introduced at first and then, the prospects of various earth-abundant transition-metal-based bifunctional electrocatalysts are critically reviewed. Finally, the challenges in the development of earth-abundant transition-metal-based bifunctional electrocatalysts are discussed. It is expected to provide a guidance for the design and fabrication of the novel bifunctional electrocatalysts with high performance in a practical water splitting process. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The use of cyclen that can strongly chelate metal ions enables the formation of completely isolated metal sits uniformly distributed on the framework of COF. The resulting single-site heterogeneous catalyst ((Cyclen@Ni0.5Fe0.5)@COF-SO3) exhibits outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity because of the maximum atom-utilization efficiency and significant bimetallic synergy effect. The TOF value at the overpotential of 300 mV reaches as high as 0.69 s(-1), which is superior to most of the recently reported efficient OER electrocatalysts. Moreover, the catalyst is stable and reusable without the loss of current density during a 25 h long-term test. The combination of advantages of molecular catalysts (metal complex) similar to homogeneous catalysts and solid COF materials for the fabrication of single-site heterogeneous catalysts first reported in this work can bring new avenues to develop highly efficient and stable COF-based catalysts in different catalytic fields.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2052-1553			WOS:000579499200007

Binuclear iron as the linear unit was formed by coordination between iron ion and H3DFMP, while TBPM was used as the tetrahedral linking unit, so that the three-dimensional porous organic polymer Fe-2-POP with dia topology was produced. X-ray single crystal diffraction analysis of the model compound (MC-1) verified the structural characteristics of the dinuclear ferrous unit. Infrared spectroscopy and solid-state nuclear magnetism characterizations proved the formation of C = N and B - O in Fe-2-POP. Fe-2-POP had a high specific surface area of 510 m(2).g(-1) and uniform pore size (0.6-0.8 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the presence of divalent iron in Fe-2-POP. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed that Fe-2-POP was composed of 50-100 nm sphere-shaped particles. Electrochemical tests showed that Fe-2-POP exhibited excellent electrochemical properties towards oxygen evolution reaction, and it only needed a small overpotential of 258 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) and the Tafel slope was 71.0 mV.dec(-1) CCDC: 2088705, MC-1.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-4861			WOS:000727729100010

Herein, a newly designed hybrid bifunctional electrocatalyst, FexNi4-xPy coupled with N,P-codoped carbon nanotubes (N, P-CNTs), is developed by a facile pyrolysis-phosphorization process. The FexNi4-xPy/N, P-CNT catalyst shows a small overpotential of 266 mV to attain the benchmark 10 mA cm(-2), low Tafel slope, and excellent stability for OER in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, preceding that of commercial IrO2. Moreover, the FexNi4-xPy/N, P-CNT catalyst also exhibits admirable activity and robust stability towards HER in alkaline media. The advantageous characteristics of high electrical conductivity, multicomponent active sites, and anchoring effects of carbon nanotubes synergistically contribute to the excellent electrocatalytic activities and stability of FexNi4-xPy/N, P-CNTs towards OER and HER. This study may pioneer a unique avenue to synthesize novel electrocatalysts featuring multicomponent active sites for applications in renewable energy techniques.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2052-1553			WOS:000637156300006

Herein, we report a fluorinated Ni3S2 nanoarray electrocatalyst with Ni-F bonds enriched and low-crystalline ultrathin nanosheets on the surface, which are responsible for the rapid and deep electrochemical-transformation of active phase during OER process. Electrochemical characterizations indicate that the fluorinated Ni3S2 (F-Ni3S2) possesses a larger electrochemical active surface area, better conductivity and higher intrinsic OER activity (TOF) than the pristine Ni3S2. Consequently, the optimized F-Ni3S2 electrocatalyst shows a small overpotential of 239 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a low Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1), superior to most of reported Ni3S2-based electrocatalysts to date. Ex-situ structural analysis further reveals the NiF bonds can be easily activated with F loss under OER process, thus generating more highly active Ni-OOH species for accelerating rate-determining step (*O -> *OOH). This work expands fluorine chemistry applications in designing high-activity electrocatalysts for energy-conversion.									34	0	0	0	5	0	34			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000626521900003

Herein we report facile synthesis of the mixed-valence trinuclear cobalt complex 1 by the reaction of 2-amino-1-phenylethanol and CoCl2 center dot 6H(2)O in methanol as the solvent at room temperature. Further, 1 was reduced by using aqueous N2H4 as a simple reducing agent, followed by calcination at 300 degrees C for 3 h, yielding a nitrogen-doped mixed phase cobalt [beta-Co(OH)(2) and CoO] nanocatalyst (N@MPCoNC). Both 1 and N@MPCoNC were characterized by various physicochemical techniques. Moreover, 1 was authenticated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The hybrid N@MPCoNC reveals a unique electronic and morphological structure, offering a low overpotential of 390 mV for a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with high durability.

The cathode catalysts play a crucial role in accelerating the oxygen reaction kinetics for improving battery performance. Herein, we employ hetero-atom doping method by combining hydrothermal reaction and ammonia-atmosphere calcination to introduce defects in MoS2 catalyst. The experimental results reveal the fabricated N-doped MoS2 (denoted as N-MoS2) catalysts introduced with abundant lattice defects while maintains the crystal structure of MoS2. The lithium-oxygen batteries with N-MoS2 catalyst as cathode show high initial specific capacity of 5500 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) with good reversibility and efficiency. And the N-MoS2 cathode exhibits good rate capability and cycle stability up to 100 cycles. We reveal that the porous structure and lattice defects promote the exposition of active sites, resulting in higher electrochemical activity for oxygen reduction and the decomposition of discharge products. This work provides a promising avenue for constructing a bi-functional defected molybdenum disulfide catalyst by nitrogen doping in Li-O-2 batteries.

Herein, we successfully fabricate NixS/Cu5FeS4 hybrid catalyst with interface structure between NixS nanoparticles (NPs) and Cu5FeS4 NPs. The NixS/Cu5FeS4 hybrid catalyst exhibits favorable HER performances in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte and demonstrates smaller overpotential and lower Tafel slope than bare NixS NPs and Cu5FeS4 NPs. The remarkable HER performances are attributed to the strongly coupling interface structure between NixS NPs and Cu5FeS4 NPs, which leads to synergistic effect optimizing the HER activity and enhancing the charge transfer during catalytic process. This work provides a promising strategy for the construction of Cu5FeS4-based hybrid catalyst and its application in energy systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

It is highly desirable to create dual-site interfaces in single-atom system to maximize the effect. Herein, we report a cation-deficient electrostatic anchorage route to fabricate an atomically dispersed platinum-titania catalyst (Pt-1(O1)/Ti1-xO2), which shows greatly enhanced hydrogen evolution activity, surpassing that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst in mass by a factor of 53.2. Operando techniques and density functional calculations reveal that Pt-1(O1)/Ti(1-x)O(2)experiences a Pt-O dual-site catalytic pathway, where the inherent charge transfer within the dual sites encourages the jointly coupling protons and plays the key role during the Volmer-Tafel process. There is almost no decay in the activity of Pt-1(O1)/Ti(1-x)O(2)over 300 000 cycles, meaning 30 times of enhancement in stability compared to the commercial Pt/C catalysts (10 000 cycles).									38	2	0	0	3	0	39			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000559398400001	32621558

Electrolysis of water is considered as the suitable method for H-2 generation in a carbon-free pathway. Herein, the synthesis of highly efficient Co9S8-Ni3S2 based hierarchical nanoflower arrays on nickel foam (NF) is explored through the one-pot hydrothermal method (Co9S8-Ni3S2/NF) for overall water splitting applications. The nanoflower arrays are self-supported on the NF without any binder, possessing the required porosity and structural characteristics. The obtained Co9S8-Ni3S2/NF displays high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as well as oxygen evolution reaction (OER), activities in 1 m KOH solution. The overpotentials exhibited by this system at 25 mA cm(-2) are nearly 277 and 102 mV for HER and OER, respectively, in 1 m KOH solution. Subsequently, the overall water splitting was performed in 1 m KOH solution by employing Co9S8-Ni3S2/NF as both the anode and cathode, where the system required only 1.49, 1.60, and 1.69 V to deliver the current densities of 10, 25, and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. Comparison of the activity of Co9S8-Ni3S2/NF with the state-of-the-art Pt/C and RuO2 coated on NF displays an enhanced performance for Co9S8-Ni3S2/NF both in the half-cell as well as in the full cell, emphasizing the significance of the present work. The post analysis of the material after water electrolysis confirms that the surface Co(OH)(2) formed during the course of the reaction serves as the favorable active sites. Overall, the activity modulation achieved in the present case is attributed to the presence of the open-pore morphology of the as formed nanoflowers of Co9S8-Ni3S2 on NF and the simultaneous presence of the surface Co(OH)(2) along with the highly conducting Co9S8-Ni3S2 core, which facilitates the adsorption of the reactants and subsequently its conversion into the gaseous products during water electrolysis.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000536354300001	32363666

However, there is much disagreement regarding which N doping sites are most desirable for the reaction. Here, we report an experimental and computational study to identify the efficient active sites in NCNTs for ORR in alkaline media. In our experiments, we synthesized NCNTs of similar overall N content (similar to 4.1%) and carbon matrix but varying percentages of different types of N doping species. Our results reveal a positive correlation between ORR activity and the content of graphitic N doping. Furthermore, we performed density functional theory calculations to predict the free energy evolution of ORR on various N doping sites in NCNTs. Our computational results also indicate that graphitic N doping sites exhibit higher thermodynamic limiting potential for ORR than pyridinic N doping sites. Our combined experimental and theoretical study concludes that graphitic N doping sites are more efficient for ORR than pyridinic N doping in NCNTs.									16	2	0	0	0	0	17			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000529225800025

Specifically, by controlling the substrate temperature during Ar+ irradiation, the surface morphology and oxygen vacancy density of rutile TiO2 (1 1 0) could be modified, such that the effects of surface crystallinity, optical absorption and electrical properties of TiO2 could be compared for OER. We found that the intrinsic activity of TiO2 for PEC OER does not exhibit a scaling relationship with respect to the density of oxygen vacancy, optical adsorption or charge carrier concentration. Rather, a linear relationship could be observed between the photocurrent density and the interfacial charge-transport conductivity. Furthermore, ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) was used to investigate the effect of low-energy Ar+ irradiation on the interaction between TiO2 and water. It was demonstrated that using single crystal model systems with controlled properties, this study has thus provided a clear yet detailed analysis on key factors in tuning the photoelectrochemical performance of TiO2.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000608509400003

However, the rational design of MOFs-based electrocatalysts and fundamental understanding of their structural evolution during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remain critical challenges. Here, we report a facile approach to tune the structural transformation process of the Co-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) during the OER process by using water molecules as a vacancy promoter. The modified ZIF catalyst accelerates the structural transformation from MOF precursor to electrochemical active species and simultaneously enhances the vacancy density during the electrochemical activation process. The optimized electrocatalyst exhibits an extremely low overpotential 175 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) and superior durability (100 h) at 100 mA cm(-2). The comprehensive characterization results reveal the structural transformation from the initial tetrahedral Co sites to cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) and the formation process of oxygen vacancies (CoOOH-VO) at a high anodic potential. These findings represent a promising way to achieve highly active MOF-based electrocatalysts for water oxidation.

It has been found that, in the case of a partial combustion of coal (under conditions of O-2 deficiency), the yield of hydrogen-enriched products increases owing to heat evolution. Under conditions of excess O-2, coal undergoes complete oxidation. In this case, the heat evolved per unit volume of furnace space is about 1.0 MW/m(3). It has been shown that the heat consumed for the implementation of the process using external sources can be partially or completely compensated for by heat evolution during homogeneous and heterogeneous combustion coupled with coal thermolysis.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1990-7931	1990-7923		WOS:000397596200014

Herein, we report one-step growth of nitrogen-decorated iron-nickel sulfide nanosheetarrays on a conductive Ni-Fe alloy foam (N-(Ni, Fe)(3)S-2/NIF). It is noteworthy that N-(Ni, Fe) S-3(2)/NIF has an ultra-low overpotential of 167 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits the best OER performance among the non-precious electrocatalysts reported so far. Furthermore, N-(Ni, Fe)(3)S-2/NIF shows nearly no degradation after a long-term OER test for 50 h at a constant current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The superior catalytic activity and stability for the OER is due to the application of simultaneous regulation of specific morphologies, incorporation of Fe, and surface nitrogen-anion decoration on Ni3S2 materials. In addition, N-(Ni, Fe)(3)S-2/NIF prepared by another method also shows excellent OER activity. This work will pave a new way to develop advanced electrocatalysts with a lower OER overpotential.									42	2	0	0	1	0	42			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431506600012

Electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability need to be further improved for these types of electrodes. A highly porous and well-adhered electrodeposited SiO2 (e-SiO2) film is proposed as the interlayer in this work to meet the above-mentioned requirements. The results show that the active oxide fully fills in the porous network throughout the whole thickness of the e-SiO2 film, to form "total-depth" highly porous oxide electrocatalytic coatings. For this reason, more than 1 order of magnitude higher apparent activity towards the OER at the Ti/e-SiO2/IrO2 (or RuO2) electrode is achieved compared to that of the conventional Ti/IrO2 or Ti/RuO2 electrode. Literature survey indicates that these novel electrodes are one of the most active Ti electrodes ever reported. The service life of this type of electrode is also obviously enhanced due to the "inter-locking" structure formed between the active oxide layer and e-SiO2 film.									23	2	0	0	0	0	24			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000381505100042

And for most SACs, single metal atoms were anchored on carbon materials with N or C coordination. However, the rational design of oxygen-containing SACs and analyzing its structure-performance relationship remain challenging. Herein, we used amino-rich compounds to tailor the metatungstate and fix the W atoms and finally obtained the oxygen-containing W-SACs. The structural evolution of tungsten and its coordination atoms were tracked by electrospray ionization high-definition mass spectrometry. Furthermore, aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy, and first-principles calculation results revealed that different from the traditional SACs, the WO2N2 moiety (W coordinated with two O atoms and two N atoms) may be the favored structure for W species. This special structure promoted the energy transfer for enhancing singlet oxygen generation. This work presents an efficient way to prepare more highefficiency SACs by atomic-scale tailoring and structural evolution tracking at the molecular level.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000685245800045	34333965

Here, we prepared novel core-shell Fe,V-NiSe2@NiFe(OH)(x) heterostructured nanoparticles on hydrophilic-treated carbon paper with high electronic transport and large surface area for accelerating the oxygen evolution rate via high-temperature selenization and electrochemical anodic oxidation procedures. Performance testing shows that Fe,V-NiSe2@NiFe(OH)(x) possesses the highest performance for OER compared to as-prepared diselenide core-derived heterojunctions, which only require an overpotential of 243 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 91.6 mV decade(-1) under basic conditions. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirm the morphology and elementary stabilities of Fe,V-NiSe2@NiFe(OH)(x) after long-term chronopotentiometric testing. These advantages are largely because of the strong synergistic effect between the Fe,V-NiSe2 core with high conductivity and the amorphous NiFe(OH)(x) shell with enriched defects and vacancies. This study also presents a general approach to designing and synthesizing more active core-shell heterojunction electrocatalysts for OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000870259000001	36223409

Nevertheless, their conclusions do not frequently lead to devising superior "real-world" catalysts. For instance, this is true for single-crystal platinum electrodes and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), an important reaction for sustainable energy conversion. Pt(111) is substantially enhanced by steps, reaching a maximum at short terrace lengths of 3-4 atoms. Conversely, regular platinum nanoparticles with similar undercoordinated defects are less active than Pt(111) and their activity increases alongside the terrace-to-defect ratio. We show here that a model to design ORR active sites on extended surfaces can also be used to solve this apparent contradiction and provide accurate design rules for nanoparticles. Essentially, only surfaces and nanostructures with concave defects can surpass the activity of Pt(111), whereas convex defects are inactive. Importantly, only the latter are present in regular nanoparticles, which is why we design various concave nanoparticles with high activities.									138	5	0	0	6	0	139			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000395906900076	28451330

Herein, we report a 1 T-WS2 in ultrathin nanosheet arrays grafted with Co4S3 on conductive carbon cloth (CC) (1 T-Co4S3-WS2/CC) through a feasible in-situ growth and vulcanization. The optimized 1 T-Co4S3-WS2/CC catalyst exhibits an impressive electrocatalytic activity and remarkable stability with the oxygen/hydrogen evolution reaction (OER/ HER: 278/75 mV for 10 mA cm-2). It also showed the small Tafel slope values of 61.7 and 58.4 mV dec-1, respectively. Additionally, the 1 T-Co4S3-WS2/CC(-/+) achieved 1.59 V@10 mA cm-2 in alkaline media superior to the most previously reported non-precious metal electrocatalysts. The outstanding performance could be attributed to the synergy between heterostructures of Co4S3 and 1 TWS2 modifying the electronic structure to accelerate water splitting kinetics. Thus, this work presents a rational design of scalable, high-efficiency, stable water splitting electrocatalysts based on WS2. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we report on a nanoarchitectured material composed of Fe3C nanoparticles encapsulated at the tip of nitrogen-enriched carbon nanotubes (NCNTs), which are aligned on one dimensional (1D) nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (Fe3C@NCNTs-NCNFs) by a scalable electrospinning technique, as a high performance OER catalyst. The unique 3D hierarchical architecture of Fe3C@NCNTs-NCNFs leads to highly exposed active sites, enhanced electron transfer properties and strong synergistic coupled effects. Fe3C@NCNTs-NCNFs exhibit an outstanding catalytic performance with a high current density (10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 284 mV), a low Tafel slope (56 mV dec(-1)), a low charge transfer resistance and strong durability in 1 M KOH solution. The electrochemical evaluation demonstrates that the Fe3C@ NCNTs-NCNF composite is a promising electrocatalyst for the OER in alkaline solution.									84	10	0	0	6	0	86			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000411739700014

This brief review will summarize the latest progress on hematite, designed with columnar morphology via chemical synthesis, for photoelectrochemical cell application. The columnar morphology efficiently minimizes the number of defects, grain boundaries, and surface traps normally present on the planar morphology. The major drawback related to hole diffusion through the solid/liquid interface was addressed by using high annealing temperature combined with dopant addition. A critical view and depth of understanding of these two parameters were discussed focusing on the molecular oxygen evolution mechanism from the sunlight-driven water oxidation reaction.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			0001-3765	1678-2690		WOS:000431760100010	29742209

The introduction of N2H4 modulates the density of Co2+ anchored on the surface of GO by adjusting the number of oxygen functional groups for Co2+/GO composites and then controls the thickness and electronic valence of Co3O4 nanosheets during subsequent pyrolysis in air. As a result, the optimized 2D p-Co3O4 NSs have ultrathin thickness, abundant hierarchical porous structure, and a high Co3+/Co2+ ratio. As expected, it exhibits excellent OER catalytic performance in 1 M KOH solutions, affording a lower overpotential of 1.50 V at 10.0 mA cm(-2) and robust stability compared to pristine Co3O4 and RuO2 as a benchmark. The outstanding OER catalytic activity is ascribed to its N2H4 induced ultrathin 2D structure with abundant hierarchical pores and a high Co3+/Co2+ ratio. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the ultrathin layer Co3O4 nanosheets with a high ratio of Co3+/Co2+ enhance the OER activity through promoting the dissociation of water to OH* and accelerating kinetics of OER in alkaline media.									30	4	0	0	3	0	30			2168-0485			WOS:000548456600023

Palladium is known as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst in Li-O-2 cathode to reduce the charge overpotential and exhibit stable cycling performance. On the other hand, MnO2 is an attractive, functional transition metal oxide catalyst in Li-O-2 batteries due to its low cost, high catalytic activity, and good oxygen reduction behavior. This study integrates the synergic effects of alpha-MnO2 nanowires and palladium nanoparticles by decorating on graphene sheets to improve cyclability and capacity to obtain highly efficient performance of Li-O-2 cells. As-prepared rGO/Pd/alpha-MnO2 hybrid nanocomposite cathode indicates an initial discharge capacity of 7500 mA h g(-1) and stable cycle life for 50 cycles at a limited capacity of 800 mA h g(-1). As a result, although the polarization of the cell dramatically decreases and stable capacity behavior is observed with the contribution of alpha-MnO2 and Pd catalysts, the limited stable cycle life of 50 is obtained due to the consumption of lithium metal which causes total capacity failure after 60 cycles.

Herein, uniform CeF3/alpha-FeOOH nanohybrids are synthesized by one-step hydrothermal process. The obtained CeF3/alpha-FeOOH nanohybrids exhibit a significantly high photocatalytic oxygen-evolution activity with sacrifice reagent free. The optimal CeF3/alpha-FeOOH-400 nanohybrid reaches a remarkable rate up to 4702.5 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which is 2.6 times higher than that of CeF3/alpha-FeOOH-0 nanohybrid. The recycling experiments further indicate its potential in oxygen evolution. The metal-like alpha-FeOOH may improve the electron transfer, act as electron collection to store the electron transferred from CeF3, and suppress the recombination of electron-hole pairs in CeF3 effectively. This work provides an insight into the construction of effective photocatalysts with improved charge separation for overall water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-7350			WOS:000695521800001

Cobalt selenide (Co3Se4) has always been considered as a promising electrocatalyst for the OER due to the well-suited electronic configuration of the Co ions in it. However, poor exposure of the active sites and low electron conductivity are still its biggest problems. In this study, we report an efficient Ni-doped rod-like Co3Se4 hybridized with reduced graphene oxide (Ni-Co3Se4/rGO) as an OER electrocatalyst. The Ni doping regulates the electronic structure of Co3Se4 and significantly reduces the overpotential of Co3Se4 toward the OER under alkaline conditions. Simultaneously, hybridization of the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) enhances the conductivity which leads to the improvement in OER activity. The Ni-Co3Se4/rGO catalyst shows a lower overpotential (284 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) as well as a Tafel slope (71 mV dec(-1)), which outperformed the benchmark of commercial RuO2. Moreover, Ni-Co3Se4/rGO also shows high stability and long-term durability.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000619559900026	33543742

However, the instability of coordination bonds during exfoliation results in great difficulties in their preparation and characterization. This work takes advantage of the anisotropy of coordination bonds in three-dimensional (3D) pillared-layer MOFs and selectively breaks the interlayer bonding through substitution of the pillared ligands by capping solvent molecules synergized with sonication in a solvent over a relatively short time course (30 min), thus leading to single-layer metal-organic nanosheets, which retain the 2D layered structure of the original crystalline counterpart. The as-synthesized single-layer metal-organic nanosheets are efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a turnover frequency as high as 0.144 s(-1) and 0.294 s(-1) at overpotentials of 400 mV and 500 mV in neutral electrolyte media, respectively, which are higher than other heterogeneous catalysts.									37	2	0	0	0	0	37			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000515391000005	31989144

Converting massive spent adsorbents into efficient electrocatalysts with a facile strategy can address the challenge of growing energy demand and achieving carbon neutral goal. Herein, we demonstrated a "spent adsorbents to heterostructured electrocatalysts" conversion strategy based on the "waste-to-wealth" principle. Via a facile boriding process, the metal ions laden biocharbased spent adsorbents (SA) have been totally transformed into magnetic metal borides/biochar heterostructures, which exhibit excellent activities towards oxygen evolution reaction. The optimized NiCuFeB/SA catalyst takes a low overpotential of 251 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming many Ni/Fe-based catalysts synthesized from commercial material resources. Comprehensive analyses suggest the high catalytic efficiency mainly attributes to the porous biochar confined well-dispersed nano-sized metallic borides, the in-situ evolved active metal (oxy)hydroxides, favourable charge-transfer kinetics, as well as the heterostructure and amorphous feature. This work offers a general strategy to efficiently reutilize the spent metal bearing biochar-based adsorbents, which can be extended to advanced energy applications-oriented reutilization of other metal-contaminated solid wastes in an economically and environmental-benign manner.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			0921-3449	1879-0658		WOS:000767524900007

Herein, we report a controllable N-doping strategy to synthesize a series of N-doped porous metallic NiMoO4 nanowires with concomitant oxygen vacancy defects (N-V-o-NiMoO4 NWs) for promoting the alkaline HER ability and durability. Both experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the doped-N at NiO6 octahedral sites and the abundant oxygen vacancy defects confined in N-V-o-NiMoO4 NWs with modified electronic arrangement could enhance the metallic conductivity, affect the surface areas, and lower the adsorption energy of hydrogen, resulting in an increased HER property. However, the excess doped-N leads to an opposite effect due to the reduced valence state of Ni centres. Therefore, alkaline HER ability of N-V-o-NiMoO4 NWs exhibits a volcano-like trend vs. the nitrogen content, with N-3-V-o-NiMoO4 NWs being the best one. As a result, the N-3-V-o-NiMoO4 NWs show nearly zero onset overpotential, an overpotential of 55 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) , and a Tafel slope of only 38 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH, which are superior to those of state-of-the-art platinum-free electrocatalysts.									22	2	0	0	0	0	23			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000448419900018	30156249

HE-NCM shows a unique voltage plateau at around 4.5 V in the first charge, which is often attributed to a decomposition reaction of the Li-rich component Li2MnO3. For this so-called "activation", it has been hypothesized that the electrochemically inactive Li2MnO3 would convert into MnO2 while lattice oxide ions are oxidized and released as O-2 (or even CO2) from the host structure. However, qualitative and quantitative examination of the O-2 and CO2 evolution during the first charge shows that the onset of both reactions is above the 4.5 V voltage plateau and that the amount of released oxygen is an order of magnitude too low to be consistent with the commonly assumed Li2MnO3 activation. Instead, the amount of released oxygen can be correlated to a structural rearrangement of the active material which occurs at the end of the first charge. In this process, oxygen depletion from the HE-NCM host structure leads to the formation of a spinel-like phase. This phase transformation is restricted to the near-surface region of the HE-NCM particles due to the poor mobility of oxide ions within the bulk. From the evolved amount of O-2 and CO2, the thickness of the spinel-like surface layer was estimated to be on the order of approximate to 2-3 nm, in excellent agreement with previously reported (S) TEM data.

Unfortunately, they generally show a laggard oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, which results in a lethargic charging performance in rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Here porous S-doped Fe-N-C nanosheets are innovatively synthesized utilizing a scalable FeCl3-encapsulated-porphyra precursor pyrolysis strategy. The obtained electrocatalyst exhibits ultrahigh ORR activity (E-1/2 = 0.84 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) and impressive OER performance (E-j= 10 = 1.64 V). The potential gap (Delta E = E-j= 10 - E-1/2) is 0.80 V, outperforming that of most highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date. Furthermore, the key role of S involved in the atomically dispersed Fe-Nx species on the enhanced ORR and OER activities is expounded for the first time by ultrasound-assisted extraction of the exclusive S source (taurine) from porphyra. Moreover, the assembled rechargeable Zn-air battery comprising this bifunctional electrocatalyst exhibits higher power density (225.1 mW cm(-2)) and lower charging-discharging overpotential (1.00 V, 100 mA cm(-2) compared to Pt/C + RuO2 catalyst). The design strategy can expand the utilization of earth-abundant biomaterial-derived catalysts, and the mechanism investigations of S doping on the structure-activity relationship can inspire the progress of other functional electrocatalysts.									196	22	0	0	11	1	201			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000471711300016	31058413

One of the best electrocatalysts for the OER is the self-supported nickel-iron layered double hydroxides on iron foam (NiFe-LDH@IF) prepared by corrosion engineering. However, the further development of NiFe-LDH@IF is hampered by a lack of understanding regarding the growth mechanism and the effects of corrosion conditions on the electrocatalytic activity. Herein, the growth mechanism is studied, revealing for the first time that NiFe-LDH@IF is formed by the preferential precipitation of NiFe-LDH on the NiFe-alloy cathode around which the local pH is high due to the reduction of dissolved oxygen. Guided by this growth mechanism, it is found that corrosion conditions mainly affect the electrocatalytic activity of NiFe-LDH@IF via changing the amount of alpha-FeOOH and NiFe-LDH along with the Fe2+-doping level of NiFe-LDH. With the aid of these findings, corrosion conditions are optimized and the prepared NiFe-LDH@IF exhibits the best reported comprehensive electrocatalytic performance. More importantly, the growth mechanism of NiFe-LDH@IF can be generalized to various self-supported LDH on different substrates prepared by corrosion engineering.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000721768200001

This makes fringelite D and concomitantly the related stentorin and blepharismin pigments better suited for the photosensory transduction chain where, as shown recently, an initial proton expulsion reaction plays the fundamental role. Thus, in organisms using these photosensory pigments the production of deleterious oxygen species becomes diminished as compared to hypericin. In addition it was found that complexation with albumin further inhibits bilirubin destruction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0026-9247	1434-4475		WOS:000165525800007

The current efficiency for hydrogen evolution increases with higher concentration and is in the same range on both, polycrystalline Au and Au(111) electrode. The onset potentials and half-wave potentials are higher on Au(111). Reaction orders for the faradaic current on the bare gold electrodes have been determined as 0.21 for higher and 0.76 for lower concentrations. Reaction orders for hydrogen evolution during formaldehyde oxidation are 1.4 times higher in each case. Tafel slopes in the range of 140-160 mV are found. This signifies that the first reaction step involving the formation of adsorbed hydrogen is largely determining the overall reaction rate. In the presence of thallium adlayers hydrogen evolution from formaldehyde oxidation is largely suppressed. On the thallium modified polycrystalline Au, formaldehyde oxidation is shifted for 100 mV to higher potentials where Tl is partially desorbed and hydroxide is coadsorbed on the modified surface. On thallium modified Au(111), a similar process takes place, but in the same potential region as the onset of formaldehyde oxidation on the bare surface and therefore the formaldehyde oxidation is only slightly shifted. Tafel slopes are decreased to 80 mV/dec in the presence of thallium. In the presence of adsorbed thallium, the first reaction step is in equilibrium, the coverage with adsorbed hydrogen is smaller and its recombination to H-2 is largely suppressed.

Catalytic formic acid oxidation in an aqueous environment was employed as the test reaction. Pre-illuminating Au/TiO2 with UV light can amplify the catalytic formic acid oxidation rate by up to four times with the degree of enhancement governed by system parameters such as Au loading, pre-illumination time, and initial formic acid loading. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy and electrochemical assessment of the Au/TiO2 indicated light pre-illumination invokes photoexcited electron transfer from the TiO2 support to the Au deposits. The Au deposits then utilise the additional electrons to catalyse molecular oxygen activation and promote the oxidation reaction. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy analysis and first principle calculations indicated the Au deposits introduced new electronic states above the TiO2 valence band. The new electronic states were most intense at the Au-TiO2 interface suggesting the Au deposit: TiO2 perimeter may be the key region for oxygen activation. The current study has demonstrated that pre-illuminating Au/TiO2 with light can be used to augment reactions where oxygen activation is a critical component, such as for the oxidation of organic pollutants and for the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells or energy storage systems.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000389224400001

TIT alone, as reported previously, can reduce O-2 slowly via a four-electron transfer pathway to produce water. Herein we show that H2TPP can catalyze the reduction of O-2 by TTF to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at the water/DCE interface, which was investigated by voltammetry and biphasic shake-flask experiments. The overall process was found to be essentially a proton-coupled electron transfer reaction. And the results also proved that the catalytic activity of H2TPP toward O-2 reduction under acid condition arises from the polarization activation of O-2 by H2TPP diacid, namely H4TPP2+.

Therefore, rationally tailoring adsorption energy of intermediates on TMOs to achieve desirable catalytic performance still remains a great challenge. Here we show the identification of a general and tunable surface structure, coordinatively unsaturated metal cation (M-CUS), as a good surface reactivity descriptor for TMOs in OER. Surface reactivity of a given TMO increases monotonically with the density of M-CUS, and thus the increase in M-CUS improves the catalytic activity for weak-binding TMOs but impairs that for strong-binding ones. The electronic origin of the surface reactivity can be well explained by a new model proposed in this work, wherein the energy of the highest-occupied d-states relative to the Fermi level determines the intermediates' bonding strength by affecting the filling of the antibonding states. Our model for the first time well describes the reactivity trends among TMOs, and would initiate viable design principles for, but not limited to, OER catalysts.									241	4	0	0	12	0	241			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000381332300035	27441842

The anodic branch of the cyclic voltammogram is characterized by one anodic dissolution peak and a passivation region before oxygen evolution. The cathodic branch shows only one cathodic reduction peak corresponding to the reduction of HNO3. Analysis of the anodic polarization data shows features of both reversible and irreversible reactions pointing to the complexity of the system. Cl- ions enhance the active dissolution of nickel in HNO3 due to the adsorption on the bare metal surface and cause destruction of the passive film and initiation of pitting corrosion.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000225920200019

Herein, we use silica as a radical sieve to grow graphene over cobalt NPs via chemical vapor deposition. As-prepared single-layer graphene-coated cobalt NPs with and without N doping (Co@N-SG and Co@SG) exhibit noticeable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Furthermore, a magnet-assisted binder-free Co@N-SG electrode illustrates much improved OER activity and stability over conventional binder-assisted counterparts, suggesting this as an effective way to overcome the recognized issues of high electron transfer resistance and poor adhesion of binder-based electrodes in practical applications. Interestingly, the graphene shell possesses varying defects and major OER benefitting active sites are found around said defects in the shell, while separately isolated Co@SG with a defect-free shell, despite exhibiting a slightly lower initial activity, illustrates a much-improved durable OER performance. The underlying Co affects the electron density of the graphene shell through dipole interaction and the electron density is optimized for adsorption of reaction intermediates, hence accelerating OER performance. This work will provide new clues to design efficient and durable electrocatalysts with further enhanced OER performance.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000651427300001

This paper provides an overview of recently developed materials for aluminum-air batteries to be used in various elements, including the anode, air cathode and electrolyte. Aluminum can be alloyed with other active metal elements such as Tin (Sn), Indium (In), Gallium (Ga) and Zinc (Zn). Its binary and tertiary alloys demonstrate improved battery performance. Bifunctional air cathodes fabricated using oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, CoO/N-CNT with oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, Ni-Fe-layered double hydroxide/CNT and MnO2/N-CNT yield excellent results. With regard to electrolytes, several types have been considered: aqueous, nonaqueous, aprotic solvent and solid-state electrolytes. The addition of corrosion inhibitors to an aqueous electrolyte helps to enhance battery performance, whereas non-aqueous and aprotic solvent electrolytes can be used to prevent hydrogen evolution. Polymer electrolytes can overcome the battery leakage problem. As a conclusion, the future research trends related to this type of battery have also been indicated.

It was found that the temperature of semi-inactivation of O-2 evolution, which coincided with Mn2+ release, declined from 45 degrees C to 40 degrees C and 34 degrees C in this series of preparations, in accordance with the decreased structural stability of OEC. This was paralleled by a decrease in the content of light harvesting complex (LHC) and by an increase in the accessibility of OEC to hydrophilic electron accepters. Thermoinactivation processes were accompanied by a two-fold decrease in PSII particle size on the EF(s) surface of membrane fragments. A ''bi-core'' oxygen-evolving complex model is proposed to account for these findings.									26	1	2	0	21	0	29			1039-9712			WOS:A1995TB59100011	7492961

At first, this paper introduces the significance of constructing nanoarrays for gas evolution reactions: Constructing electrocatalyst with nanoarray structure can provide superaerophobic surface, which can lower the bubble adhesive force and bubble size by forming a discontinuous triple phase contact line (TPCL), and that can facilitate the release of gas, while it can afford abundant active sites, and that can enhance the activity and stability for gas evolution reactions. Then, we review the activity (including <= 1.49 V), and stability (including >= 100 h) for overall water splitting in alkaline medium of various kinds of recently reported earth-abundant 3D nanoarray bifunctional electrocatalysts. Later, we review the efficient strategies such as constructing nanoarrays with doping metals/heteroatoms, bi- metallic/multi-metallic materials, metal oxides, metal phosphide/phosphate, metal nitrides, carbon, amorphous materials, metal chalcogenides (metal sulfides and selenides), coreshell/hetero/hollow structure, vacancies/defects, and well-matched electrode pair to achieve efficient overall water splitting. Then, we review the construction of earth-abundant nanoarray bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient overall water splitting in acid medium. Finally, we discussed the gas separation in water electrolysis.									83	1	0	0	5	0	83			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000463960000001

The effectiveness model is known to accurately predict the current generation performance of SOFC electrodes, by considering the complex reaction/transport processes that occur within thin active functional layers near the electrolyte. After validation tests, the two-dimensional simulation model was used to calculate the distribution of current density and oxygen concentration transverse to the flow channel in anode-supported SOFCs, with which the oxygen depletion characteristics were investigated in detail. In addition, simulations were also conducted to determine the minimum number of grids required in the transverse direction to efficiently obtain accurate results.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1226-4881			WOS:000408437700005

The as-obtained WS2/Ni exhibit high performances for water oxidation in 1.0 M NaOH solution, which are much superior to those of the state-of-the-art RuO2/Ni and previously reported oxygen evolution catalysts. The WS2/Ni electrocatalyst manifests the high performance, displaying a very low overpotential of 0.335 V at 20.0 mA cm(-2) and much improved durability.

However, the exact mechanism of lithium (de)insertion in those materials, especially the reactions involving the redox of lattice oxygen, is still elusive. In this paper the structural and electrochemical properties of a high performance cathode material (Li[Li0.2Mn0.6Ni0.1Co0.1]O-2) are investigated with special attention focused on the TM and oxygen ion contributions in electrochemical processes. The detailed description of the structural, electronic and electrochemical properties of nano-Li[Li0.2Mn0.6Ni0.1Co0.1]O(2)during lithium (de)insertion are determined by means of electrochemical investigation as well asex situXAFS and operando XRD measurements. The obtained results show the correlation of the changes in the electronic structure of the materials with specific structural rearrangements andC2/m -> R3m <-> Fd3mphase transitions. This paper shows the detailed analysis of the origins of the high capacity and low capacity fade of Li-rich layered oxides conditioned by the reversibility of the Li ion removal thanks to oxygen redox reactions as well as the migration of transition metal ions in the Li sublattice.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000569873400022

The reduced Fe0.79Mn0.21Nb0.16Ta0.84O6 (CTr) electrocatalyst shows a low overpotential of 84.23 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 103.7 achieved at 20 mA cm(-2) current density in situ for the HER and OER, respectively. The electrocatalyst also exhibited low Tafel slopes of 104.97 mV/dec for the HER and 57.67 mV/dec for the OER, verifying their rapid catalytic kinetics. The electrolyzer maintained a cell voltage of 1.5 V and potential-time stability close to that of Pt/C and RuO2. Complementary first-principles density functional theory calculations identify the Mn sites as most active sites on the Fe0.75Mn0.25Ta1.875Nb0.125O6 (100) surface, predicting a moderate Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H*) approximate to 0.08 eV) and a low overpotential of eta = 0.47 V.

The morphology of perovskite crystals was studied by SEM, whereas obtained microphotographs implied porous microstructure. The conductivity of both perovskite series spanned in the range of semiconductors as revealed from electrical measurements. The electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction, oxidation of hydrogen peroxide, and methanol was studied in alkaline solutions by cyclic voltammetry. The influence of electronic, structural and morphological factors to the electrical and electrocatalytic properties is discussed.

Herein the catalyst's electronic structure is tuned by doping vanadium ions into the NiFe LDHs laminate forming ternary NiFeV LDHs to reduce the onset potential, achieving unprecedentedly efficient electrocatalysis for water oxidation. Only 1.42 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), approximate to 195 mV overpotential) is required to achieve catalytic current density of 20 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution, which manifests the best of NiFe-based catalysts reported till now. Electrochemical analysis and density functional theory +U simulation indicate that the high catalytic activity of NiFeV LDHs mainly attributes to the vanadium doping which can modify the electronic structure and narrow the bandgap thereby bring enhanced conductivity, facile electron transfer, and abundant active sites.									446	28	0	0	29	0	451			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000434031400024

The obtained CuWO4/BiVO4 exhibited high catalytic activity toward photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. When cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) was coupled with CuWO4/BiVO4, the activity of the resulting CuWO4/BiVO4/Co-Pi composite for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was further improved. The photocurrent density (Jph) for OER on CuWO4/BiVO4/Co-Pi is among the highest reported on a CuWO4-based photoanode in a neutral solution. The high activity for the PEC OER was attributed to the high specific surface area of the composite, the formation of a CuWO4/BiVO4 heterojunction that accelerated electron-hole separation, and the coupling of the Co-Pi co-catalyst with CuWO4/BiVO4, which improved the charge transfer rate across composite/solution interface.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2073-4344			WOS:000454711500095

Meanwhile, the compressible flexibility of a battery is the prerequisite of wearable or/and portable electronics. Herein, we present a strategy via single-site dispersion of an Fe-N-x, species on a two-dimensional (2D) highly graphitic porous nitrogen-doped carbon layer to implement superior catalytic activity toward ORR/OER (with a half-wave potential of 0.86 V for ORR and an overpotential of 390 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) for OER) in an alkaline medium. Furthermore, an elastic polyacrylamide hydrogel based electrolyte with the capability to retain great elasticity even under a highly corrosive alkaline environment is utilized to develop a solid-state compressible and rechargeable zinc-air battery. The creatively developed battery has a low charge discharge voltage gap (0.78 V at 5 mA.cm(-2)) and large power density (118 mA.cm(-2)). It could be compressed up to 54% strain and bent up to 90 without charge/discharge performance and output power degradation. Our results reveal that single-site dispersion of catalytic active sites on a porous support for a bifunctional oxygen catalyst as cathode integrating a specially designed elastic electrolyte is a feasible strategy for fabricating efficient compressible and rechargeable zinc-air batteries, which could enlighten the design and development of other functional electronic devices.									263	21	0	0	4	0	269			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000426615600109	29432686

Facile Synthesis of Transition-Metal-Doped (Fe, Co, and Ni) CuS/CuO/CS Nanorod Arrays for Superior Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction								ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS											10.1021/acsaem.2c01384		OCT 2022			2022	Electrochemical water splitting is a promising way to produce sustainable, renewable, and clean H-2 fuel. The anodic half-reaction of electrochemical water splitting, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) lowers the overall efficiency of the system due to this four-electron process with sluggish reaction kinetics. The state-of-the-art catalysts for OER are based on precious metals (Ru and Ir). In this article, transition-metal-doped (Fe, Co, and Ni) CuS/CuO nanorod arrays on copper sheet (CS) substrates were synthesized for the first time via the facile solvothermal method, and the electrocatalytic activity of the synthesized material toward OER in alkaline media was investigated. Fe-doped CuS/CuO/CS showed superior electrochemical performance with an overpotential of only 340 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) current density. The OER performance of the material was compared with the state-of-the-art catalyst for RuO2/CS. The overpotential of RuO2/CS was 320 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) current density which is only 20 mV lower than the state-of-the-art catalyst. The enhancement of the OER activity was obtained by valence regulation upon doping Fe3+ and Fe2+ into CuS/CuO/CS nanorod arrays (NAs). The charge transfer resistance was lowered from 10.2 Omega/cm(2) for pristine CuS/CuO/CS NA to 1.2 Omega/cm(2) upon Fe doping. The electrochemically active surface area was increased from 36 to 51 cm(EcsA)(2) upon Fe doping. The Fe-doped CuS/CuO/CS shows an exceptionally high turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.68 s(-1). The catalyst was stable up to 1000 cycles of OER over 10 h. The increase in electrical conductivity, increase in electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), and creation of defect sites leading to preferential absorption of OH- upon Fe doping led to enhanced OER activity of Fe-CuS/CuO/CS. This is the first report of an Fe-doped CuS/CuO/CS nanoarray that shows superior OER activity with high TOF and excellent stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000869712700001

Although promising strides have been made in this area, the tunability and implementation of cost-effective metal-based 3D-printed electrodes is a challenge. Herein, a straightforward method is reported to produce bimetallic 3D-printed electrodes with built-in noble metal catalysts via galvanic replacement. For this goal, a commercially available copper/polylactic acid composite filament has been exploited for the fabrication of Cu-based 3D-printed electrodes (3D-Cu) using fused filament fabrication (FFF) technology. The subsequent electroless deposition of an active noble metal catalyst (viz. Pd) onto the 3D-Cu surface has been carried out via galvanic exchange. A detailed electrochemical study run by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) has revealed that the resulting bimetallic 3D-PdCu electrode exhibits enhanced capabilities by energy conversion related reactions -hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)- when compared with the monometallic 3D-Cu counterpart. Thus, this simple functionalization approach provides a custom way for manufacturing functional metal-based 3D-printed electronics harboring noble metal catalysts to improve energy-converting applications on-demand and beyond.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000816053200001

Herein, a facile one-step dealloying strategy was proposed to synthesize mesoporous CoFe-based oxides and layered double hydroxides (LDHs). Benefitting from the fast mass transfer and more active sites caused by the open mesoporous structure, the CoFe-based materials exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activities and stability towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline electrolyte (1 M KOH). The CoFe-LDH catalyst only needs an overpotential of 0.286 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), and a small Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1) for the OER. Moreover, an alkaline electrolyzer was constructed with the CoFe-LDH as both the anode and cathode. The electrolyzer delivers a current density of 10 mA cm (2) at a voltage of 1.69 V toward overall water splitting in the 1 M KOH solution.									50	5	0	0	2	0	50			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000414349100042	29063927

The results obtained lead to the conclusion that under low irradiances all chlorophyll molecules are in a state to perform charge separation (photochemical) reaction, while under increased irradiances the essential part of the reaction centres are blocked and only one reaction centre from 500-600 remains in functionally active state, i.e. in the range of the value obtained by the founders of the widely accepted concept of photosynthetic units.									3	0	0	0	4	0	4			0939-5075			WOS:000271046000001	19791495

The mechanisms of the Pb2+ toxicity are not well understood for photosynthesis. In this paper, we reported the effect of Pb2+ on light absorption, distribution and conversion of spinach chloroplast by spectroscopy, and photochemical reaction activities. Several effects of Pb2+ were observed: (1) the absorption peak intensity of chloroplast obviously decreased in red and blue region and produced optical flattering; (2) fluorescence quantum yield nearby 680 nm of chloroplast greatly declined; (3) the excitation band nearby 440 nm of chloroplast significantly descended; (4) Pb2+ treatments reduced of the rate of whole chain electron transport, photochemical activities of PSII DCPIP photoreduction and oxygen evolution, but the photoreduction activities of PSI were little changed. Together, the studies of the experiments showed that Pb2+ decreased absorption of light on spinach chloroplast and inhibited excitation energy to be absorbed by LHCII and transferred to PSII, then reduced the conversion from light energy to electron energy, and decelerated electron transport, water photolysis and oxygen evolution.

In this study, we composed an iron-based binary diselenide-derived oxide (Fe-SDO) with a facile one-step hydrothermal method to utilize the earth-abundant iron and the probably prosperous catalytic performance of metal-selenides compounds. The catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 226 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), a Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1), and robust durability after catalyzing vigorous OER for 36 h constantly. Through several analytical methods conducted before and after the oxygen evolution reaction activation on FeSe2 it was discovered that such catalyst possessed a morphology as "Cuju"-like balls with porosity inside in which we explored the vacancy defects and lattice distortion that play significant roles in generating the high electrocatalytic performance of our proposed catalyst by inducing conductivity in the porous Cuju balls (a Chinese traditional football). Throughout our work the superb electrocatalyst performance of the iron-based compounds was demonstrated, and subsequently the underlying reason for such electrocatalyst performance was addressed, which may push boundaries for the exploration of iron-based compounds as OER catalyst and large-scale commercial application of such compounds in the future.									46	2	0	0	3	0	47			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000416614600053	29111645

NiFe sulfides show promising OER activity but are troubled by their low intrinsic conductivities. Herein, we demonstrate the construction of the porous core-shell heterojunctions of FeNi3@(Fe,Ni)S-2 with tunable shell thickness via the reduction of hierarchical NiFe(OH)(x) nanosheets followed by a partial sulfidization. The conductive FeNi3 core provides the highway for electron transport, and the (Fe,Ni)S-2 shell offers the exposed surface for in situ generation of S-doped NiFe-oxyhydroxides with high intrinsic OER activity, which is supported by the combined experimental and theoretical studies. In addition, the porous hierarchical morphology favors the electrolyte access and O-2 liberation. Consequently, the optimized catalyst achieves an excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 288 mV at 100 mA.cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 48 mV.dec(-1), and a high OER durability for at least 1,200 h at 200 mA.cm(-2). This study provides an effective way to explore the advanced earth-abundant OER electrocatalysts by constructing the heterojunctions between metal and corresponding metal-compounds via the convenient post treatment, such as nitridation and sulfidization.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000655809000001

Herein, we prepared trimetallic PtNiCo hollow alloyed 3D multipods (HAMPs) with rough surfaces by an effective one-pot solvothermal strategy coupled with acid etching, as evidenced by a series of characterizations. By virtue of the trimetals and unique structures, the PtNiCo HAMPs exhibited excellent HER performance in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with a low overpotential (eta, 20 mV) and small Tafel slope (46.3 mV dec(-1)), superior to homemade PtNi HAMPs, PtCo nanocrystals (NCs) and commercial Pt/C catalysts.

Typically, the performance of the zinc air batteries is determined by two catalytic reactions on the cathode-the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, intensive effort has been devoted to explore high performance electrocatalysts with desired morphology, size, and composition. Among them, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as attractive and unique systems because of their high electrocatalytic activity, good durability, and 100% active atom utilization. In this review, we mainly focus on the advance application of SACs in zinc air batteries in recent years. Firstly, SACs are briefly compared with catalysts in other scales (i.e., micro- and nano-materials). A main emphasis is then focused on synthesis and electrocatalytic activity as well as the underlying mechanisms for mono- and dual-metal-based SACs in zinc air batteries catalysis. Finally, a prospect is provided that is expected to guide the rational design and synthesis of SACs for zinc air batteries.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21				2079-4991		WOS:000495666800057	31581611

By exploring the diverse abiotic and biotic interactions of plants above- and belowground, we provide examples that are characterized by nonlinear effects of the secondary metabolites. We propose that redox chemistry, specifically the reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and, in their absence, reduction of molecular oxygen by the identical secondary metabolite, is an important component of the hormetic effects caused by these compounds. This is illustrated for selected phenols, terpenoids, and alkaloids. The redox reactions are modulated by the variable availability of transition metals that serve as donors of electrons in a Fenton reaction mode. Low levels of ROS stimulate growth, cell differentiation, and stress resistance; high levels induce programmed cell death. We propose that provision of molecules that can participate in this redox chemistry is the raison d'etre for secondary metabolites. In this context, the presence or absence of functional groups in the molecule is more essential than the whole structure. Accordingly, there exist no constraints that limit structural diversity. Redox chemistry is ubiquitous, from the atmosphere to the soil.									52	1	1	0	41	0	55			1559-3258			WOS:000288122900007	21431080

The model includes oxygen transport in the channel, in the catalyst and gas-diffusion layers, and proton transport in the catalyst layer. Evolution of DRT peaks upon variation of transport parameters is studied. It is shown that variation of one of the oxygen transport parameters changes the resistivities of several peaks. It follows, that usual attribution of peaks to one of the transport or kinetic processes in the cell is rather conventional: oxygen transport elements (channel, gas diffusion and catalyst layers) form a unified oxygen transport media connected to faradaic reaction with impedance of each element being dependent on parameters of the others.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000861222600006

Herein, inspired by the self-standing three-dimensional(3D) structure of the natural spinach leaves, a unique binder-free and self-standing porous Au/spinach cathode for high-performance Li-O-2 batteries has been developed. The carbonized spinach leaves serve as a superconductive current collector and an ideal porous host for accommodating catalysts. The Au/spinach cathode could offer enough spaces for accommodating the discharge products, shorten the distance of the oxygen and electrolyte diffusion, and promote the oxygen reduction reaction(ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes. This optimized Au/spinach cathode achieved a high specific area capacity of 7.23 mA center dot h/cm(2) at a current density of 0.05 mA/cm(2) and exhibited excellent stability(280 cycles at 0.05 mA/cm(2) with a fixed capacity of 0.2 mA center dot h/cm(2)). The superior performance encourages the construction of more advanced cathode architectures by the use of bio-composites for Li-O-2 batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1005-9040	2210-3171		WOS:000712513500003

Herein, a single-atom catalyst (termed as Fe-N-C/rGO SAC) with unique five N-coordinated Fe (Fe-N-5) centers is prepared by pyrolyzing the composite of zeolitic-imidazolate-frameworks-8 (ZIF-8) and graphene oxide (GO). Specifically, the individual Fe site is stabilized by four equatorial and one axial N atoms donated by the N-doped carbon matrix and imidazole ring, respectively, thus forming an asymmetric electron depletion zone over the metal center, which can effectively promote the generation of reactive intermediates and accelerate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes for ZABs. The rechargeable liquid ZAB with Fe-N-C/rGO catalyst exhibits an extremely high energy density (928.25 VVh.kg(-1)), a remarkable peak power density (107.12 mW.cm(-2)), and a long cycle life (400 h). Additionally, the corresponding flexible solid-state ZAB displays superior foldability and remarkable cycling stability.

Recently, heteroatom doping has exhibited good prospects to boost the electrocatalytic performance of materials. Herein, we selected the typical MCo2O4 (M = transition metal)-type spinel oxides to test the doping effects aroused by metal cations and non-metal phosphorus (P) towards the OER in alkaline media. Not surprisingly, both cation and P dopants improved the OER activity. Additionally, P doping gave a further decrease of overpotential (reduced 34-194 mV) and Tafel slope (reduced 9.59-207.55 mV dec(-1)) compared to the oxide counterparts. Specifically, P-doped (Zn0.33Ni0.33Mn0.33)Co2O4 showed the best OER performance with the lowest overpotential of 0.349 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 69.68 mV dec(-1) and good stability after 2000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry. Redox pairs, oxygen vacancies, crystallinity and electrochemical active surface area were greatly modulated by heteroatom doping and together influenced the OER performance. This work confirms the synergistic effect of both metal and non-metal doping and the larger contribution of P dopants towards the OER, which gives a hint to develop superior electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				1466-8033		WOS:000623435900015

Herein, a novel environmentally friendly approach for the development of stable and active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is reported. In detail, the methodology aimed at developing a sequence of composites having a low cobalt loading (<4%(wt)) using polyphenols extracted from green tea as metal stabilizers and activated carbon derived from pinecones as a metal-support as well as a co-active material. The approach exploited ultrasound (US), microwave (MW) and combined US/MW-assisted techniques with the purpose of enhancing the final electrocatalytic activity of these new composites, replacing conventional high-temperature approaches. The results indicated that the so-produced electrocatalytic materials followed the order of activity US > MW/US > MW > conventional heating, with the best sample requiring an overpotential of 365 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1).									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2398-4902			WOS:000616375400008

The manganese carbonate was subsequently used as a precursor to synthesise mesoporous manganese oxides via thermal treatments at three various temperatures. X-ray diffraction and Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) results shows that g-MnO2 is synthesised at 380 and 450 degrees C while Mn2O3 is produced at the annealing temperature of 575 degrees C. X-ray absorption spectra show that g-MnO2 converts completely to Mn2O3 after annealing over the 450-575 degrees C range. The oxides obtained at 380 degrees C and 450 degrees C possess extremely high specific surface area, which is of interest for catalytic applications. The oxides were investigated as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction; the oxide prepared at the lowest annealing temperature was found to be the optimum catalyst with an overpotential of 427 +/- 10 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), normalised by the geometric area. The improved catalytic activity was related to the presence of defect-rich and highly porous manganese dioxide at the lowest annealing temperature.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			2398-4902			WOS:000422783100011

The well-defined Co3O4 nanorods were successfully anchored onto mildly oxidized MWCNTs with the assistance of diethylenetriamine (DETA) following a simple route. The as-prepared hybrid possesses a promising BET specific surface area of about 252 m(2) g(-1) and shows excellent electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) with an onset potential of about 0.47 V vs. Ag/AgCl and an overpotential of 309 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH. In addition, the Co3O4@MWCNT catalyst exhibits prominent stability during long-term electrolysis of water. We attribute the enhanced performance to a synergic effect between MWCNTs and Co3O4 nanorods by gaining insight into the electrochemical properties of the Co3O4@MWCNT hybrid. This work offers a useful way to synthesize one-dimensional (1D) metal oxides combined with 1D carbon materials for wide applications in energy storage and conversion.									71	4	0	0	3	0	72			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000346906100052

Enhanced by synergistic interactions of heterojunction between RuO2 and IrOx, the RuO2@IrOx nanocomposite reveals lower overpotential (215 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) than RuO2 (260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and IrO2 (316 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). After assembled into a homemade single-cell PEM water electrolyzer, a lower cell voltage of 1.683 V at 1 A cm(-2) for RuO2@IrOx anode is obtained, compared with RuO2 (1.715 V at 1 A cm(-2)) and IrO2 (1.748 V at 1 A cm(-2)). Additionally, the RuO2@IrOx anode shows good stability at 1 A cm(-2) over a 300 h stability test due to the effective protection of IrOx shell. This work offers an effective strategy to design and construct high efficient and long-term stable catalysts simultaneously.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000523185200069

Since on one hand photosystem I is not affected and electron transport from DPC to QA is midly affected and on the other hand the electron transport from water to DCIP, and water to silicomolibdate are inhibited, we conclude that the site of inhibition of cacalol is located at the oxygen evolution level. Cacalol derivatives inhibit electron flow between P680 to QA and probably also the Q(B) site.									27	0	0	0	20	0	28			0939-5075			WOS:A1991GM16300009

Herein, a straightforward synthesis strategy of embedding Co in porous carbon nanospheres is reported. Because of the rigid porous spherical structure and the existence of Co-N-x active sites, the as-prepared cathode catalyst exhibits an outstanding oxygen reduction performance (with an onset potential E-onset of 1.03 V vs RHE and a half-wave potential E-1/2 of 0.93 V vs RHE) in 0.1 M KOH, out-performing that of commercial Pt/C (E-onset = 1.03 V and E-1/2 = 0.87 V), and shows more rapid kinetics. Significantly, the nanomaterial shows a negligible degradation (Delta E-1/2 = 4 mV) after 5000 continuous cycles, which surpasses that of most of the highly active electrocatalysts reported to date. In addition, an assembled Zn-air battery composed of this effective electrocatalysts exhibits higher open-circuit voltage (1.44 V), power density (109.5 mW cm(-2)), and discharge specific capacity (657.2 mA h g(-1)) as a primary battery and has a long cycle life as a rechargeable battery. This work provides a large-scale preparation route for synthesizing efficient electrocatalysts to drive the oxygen reduction reaction in Zn-air batteries.									33	0	0	0	4	0	33			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000618083400004

Earth-abundant and cut-price transitionmetal compounds, particularly CoFe layered-double-hydroxides (LDHs), show the distinct superiorities in contrast to noble metals and their derivatives. In this review, we firstly underline their fundamental issues in electrocatalytic water oxidation, including CoFe LDHs crystal structure, the surface of (hydr)oxides confined to OER and the controversial roles of Fe species, aiming at understanding the structure-related activity and catalytic mechanism. Advanced approaches for optimizing OER activity of CoFe LDHs are then comprehensively overviewed, which will shed light on the different working mechanisms and provide a concise analysis of their unique advantages. Finally, a perspective on the future development of CoFe LDHs electrocatalysts is offered. We hope this review can give a concise and explicit guidance for the development of transition-metal-based electrocatalysts in the energy field.

The reproducibility of oxygen evolution was evaluated using 30-mol%-M-CeO2-delta and the effects of different M dopants were compared in the TR temperature range of 1200-1500 degrees C. Two solid phases detected in the 30-mol%-M- CeO2-delta powders were involved in the redox reaction of the thermochemical two-step water splitting cycle. Among the M-CeO2-delta samples evaluated, Mn-doped CeO2-delta provided the most stable and reproducible results and the highest reactivity for oxygen evolution at all temperatures employed for the TR step of the thermochemical two-step water-splitting cycle.

However, it is difficult to ascertain the oxidation state of a metal catalyst following oxygen exposure. Here, we present a time-scale study of the charge state of Pd nanoclusters on a model catalyst system, Pd/Al2O3/NiAl(1 10), during an exposure of molecular oxygen by noncontact atomic force microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). We speculate that the Pd nanocluster can be oxidized by O-2 at room temperature, leading to the formation of metal-complex PdxOy, nanoclusters. PdxOy shows a positive charge on the alumina surface in KPFM images, and it is the major sintering species in contrast with the stable Pd nanocluster. In addition, PdxOy contains weak binding oxygen that can be removed after annealing to a higher temperature. Following the evolution from individual well-dispersed metal nanoclusters to the oxidized state enables the identification of the key processes that underlie gas-induced charge transition.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000611410300045

Experimental results are consistent with a mechanism previously proposed in the literature for lead dioxide electrodeposition. The presence of bismuth ions in the electrodeposition solution causes a decrease of rate constants of lead dioxide formation due to co-adsorption phenomena. Deposits from solutions containing bismuth ions appear shiny dark grey, and show good adhesion to metal support. SEM images reveal a compact structure with spindle-shaped submicron and nanosized crystals and X-ray diffractograms demonstrated that incorporation of bismuth diminishes the size of crystal particles. Oxygen evolution was investigated to test electrocatalytic activity. It is shown, that oxygen overpotential on modified electrodes is significantly higher than on non-modified PbO2-electrode, which depends on bismuth content in deposit and segregation of bismuth that induces surface heterogeneity due to sites with different electroactivity for water oxidation.

Propane titration showed that the active site is deactivated through formation of hydroxyl groups that are stable at 550 degrees C and below in absence of oxygen. On the contrary at 700 degrees C, propane pulses resulted in hydrocarbon activation, accompanied by evolution of water molecules. In addition, simultaneous evolution of hydrogen molecules pulsing propane indicate that ODH of propane follows a mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous radical chemistry. No COx was observed while pulsing propane at both temperatures. Moreover COx molecules were not detected even during catalyst regeneration by pulsing oxygen showing that Li/MgO materials are not affected by coke formation. Formation of COx molecules seems to be feasible exclusively by co-feeding propane and oxygen. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Introducing hierarchical mesoporosity into NP superstructures will facilitate mass transport while simultaneously enhancing the accessibility of constituent NPs, which is of critical importance for widening their applications in catalysis and energy-related fields. Herein, we develop a colloidal co-assembly strategy to construct mesostructured, carbon-coated Co0.5Fe2.5O4 NP superstructures (M-C@CFOSs), which show great promise as highly efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reac-tion (OER). Specifically, organically-stabilized SiO2 NPs are employed as both building blocks and sacri-ficial template, which co-assemble with Co0.5Fe2.5O4 NPs to afford binary NP superstructures through a solvent drying process. M-C@CFOSs are obtainable after in situ ligand carbonization followed by the selective removal of SiO2 NPs. The hierarchical mesoporous structure of M-C@CFOSs, combined with the conformal graphitic carbon coating derived from the native organic ligands, significantly improves their electrocatalytic performance as OER electrocatalysts when compared with nonporous Co0.5Fe2.5O4 NP superstructures. This work establishes a new and facile approach for designing NP superstructures with hierarchical mesoporosity, which may find wide applications in energy storage and conversion.

However, it is very challenging to fabricate electrocatalysts with edge dislocations for water splitting. In this work, a pioneering way was demonstrated to synthesize Co3O4 catalysts with abundant edge dislocation defects in the special {011} facets by using a regenerated cellulose template, in which the semi-crystalline configuration of the cellulose chain played a crucial role in the edge dislocation generation in Co3O4. The obtained defect-activated Co3O4 (DA-Co3O4) exhibited a remarkably enhanced catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Compared with defect-free Co3O4, the defect-activated one required 183 mV and 261 mV overpotentials to afford current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) respectively in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH solution.									24	2	0	0	1	0	24			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472183200063

It is wellknown that La1-xSrxCoO3-delta perovskites can easily display strontium surface segregation, but how this influences the performance of La1-xSrxCoO3-delta. perovskites as anodic electrode in alkaline water electrolyzers, particularly in terms of OER activity, has not been unveiled yet. This study focuses on La0.2Sr0.8CoO3-delta, which shows relatively high activity for the OER, and reveals the influence of the preparation temperature on the amount and morphology of segregated strontium-containing islands. Thin film samples were prepared at different temperatures by using pulsed laser deposition. Those samples were then characterized with synchrotron-based X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy "as prepared" and after being immersed in ultrapure water. We found that higher preparation temperatures enhance the segregation of strontium, which is then almost quantitatively removed by washing the samples with ultrapure water. After immersion in water, the samples expose a cobalt-rich surface. Investigating the OER activity as a function of the perovskite deposition temperature, it has been found that the higher the deposition temperature (i.e., the more extended the strontium segregation), the higher the OER activity. Such an effect has been linked to the higher amount of cobalt accessible after removing the strontium segregated islands.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000543738500038

Oxygen release from oxygen-containing positive electrode materials is one of the major structural degradations resulting in rapid capacity/voltage fading of the battery and triggering the parasitic thermal runaway events. Herein, the authors summarize the recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of the oxygen release phenomena and correlative structural degradations observed in four major groups of cathode materials: layered, spinel, olivine, and Li-rich cathodes. In addition, the engineering and materials design approaches that improve the structural integrity of the cathode materials and minimize the detrimental O-2 evolution reaction are summarized. The authors believe that this review can guide researchers on developing mitigation strategies for the design of next-generation oxygen-containing cathode materials where the oxygen release is no longer a major degradation issue.									162	12	0	0	3	0	164			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000471132800013

Most importantly, the preferential electrochemical activation process, which consisted of both anodic and cathodic pre-treatment steps, strikingly enhanced OER and long-lasting cyclic stability. The substantial increase in OER electrocatalytic activity of Ni9S8/Ni3S2-NC and Co9S8-NC during the activation process was mainly attributed to the increase of faradaic active site density on the catalytic layer resulting from the reconstruction of catalytic interfaces. It was also found that Fe-based metallocene [ferrocene (Fc)]-incorporation in the Co9S8-NC and Ni9S8/Ni3S2-NC nanostructures significantly boosted the OER activity. Thus, the combined effects of Fc-incorporation and the electrochemical activation process reduced the overpotential to about 115 and 95 mV on the Ni9S8/Ni3S2-NC and Co9S8-NC nanostructures to derive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Notably, Fc-Ni9S8/Ni3S2-NC electrocatalysts required very small overpotentials of around 222, 244, and 280 mV to acquire the current densities of 10, 20, and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. This work opens up a new avenue for superior OER electrocatalysts by the utilization of metallocene and the preferential electrochemical activation process.									5	0	0	0	0	0	4			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000707053200001	34463051

In this work, Cu3P-Co2P nanocomposites with numerous interfaces are employed as catalysts for water splitting in alkaline solution. The quasi-layer structure of Co2P and the polarized plane of Cu3P endow the nanocomposites with large surface areas and active sites, which substantially favors the intrinsic charge transfer and boosts the catalytic activity. In addition, Cu3P reduces the lattice mismatch between Co2P and nickel foam and then enhances the catalytic stability. For the optimized Cu(3)P0.75Co(2)P catalyst, a low overpotential of 124.6 mV@-20 mA cm(-2) is required with a Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and an overpotential of 334 mV (at 20 mA cm(-2)) is required for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The potential for the overall-water-splitting@10 mA cm(-2) is about 1.55 V with the optimized Cu(3)P0.75Co(2)P catalysts. Theoretical and experimental results both reveal the significance of coupling of Cu3P in the two processes of water-splitting for the Cu3P-Co2P nanocomposite catalyst.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000464518400060	30888362

TPR experiments performed with and without added hydrogen in the sweep gas for different KOH/anthracite ratios demonstrate that the greater this ratio, the greater the amount of hydrogen evolved during the activation process. It is also shown that hydrogen concentration during the activation process can significantly affect porosity development of the resultant activated carbon (AC). A series of post-activation TPD experiments was carried out for AC samples prepared under different conditions. The behavior of oxygen surface complexes in the TPD experiments also supports significant interaction between hydrogen and oxygen surface groups and/or inhibition of their formation. Post-activation gas evolution via thermal desorption is demonstrated to be an indicator of the hydrogen evolution during the activation process. These results explain earlier findings that porosity development correlates with hydrogen evolution, and is favored for high KOH/anthracite ratios, high sweep gas flow rates (up to a maximum value), and high activation temperatures. The effect of the "inert" sweep gas flow rate is attributed to the mass transfer rate of gas phase species, especially hydrogen and potassium vapor. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, the effect of an initial microstructure on the microstructure evolution in SOFC cathode is investigated using a recently developed phase field model. Specifically, we tune the phase fraction, the average grain size, the standard deviation of the grain size and the grain shape in the initial microstructure, and explore their effect on the evolution of the grain size, the density of triple phase boundary, the specific surface area and the effective conductivity in LSM-YSZ cathodes. It is found that the degradation rate of triple phase boundary density and specific surface area of LSM is lower with less LSM phase fraction (with constant porosity assumed) and greater average grain size, while the degradation rate of effective conductivity can also be tuned by adjusting the standard deviation of grain size distribution and grain aspect ratio. The implication of this study on the designing of an optimal initial microstructure of SOFC cathodes is discussed. (C) The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS.

The performance of Pb-anodes is reviewed herein, taking a holistic perspective, including metallurgy (i.e. solubility of metals in Pb) and the electrochemical impact of alloying. The review is general in its nature, however the application of copper (Cu) EW is used illustratively to emphasise key points. The need for energy efficiency in the present era and future will dictate the use of anodes with low overpotential, hence warranting an appraisal of electrochemical performance of Pb as altered by alloying.

LOW-MOLECULAR-WEIGHT PRODUCTS								MAKROMOLEKULARE CHEMIE-MACROMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS				192	4			863	866						APR 1991	1991	The process which take place with the alpha,beta-unsaturated compound 1,2,3,3-tetraphenyl-2-propen-1-one (1) under the influence of WCl6 were investigated. Special attention was paid to the low-molecular-weight products. It was established that beside polydiphenylacetylene and benzophenone also benzil, tetraphenylethylene and molecular oxygen are present in the product mixture. Their formation is explained as a result of a redistribution of the atoms connected with double bonds according to olefin metathesis (OM), carbonyl-olefin exchange reaction (COER) and reductive coupling (RC) of carbonyl compounds, accompanied by molecular oxygen evolution. The yields of products insoluble in methanol are sometimes higher than a simple stoichiometry would allow. This can be attributed to the participation of both the inner double bonds of the polymer and the low-molecular-weight products.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0025-116X			WOS:A1991FK98200012

Recently, the low-cost, stable and high-performance electrocatalysts for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) derived from porous metal-organic framework (MOF) precursors have attracted numerous attention. Herein, a new type of CoMo carbide/nitride embedded in the flower-like carbon materials (CoMo-MI-T, MI = 2-Methylimidazole, T = 400, 500, 600, 700 degrees C) has been synthesized by a simple pyrolysis, in which bimetallic CoMo-MI precursors can be conveniently converted from crystalline cobalt-based MOFs of Co-MI by solvothermal reaction. The pyrolyzed CoMo-MI-T series exhibits a hierarchically porous nanostructure, high Co3Mo3C/N content, suitable N-doping, graphitic carbon layers as well as well-preserved flower-shaped morphology, which shows an excellent OER performance. Among them, the most optimal CoMo-MI-600 owns the small overpotential of 316 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 89.9 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH solution. Meanwhile, the rotating ring-disk electrode technique is examined to verify near 4-electron transfer process for CoMo-MI-600 together with a high Faradaic efficiency of 98.7%. The well-performed CoMo-MI-600 electrocatalyst may be stemmed from the best balance of the synergistic effect of abundant multi-component, suitable electrical conductivity and large porosity. The current work will provide a new route to prepare MOF-derived bimetallic active sites in porous carbon nanomaterials with satisfactory activity and robust stability in the relevant energy applications.

Heterostructure with an amorphous crystalline interface has been reported recently to availably enhance the catalytic performance of materials at high output. Herein, a wet chemical etching method realizes the hierarchical amorphous/crystalline heterostructure [(WO2-Ni17W3)/NiFe(OH)(x)]. It induces modulated electronic structure and abundant active sites with chemical stability, resulting in extraordinary catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (eta(10) = 31 mV, eta(1000) = 258 mV), oxygen evolution reaction (eta(50) = 240 mV, eta(1,000) = 336 mV), and overall water splitting (1.54/ 1.84 V at 50/1,000 mA cm(-2)). Besides, it can maintain at 1,000 mA cm(-2) stably for 120 h under simulated industrial condition (6.0 M KOH solution at 60 celcius) as a bifunctional catalyst. The coupled active phases and the in-situ formed heterojunction ensure an excellent performance at high current density. This strategy could be promoted to fabricate catalysts for practical water electrolysis.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000772824400002

Here, we report an atomically dispersed iron and nickel co-anchored on defect-rich porous nitrogen and sulfur carbon frameworks (denoted as Fe, Ni-SAs/DNSC) with tailored coordination environment, The Fe, Ni-SAs/DNSC electrocatalyst displays outstanding catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with an onset potential (E-onset) of 1.03 V (vs. RHE), half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.88 V (vs. RHE) as well as superior stability. The catalyst also shows a superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. When Fe, Ni-SAs/DNSC catalyst is employed as an air cathode, the Zn-air battery displays superior performance with a large peak power density of 160 mW cm(-2), high energy density of 962.8 kg(zn)(-1) and cycling stability. Also, the Fe, Ni-SAs/DNSC-based liquid and flexible solid-state Mg-air batteries deliver a large peak power density of 76 mW cm(-2), high energy density of 1653 kg(Mg)(-1) and superior durability (Over 78 h at 20 mA cm(-1)). Furthermore, DFT calculations reveal that the doped S atom and carbon vacancy can weaken the binding strength between oxygen intermediates and Fe active site and improve the desorption of *OH step during the ORR process. This work provides insights into the design dual single atomic catalyst with a tailored coordination environment.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729674400003

Each individual electrocatalyst was assembled with a different alkali metal intercalated between two nanosheets (NS) of manganese oxide to form a bilayer structure. Manganese oxide NS were synthesized via the exfoliation of a layered material, birnessite. Atomic force microscopy was used to determine the heights of the bilayer catalysts. The interlayer spacing of the supported bilayers positively correlates with the size of the alkali cation: NS/Cs+/NS > NS/Rb+/NS > NS/K+/NS > NS/Na+/NS > NS/Li+ / NS. The thermodynamic origins of these bilayer heights were investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. The overpotential (eta) for the OER correlates with the interlayer spacing; NS/Cs+ /NS has the lowest eta (0.45 V), while NS/Li+/NS exhibits the highest eta (0.68 V) for OER at a current density of 1 mA/cm(2). Kinetic parameters (eta and Tafel slope) associated with NS/Cs+ /NS for the OER were superior to that of the bulk birnessite phase, highlighting the structural uniqueness of these nanoscale assemblies.									106	6	0	0	7	0	108			0002-7863			WOS:000393848400034	28085268

As an emerging carbon-based material, the investigation of electrocatalytic of water to produce 'OH on Graphdiyne (GDY) anode is firstly evaluated by using first-principles calculations. The theoretical calculation results demonstrated that the GDY anode owns a large oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential (eta(OER) = 1.95 V) and a weak sorptive ability towards oxygen evolution intermediates (HO*, not (OH)-O-center dot). The high Gibbs energy change of HO* (3.18 eV) on GDY anode makes the selective production of (OH)-O-center dot (Delta G = 2.4 eV) thermodynamically favorable. The investigation comprises the understanding of the relationship between OER to electrochemical advanced oxidation process (EAOP), and give a proof-of concept of finding the novel and robust environmental EAOP anode at quantum chemistry level.

The starting monomers' composition allows the formation of photoactive CNO semiconductors with extended absorption and ordered morphologies. Interestingly, at these reaction temperatures, the chemical structure of the starting monomers is partially retained, opening a path for the transfer of properties from the molecular level to the final CN materials after condensation. The new CNO polymers exhibit good photoactivity for the hydrogen evolution reaction, CO2 reduction and rhodamine B dye degradation.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000490797900001

Pd-Au alloyed domains with a wide range of compositions were evidenced by in situ and ex situ XRD, the Pd content of which decreased with the increasing oxidising nature of the feed due to phase segregation giving rise to PdO and an Au-rich alloy.

ESR spectroscopy was used to provide direct evidence for generating ROS during decomposition of H2O2 assisted by Ag NPs. Hydroxyl radical formation was observed under acidic conditions and was accompanied by dissolution of Ag NPs. In contrast, evolution of O-2 was observed in alkaline solutions containing H2O2 and Ag NPs: however, no net dissolution of Ag NPs was observed due to re-reduction of Ag+ as evidenced by a cyclic reaction. Since H2O2 is a biologically relevant product being continuously generated in cells, these results obtained under conditions mimicking different biological microenvironments may provide insights for finding new biomedical applications for Ag NPs and for risk assessment.

Most of these works have focused on acid system as Ni2P is unstable in alkaline media. However, alkaline water splitting is more practical for industry due to the lack of suitable acidic oxygen evolution catalyst. Thus, providing an efficient alkaline HER catalyst by enhancing the stability and activity of Ni2P is needed. Herein, we have grown mesoporous (FexNi1-x)(2)P nanosheets on Ni foam (NF) as HER catalyst with activities being related to Fe/Ni ratio. FeNiP/NF with Fe/Ni ratio of 5/5 and high- density exposure of (001) surface shows much better stability and HER activity in alkaline than Ni2P. Our experimental results reveal that the homogeneous lattice substitution of Fe modified the electronic structure of Ni2P, enhanced the intrinsic activity and the number of active sites. Density functional theory calculation reveals that the Fe incorporation improves the HER activity of the highly exposed FeNiP (001) surface by reducing the energy barriers of HER reactants (H and H2O) adsorption compared with Ni2P. This work provides an effective pathway for the future development of HER catalyst in alkaline conditions by introducing hetero-atom into the host lattice. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we take a computational approach to first identify a series of rare-earth pyrochlore oxides based on Ir and Ru as potential OER catalysts. The DFT-based phase diagrams, Pourbaix diagrams (E vs pH), projected density of states, and band energy diagrams were used to identify prospective OER catalysts based on rare-earth Ir and Ru pyrochlores. The predicted materials were synthesized using the spray-freeze freeze-drying approach to afford nanoparticulate oxides conforming to the pyrochlore structural type A(2)B(2)O(7) where A = Nd, Gd, or Yb and B = Ir or Ru. In agreement with the computed Pourbaix diagrams, the materials were found to be moderately stable under OER conditions. All prepared materials show higher stability as compared to the benchmark IrO2 catalyst, and the OER mass activity of Yb2Ir2O7 and the ruthenate pyrochlores (Nd2Ru2O7, Gd2Ru2O7, and Yb2Ru2O7) were also found to exceed those of the benchmark IrO2 catalyst. We find that the OER activity of each pyrochlore series (i.e., iridate or ruthenate) generally improves as the size of the A-site cation decreases, indicating that maintaining control over the structure can be used to influence the electrocatalytic properties.									40	2	0	0	2	0	40			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000491219700037	31535842

Here, a robust water oxidation catalyst, Ag-nanoparticle-anchored reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-coated MIL-88B(Fe) hybrids (AgNPs@rGO/MIL-88B(Fe)), is developedfor a high-electrocatalytic performance in the OER. Initially, MIL-88B(Fe) is synthesized through an in situ process in exfoliated graphene oxide dispersion, forming a GO-coated MIL-88B(Fe) hybrid. Ag nanoparticles (ca.3 nm) are then deposited through simultaneous reduction of silver ions and GO to form a robust AgNPs@rGO/MIL-88B(Fe) combined catalyst. The new catalyst material was tested for the OER and exhibited remarkable catalytic performance, affording a current density of 1 mA cm(-2) at a very low overpotential of approximately 395 mV in buffered solution (pH - 7). Furthermore, the sustained catalyst stability with Tafel slopes of 60 mV dec(-1) is one of the best electro-catalytic performances reported at neutral pH.									26	1	0	0	1	0	27			2196-0216			WOS:000419269000012

Herein, a novel heterojunction material (MMZ-900) is prepared as an excellent electrocatalyst for NRR at 900 degrees C, which is composed of MoS2, MoO2 and ZnO with nonuniform charge distribution of rich S and O vacancies. As a result, MMZ-900 exhibits about 8 times higher Faradaic efficiency and 5 times higher NH3 yields for NRR than pure MoS2, respectively. These new insights may open up opportunities for exploiting efficient NRR electrocatalysts by simultaneously improving sulfur and oxygen vacancies on heterojunction material.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000867306200001

NP temperature (T-NP) was measured by measuring the NP thermal emission spectra during the kinetics studies. The initial oxidation efficiency is found to peak in the 1200-1500 K range, dropping by an order of magnitude as T-NP was increased above 2000 K. There were large NP-to-NP variations in the oxidation rates, attributed to variations in the NP surface structure. In addition, the oxidation efficiencies evolved, non-monotonically, as the NPs reacted, decreasing by factors of between 10 and 300. This evolution of reactivity is attributed to changes in the NP surface structure due to the combination of oxidation and annealing. The optical properties, including wavelength dependence of the emissivity and the absorption cross section for the 532 nm heating laser, also tended to evolve as the NPs oxidized, but differently for each individual NP, presumably reflecting differences in the initial structures and their evolution.

This work also emphasizes that anodic deposition of vanadium oxide does occur at a potential much more negative to oxygen evolution from aqueous VOSO4 solutions due to the presence of V5+ by adding H2O2. Through the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analyses, this oxide deposit, mainly consisting of V5+ with 11 mol.% V4+, shows a hydrous nature. The unique power characteristics of this hydrous vanadium oxide are reasonably attributed to its intrinsic porous and crystalline structure produced by means of this novel anodic deposition process at a potential much more negative to the oxygen evolution reaction.

The remarkable features of well-developed in- and out-of-plane pores, 3D conductive networks, and N-doping have greatly promoted the transport in electrodes and assured high catalytic efficiency. The 3D hybrid paper of N-doped graphene-NiCo2O4 has shown a remarkable OER catalytic activity that was comparable to that of previously reported noble metal catalysts (IrO2). The catalytic process occurred with favorable kinetics and strong durability. The dual-active-site mechanism is responsible for the excellent performance of the hybrid catalyst; that is, the edges of NiCo2O4 and the N (0)-metal (Ni or Co) bonds are both active sites. This study affords a new strategy to achieve optimal performance in 3D catalysts, which may be extended to the preparation of other 3D hybrid materials for a broad range of technological applications.									453	16	0	0	26	0	458			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000327752200067	24090468

To address these drawbacks, the non-equilibrium nature of pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is exploited to synthesize self-supported hierarchical nanoarchitectures by gas phase nucleation and sequential attachment of defective molybdenum sulfide clusters. The physics of the process are studied by in situ diagnostics and correlated to the properties of the resulting electrocatalyst. The as-synthesized architectures have a disordered nanocrystalline structure, with nanodomains of bent, defective S-Mo-S layers embedded in an amorphous matrix, with excess sulfur and segregated molybdenum particles. Oxygen incorporation in this structure fosters the creation of amorphous oxide/oxysulfide nanophases with high electrical conductivity, enabling fast electron transfer to the active sites. The combined effect of the nanocrystalline pristine structure and the surface oxidation enhances the performance leading to small overpotentials, very fast kinetics (35.1 mV dec(-1)Tafel slope) and remarkable long-term stability for continuous operation up to -1 A cm(-2). This work shows possible new avenues in catalytic design arising from a non-equilibrium technique as PLD and the importance of structural and chemical control to improve the HER performance of MoS-based catalysts.									18	3	0	0	0	0	18			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000577424300001	33090682

Herein, we demonstrated a kind of hybrids of Mo2C/Fe5C2 embedded in N-doped carbon (Mo2C/Fe5C2@NC) are prepared by pyrolyzing mixtures of Mo3O10-EDA nanowires and biomass iron-tannin-framework ink (Fe-TA). The as-prepared Mo2C/Fe5C2@NC samples are characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD), scan electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectronic spectrum (XPS) techniques. The systematic electrochemical study for the Mo2C/Fe5C2@NC shows a improved catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction in O-2 saturated 0.1 m KOH electrolyte. Specially, the Mo2C/Fe5C2@NC-800 exhibits a remarkably high activity with an onset potentials of 0.92 V, half-wave potential 0.78 V, and a small tafel slope of 76.89 mV dec(-1), and also exhibits a larger limiting current density (5.2 mA cm(-2) at 0.1 V vs. RHE), strong tolerance against methanol and long-term stability (40000 s) comparable to those of the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts. Such outstanding catalytic activities are originated from the intrinsic activity of Mo2C and the high conductivity provided by metallic Fe5C2 nanoparticles, and also due to the large amounts of oxygen vacancies created by Mo2C and Fe5C2 as electron donors in Mo2C/Fe5C2@NC hybrids. Therefore, this work is expected to boost the fabrication of various non-noble carbide-based heterostructure nanomaterials for practical applications in fuel cells and metal-air batteries.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000476762200015

Important geometric parameters, including the active surface area and micro-diffusion length for both electrodes, are measured and incorporated in the model. The kinetic parameters of the oxygen evolution reaction are also characterized using constant potential experiments. Two separate equilibrium equations for the Ni electrode, one for charge and the other for discharge, are determined to provide a better description of the electrode hysteresis effect, and their use results in better agreement of simulation results with experimental data on both charge and discharge. The Ni electrode kinetic parameters are re-calibrated for the battery studied. The Ni-MH cell model coupled with the updated electrochemical properties is then used to simulate a wide range of experimental discharge and charge curves with satisfactory agreement. The experimentally validated model is used to predict and compare various charge algorithms so as to provide guidelines for application-specific optimization. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The thermodynamic and kinetic requirements for this multi-step reaction are reexamined, including the coupling of the individual electron-proton steps (PCET) and the O-O bond formation step. The four oxygen atoms at the corners of the proposed hetero-cubical Mn3CaO4 core (3 mu(3)-oxos and one mu(4)-oxo) can be distinguished by the number and types of chemical bonds to Ca2+ and Mn (geometries and orbital hybridization). Two of these mu(3)-oxos, postulated as substrates, are located at unique sites indicative of sp(2) + ppi hybridized orbitals. Both proposed substrate oxos are strongly hydrogen-bonded to different protein carboxylate residues, which are postulated as the initial proton transfer sites. Ca2+ is weakly bonded to these substrate oxos via non-directional ionic bonds that are postulated to provide stereochemical flexibility for the homolytic formation of the O-O bond. A previously postulated heterolytic pathway involving an electrophilic oxo and nucleophilic hydroxide species is reevaluated. We extend this mechanism by postulating roles for (bi)carbonate either in proton transfer or delivering the nucleophile for O-2 formation.									50	0	0	0	18	0	50			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000224755500009

On the basis of the detailed analysis of different reaction mechanisms the limitations associated with the 02 evolution reaction is analysed. We find that overpotentials lower than the 0.4 eV, which have been observed for a mono-nuclear mechanism, are possible if the problematic *-00H intermediate is avoided. This is the case for the bi-nuclear and bi-functional reaction paths. 3-dimensional volcano plots are constructed and used to explore the performance of these reaction mechanisms. Our results suggest, that in contrast to previous analysis of the mono-nuclear mechanism, the true top of the water oxidation volcano is placed at slightly lower *=0 binding energies of only 2.46 eV if combined with a suitable co-catalyst. On the basis of this new analysis, design criteria for improved catalysts are developed.									34	0	0	0	0	0	34			2451-9103			WOS:000442798800037

The as-prepared Zn(O,S) had a nano crystallite size of 3-10 nm and formed aggregates. Low temperature process has led to the difficulty in forming well crystalline nanoparticles, therefore the ionic bonding is weaker as compared to the high temperature one. Due to the entropy-controlled reaction, Zn(O,S) with different compositions, phases, and bandgaps was formed and proposed to have a three-dimensional multibandgap-quantum-well (3D MQW) band structure, as supported by the selected area electron diffraction of high resolution transmission electron microscopy. Photo reduction of Cr6+ was initially performed for our materials selection. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of Zn(O,S) in different kinds of solutions under low power UV lamps (the intensity is 0.088 mW/cm(2) or approximately 1/40 times UV light intensity of sunlight) was executed. A high efficient hydrogen evolution rate of 213 mu mol/g h watt was achieved by considering the input light power. The active surface oxygen anion-involved photocatalytic mechanism for HER is proposed, which was derived from the reversible change in Zn(O,S) color and the results from HER reactions in different solutions.

Both surfaces are poor catalysts for hydrogen reactions in the as-grown state, however, their activity increases after cathodic polarization. Cathodic activation of the RuO2 (110) surface was interpreted as the formation of metallic ruthenium sites which can be reoxidized to ruthenium dioxide. This process is reversible in the early stages of activation when no significant surface corrugation is produced. Irreversible surface roughening can be produced with activation at very negative potentials. On the other hand, the activation of the RuO2 (100) surface leads, under even very mild conditions, to an irreversible increase in surface pseudocapacitance and the appearance of new voltammetric features. This behavior is attributed to irreversible morphological changes following hydrogen intercalation into the subsurface region. The more facile and drastic changes upon activation of the (100) surface can be explained by its more open structure as compared with the densely packed (110) surface. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

MoS2/rGO shows a remarkable electrocatalytic performance, which is characterized by an outstanding onset potential of 0.97 V, a half-wave potential of 0.83 V, noticeable methanol tolerance, and durability of 93.7% current retention, superior to commercial Pt/C. The ORR process occurring on MoS2/rGO is a typical four electron pathway. Therefore, this study achieves the design of a low-cost, highly efficient and stable nonprecious metal ORR electrocatalyst in alkaline media.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2046-2069		WOS:000678299000004	35481001	
J	Li, Yanan; Han, Jie; Xu, Zhilong; Guo, Rong								Hybrid shells of N-doped carbon encapsulated by MnO nanoparticles as oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysts								NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				44	2			580	585		10.1039/c9nj05550a				JAN 14 2020	2020	Recently, the development of non-precious metal electrocatalysts for effective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has become a research hotspot. Herein, a facile and effective strategy is explored to develop non-precious electrocatalysts of hybrid shells of N-doped carbon (N-carbon) encapsulated by MnO (denoted as MnO/N-carbon/MnO), which can be recognized as efficient and durable electrocatalysts for ORR. The MnO2/N-carbon/MnO2 hybrid shells were synthesized via the redox reaction between poly(o-phenylenediamine) (PoPD) hollow microspheres and KMnO4, followed by a calcination process to form MnO/N-carbon/MnO hybrid shells. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) proved that MnO/N-carbon/MnO(800) hybrid shells showed the best electrocatalytic activity for ORR. The hybrid structure of the material and the synergy between MnO and N-carbon contribute to the improved electrocatalytic activity for ORR.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000504433000035

Building chemical bonds between inorganic active materials and nanocarbon substrates is the key to controlled hybrid material synthesis that allows for controlling the size and morphology of the materials and enhancing electron transport within the electrodes. Our inorganic/nanocarbon hybrid materials manifest superior electrochemical performance for asymmetrical supercapacitors, ultrafast nickel-iron batteries, lithium ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, and electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy has been utilized to characterize the chemical bonding and charge transfer at the interface of inorganic nanocrystals and nanocarbon substrates. Probing the physical and chemical states of the hybrid materials under electrochemical reaction conditions is an important future direction in this area.									4	0	0	0	0	0	5			0033-4545	1365-3075		WOS:000332034800005

The peaks assigned to the peroxo species (TiOOH and bridging O-O) were generated by UV-irradiation, though observed vibrational energy of bridging O-O species was largely shifted from that of rutile TiO2 particles (TIO-3). The observed difference between both particles was mainly attributable to the difference in the local surface structure of TiO2. The existence of unknown reaction paths to consume bridging O-O species without reacting with photogenerated holes was suggested from the observation of sequential change of absorption intensity.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1344-3542	2186-2451		WOS:000295908000009		
J	Shi, Lei; Chen, Hui; Liang, Xiao; Liu, Yipu; Zou, Xiaoxin				Zou, Xiaoxin/ABD-6285-2021				Theoretical insights into nonprecious oxygen-evolution active sites in Ti-Ir-Based perovskite solid solution electrocatalysts								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				8	1			218	223		10.1039/c9ta10059h				JAN 7 2020	2020	Deep understanding of the properties of catalytically active sites on complex solid surfaces will benefit the rational design of catalysts with desirable performances. Here, we present DFT calculations that demonstrate the unexpected ability of nonprecious titanium sites on SrTix(Ir)(1-x)O-3 solid solution (STIO) surfaces to electrocatalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the crucial roles of iridium content (defined by the atomic ratio Ir/(Ir + Ti) in STIO) and spatial distribution in generating highly active titanium catalytic sites. The surface iridium sites for STIO with iridium content from 12% to 50% show higher activity than those on IrO2 surfaces. The surface titanium sites for STIO with iridium content from 25% to 75% show high catalytic activity similar to iridium catalytic sites, while the surface titanium sites for SrTiO3 (STO) are intrinsically catalytically inert for the OER. These results suggest that for an optimum catalytic activity to be realized, STIO should have an iridium content between 25% and 50% due to the existence of efficient, dual metallic catalytic sites, in agreement with our previous experimental observation. Additionally, the e(g)-filling of surface titanium sites for STIO is found to be reduced with the increase of the iridium content and strongly correlates with the surface adsorption ability of surface titanium sites towards the key reaction intermediates and thereby the catalytic activity for the OER. Besides the iridium content, the spatial distribution of iridium in STIO is also found to be vital to activate surface titanium sites. The results show that the surface iridium atoms play a dominant role in the activation of surface titanium sites, while the inner iridium atoms have a minor impact on this activation. As presented in this work, a novel core/shell-type material model, where an iridium-free STO core is covered with a single-layered-thick STIO shell, is overall suggested to achieve highly active oxygen evolution electrocatalysts with an ultralow iridium content.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000503772400017

Here we examine the oxygen reduction reaction performance of a combinatorial Pd-Au-Ag-Ti thin film library using high-throughput screening and correlate the electrochemical behavior to the crystallographic properties. We find compositions of ca. 4060 at% Pd and 30-35 at% Au exhibit both a low overpotential of close to the value of pure Pt as well as high current density. We also observe a volcano-like relationship between the overpotential and the solid formation strain. This study provides compositional guidance towards the future synthesis of nanostructured quaternary Pd-Au-Ag-Ti alloys and suggests the potential for broader application of high-throughput electrochemical characterization by means of an automatic scanning droplet cell.									29	3	0	0	2	0	29			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000391572200005

In this study, we apply a versatile selenizing technology to synthesize Se-enriched Co1-xFexSe2 catalysts on nickel foams for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) and disclose the relationship between the electronic structures of Co1-xFexSe2 (via regulating the atom ratio of Co/Fe) and their OER performance. Owing to the fact that the electron configuration of the Co1-x FexSe2 compounds can be tuned by the incorporated Ee species (electron transfer and lattice distortion), the catalytic activity can be adjusted according to the Co/Fe ratios in the catalyst. Moreover, the morphology of Co1-xFexSe2 is also verified to strongly depend on the Co/Fe ratios, and the thinner Co0.4Fe0.6 Se-2 nanosheets aire obtained upon selenization treatment, in which it allows more active sites to be exposed to the electrolyte, in turn promoting the OER performance. The Co0.4Fe0.6Se2 nanosheets not only exhibit superior OER performance with a low overpotential of 217 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1) ' but also possess ultrahigh durability with a dinky degeneration of 4.4% even after 72 h fierce water oxidation test in alkaline solution, which outperforms the commercial RuO2 catalyst. As expected, the Co0.4Fe0.6Se2 nanosheets have shown great prospects for practical applications toward water oxidation.									107	4	0	0	5	0	108			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000412717600055	28849648

In this communication, we demonstrate the topotactic conversion of a nickel phosphide nanoarray on carbon cloth into a nickel borate phosphate nanoarray (Ni-Bi-Pi/CC) by oxidative polarization in potassium borate water. When used as a 3D water oxidation catalyst, such Ni-Bi-Pi/CC shows high activity with a geometrical catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of only 440 mV in 0.1 M K-Bi, rivaling the performances of the reported Ni-containing catalysts operated under benign conditions. Notably, this electrode also demonstrates strong long-term electrochemical durability with 100% Faradaic efficiency for oxygen evolution. All these features promise its use as an attractive low-cost catalyst electrode in water-splitting devices for mass production of hydrogen fuels under environmentally friendly conditions.									39	3	0	0	0	0	39			2052-1553			WOS:000401554000013

However, peroxo/superoxo analogues have aroused controversies relevant to the origin of oxygen-anion redox. Specifically, some characteristics such as the magnitude of the O-O bond length in bulk materials have been puzzling during oxygen oxidation, as has the relationship between the peroxo/superoxo intermediate and the release of oxygen. The latter is a major safety concern to the application of oxygen-anion redox in lithium ion batteries. Herein, we present a unified modeling of the full delithiation process for model system Li2MnO3 by using first-principles calculations. We find that the cationic antisite defects and the electron deficiency are two major limiting factors in the anionic oxidation whose state can evolve, as the degree of delithiation increases, from the electron/hole, through peroxo-like O-2(delta-) dimer formation, to the eventual release of gas-phase oxygen molecule. During the delithiation process, the dangling oxygen (i.e., singly coordinated with Mn) pairs play a critical role in intermediate dimer formation. Meanwhile, we identify five generic binding patterns of O-2(delta-) dimers with Mn ions for which the O-O bond length varies from 1.45 angstrom in the peroxo state to 1.22 angstrom in the gas-phase oxygen molecule. Moreover, the dominant features of the three molecular orbitals, sigma(c), pi(a), and pi(b), are distinguished, with the corresponding energy levels being highly delocalized and mixed as a result of the interplay with the host lattice. This work provides a deep understanding of the intermediate states of the anionic redox and suggests new strategies that mitigate oxygen release for the design of highly efficient and safe Li-rich cathode materials.									56	1	0	0	4	0	57			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000475533500024	31251049

However, studies relating their morphology and performance are rare. In this study, three types of RhNPs, i.e., nanoshells, nanoframes, and porous nanoplates, were synthesized via inverse-directional galvanic replacement. The relationship between the performance of the RhNPs at catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and their morphology was investigated using cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, the Tafel slope, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction data revealed that the RhNPs contained different Rh/Ag ratios. All the RhNPs exhibited long-term stability under acidic conditions. In particular, nanoshell-structured RhNPs exhibited superior ORR activity as determined from the slope of the Tafel plot, the number of electrons, and the onset potential compared to a commercial Rh electrocatalyst and other RhNPs. Evidently, controlling the morphology and composition of RhNPs greatly facilitates efficient electrocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0253-2964	1229-5949		WOS:000852994500001

In this work, zinc sulfide (ZnS) nanoparticles were supported by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and utilized for the ORR. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy profiles reveal that the ZnS nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the rGO. Cyclic voltammograms, rotating disk electrode and rotating ring disk electrode measurements demonstrated that the hierarchical ZnS/rGO sheets exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the ORR in an alkaline medium, which was evidenced by their high cathodic current density, positive onset potential, low H2O2 yield, and high electron transfer number. Chronoamperometric studies revealed the excellent catalytic stability of the prepared catalyst. The catalytic activity and stability in the alkaline electrolyte indicated that ZnS/rGO sheets have great potential as alternatives to precious metal-based catalysts.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000451074200087

However, it is difficult to control their catalytic activity precisely. Here, a general three-stage synthesis strategy is described to produce a family of hybrid materials comprising amorphous bimetallic oxide nanoparticles anchored on N-doped reduced graphene oxide with simultaneous control of nanoparticle elemental composition, size, and crystallinity. Amorphous Fe0.5Co0.5Ox is obtained from Prussian blue analog nanocrystals, showing excellent OER activity with a Tafel slope of 30.1 mV dec(-1) and an overpotential of 257 mV for 10 mA cm(-2) and superior ORR activity with a large limiting current density of -5.25 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V. A fabricated Zn-air battery delivers a specific capacity of 756 mA h g(Zn)(-1) (corresponding to an energy density of 904 W h kg(Zn)(-1)), a peak power density of 86 mW cm(-2) and can be cycled over 120 h at 10 mA cm(-2). Other two amorphous bimetallic, Ni0.4Fe0.6Ox and Ni0.33Co0.67Ox, are also produced to demonstrate the general applicability of this method for synthesizing binary metal oxides with controllable structures as electrocatalysts for energy conversion.									191	18	0	0	7	0	191			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000412452500008	28804931

However, the rational development of novel catalyst chemistries for this reaction is needed to tune the activity and selectivity of the CO2RR, especially for increasingly complex chemistries, such as oxides, sulfides, and phosphides. In this work, we explore a diverse chemical range of transition-metal perovskite oxides (ABO(3)) by determining their surface binding energies toward COads and H-ads using density functional theory (DFT) and by evaluating their CO2RR activity and selectivity. We find that tuning perovskite chemistry results in the ability to electrochemically reduce CO2 to CH4. We propose the O 2p-band center as a rational design parameter that faithfully captures the energetics of H-ads and COads binding that influence the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO2RR activity. A higher O 2p band center results in higher HER activity, while an intermediate O 2p-band center improves favorability for CH4 evolution. In the process, we identify a group of perovskites (i.e., LaCoO3, GdCoO3, NdCoO3) as materials that have not, to date, been reported previously for CH4 evolution activity at relatively low overpotentials (-0.6 to -0.8 V-RHE).									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000490353900015

The electrocatalytic behavior of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic electrolysis in 1 mol dm(-3) KOH solution. The effects of calcination temperature on the oxygen reduction pathway are examined. Galvanostatic electrolysis results show that the reaction pathway on the IrO2/Ti electrode prepared at high calcination temperature is mainly a two-electron pathway producing H2O2. It is observed that higher calcination temperatures produce: a more uniform fault-free surface; reduced levels of Cl contamination (residual Cl presumably from incomplete IrCl3 decomposition during the coating process); higher levels of rutile character of the IrO2 layer: lower hydration levels. It is confirmed that ORR electrocatalytic behavior on highly hydrated IrO2 is better than on slightly hydrated IrO2. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Ye, Cuizhu; Wang, Zixu; Shen, Yi								Preparation of Iron-Copper Oxalates and Oxides for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				169	6					064503	10.1149/1945-7111/ac7259				JUN 1 2022	2022	Recently, great efforts have been directed in searching for electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, a series of earth-abundant and low-cost iron-copper oxalates and oxides with varying iron/copper ratios were prepared and further examined as OER electrocatalysts. The structures of the samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The catalytic performance of the samples was evaluated by linear scanning voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and chronoamperometry. The electrochemical results indicated that the oxides are better OER candidates than the corresponding oxalates. The coexistence of copper oxide and iron oxide is beneficial for OER activity. Among the samples, the 6CuO-Fe2O3 exhibited the best OER activity. To yield a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), only a potential of 1.74 V was required. In addition, the oxide catalysts also had good stability, as confirmed by chronoamperometry tests.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000804951500001

Here we review the influence of NO on chloroplasts which can be directly induced by interaction with the photosynthetic apparatus by influencing photophosphorylation, electron transport activity and oxido-reduction state of the Mn clusters of the oxygen-evolving complex or by changes in gene expression. The influence of NO-induced changes in the photosynthetic apparatus on its functions and sensitivity to stress factors are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A major obstacle is the sluggish performance of the air cathode, where both oxygen reduction (discharge) and oxygen evolution (charge) reactions occur. Recently, there have been significant advances in the development of graphene-based air cathode materials with a large surface area and catalytically active for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, especially with additional catalysts or dopants. However, most studies reported so far have examined air cathodes with a limited areal mass loading rarely exceeding 1 mg/cm(2). Despite the high gravimetric capacity values achieved, the actual (areal) capacities of those batteries were far from sufficient for practical applications. Here, we present the fabrication, performance, and mechanistic investigations of high-mass-loading (up to 10 mg/cm(2)) graphene-based air electrodes for high-performance Li-O-2 batteries. Such air electrodes could be easily prepared within minutes under solvent-free and binder-free conditions by compression-molding holey graphene materials because of their unique dry compressibility associated with in-plane holes on the graphene sheet. Li-O-2 batteries with high air cathode mass loadings thus prepared exhibited excellent gravimetric capacity as well as ultrahigh areal capacity (as high as similar to 40 mAh/cm(2)). The batteries were also cycled at a high curtailing areal capacity (2 mAh/cm(2)) and showed a better cycling stability for ultrathick cathodes than their thinner counterparts. Detailed post-mortem analyses of the electrodes clearly revealed the battery failure mechanisms under both primary and secondary modes, arising from the oxygen diffusion blockage and the catalytic site deactivation, respectively. These results strongly suggest that the dry-pressed holey graphene electrodes are a highly viable architectural platform for high-capacity, high-performance air cathodes in Li-O-2 batteries of practical significance.									103	5	0	0	4	0	105			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000401307300075	28362096

CLC is realized through redox reactions of gas or solid fuels with oxygen carriers at high temperatures. The oxygen carriers are required to have high reactivity and recyclability with low cost. In this work, we use a low concentration of the lanthanum dopant to dramatically change the reactivity of oxygen carriers in CLC with CO fuel. Lanthanum is a rare earth element and is chosen because of its high catalytic activity. It is found that the conversion rates of lanthanum-doped oxygen carriers are universally higher than those of undoped iron oxide oxygen carriers from 550 degrees C to 780 degrees C. The reactivity increases significantly in doped oxygen carriers at these temperatures favourable for CLC and decreases in these carriers at temperatures above approximately 800 degrees C due to enhanced sintering. Density functional theory (DFT) is used to calculate the surface configuration and energy barriers in CLC reactions and shows dramatically reduced energy barriers in lanthanum-doped iron oxide reactions with CO and oxygen carrier regeneration. This methodology provides substantial reactivity improvements of CLC with oxygen carriers that are relatively simple to fabricate, and it will have an impact on chemical looping particle design and modification.									31	2	0	0	1	0	32			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000412781700008
