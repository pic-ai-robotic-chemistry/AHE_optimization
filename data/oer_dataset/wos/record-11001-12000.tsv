Kinetics has been investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry, quasistationary current-potential curves and reaction order determination. Results have shown that the Tafel slope for as-prepared electrodes is close to 40 mV and independent of oxide composition. The Tafel slope changes on electrodes aged by H-2 evolution: it varies from about 60 mV for pure RuO2 to about 20 mV for pure IrO2. The anomalously low Tafel slope for IrO2-rich electrodes, and the apparent reaction order varying from 1 to ca. 2.5 have been interpreted on the basis of a single mechanism with different rate determining steps in which the back-reaction may have an appreciable effect due to oversaturation of the solution adlayer in the presence of quasi-equilibrium of the H-2 reaction in the pores of the oxide layer.

Herein, an advanced electrocatalyst is prepared by anchoring atomically dispersed Co atoms on N-doped graphene-like hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets (SA-Co-N-4-GCs) and thereby forming Co-N-4-C architecture. Its unique structure with excellent conductivity, large surface area, and three dimensional (3D) interconnected hierarchically porous architecture exposes not only more Co-N-4 active sites to accelerate the kinetics of both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but also provides an efficient charge/mass transport environment to reduce diffusion barrier. Consequently, SA-Co-N-4-GCs exhibits excellent ORR/OER bifunctional activities and durability, surpassing noble-metal catalysts. Liquid RZABs using SA-Co-N-4-GCs cathodes display a high open-circuit voltage of 1.51 V, a remarkable power density of 149.3 mW center dot cm(-2), as well as excellent stability and rechargeability with faint increase in polarization even at a large depth of charge-discharge cycle with 16 h per cycle over an entire 600 h long-term test. Moreover, flexible quasi-solid-state RZABs with SA-Co-N-4-GCs cathodes also deliver a considerable power density of 124.5 mW center dot cm(-2), which is even higher than that of liquid batteries using noble-metal catalysts. This work has thrown new insight into development of high-performance and low-cost electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000797290400002

In this work, a series of porous La0.5Sr0.5Co1-xWxO3-delta perovskite nanofibers with a high ratio of Co2+/Co3+ and oxygen defects were prepared by doping W ions at B-sites. It was revealed that the W dopant effectively optimized the electronic structures of La0.5Sr0.5Co1-xWxO3-delta (x = 0.3), which not only reduced the electron numbers of the e(g) orbital, but also regulated the O 2p-band closer to the Femi level, calculating for the expressively enhanced bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity. Optimized LSCW0.3 possessed a low oxygen evolution potential of 1.58 V vs. RHE to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and an excellent long-term stability for 50 hours in 1 M KOH electrolyte. In addition, LSCW0.3 with the efficient bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity was used as the cathode in the rechargeable zinc-air battery. The LSCW0.3-based zinc-air battery delivered a high power density of 121.23 mW cm(-2) at a current density of 156 mA cm(-2), which was much higher than that of the Pt/C + RuO2-based zinc-air battery. The LSCW0.3-based zinc-air battery demonstrated a stable voltage gap after 1000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycle tests.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000668130100001

As electrocatalysts, these derivatives (metal, metal compound, and associated composites) have a wide range of application in water-splitting devices, fuel cells, and other hydrogen-related technologies. However, with the exception of pyrolysis, limited studies have documented generated metal nanoparticles from MOFs hydrolysis reactions. Herein, NiRu dual-phase alloy nanoparticles are synthesized via in situ MOFs hydrolysis mediating solvothermal reduction reaction. The hcp-phase NiRu alloys can be rationally tuned by modulating experimental parameters of feeding metal ratio and reaction time. The volcanic link between hydrogen evolution reaction activity and the descriptor of d band center is investigated using experimentally determined valence bands. Furthermore, compared with fcc-phase NiRu alloys, it is theoretically revealed that hcp-phase NiRu alloys optimize d band structure and have a lower energy barrier. This finding broadens the range of application for MOFs hydrolysis reactions and highlights advantages of metal alloys manufactured from MOFs hydrolysis reactions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2366-9608			WOS:000732599000001	34935311

Firstly, a low-cost and scalable synthesis method was developed to synthesis 4-5 nm hydrophilic NixFe(1-x)@NixFe(1-x)O core-shell nanocrystals with superparamagnetism. Then, these NixFe(1-x)@NixFe(1-x)O nanoparticles (NPs) could be easily supported on nickel foam without any binders or additives. Optimized by the composition effect, the Ni0.7Fe0.3@Ni0.7Fe0.3O/NF exhibits excellent activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), requires only 215 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) and 260 mV at 100 mA center dot cm(-2), with a Tafel slope of 47.4 mV center dot dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, the underlying mechanism was carefully studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Due to the self-magnetic attraction, the catalyst shows outstanding stability throughout the electrocatalysis, surpassing than most self-supported catalysts. This work provides a new strategy for the construction of highly active and stable OER electrocatalysts, the nearly monodisperse magnetic NixFe(1-x)@NixFe(1-x)O NPs also serve an ideal building block for fundamental research of nickel-iron based catalyst.									17	5	0	0	0	0	17			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000507801500008

To monitor electronic property of catalyst during the OER can provide crucial insights into catalytic ability. Here we design a planar electrochemical microdevice based on individual thin-film catalyst, and for the first time explore the continuous electric conductance evolution of lattice P-doped oxides during the electrochemical activation process. Moreover, combining on-chip electrochemical impedance spectra measurements, in situ I-V measurements, and theoretical simulations of reconstructed lattice P-doped oxides, the effect of P?O groups on new-formed oxides is clarified. The induced electronic coupling between new-formed oxides and P-O groups has been studied and demonstrated. The coupled P?O groups effectively promote the metal?oxygen covalency of new-formed oxides, which accelerates electron transfer between active metallic center and oxygen adsorbates, thus leading to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Our study highlights the role of surface P?O groups in Co3O4 during the OER, and such unique on-chip electrochemical microdevice platform can also be applied in other related fields to understand the dynamic behavior of energy materials at nanoscale.									25	3	0	0	2	0	26			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000641594700002

However, the level of hydrogen gas production is still small. In addition, noble-metal catalysts for the reaction in acidic environments, as well as an additional drying step to remove water contained in the hydrogen, are required. Therefore, water electrolysis system with high efficiency and lower cost, an alkaline anion-exchange membrane system that can produce high-purity hydrogen without a noble-metal catalyst, is needed. Nano-size NiCo2O4 powders were prepared by using a sol-gel method to achieve an efficient and economical water electrolysis system. When the powder was calcined at 450 A degrees C, the crystallinity and the cyclic voltammogram measurement showed the best values. In addition, the 15-wt.% polytetrafluoroethylene mixed NiCo2O4 powders exhibited the largest cyclic voltammetry active area and the highest oxygen evolution reaction activity with the appropriate stability.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0374-4884	1976-8524		WOS:000365103800011

Different from many previous studies that use binder to adhere nanoparticles to electrode substates CeO2 nanoparticles are successfully introduced to a porous Ni-Cu substrate without binders in this work. The CeO2-modified Ni-Cu catalyst has abundant active sites which can promote the mass transfer and facilitate the Hatom adsorption of hydrogen evolution reaction. In addition the oxygen vacancies of CeO2 and the synergistic effect between Ce3+ and Ce4+ are manifested during the hydrogen evolution reaction. For producing hydrogen through water electrolysis results show that the obtained porous CeO2/Ni-Cu catalyst presents an overpotential of 72 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) as well as a long-term stability of more than 24 h. This work provides new idea for the development of the composite catalyst derived from non -precious metals with the stable structure for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline condition.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000697031000012

However, the high activation barrier for water splitting greatly hinders large-scale hydrogen production, inspiring the necessity of using catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Materials from precious metals to earth-abundant transition metals and their composites have been widely developed, in which transition metal selenides display a more outstanding bifunctional catalytic performance. This review aims to focus on the design strategies of transition metal selenide based catalysts from modification methods, including morphological control, anion substitution and cation substitution, as well as using composite materials modified by constructing heterostructures and the synergistic effect of different components. Finally, it provides guidance for the research status, and future development directions of multifunctional electrocatalytic selenide based materials are also suggested.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2398-4902			WOS:000626710500005

In addition, the O-2 evolution reaction (OER) is considered to be the rate-determining step. Here we develop a surface modification strategy for carbon nitride (CN) to improve its photocatalytic OER activity, thus making the overall reaction possible. We take CN nanosheets (CNNS) as an example to demonstrate that the single Co sites with high density (3.0 wt%) can be obtained on the surface of CNNS via a simple organic-solvent driven deposition method. The photocatalytic O-2 evolution rate of the as-synthesized Co/CNNS is significantly increased, up to about 46 times that of pristine CNNS. In the presence of Pt as the reduction cocatalyst, the Co/CNNS sample can induce overall reactions with H-2 and O-2 evolution rates of 14 and 7.2 mu mol h(-1), respectively, about five times those of CNNS. The abundant exposed Co atoms not only act as active sites to facilitate the surface water oxidation reaction, but also quickly trap the holes to promote the charge separation and transfer. This research reports a universal strategy of surface modification CNs to promote photocatalytic overall water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000762840200006

However, in the water-splitting reaction, a high overpotential is needed to overcome the high-energy barrier due to the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, we selected the 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation reaction, which is thermodynamically favored, to replace the OER in the water-splitting process. We fabricated three-dimensional hybrid electrocatalytic electrodes via layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly for simultaneous HMF conversion and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to investigate the effect of the nanoarchitecture of the electrode on the electrocatalytic activity. Nanosized graphene oxide was used as a negatively charged building block for LbL assembly to immobilize the two electroactive components: positively charged Au and Pd nanoparticles (NPs). The internal architecture of the LbL-assembled multilayer electrodes could be precisely controlled and their electrocatalytic performance could be modified by changing the nanoarchitecture of the electrode, including the thickness and position of the metal NPs. Even with a composition of the identical constituent NPs, the electrodes exhibited highly tunable electrocatalytic performance depending on the reaction kinetics as well as a diffusioncontrolled process due to the sequential HMF oxidation and the HER. Furthermore, a bifunctional two-electrode electrolyzer for both the anodic HMF oxidation and the cathodic HER, which had an optimized LbL-assembled electrode for each reaction, exhibited the best full-cell electrocatalytic activity.									34	2	0	0	0	0	35			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000543744100040	32490662

These 3-DOM IrO2 honeycomb arrays showed a large surface area and ordered macropores (155 nm in diameter) cross-linked by secondary mesopores. Internal structures of 3-DOM IrO2 material were observed microscopically through these secondary pores. According to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra, 3-DOM IrO2 has a rutile crystal structure and is mainly composed of iridium dioxide. In acidic electrolytes, the overpotential of 3-DOM IrO2 material at 0.5 mV cm(-2) was only 0.22 V.

As a representative of inverse-spinel-structured oxide catalysts, nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) has recently gained interest because of its earth abundance and environmental friendliness. However, the gained electrocatalytic performance of NiFe2O4 for the OER is still far from the state-of-the-art requirements because of its poor reactivity and finite number of surface active sites. Here, we prepared a series of atomically thin NiFe2O4 catalysts with different lateral sizes through a mild and controllable method. We found that the atomically thin NiFe2O4 quantum dots (AT NiFe2O4 QDs) show the highest OER performance with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 262 mV and a small Tafel slope of 37 mV decade(-1). The outstanding OER performance of AT NiFe2O4 QDs is even comparable to that of commercial RuO2 catalyst, which can be attributed to its high reactivity and the high fraction of active edge sites resulting from the synergetic effect between the atomically thin thickness and the small lateral size of the atomically thin quantum dot (AT QD) structural motif. The experimental results reveal a negative correlation between lateral size and OER performance in alkaline media. Specifically speaking, the number of low-coordinated oxygen atoms increases with decreasing lateral size, and this leads to significantly more oxygen vacancies that can lower the adsorption energy of H2O, increasing the catalytic OER efficiency of AT NiFe2O4 QDs.									112	4	0	0	4	0	114			2155-5435			WOS:000407309100075

Particularly, the tunable composition and structure of conductive MOFs provide an opportunity to probe the structure-activity relationship toward electrocatalysis. Herein, we exemplify an alternative strategy to modulate the electronic structure in conductive MOFs for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By replacing an appropriate number of Ni-O-4 sites with Fe-O-4 sites in NiPc-Ni, the optimal bimetallic conductive MOF has a low overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and an ultra-high TOF value of 1.943 s(-1) at eta = 300 mV. DFT calculations reveal that the electronic interaction between Ni-O-4 and Fe-O-4 notably enhances the intrinsic activity of bimetallic conductive MOFs.

Two-dimensional (2D) nano-laminated materials are imperious as electrocatalysts due to their phenomenal properties and extensive scope of applications. In this work, we report a greener way of synthesizing MXene without hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment and demonstrated its excellent electrochemical characteristics as an overall water-splitting catalyst. Cl-terminated MXenes (Ti3C2Cl2) were synthesized via a molten salt approach, in which the MAX phase (Ti3AlC2) was reacted with copper chloride (CuCl2) salt followed by thermal treatment at a temperature of 550 degrees C for 5 hours. The resulting Cl-terminated MXene was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope, Raman, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical testing was performed in the alkaline media for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). For OER in 1 M KOH, Cl-terminated MXene achieves a benchmark of 30 mA cm(-2) current density at an overpotential of 330 mV and a Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1), while HF-MXene exhibits an overpotential of 390 mV and a Tafel slope of 136 mV dec(-1). For HER, Cl-MXene attains an overpotential of 259 mV, and a Tafel slope of 92 mV dec(-1) to achieve the 10 mA cm(-2) current density, on the other hand, HF-MXene achieves an overpotential of 444 mV and a Tafel slope of 311 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, the electrocatalyst exhibited excellent long-term stability of 0.7 V at 100 mA cm(-2) current density for 36 hours. The synthesis methodology for greener Cl-terminated MXene coupled with an outstanding electrocatalytic activity is set to open new avenues of catalyst design for water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000776190600001

Herein, we designed and synthesized bi-functional electrocatalyst Co9S8/C nanosheets (NSs) by reducing the Co3O4/C NS precursor with sodium sulfide. From the structural characterization, Co9S8 is anchored on the graphitized carbon NSs homogeneously. According to the electrochemical measurements, the Co9S8/C NSs show excellent electrocatalytic activity towards both the ORR (E-onset = 0.892 V vs. RHE and (E1/2) is 0.778 V vs. RHE) and OER (E-onset = 1.50 V vs. RHE and the overpotential is 0.434 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2)) in 0.1 M KOH solution. In the ORR, Co9S8/C catalyzes through a 4-electron process like the commercial Pt-based catalyst. In addition, the Co9S8/C NSs show great long-term stability. The Co9S8/C NSs show excellent catalytic performance due to the rich active sites and two-dimensional sheet structure. The developed strategy offers an effective method for preparing bi-functional electrocatalysts for both the OER and ORR.									73	3	0	0	2	0	74			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000460162900069	30411107	
J	Kang, Yong-Ju; Jung, Sung Chul; Kim, Hyung-Jin; Han, Young-Kyu; Oh, Si Hyoung								Maximum catalytic activity of Pt3M in Li-O-2 batteries: M = group V transition metals								NANO ENERGY				27				1	7		10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.06.040				SEP 2016	2016	Li-O-2 batteries are considered as promising power sources for electric vehicles due to their remarkably high energy density. However, low rate capability and short cycle life caused by sluggish oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) kinetics limit their practical applications. Here, we investigate the catalytic activities of Pt3M bimetallic alloys (M = 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals) for improving the ORR and OER kinetics using first-principles calculations. We found that the group 5 elements (V, Nb, and Ta in 3d, 4d, and 5d periods, respectively) are the most effective alloy components for high catalytic activity. Pt3V, Pt3Nb, and Pt3Ta alloys exhibit considerably lower ORR and OER overpotentials (by 71-77% and 57-59%, respectively) than those of Pt. The catalytic activities are successfully described by the adsorption strengths of reaction intermediate species (Li and LiO2) on the alloy surface rather than the d-band center of the alloy surface and are fundamentally controlled by the amount of surface charge. The superior catalytic activities of Pt3M alloys with the group 5 elements originate from their electron-rich surfaces and can also be interpreted in terms of the integration of mechanical interplay and chemical interplay of Pt and M, i.e., an appropriate trade-off between surface strain and ligand effects.

Herein, a novel in-situ one-pot strategy is developed for the first time to synthesize molybdenum carbide nanoparticles (Mo2C NPs) incorporated on nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) co-doped stereotaxically carbon (SC). The optimized Mo2C NPs/N, PSC800 electrocatalyst exhibits lower overpotentials of 131 and 287 mV for HER and OER to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH medium with smaller Tafel slopes of 58.9 and 74.4 mV/dec, respectively. In addition, an electrolyzer using Mo2C NPs/N, PSC800 electrode as cathode and anode delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small voltage of 1.64 V for overall water splitting. The excellent water splitting performance could be ascribed to optimum Mo2C NPs for more accessible active sites, highly active N, P-SC networks for accelerated electron transfers, and synergetic effect between Mo2C NPs and N, P-SC networks. The N, P-SC network not only enhances the overall dispersion of Mo2C NPs but also contributes numerous electroactive edges to enhance the performance of HER, OER, and overall water splitting activity. This research work explores the in-situ one-step strategies of advanced, cost-effective, and non-precious metal electrocatalysts for efficient water splitting and motivates the consideration of a novel class of heteroatom doped stereotaxically carbon nanocomposites for sustainable energy production.

Also, the spinel needs only 10 mV more overpotential compared with benchmark IrO2/C to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The 3DOM spinel shows superior stability for both reactions, retaining 80.5 (for the ORR) and 100% (for the OER) of the initial current after 10 h, respectively. This 3DOM spinel is used as an air electrode in a rechargeable Zn-air battery, enabling an open-circuit potential of 1.44 V, which is similar to that obtained for Pt/C (1.46 V), while also displaying a similar performance (109 vs. 101 mW cm(-2)). Moreover, because of its excellent activity as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, the 3DOM spinel displays a superior charge-discharge capability after being operated for 21 h, while successfully supplying the energy requirements of a multi-sensor, which is operated for more than 2 h.									30	1	0	0	1	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000533422400037

Here we show a generic approach to fabricate ultrathin nanosheet array of metal-organic frameworks on different substrates through a dissolution-crystallization mechanism. These materials exhibit intriguing properties for electrocatalysis including highly exposed active molecular metal sites owning to ultra-small thickness of nanosheets, improved electrical conductivity and a combination of hierarchical porosity. We fabricate a nickel-iron-based metal-organic framework array, which demonstrates superior electrocatalytic performance towards oxygen evolution reaction with a small overpotential of 240 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and robust operation for 20,000 s with no detectable activity decay. Remarkably, the turnover frequency of the electrode is 3.8 s(-1) at an overpotential of 400 mV. We further demonstrate the promise of these electrodes for other important catalytic reactions including hydrogen evolution reaction and overall water splitting.									773	51	0	0	31	0	779			2041-1723			WOS:000402742100001	28580963

Although the thermodynamics and kinetics of the formation of nanoparticles have been largely investigated, the precise synthesis of clusters in wet chemical methods still faces great challenges. In the study, a quenching strategy of asymmetric temperature in solution for the rapid generation of vacancy-defect rich clusters is reported. The quenching process can be used to synthesize multitudinous metal compound clusters, including metal oxides, fluorides, oxygen-sulfur compounds, and tungstate. For oxygen evolution reaction (OER), IrO2 clusters with abundant oxygen vacancies were obtained and uniformly dispersed in the solution. Compared to commercial IrO2, the prepared IrO2 cluster can be directly loaded on carbon paper and used as binder-free electrodes, which exhibit higher OER activity and long-term operational stability in alkaline electrolytes. The quenching strategy provides a simple and efficient method for the synthesis of clusters, which has tremendous potential for industrial-scale preparation and application, especially can be further applied to flow electrochemical generators.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000819296800001

As a typical environment-friendly renewable resource with a wide range of sources, wood has a hierarchical porous structure and is rich in carbon content. Recently, wood has been applied as three-dimensional self-supported conductive substrates after high-temperature carbonization or activation, which has sparked great interest among researchers. During the fabrication of electrochemical energy conversion devices, the unique vertically aligned open channels and lateral micro-nano pores are beneficial for improving the loading amounts of active catalysts and for promoting ion transport, thus enhancing the catalytic performances. In this review, we summarized the research progress on wood-based electrocatalysts in oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, emphatically introduced the effects of the species, structures, and components of wood on electrocatalytic performance, and discussed the future prospect of development of wood-based electrocatalytic materials. This should provide new insight into the design of novel wood-based electrocatalytic materials with high performance and environmental friendliness, and promote the production and development of new green and low-carbon energy sources.			随着全球对新能源需求的持续增加,高效、稳定、绿色、环保的能源生产方式受到越来越多的关注。木材是一种典型的来源广泛、绿色环保的可再生资源,且具有分级多孔结构和丰富的碳成分。近年来,木材被用作基底材料,经过高温碳化或活化处理后,作为新型电化学能源转换器件的3D自支撑电极引起研究学者们极大兴趣。在电化学能源转换器件的制备中,可充分利用木材独特的开放型垂直孔道和横向微纳孔隙结构,提高活性粒子的负载量、促进离子的传输,进而从两个方面实现催化性能的提高。文中总结了木质基电催化析氧析氢材料的研究进展,着重介绍了木材的种类、结构、组成对电催化性能的影响,探讨了木质基电催化材料今后的发展前景,为高性能、环境友好型的新型木质基电催化材料的设计提供新的思路,助推绿色低碳新能源的创生与发展。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2096-0018			CSCD:7043104

By combining the MOF derivation and fluorination approaches, herein, we demonstrated an efficient catalyst of ZIFFeCo MOFs derived FeCo fluoride hybrid with efficient catalytic synergism for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The temperature dependence of fluorination for derivatives is observed by the physical characterization and electrochemical measurements. The optimal catalysts show the best catalytic performance for OER with 250 mV overpotentials (No IR correction) to offer 10 mA cm(-2) loaded on glass carbon electrode, which is much better than that of the pristine ZIF-FeCo MOFs and the traditional carbonization derivatives of ZIF-FeCo/C. An efficient synergism of Fe and Co in the catalyst system is demonstrated compared to the single metal MOFderived fluorides. The specific activity and TOF value at 1.53 V are 2.34 mA cm(-2) and 0.055 s(-1), respectively, about 17 and 55 times higher than the pristine ZIF-FeCo MOF, and 5 and 14 times higher of ZIF-FeCo/C samples. High catalytic performances of catalytic stability, kinetics, charge transfer ability and active sites efficiency can be attributed to the combined techniques of MOF derivatives and fluorination etching induced high electrochemical surface area, more active site exposure, conductivity improvement and the facile high valence state of Co active phase formation coming from the high polarity of chemical bonds. The current work expands the application of MOF derivatives in the field of energy conversion and catalysis reactions.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000724792800002

Two metal-modified ZrP catalyst systems were synthesized: metal-intercalated ZrP and metal-adsorbed ZrP, each involving Fe(II), Fe(III), Co(II), and Ni(II) cations. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize the composite materials and confirm the incorporation of the metal cations either between the layers or on the surface of ZrP. Both types of metal-modified systems were examined for their catalytic activity for the OER in 0.1 M KOH solution. All metal-modified ZrP systems were active for the OER. Trends in activity are discussed as a function of the molar ratio in relation to the two types of catalyst systems, resulting in overpotentials for metal-adsorbed ZrP catalysts that were less than, or equal to, their metal-intercalated counterparts.									26	0	0	0	1	1	26			2073-4344			WOS:000404099100007

Small methods								e2201130	e2201130		10.1002/smtd.202201130				2022-Nov-04	2022	Hydrogen generated by proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer holds a promising potential to complement the traditional energy structure and achieve the global target of carbon neutrality for its efficient, clean, and sustainable nature. The acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), owing to its sluggish kinetic process, remains a bottleneck that dominates the efficiency of overall water splitting. Over the past few decades, tremendous efforts have been devoted to exploring OER activity, whereas most show unsatisfying stability to meet the demand for industrial application of PEM electrolyzer. In this review, systematic considerations of the origin and strategies based on OER stability challenges are focused on. Intrinsic deactivation of the material and the extrinsic balance of plant-induced destabilization are summarized. Accordingly, rational strategies for catalyst design including doping and leaching, support effect, coordination effect, strain engineering, phase and facet engineering are discussed for their contribution to the promoted OER stability. Moreover, advanced in situ/operando characterization techniques are put forward to shed light on the OER pathways as well as the structural evolution of the OER catalyst, giving insight into the deactivation mechanisms. Finally, outlooks toward future efforts on the development of long-term and practical electrocatalysts for the PEM electrolyzer are provided.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2366-9608		MEDLINE:36333185	36333185

Herein, we describe the synthesis of cobalt-nickel oxide nanowires decorated with molybdenum disulfide nanosheets, directly grown on Ni foam (MoS2/NiCo2O4/NF), by a simple stepwise hydrothermal method and calcination process. Benefiting from a synergistic effect between MoS2 and NiCo2O4, the heterostructured catalyst accelerates water dissociation and exhibits superior catalytic activity under alkaline conditions, with a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 322 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and an overpotential of 106 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (@ j = 10 mA cm(-2)). Notably, when used as both anode and cathode for overall water splitting, MoS2/NiCo2O4/NF achieved a quite low voltage of 1.62 V at 10 mA cm(-2), and exhibited satisfactory stability for 16 h. Moreover, we have achieved continuous hydrogen and oxygen evolution at 1.606 V generated by using a solar panel, which is a promising route for solar-to-hydrogen conversion.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000605608400017

Here, we can facilely construct electrochemistryinduced crystalline-amorphous phase in hybrid La0.33SrCo0.5Fe0.5Ox (H-LSCF) nanofibers based on the behavior of high-valence cubic perovskites and Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites after the OER, where such unique combination can be artificially modulated. This nano-sized combination surpasses its pure-phase counterparts and exhibits ultra-low overpotentials of 260 mV and 240 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in 0.1 M and 1 M KOH, respectively, which can be ascribed to their favorable solid-liquid contact, higher Co valence and stronger Co-O covalency to accelerate OER electron transport. The beneficial changes in various surface properties of H-LSCF ensure its stability for 80 h and 60 h in 0.1 M and 1 M KOH, respectively. In-situ 18O isotope-labelled experiments directly reveal that such combination can trigger exceptional lattice-oxygen activation mechanism.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000697423000005

It is also challenging to find a suitable support for the catalysts. Though the N-doped graphene tube (NGT) has many advantages over others due to its excellent electrical conductivity, high surface area, easy synthesis, and low cost, it shows very poor HER and ORR activity. Here, we report the in situ decoration of Ru nanocrystals (Ru NCs) on NGT (Ru@NGT) and their applications as efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst toward ORR and HER. The coordinated Ru complex (ruthenium acetylacetonate) is a unique precursor which directly converted to ultrafine (similar to 2 nm) and highly dispersed Ru NCs on NGT surface at low temperature without any treatment of the NGT surface. Because of strong coupling with the Ru on NGT, the hydrogen evolution activity drastically enhances. It shows zero onset potential and better current density as compared to 20% Pt/C catalyst in alkaline medium with long-term stability. The overpotential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) is 75 mV for Pt/C, whereas it requires only 45 mV for the three-dimensional electrode of Ru@NGT/Ni foam. Similarly, the Ru@NGT also shows excellent ORR performance with a limiting current density of 5.0 mA/cm(2) with long-term stability and alcohol tolerance activity. This high activity and better performance is due to the electron transfer from Ru NCs to NGT and better electron transfer within the NGT.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			2574-0962			WOS:000502688800042

Nevertheless, developing highly active bi-functional catalysts at low cost for both OER and ORR still remains a huge challenge. In this paper, Co3O4 nanocrystals embedded in N-doped mesoporous graphitic carbon layer/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) hybrids are prepared by a facile carbonization and subsequent oxidation process of MWCNT-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). As a result, in alkaline media, the hybrid material catalyzes OER with an onset potential of 1.50 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) and an over-potential only of 320 mV to achieve a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for at least 25 h. The same hybrids also exhibit similar catalytic activity but superior stability to the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst for ORR, making it a high-performance cheap bi-catalyst for both OER and ORR. The design concept of nonmetal-doped and precious-metal-free electrocatalysts from MOFs can be extended to fabricate other novel, stable and easy to use catalyst systems for advanced applications.									306	21	0	0	13	0	313			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000359459900054

Herein, an in situ activation of the electrocatalyst of dual metal ions on carbon quantum dots (Fe-NiOOH/CQDs) for the scalable oxygen production is reported. Through alternating the potential-determining step and averaging energy barrier distributions of OER, Fe-NiOOH/CQDs show excellent intrinsic OER performance with an extremely low Tafel slope of 35 mV dec(-1) and the overpotential of 199 mV@10 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, the hydrophilicity and aerophobicity of Fe-NiOOH/CQDs facilitate the rapid OH- diffusion and O-2 detachment, resulting in an outstanding kinetics for large-scale oxygen production. With an overpotential of 450 mV@1000 mA cm(-2) and ultrahigh turnover frequency of 5.4 s(-1), it is superior to most of the reported transitional-metal-based electrocatalysts. Thereby, a water splitting electrolyzer with Fe-NiOOH/CQDs anode is assembled to demonstrate the promising reality.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2688-4062		WOS:000857951000001

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy studies reveal synergistic electronic interactions among Ni, V, and Ru (Ir) cations. Raman spectra and Fourier and wavelet transform analyses of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure indicate modulated local coordination environments around the Ni and V cations, and the existence of V vacancies. The Debye-Waller factor suggests a severely distorted octahedral V environment caused by the incorporation of Ru and Ir. Theoretical calculations further confirm that Ru or Ir doping could optimize the adsorption energy of intermediates in the Volmer and Heyrovsky steps for HER and accelerate the whole kinetic process for OER.									239	14	0	0	23	0	241			2041-1723			WOS:000483017900009	31467288

Herein, efficient bimetallic nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon (Co-Fe@NC) were developed for the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in HSABs. The bimetallic Co-Fc@NC catalyst outperformed its monometallic counterparts in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The assembled HSAB, utilizing the Co-Fe@NC in the air electrode, exhibited a smaller voltage gap of 0.27 V and a higher power density of 5.39 mW/cm(2) compared with the air electrode utilizing Pt/C + RuO2 (0.55 V, 4.79 mW/cm(2)). Furthermore, the round-trip efficiency of the assembled HSAB is up to 75.37% after 700 h of cycling at 0.1 mA/cm(2), outperforming the benchmark HSAB with Pt/C + RuO2 (65.76% after 400 h). This work presents a promising strategy to prepare low-cost, efficient electrocatalysts to substitute the precious catalyst Pt/C + RuO2 in HSABs or other metal-air batteries for practical applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000757996100001

The as-prepared Pt@NPC exhibits superior activity and durability towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in comparison with commercial Pt/C catalyst. The excellent HER performance of Pt@NPC can be ascribed to the combined features of catalyst and support material, including high dispersion and ultrathin particle size of Pt, high surface area and nitrogen doping of carbon support, and the strong interaction between metal and support.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000661350100001	34060238

Cl coverage of 18 atom% was successfully confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and D, G and 2D peaks changes upon irradiation were monitored by Raman. The mobility of chlorinated graphene field-effect transistor decreased to 66.1 cm(2)/(V s) in comparison to pristine graphene of 730.4 cm(2)/ (V s). Raman indicated that the defects and C-Cl bonds are sensitively associated with the irradiation time, thus the structural defects and composition can be engineered accordingly. Given the creation of active sites, namely the polarization of carbon, as well as fast ionic and electronic transport, chlorinated graphene has demanded features for electrocatalytic reactions. As a proof of concept, chlorinated vertically-oriented graphene grown on carbon cloth (CC@VG) served as excellent bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) free-standing electrodes, showing overpotential of 405 mV for OER, Tafel slope of 56 mV, which has better durability than that of commercial Ir/C. Meanwhile, the ORR reduction peak appeared at 0.776 V vs. RHE, more positive than that of carbon cloth (0.60 V). All-solid-state Zn-air battery (ZABs) using chlorinated CC@VG as bifunctional air-cathode showed stable discharge voltage of 1.28 V at current density of 2 mA/cm(2), power density of 45.8 mW/cm(2) at 80 mA/cm(2). More than 108 discharge/charge cycles (20 min per cycle) was obtained at current density of 2 mA/cm(2), and round-trip efficiency decreased from 57.4% to 50.0%. Present work developed a universal chlorination method to endow carbonaceous materials with abundant defects and polarized carbon as active site as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts, and opened a new avenue for developing promising air-cathodes for rechargeable solid-state ZABs.

The heat treatment boosts the conversion of N-containing species from the pyrollic N to graphitic N and pyridinic N, thus improving the electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The physical characterization including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectra, specific surface area and charge transfer resistance indicates that 600 degrees C is a pivotal temperature for remarkably improving the electrochemical activity for ORR in terms of onset potential, half-wave potential, electron transfer number and peroxide yields.

High conductivity, wettability and active sites play key roles for a highly efficient OER catalyst. Here, we report a NiFe foam starting material treated with a two-step process using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) in the presence of PH3, CO2 and H-2, to form phosphate (Pi) and phosphide (P) groups on the foam, and forming NiFePi/P. The self-supported material combines conductivity, wettability with active sites, and is used directly as a working electrode for excellent oxygen evolution in alkaline solutions. Significantly, the strong synergistic effect between the phosphate and phosphide lead to a change in the surrounding electronic environment of metal ions that contributes to the increase in active sites, while improving the wettability and metallic nature of the catalyst, both of these result in an enhanced OER performance. This new material and design strategy appear to represent an intriguing advance that is likely to be of considerable interest to other researchers in the field.									68	0	0	0	2	0	68			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431621700022

In this work, we designed a single-atom catalyst (SAC) in which transition-metal atoms were supported on the N-doped BP (denoted as MNx-BP, M = Fe, Co, Ni; x = 0-3) and systematically studied their catalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline conditions by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The DFT calculation results indicated that the catalytic activity of MNx-BP is significantly affected by the number of doped N atoms surrounding the single-metal center. The coordination of N atoms adjusts the adsorption strength of oxygenated intermediates over the metal center, thus affecting the catalytic performance of MNx-BP. In particular, the SAC of CoN3-BP exhibited the highest activity for OER (the overpotential eta value was 0.48 V for the OER), while NiN3-BP has the highest activity for ORR (the overpotential eta value was 0.44 V for the ORR). This work provided a new perspective on the design of a single-atom catalyst loaded on BP for the OER and ORR processes.									9	0	0	0	0	0	8			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000664312500008

Electrospun nitrogen-doped carbon fibers have the advantages of uniform size, controllable defects, orderly arrangement, and mass production, which benefits their practical applications in electrocatalysis. Nitrogen doping can activate the adjacent carbon atoms. The graphitic nitrogen can donate electron to the -conjugated carbon system and the pyridinic nitrogen has electron attracting effect on the adjacent carbon atom, thereby achieving improved electrocatalytic performance. However, the catalytic activity of pure nitrogen-doped carbon fibers is insufficient for practical applications. Therefore, researchers have conducted extensive investigations on optimizing the structure and composition of carbon fibers. In this review, electrospun N-doped carbon nanofibers with various architectures are summarized, and the advantages of heteroatom doping and fiber structure are grasped. The application progresses of nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers in the fields of oxygen and carbon dioxide reduction reaction, hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction are reviewed.

In this work, we prepare amorphous cobalt iron boride (Co-Fe-B) nanochains on a nickel foam (labeled as Co-Fe-B/NF) via one-pot sodium borohydride reduction of Co2+ and Fe2+ at room temperature and use them to boost the performance of OER. The as-prepared Co-Fe-B nanochains exhibit promising catalytic activity with low overpotentials of 270 and 280 mV at higher current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, and a much lower Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1) for OER. In addition, the Co-Fe-B shows excellent stability for more than 50 h at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2). The satisfactory electrocatalytic performance is mainly due to the synergy between the metal ions (Co and Fe) and plentiful catalytically active sites of the one-dimensional chain-like structure, which improves the atom utilization efficiency.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2574-0970		WOS:000823558600001

The slow reaction rate of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has become the bottleneck to improve the electrocatalytic efficiency. Herein, Fe-doped CoF2 nanowire arrays on 3D nickel foam are prepared by two steps of hydrothermal reaction and fluorination process. The increased catalytic activity sites and accelerated charge transfer rate make the self-supported Fe-doped CoF2 electrode show excellent OER performance in alkaline electrolyte. An overpotential of 230 mV is only required to release a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The Tafel slope derived from the polarization curves is 59 mV dec(-1), indicating outstanding electrochemical kinetics performance. A stable output current density of 84 mA cm(-2) for more than 96 h is achieved under an invariant overpotential of 338 mV, attributing to the anion reconstruction making part of CoF2 transform into cobalt hydroxide and further improving its electrocatalytic performance.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2196-7350			WOS:000515108200001

Herein, we report the electrocatalytic performance of atomically dispersed ruthenium catalysts (Ru ADCs) with ultralow Ru loading (0.2 wt%). The as-obtained Ru ADCs (Ru (0.2)-NC) are active for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which only require a low overpotential (eta) of 47.1 and 72.8 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively, and of 300 mV for OER in 1.0 M KOH, showing favorable bifunctionality. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the Ru-N bonding plays an important role in lowering the energy barrier of the reactions, boosting the HER and OER activities. Furthermore, the bipolar membrane (BPM) water electrolysis using the bifunctional Ru (0.2)-NC as both HER and OER catalysts can afford 10 mA cm(-2) under a low cell voltage of only 0.89 V, and does not show any performance decay upon 100 h continuous operation, showing great potential for energy-saving hydrogen production.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2052-1553			WOS:000819504900001

The synthesized Ni1V1P NSs/NF material shows excellent catalytic activity due to its interconnected three-dimensional (3D) structure and synergistic effect between nickel and vanadium. When used as a catalyst electrode for OER, the synthesized Ni1V1P NSs/NF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity, reaching a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at the low overpotential of 250 mV in 1.0 M KOH. This material also shows superior electrochemical stability with negligible decay of the activity after continual measurement for 15 h at 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. This work provides a valuable method to synthesize efficient OER catalysts by doping valence-variable metal ions and designing distinctive 3D structure.									14	0	0	0	0	0	15			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000502403200001

Role of rhodium doping into lanthanum cobalt oxide (LaCoO3) perovskite and the induced bifunctional activity of oxygen evolution and reduction reactions in alkaline medium								ARABIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				15	11					104256	10.1016/j.arabjc.2022.104256				NOV 2022	2022	Transition metal oxides, especially perovskites, have been considered effective electrocat-alysts for the oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction (ORR) reactions in an alkaline solu-tion. Here, a series of lanthanum cobalt rhodium oxide perovskites with the chemical formula LaCo1-xRhxO3 (LCRO, 0.1 < x < 0.70) were prepared through the approach of solid-phase synthe-sis and their bifunctional electrocatalytic activity was assessed for both the OER and ORR. The crystallinity, morphology, surface, and electrocatalytic features of the LCRO were significantly cor-related with the rhodium content. The LaCo0.7Rh0.3O3 electrocatalysts with x = 0.3 showed enhanced electrocatalytic bifunctional performance with a substantially lower OER/ORR onset potential of 1.38/0.73 V vs HRE, smaller Tafel slope (116/90 mV/dec), and low charge-transfer resistance, which is the most efficient catalyst among the other studied ratios and superior to the pristine lanthanum cobalt oxide benchmark electrocatalysts. The LaCo0.7Rh0.3O3 electrode exhibit good bifunctional electrocatalytic behavior and long-term durability with an OER and ORR onset potential gap (DE = EOER -EORR) of only 0.65 V, which could be credited to the enriched oxygen vacancies, lattice expansion and the improved electrical conductivity upon the doping of larger sizeof Rh ions. The LaCo1-xRhxO3 catalysts are obtained from abundant materials that have the poten-tial of highly-active bifunctional OER and ORR electrocatalysts. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

Herein, Au-cluster loading on unilamellar exfoliated layered double hydroxide (ULDH) electrocatalysts for the OER is demonstrated to fabricate a heterointerface between Au clusters and ULDHs as an active site, which is accompanied by the oxidation state modulation of the active site and interfacial direct O-O coupling ("interfacial DOOC"). The Au-cluster-loaded ULDHs exhibit excellent activities for the OER with an overpotential of 189 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). X-ray absorption fine structure measurements reveal that charge transfer from the Au clusters to ULDHs modifies the oxidation states of trivalent metal ions, which can be active sites on the ULDHs. The present study, supported by highly sensitive spectroscopy combining reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy and modulation-excitation spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, indicates that active sites at the interface between the Au clusters and ULDHs promote a novel OER mechanism through interfacial DOOC, thereby achieving outstanding catalytic performance.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000767170900001	35212064

The influence of alloy composition, achieved through induced codeposition of the reluctant non-metal, i.e. phosphorous (P) on its electrocatalytic activity was studied, and arrived at the best composition of alloy for HER and OER. The water splitting efficacy of the alloy films was tested in 1.0 M KOH using electrochemical methods such as cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry. The experimental observation shows that the alloy thin film with 9.0 wt. % of P and 4.2 wt. % of P are the best electrode materials for HER and OER, respectively. The electrocatalytic performance of alloy films towards HER and OER were related to its surface topography, composition and crystal structure through field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses, respectively.

Here, we report a in-situ simple approach to synthesize ultra small sized transition metal carbides (TMCs) nanoparticles coupled with nitrogen-doped carbon hybrids (TMCs/NC, including WC/NC, V8C7/NC and Mo2C/NC). The TMCs/NC exhibit excellent ORR and HER performances in acidic electrolyte as bi-functional catalysts. The potential of WC/NC at the current density of 3.0 mA cm(-2) for ORR is 0.814 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), which is very close to Pt/C (0.827 V), making it one of the best TMCs based ORR catalysts in acidic electrolyte. Besides, the TMCs/NC exhibit excellent performances toward HER, the Mo2C/NC only need an overpotential of 80 mV to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is very close to Pt/C (37 mV), making it the competitive alternative candidate among the reported non-precious metal HER catalysts.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0360-3199	1879-3487		WOS:000788057700004		
J	Kim, Kyung-Hwan; Choi, Yun-Hyuk								Effect of constituent cations on the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction in high-entropy oxide (Mg0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2)O								JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				922						116737	10.1016/j.jelechem.2022.116737				OCT 1 2022	2022	The electrocatalytic electrode kinetics should be controlled to overcome overpotentials for the hydrogen generation via water electrolysis, which consists of the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Although transition metal catalysts that can replace noble metal catalysts are presented, more studies are still required in terms of stability and activity. Since the compositional diversity can provide a new breakthrough in that area, a high-entropy oxide (HEO) with five cations, (Mg0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2)O, is applied as a promising electrocatalyst toward the OER in this study. For the HEO electrocatalysts, unveiling the effect of constituent cations on the OER activity and finding core cations driving the high OER activity come as a major issue. For it, in this work, the medium-entropy oxides (MEOs) with four cations are prepared by subtracting each cation (Mg, Fe, Co, Ni, or Cu) from the HEO, exhibiting homogeneous morphology, equiatomic composition, and single-phase rocksalt structure. As a result, it is found that the highest concentration of Co3+ in the MEO (w/o Cu) leads to the best OER activity, and thus Co3+ is the core ion driving the high OER activity. Furthermore, it is regarded that Cu2+ ions prevent the con -version of Co or Fe cations from 2(+) to 3(+) in the HEO and MEOs. Accordingly, maximizing the concentration of Co3+ within electrocatalysts is suggested as an effective design strategy for the high-efficiency electrocatalysts based on high or medium entropy materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000863042400001

In this paper, we perform DFT + U calculations to investigate the structural, electronic, and optical properties, water adsorption and the oxygen evolution reaction processes on BiVO4 (001) and BiVO4 (110) surfaces in acidic medium both in the gas and solution (water) phases. The structural, electronic, optical, and water adsorption properties reveal that BiVO4 (001) surface is energetically more stable than BiVO4 (110) surface in vacuum. On other hand, the water oxidation mechanisms reveal that BiVO4 (110) surface in water and in strained form in vacuum is energetically more stable than BiVO4 (001) surface in water and in strained form in vacuum both U = 0 and 2.1 V. The free energy of adsorption for all systems at U = 2.1 V reduce about 2 times than that at U = 0 V. Such analyzes provide important insights into the role of different facets on BiVO4 surface for photocatalytic reactions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000655587100001	33915525

For an efficient water splitting reaction, the development of a highly active, robust and cost-effective catalyst is desirable. Herein, we report iron oxyhydroxide thin films as an efficient water oxidation catalyst. The films have been electrochemically deposited applying anodic potential in the presence of a nonaqueous solvent, using ferrocene as the metal ion precursor and exclude interference from the problems of precipitation of iron hydroxide during the deposition process. The as-prepared films exhibit high catalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction under alkaline as well as under near neutral conditions. Long term testing results showed that the films were able to oxidize water for almost 8 h of continuous operation with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 600 mV under near neutral conditions. The facile method of electrodeposition reported here with outstanding catalytic efficiency is of great significance for the large scale production of hydrogen.									58	4	0	0	1	0	58			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000371967000006

In cool white light, Kappaphycus exhibited a robust circadian rhythm of O-2 evolution in the irradiance range of 100 to 1000 mu mol photons(.)m(-2.)s(-1). With increasing irradiance, the period of the free-running rhythm, tau, decreased in blue and increased in red light but did not change significantly in green light. The accelerating or slowing action of blue or red light, respectively, points to two photoreceptors used in the light transduction pathway of the circadian oscillator controlling oxygen evolution or the light reactions of photosynthesis in Kappaphycus. No significant changes of tau were observed with increasing irradiance in cool white light, possibly due to the additive opposing responses caused by blue and red light.									25	0	0	0	23	1	25			0022-3646			WOS:000173029500013

However, due to a lack of an in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanisms and the nature of the active sites, further advancement of these techniques has been limited by the development of efficient and robust catalysts. Therefore, in situ characterization of these electrocatalytic processes under working conditions is essential. In this review, recent applications of in situ Raman spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy for various nano-and single-atom catalysts in energy-related reactions are summarized. Notable cases are highlighted, including the capture of oxygen-containing intermediate species formed during the reduction of oxygen and oxidation of hydrogen, and the detection of catalyst structural transformations occurring with the change in potential during the evolution of oxygen and reduction of CO2. Finally, the challenges and outlook for advancing in situ spectroscopic technologies to gain a deeper fundamental understanding of these energy-related electrocatalytic processes are discussed.

It is worth noting that Ni2P4O12 electrocatalyst has remarkable oxygen evolution performance operating in basic media. Further experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that N dopant boosts the catalytic performance of Ni2P4O12 due to optimizing the surface electronic structure for better charge transfer and decreasing the adsorption energy for the oxygenic intermediates.									117	12	0	0	8	0	117			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000423793100018	29226454

Model epitaxial catalysts have emerged as a platform to identify structure-function-relationships at the atomic level, a prerequisite to establish advanced catalyst design rules. Previous work identified an inverse relationship between activity and the stability of noble metal and oxide OER catalysts in both acidic and alkaline environments: The most active catalysts for the anodic OER are chemically unstable under reaction conditions leading to fast catalyst dissolution or amorphization, while the most stable catalysts lack sufficient activity. In this perspective, we discuss the role that epitaxial catalysts play in identifying this activity-stability-dilemma and introduce examples of how they can help overcome it. After a brief review of previously observed activity-stability-relationships, we will investigate the dependence of both activity and stability as a function of crystal facet. Our experiments reveal that the inverse relationship is not universal and does not hold for all perovskite oxides in the same manner. In fact, we find that facet-controlled epitaxial La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta catalysts follow the inverse relationship, while for LaNiO3-delta, the (111) facet is both the most active and the most stable. In addition, we show that both activity and stability can be enhanced simultaneously by moving from La-rich to Ni-rich termination layers. These examples show that the previously observed inverse activity-stability-relationship can be overcome for select materials and through careful control of the atomic arrangement at the solid-liquid interface. This realization re-opens the search for active and stable catalysts for water electrolysis that are made from earth-abundant elements. At the same time, these results showcase that additional stabilization via material design strategies will be required to induce a general departure from inverse stability-activity relationships among the transition metal oxide catalysts to ultimately grant access to the full range of available oxides for OER catalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-2646			WOS:000827246200001	35815219

The use of MPc in carbon matrix is attractive due to the formation of M-N-x sites, which are responsible for ORR electrocatalysis and transition metal oxides that are OER-active. Physical characterisation of the prepared catalysts was carried out by scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, N-2 physisorption analysis, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The highest ORR activity among bimetallic catalysts was shown by a MnCoN-CNT catalyst with half-wave potential of 0.84 V. The electrochemical results of the prepared bimetallic catalysts revealed superior OER activity of NiCoN-CNT with E-OER of 1.61 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and also good ORR activity (E-1/2=0.83 V). Furthermore, NiCoN-CNT exhibited excellent stability for both, ORR and OER, with only 5 mV change in half-wave potential and only 14 mV loss in E-OER, respectively. For checking bifunctionality, the NiCoN-CNT catalyst was used as an air electrode and tested for zinc-air battery (ZAB). Good ZAB performance was obtained, with open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.338 V.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2196-0216			WOS:000680140000011

The asprepared Co3O4-N-Gr displayed an onset potential and half-wave potential of 0.98 and 0.86 V, which were 40 and 80 mV larger than that of Pt/C (0.94 and 0.78 V), while its Tafel slope (31.4 mV dec(-1)) was much lower than Pt/C (44.7 mV dec(-1)). Moreover, the current density retained 96.25% after working for 6000 s and had no change after adding methanol. These suggest that the Co3O4-N-Gr is promising as an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium when compared with Pt/C and other reported non-precious catalysts.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			1387-7003	1879-0259		WOS:000478710900024

J	Spector, A; Zhou, W; Ma, WC; Chignell, CF; Reszka, KJ								Investigation of the mechanism of action of microperoxidase-11, (MP11), a potential anti-cataract agent, with hydrogen peroxide and ascorbate								EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH				71	2			183	194		10.1006/exer.2000.0867				AUG 2000	2000	The interaction of hydrogen peroxide, ascorbate and microperoxidase-ll (MP11), a ferriheme undecapeptide derived from cytochrome c, has been investigated using spectrophotometry, oxymetry, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and mass spectroscopy techniques. It is shown that in 50 mM phosphate pH 7.0-7.4 in the absence of other reactants H2O2 induces a concentration-dependent decrease in absorption at the Soret band (399 nm) of the microperoxidase, with concomitant H2O2 decomposition and oxygen evolution. The reaction causes irreversible heme degradation, concomitant with loss of enzymatic activity. Ascorbate effectively protects MP11 from degradation and inhibits oxygen evolution. At ascorbate concentrations greater than that of H2O2, microperoxidase degradation is almost completely prevented. Mass spectrometry showed that H2O2 oxidizes the microperoxidase to a mono-oxygenated product, which did not form if ascorbate was included in the reaction system, There appears to be a 1:1 relationship between H2O2 degradation and ascorbate oxidation. EPR experiments revealed that an ascorbate radical was formed during the reaction, These reactions may be described by a scheme where a putative 'compound I' of the microperoxidase is reduced by ascorbate back to the original redox state (ferric) of the peroxidase in two one-electron steps, concomitantly with oxidation of the ascorbate to an ascorbate radical or in one two-electron transfer step forming dehydroascorbate. In the absence of ascorbate, the 'compound I' reacts further with the peroxide causing microperoxidase degradation and partial oxygen evolution. These observations are relevant to the interaction of ferrihemes with H2O2 and ascorbic acid and may he pertinent for the potential application of MP11 as an anti-cataract agent, (C) 2000 Academic Press.									22	2	0	0	13	0	24			0014-4835	1096-0007		WOS:000088736800008	10930323

Herein, we have synthesized bimetallic (nickel and iron) zeolite imidazolate framework (ZIF)-based nanofibrous materials via a simple electrospinning (ES) process. The structural stability of the fibrous material is subjected to various calcination conditions. We have elaborated the structural importance of the one-dimensional (1D) fibrous materials in electrocatalytic water-splitting reactions. As a result, NiFe-ZIF-NFs (Nanofibers)-RT (Room Temperature) have delivered a small overpotential of 241 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density in OER and 290 mV at a fixed current density of 50 mA cm(-2) in HER at two different pH conditions with 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. Furthermore, it exposes the actual surface area of 27.270 m(2) g(-1) and a high electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of 50 mu F in OER and 55 mu F in HER, which is responsible for the electrochemical performance with better stability. This exceptional activity of the materials is mainly attributed to the structural dependency of the fibrous network through the polymeric architecture.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000687044700080	34296864

Herein, hollow spherical hybrids composed of cobalt phosphate and sufficient heteroatoms-doped carbon (CoPi-HSNPC) are obtained by the direct pyrolysis of organic-inorganic cobalt phosphonate (Co-BHMTPMPA). The homogeneously distributed organophosphonic ligands in the cobalt phosphonate hybrid framework evidently ensure the intimately coupled interaction between the in situ formed heteroatoms-doped conductive carbon substrates and cobalt phosphate nanoparticles. The as-prepared CoPi-HSNPC exhibits extraordinary electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a small overpotential (320 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and robust stability in alkaline conditions. In addition, Ni-based and Mn-based hollow spherical hybrids are also synthesized by this facile metal-phosphonate-derivation method, exhibiting a decent performance toward the OER This work highlights the universal property of organic-inorganic metal phosphonates for the fabrication of metal phosphate hybrids with hierarchical nanostructures, which have significant potential for enhancing energy conversion applications.									42	4	0	0	3	0	42			2168-0485			WOS:000480370500100

The practical application efficiency is often affected by the slow kinetics of hydrogen or oxygen electrocatalytic reactions(hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions, oxygen evolution and reduction reactions)among the emerging devices. Therefore, the researchers devote to finding cost-effective electrocatalysts. Non-noble metal catalysts have low cost and good catalytic activity, but poor stability, agglomeration, dissolution, and other problems will occur after a long cycle, such as transition metal oxides and carbides. Transition metal nitrides(TMNs)stand out among all kinds of non-noble metal catalysts because of the intrinsic platinum-like electrocatalytic activities, relatively high conductivity, and wide range of tunability. In this review, the applications of TMNs in electrocatalytic fields are summarized based on the number of metals contained in TMNs. The practical application potentials of TMNs in fuel cell, water splitting, zinc-air battery and other electrochemical energy storage/conversion devices are also listed. Finally, the design strategies and viewpoints of TMNs-based electrocatalyst are summarized. The potential challenges of TMNs-based electrocatalyst in the development of electrocatalytic energy devices in the future are prospected.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-5861			CSCD:7264731

A mature aqueous alkaline electrolyte could also significantly improve safety while minimizing the fabrication cost. Hence, ZABs have great potential to challenge the dominant position of LIBs in the future. Nevertheless, the widespread application of this energy storage system is seriously hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution reactions (OER) at the liquid-gas-solid phase cathode interface. Therefore, to further promote the development of this technology, the development of low-cost, high-activity catalysts for the OER/ORR has long been recognized as a crucial measure. This paper summarizes the existing strategies that could be used to develop non-precious-metal based, high activity bifunctional OER/ORR catalysts for the alkaline electrolyte based zinc-air system.									57	5	0	0	0	0	59			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000490535600005

The performance of metal-air batteries is guided by the kinetics of electrochemical reactions involving oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution. The present study explores the use of a gel-based electrolyte in combination with a ceramic catalyst based on titanium carbonitride for Li-O-2 battery. Stable and highly ionically conducting gel electrolyte combined with active bi-functional electrocatalyst results in flexible and thin cell design. The high bi-functional activity of the electrode for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions in nonaqueous dimethyl acetamide medium lends itself to be a very good electrode material for Li-O-2 chemistry.

Both of the concentration of ammonium fluoride and the reaction time are adjusted to obtain a series of NiFe-LDH microspheres, with different internal structures from massive to hollow generated during the hydrothermal treatment, which improve the electrocatalytic activity of the NiFe-LDH catalysts towards the evolution reaction of oxygen. The optimized NiFe-LDH-0.4M HMS show the excellent OER performance in alkaline electrolyte with eta = 290 mV@10 mA cm(-2), and a Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1), which outperforms the benchmark RuO2 catalyst. The possible reason is attributed to the more exposure of active sites, and fast ion transport resulting from the hierarchical hollow structure.

The as-obtained nanosheet-array-like composites exhibit excellent performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In particular, Ni2Fe1-LDH/rGO/NF requires 228 and 109 mV for the OER and HER in 1 M KOH at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, when it is directly used as both cathode and anode at the same time for overall water splitting, it only requires 1.62 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2). The as-prepared Ni2Fe1-LDH/rGO/NF composite shows excellent electrocatalytic performance, which is ascribed to the unique array-like nanosheet framework with exposed paths, the synergy between Ni2Fe1-LDH and rGO, and the vertically staggered growth of Ni2Fe1-LDH on the rGO/NF substrate improving the stability. This strategy can also be applied to create composites of other metal compositions with a nanosheet-array-like structure as efficient electrocatalysts for the development of efficient clean renewable energy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2633-5409		WOS:000832640300001

One promising alternative to fossil fuels is green hydrogen, which can be produced through water electrolysis from renewable electricity. However, the variety and complexity of hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts currently studied increases the difficulty in the integration of catalytic theory, catalyst design and preparation, and characterization methods. Herein, this review first highlights design principles for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts, presenting the thermodynamics, kinetics, and related electronic and structural descriptors for HER. Second, the reasonable design, preparation, mechanistic understanding, and performance enhancement of electrocatalysts are deeply discussed based on intrinsic and extrinsic effects. Third, recent advancements in the electrocatalytic water splitting technology are further discussed briefly.

Rotating ring-disk studies of the oxygen reduction reaction on Cu UPD show a strong inhibition of the reaction only in the region of diffusion control.

However, progress in the development of highly active oxide nanostructures is hampered by a lack of knowledge of the location and nature of the active sites. Here we show, through atom-resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy, X-ray spectroscopy and computational modelling, how hydroxyls form from water dissociation at under coordinated cobalt edge sites of cobalt oxide nanoislands. Surprisingly, we find that an additional water molecule acts to promote all the elementary steps of the dissociation process and subsequent hydrogen migration, revealing the important assisting role of a water molecule in its own dissociation process on a metal oxide. Inspired by the experimental findings, we theoretically model the oxygen evolution reaction activity of cobalt oxide nanoislands and show that the nanoparticle metal edges also display favourable adsorption energetics for water oxidation under electrochemical conditions.									92	4	0	0	5	0	92			2041-1723			WOS:000392858400001	28134335

Quasi-stationary polarization curves showed that the mixed catalyst, Ag + Co3O4 (10 wt%), outperformed its components. Rotating ringdisc electrode (RRDE) measurements revealed a negligible peroxide species formation and a 4-electron pathway for ORR. A tafel slope of ca. 75 mV dec(-1) has been observed. The overpotential for ORR at 10% Co3O4 catalyst is ca. 70 mV lower than that of Ag and only ca. 80 mV higher than that of the commercial Pt catalyst. DEMS technique provided a direct evidence for oxygen evolution at these bimetallic catalysts. This hybrid is therefore one of the (or even the) most active, carbon-free, durable, non-precious ORR and OER electrocatalysts reported to date.

In order to decrease the power consumption during gas evolution, the performance of the electrodes must be increased. In this study, IrO2- or Sb-doped SnO2 (ATO) nanoparticles were added to IrO2 DSAs at a level of 5-40%. The anode surfaces were characterised with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The performance of the anodes for the oxygen evolution reaction was measured in 0.5 mol L-1 H2SO4 solution potentiostatically. The performance increased for both the IrO2 and the ATO nanoparticles' addition. The maximum performance with IrO2 nanoparticles occurs when the electrode contains 40 wt% nanoparticles, with more than double the current density at 1.25 V, and for ATO, the maximum occurs at 10% nanoparticles with a 70% increase in current density. These both correspond to the maxima in electrochemically active surface area as determined by cyclic voltammetry. The improvement in performance appears therefore to be primarily caused by the increase in surface area. Addition of catalytically active nanoparticles is shown to be an effective method to increase DSA electrode performance towards the oxygen evolution reaction.									30	4	0	0	0	0	32			0022-2461			WOS:000299104300006

The observed OER performance decreases when increasing the annealing temperature due to the nanostructure deformation and agglomeration and the decreased number of oxygen vacancies, electrochemically active surface area, and electrical conductivity. An optimized nanopetal structure of CuxCo3-xO4 (x = 0.95, annealed at 200 degrees C) shows a considerably high Faradaic efficiency (similar to 93%) with a remarkably low overpotential (similar to 230 mV) at a benchmark current density (J) of 10 mA cm(-2); at the same J in an alkaline solution (1 M KOH) for OER, it also exhibits high durability (up to 100 h). This study provides a complete guide for designing efficient and robust spinel-type CCO electrocatalysts through a facile electrochemical route. (C) 2020 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

Herein, in situ structural reconstruction of V-doped Ni2P pre-catalyst to form highly active NiV oxyhydroxides for OER is reported, during which the partial dissolution of V creates a disordered Ni structure with an enlarged electrochemical surface area. Operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals that the synergistic interaction between the Ni hosts and the remaining V dopants can regulate the electronic structure of NiV oxyhydroxides, which leads to enhanced kinetics for the adsorption of *OH and deprotonation of *OOH intermediates. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy further demonstrate that the increased content of active beta-NiOOH phase with the disordered Ni active sites contributes to OER activity enhancement. Density functional theory calculations verify that the V dopants facilitate the generation of *O intermediates during OER, which is the rate-determining step for realizing efficient O-2 evolution. Optimization of these properties endows the NiV oxyhydroxide electrode with a low overpotential of 221 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability in the alkaline electrolyte.									55	1	0	0	4	0	55			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000640759600001

Herein, we present the design and construction of an advanced class of Prussian blue analog (PBA)/transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) hybrids, which combine the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of TMDs for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the sunlight response of TMDs and PBAs. Consequently, the porous framework, engineered surface defects, and abundant oxygen vacancies endow them with remarkably enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward OER due to the enlarged electrolyte-accessible surface, high structural integrity, and abundant electron and mass transfer routes. Moreover, they could also enable photo-assisted oxidation reactions with significantly high current density and low overpotential. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the OER improvement can mainly be ascribed to the combination of photo-driven and electricity-driven water oxidation reaction, where the photogenerated electron transfer from PBAs to TMDs results in photogenerated holes in PBAs that are more beneficial for the oxidation of H2O, as well as affording decreased activation energy of TMDs for the OER. This work manifests the photo-assisted electrocatalytic water oxidation ability of PBA/TMD hybrids and offers a new avenue for the design and construction of high-performance electrocatalysts for water splitting upon light irradiation.									84	2	0	0	2	0	83			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000501811800016

We describe here a novel Mn3O4/CoSe2 hybrid which could be a promising candidate for such electrocatalysts. Possibly due to the synergetic chemical coupling effects between Mn3O4 and CoSe2, the constructed hybrid displayed superior OER catalytic performance relative to its parent CoSe2/DETA nanobelts. Notably, such earth-abundant cobalt (Co)-based catalyst afforded a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of similar to 0.45 V and a small Tafel slope down to 49 mV/decade, comparable to the best performance of the well-investigated cobalt oxides. Moreover, this Mn3O4/CoSe2 hybrid shows good stability in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, which is highly required to a promising OER electrocatalyst.									566	13	0	0	31	0	569			0002-7863			WOS:000301161500023	22296184

In this work, inspired by biological evolution phenomenon, we develop a simple electrochemical "stimulation-evolution " mechanism and successfully fabricate Fe nanodots-doped Ni hydroxide nanoflakes film electrode under a real-time oxygen evolution reaction (OER) situation in alkaline KOH electrolyte. Physical characterizations show that the film product is composed by Ni(OH)(2) ultrathin nanoflakes with Fe hydroxide nanodots evenly doped, which shows combined properties of hierarchical nanostructure, 3D porous framework and enhanced affinity/conductivity. Being adopted as additive-free electrode, the product exhibits greatly improved OER catalytic activity with low onset over potential, low Tafel slope of 43.5 mV dec(-1), promising repairability/recyclability and high energy conversion efficiency. The in-situ electrochemical research shows a high compatibility of electrode and indicates that the fast OER kinetics is mainly ascribed to the severely reduced reaction resistance, which is further supported by density functional calculations. In-situ Raman study reveals a dynamic changes of material/H2O status on electrode interface during OER process. The as-proposed strategy, from view of methodology, may have great value on synthesizing other efficient catalytic film products.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000805290000002

In.recent years, various Mn-based oxides were identified as promising catalysts for both reactions. While electrocatalytic activity of such oxides is well addressed, their stability is still to be proven. Herein, we investigate the stability of four main manganese oxide allotropes by following their Mn dissolution rate in operando ORR. and OER conditions. Using an electrochemical on-line inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, we uncover unexpected instability of this class of catalysts, with different degradation mechanisms identified under OER and ORR conditions. The reason for their degradation is shown to be related to the production of hydrogen peroxide species on manganese oxides during ORR. Furthermore, we discuss how limits in thermodynamically stable windows of each Mn oxidation state lead to increased dissolution during applications with high potential perturbations, that is, change in load, start/stop conditions, and especially bifunctional application. Therefore, we recommend clear guidelines for future development of platinum group metal-free electrocatalysts for affordable alkaline energy conversion technologies.									46	0	0	0	2	0	46			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000492118400028

Mg,Ti-base surface integrated layer and bulk doping to suppress lattice oxygen evolution of Ni-rich cathode material at a high cut-off voltage								Journal of Energy Chemistry				71				434	44		10.1016/j.jechem.2022.03.053				2022	2022	The Nickel-rich layered cathode materials charged to 4.5 V can obtain a specific capacity of more than 200 mAh g-1. However, the nickel-rich layered cathode materials suffer from the severe capacity fade during high-voltage cycling, which is related to the phase transformation and the surface sides reactions caused by the lattice oxygen evolution. Here, the simultaneous construction of a Mg, Ti-based surface integrated layer and bulk doping through Mg, Ti surface treatment could suppress the lattice oxygen evolution of Ni-rich material at deep charging. More importantly, Mg and Ti are co-doped into the particles surface to form an Mg2TiO4 and Mg0.5-xTi2-y(PO4)3 outer layer with Mg and Ti vacancies. In the constructed surface integrated layer, the reverse electric field in the Mg2TiO4 effectively suppressed the outward migration of the lattice oxygen anions, while Mg0.5-xTi2-y(PO4)3 outer layer with high electronic conductivity and good lithium ion conductor could effectively maintained the stability of the reaction interface during high-voltage cycling. Meanwhile, bulk Mg and Ti co-doping can mitigate the migration of Ni ions in the bulk to keep the stability of transition metal-oxygen (M-O) bond at deep charging. As a result, the NCM@MTP cathode shows excellent long cycle stability at high-voltage charging, which keep high capacity retention of 89.3% and 84.3% at 1C after 200 and 100 cycles under room and elevated temperature of 25 and 55 degC, respectively. This work provides new insights for manipulating the surface chemistry of electrode materials to suppress the lattice oxygen evolution at high charging voltage.

Without introduction of extra heteroatoms into CNTs, the optimized PANI@CNTs composite exhibits a much better electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than pure CNTs via favorable interfacial modification with PANI to largely expose the active sites of on the surface of pure CNTs. Besides, it displays good oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. When directly utilized as bifunctional air electrode without extra additive agents, the composite membrane-enabled rechargeable Zn-air batteries not only deliver a high peak power density (201.9 W g(-1)) and a large energy density (850.3 Wh kg(Zn)(-1)), but also present robust cycling performance for 216 cycles with a high energy efficiency of 57.8%.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000532800400005	32103578

Herein, it is demonstrated that the robust and high output Zn doped NiOOH-FeOOH (Zn-FexNi(1-x))OOH catalyst can be derived by electro-oxidation-induced reconstruction from the pre-electrocatalyst of Zn modified Ni metal/FeOOH film supported by nickel foam (NF). In situ Raman and ex situ characterizations elucidate that the pre-electrocatalyst undergoes dynamic reconstruction occurring on both the catalyst surface and underneath metal support during the OER process. That involves the Fe dissolution-redeposition and the merge of Zn doped FeOOH with in situ generated NiOOH from NF support and NiZn alloy nanoparticles. Benefiting from the Zn doping and the covalence interaction of FeOOH-NiOOH, the reconstructed electrode shows superior corrosion resistance, and enhanced catalytic activity as well as bonding force at the catalyst-support interface. Together with the feature of superaerophobic surface, the reconstructed electrode only requires an overpotential of 330 mV at a high-current-density of 1000 mA cm(-2) and maintains 97% of its initial activity after 1000 h. This work provides an in-depth understanding of electrocatalyst reconstruction during the OER process, which facilitates the design of high-performance OER catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000839888000001	35961949

The C-O bond of 2-methylcyclopropylmethoxide subsequently breaks near 350 K, yielding the (2-methylcyclopropyl)methyl radical. The (2-methylcyclopropyl)methyl radical can undergo fast rearrangement to two different linear C-5 homoallyl radical species. The two different ring-opening pathways are due to the asymmetric methyl substitution of the cyclopropyl unit. Only one pathway results in a surface-bound product: adsorbed 4-penten-2-oxide is formed via rearrangement to 4-penten-2-yl radical and subsequent trapping on surface oxygen. The 4-penten-2-oxide is identified by comparison of infrared and temperature-programmed reaction data for the reaction product to analogous data for the reference compound. Evolution of C-5 hydrocarbons competes with trapping at 350 K. Careful analysis of temperature-programmed reaction data indicates that 3-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene, and 1,2-dimethylcyclopropane contribute to the 410 K product. However, the close resemblance of the fragmentation patterns for all C-5 hydrocarbons renders quantitative analysis impossible. At elevated temperatures the C-O bond of 4-penten-2-oxide breaks and C-5 hydrocarbon evolution sets in. 1-Pentene and 1,3-pentadiene, as well as propene, are formed in a ratio of 20:70: 10 at similar to520 K. Above 900 K CO is formed from recombination of adsorbed carbon and. oxygen. Our results are discussed in the context of relative reaction rates for different pathways available to hydrocarbon radicals and their relation to product selectivity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1520-6106			WOS:000177472800059

Herein, we propose a strategy of intentionally engineering the local reaction environment to yield highly active catalysts. Taking Pt delta- nanoparticles supported on oxygen vacancy enriched MgO nanosheets as a prototypical example, we have successfully created a local acid-like environment in the alkaline medium and achieve excellent hydrogen evolution reaction performances. The local acid-like environment is evidenced by operando Raman, synchrotron radiation infrared and X-ray absorption spectroscopy that observes a key H3O+ intermediate emergence on the surface of MgO and accumulation around Pt delta- sites during electrocatalysis. Further analysis confirms that the critical factors of the forming the local acid-like environment include: the oxygen vacancy enriched MgO facilitates H2O dissociation to generate H3O+ species; the F centers of MgO transfers its unpaired electrons to Pt, leading to the formation of electron-enriched Pt delta- species; positively charged H3O+ migrates to negatively charged Pt delta- and accumulates around Pt delta- nanoparticles due to the electrostatic attraction, thus creating a local acidic environment in the alkaline medium.While catalysts have intrinsic activities toward reactions, such performances often require further optimization. Here, authors engineer an acid-like environment in alkaline media by fine-tuning the reaction environment of platinum nanoparticles on oxide nanosheets for H-2 evolution electrocatalysis.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2041-1723		WOS:000784997300097	35440547

Intended to the mentioned aim, we have utilized Kohn-Sham formulated extensively popular ab initio method based on density functional theory (DFT). The structural and electronic properties of the BP NW are computed and compared with its bulk phase. We observe dramatic indirect to direct bandgap transition with pronounced energy gap after introducing two-dimensional confinement that is akin to the other reported III-V NWs. The calculated partial density of states with van Hove singularity also confirms the same. Owing to its moderate bandgap value, the applicability of the BP NW as an HER/OER catalyst is assessed by computing the site dependent HER/OER activities. Our computation on Gibbs free energy for the case of hydrogen adsorption with -1.19 eV magnitude gives better results; whereas in case of OER, the results with higher magnitude of Gibbs energy implicate over binding of oxygen with adsorbent thus revealing non-feasible desorption of oxygen from adsorbent. Significant perturbation in electronic states of NW under hydrogen adsorption confirms high sensitivity of BP NW for hydrogen adsorption. Further, the effect of substitutional doping on HER and OER activities suggests that the doped NW shows poor HER activity in contrast to the site-dependent better OER activity in case of Ga doped BP NW. The present BP NW shows potential as an HER catalyst owing to its lower adsorption and Gibbs free energies (-1.07 and -0.84 eV), as compared to previously conventionally utilized III-V NWs. Henceforth, we believe that the present study would serve as a blueprint for the researchers to design and develop toxic and/or metal-free catalyst that can be utilized for efficient water-reduction.

Therefore, the obtained MnCo2O4/N-GQD/MXene electrocatalyst presenting an outstanding ORR performance with a low over potential of only 22 mV, half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.87 V (vs RHE), and remarkable long-term durability, strikingly outperforms commercial Pt/C (20 % w/w). Concerning OER, the MnCo2O4/ N-GQD/MXene exhibiting an onset potential of 1.54 V(vs RHE) and a Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1) displays better performance than IrO2. The zinc-air battery with MnCo2O4/ N-GQD/MXene cathode shows superior peak power density (152.8 mW cm(-2)), tremendous capacity efficiency up to 753 mAh g(-1) and substantial stability, proving that MnCo2O4/ N-GQD/MXene could feasibly be used in metal-air batteries.

In this study, a novel two-step method for the synthesis of cerium oxide nanoparticles in-situ generatedon CoP nanosheets toward OER is presented. Interestingly, Ce ions were gradually hydrolyzed and oxidized under the action of alkaline ligand andsolvothermal environment, and eventually existed in the form of CeOx on the 2D Co-MOF nanosheets in the first step. In the followed selective phosphating process, 2D Co-MOF nanosheets act as the template are transformed into CoP nanosheets but CeOx is still maintained. Optimal CeOx/CoP nanosheets exhibit low OER overpotential, small Tafel slope and robust durability. Furthermore, in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy demonstrates the transformation of the active catalytic species during the oxidation process. This in situ generation of a cocatalyst and selective phosphidation strategy provides some guidelines for the designing of highly efficient catalysts for OER and even other explorations.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2052-1553			WOS:000693194000001

Despite tremendous effects, developing cathode catalysts with high activity remains a great challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of hierarchical macroporous/mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanosheets as an effective cathode catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries. The hierarchical porous catalyst was synthesized by a hydrothermal method, followed by tow temperature calcination. SEM and TEM observations clearly present that the as-prepared NiCo2O4 nanosheets showed a hierarchical porous structure with mesopores distributed through the surface of NiCo2O4 nanosheets and macropores formed between the crumpled nanosheets. When investigating as the cathode catalyst in Li-O-2 batteries, the as-prepared NiCo2O4 nanosheets exhibited higher reversible capacity, lower charge/discharge overpotential, and better cycling stability than those of pristine carbon black. The enhanced electrochemical performance of NiCo2O4 nanosheets should be attributed not only to the high catalytic activity of NiCo2O4 towards oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, but also to the novel hierarchical porous structure of NiCo2O4.									78	4	0	0	2	0	80			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000339535100064

The electrochemical performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was tested in 1 M KOH solution. The overpotential of Co(OH)(2)-Ni(OH)(x)S-y (Co:Ni = 9:1) electrode was 423 mV at 50 mA cm(-2). The potential of the Co(OH)(2)-Ni(OH)(x)S-y (Co:Ni = 9:1) sample remained essentially unchanged from the initial potential of 1.651 V after 12 h of stability test. In this catalyst, the strong synergistic effect between cobalt and nickel ions, the greatly increased amorphous defect sites and oxygen vacancies, and the abundant electrochemical specific surface area together lead to the increased electrocatalytic activity and high electrocatalyst stability. This amorphous CoNi-based composite electrocatalyst prepared by simple electrodeposition has certain significance for the preparation of hydrogen energy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000805466700001

The perovskite samples were synthesized by combustion method. Energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to determine the bulk and the surface composition, respectively. The X-ray diffraction and iodometric titration method were employed to examine the phases and the oxidation state, respectively. It was observed that incorporation of calcium (Ca2+) ions in the lattice of LaFeO3 decreases the lattice parameters and the cell volume systematically as evaluated by Rietveld method. Furthermore, increase in the degree of Ca2+ substitution from 0.0 to 1.0, increases the average oxidation state of iron from Fe3+ to Fe4+ in addition to creating oxygen vacancies. The evaluation of OER kinetics on a rotating disk electrode setup suggests that incorporation of Ca2+ decreases the activity initially (0.0 <= x <= 0.4), but further substitution increases the activity. The maximum activity was observed for x = 1.0. This change in the OER activity suggests an interplay between the bond lengths and angles, oxygen vacancy and the average oxidation state of Fe.

Here we report on copper delafossite oxide (ABO(2); A = Cu) as a novel anode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Among the copper delafossites we synthesized, copper rhodium delafossite (CuRhO2) showed excellent cyclic voltammogram (CV) characteristics for OER in 1 M KOH (aq), comparable to that of Co3O4. We also confirmed that the e(g) orbital occupancy at the B site of delafossites, calculated from the bulk structure, had a strong correlation with the electrochemical OER activity of those materials.

Herein, we report a novel heterostructured Ni2P-Fe2P-Co2P-Ni5P4 nanorods derived from a NiFe LDH@ZIF-67 precatalyst on 3D self-supported Ni foam (NiFeCoP/NF) for water electrolysis. Owing to systematically engineering the composition, structure, and morphology of catalyst, which not only increase the intrinsic activity and create more accessible catalytic activity centers, but also accelerate electron transfer and promote the gas release, the designed NiFeCoP/NF achieves synergistically enhanced catalytic performance towards OER and HER. The as-prepared NiFeCoP/NF electrode exhibits excellent activities with low overpotentials of 244.2 mV for OER and 167.5 mV for HER, respectively to reach a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 KOH solution, as well as outstanding stability for 140 h at 500 mA cm(-2). Additionally, a water electrolysis device constructed with the NiFeCoP/NF electrode as both the anode and cathode only needs a low cell voltage of 1.564 V to achieve 30 mA cm(-2).

Herein, a novel Cu8S5 decorated N, S self-doped interconnected porous carbon (Cu8S5/NSC) with abundant mass transfer channel is successfully designed through a direct pyrolysis strategy of textile sludge waste. Benefiting from the synergistic catalysis between Cu8S5 nanoparticles and the abundant mass transfer channel of the N, S self-doped porous carbon, the Cu8S5/NSC-900 catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability with small overpotentials of 313 and 137 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Significantly, the resultant water splitting system achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.64 V, outperforming the benchmark Pt/C||RuO2.

The hybrid catalyses oxygen evolution reactions (OER) with an onset potential of 1.51 V vs. RHE and an overpotential only of 390 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The Co3O4/mMWCNT catalyst exhibits high Faraday efficiency (>99%) and long-term stability (>25 h) during bulk electrolysis of water. A range of carbon nanostructures including MWCNTs, single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs), and graphene, and CNTs of different oxidation states have been prepared and applied as substrates for Co3O4 nanocrystals and their performance is compared to reveal the interrelationship between the nanocarbon structure, surface functionalization and charge transport for rational design of OER catalysts. Furthermore, a range of techniques has been utilized to characterize the stability of MWCNT substrates during water oxidation. Importantly, it is found that the MWCNTs in the composite can sustain the harsh oxidative environment of water oxidation, with no carbon corrosion detected.									148	8	0	0	11	0	151			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000324553400006

However, oxide overlayers formed on their surface by spontaneously atmospheric oxidation are usually neglected, thus confusing the establishment of structure-performance relationship. Herein, we successfully etched the oxide overlayers of NiFe phosphide (NiFeP) by a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma technique, aiming to reveal the influence of the oxide overlayers on its electrocatalytic performance for OER. It is found that etching the oxide overlayers can accelerate the surface reconstruction process of NiFeP and facilitate the formation of metal hydroxides, which are key intermediate phases for OER. Consequently, the etched NiFeP-DBD material shows remarkably enhanced OER activity with an overpotential of 265 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The finding of this work probably brings a significant impact to understand the structure-performance relationship of metal phosphide in electrooxidation reaction.

Potassium sulphate (K2SO4) was used as inorganic source of sulfur (S), while triphenyl phosphine (PPh3) was used as phosphorus (P) source. A stepwise mechanistic investigation into the doping process revealed that the decomposition of PPh(3)triggered the release of both the elemental sulfur and phosphorus because of the reducing reaction environment. The transformation of cobalt-PPh(3)complex into cubic cobalt (II) oxide along with the successful co-doping (P and S) was achieved by high temperature calcination at 800 degrees C but preserved the bulk CoO crystalline structure. The as synthesized P/S-CoO demonstrated an unprecedented enhancement on the oxygen evolution activity compare to that of pristine CoO with the current density of 10 mA/cm(2)at the overpotential of 293 mV in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte and profound stability at different current densities.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2192-6506			WOS:000555737600028	32729680

Replacing the OER with the thermodynamically more favorable urea oxidation reaction (UOR) offers the prospect of energy-saving H-2 production together with urea-rich wastewater purification. In this study, 3D hierarchical Ni4N/Cu3N nanotube arrays are successfully fabricated, which exhibit excellent performance both in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, -0.098 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2)) and in the UOR (1.34 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2)). The excellent performance is benefited from the highly electrochemical active metal nitrides and unique hierarchically nanoarray structure. Remarkably, the symmetrical electrolyzer by using Ni4N/Cu3N/copper foam (CF) as both the cathode and the anode exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.48 V to reach the current of 10 mA cm(-2). It also possesses remarkable long-term stability (10 h at 100 mA cm(-2)) and near 100% Faradaic efficiency for hydrogen evolution.									46	0	0	0	1	0	46			2168-0485			WOS:000480370500069

Here, we consider the Fe-v-bisoxo complex {[Fe-v(Me(3)tacn)(OH2)(=O)(2)](+)} to be responsible for the oxygen-oxygen bond formation. This O-O bond formation happens through the addition of water as a nucleophile. The transition state was determined by the synchronous transit-guided quasi-Newton method using reactants and products and verified by intrinsic reaction coordinates (IRCs). From the IRC calculations, we observe that the Fe-v =O moiety is attacked by water and assisted by the H-bonded interaction with the oxygen atom of the bisoxo complex. The hydrogen atom is transferred to the oxygen atom of the bisoxo complex through the transition state, and subsequently, the hydroxide is transferred to another oxygen of the bisoxo complex, resulting in the formation of the oxygen-oxygen bond. This work also explains the effect of explicit water molecules on the oxygen-oxygen bond formation. Our results also show how the formation of superoxide plays an essential role in O-2 evolution. We used the potential energy scan method to compute the transition state in the oxygen evolution step. In the present work, we study the effect of chlorine on the formation of the oxygen-oxygen bond formation. In this study, the changes in the oxidation state, spin density, and spin multiplicity of the complexes are investigated for each successive step. Apart from these static theoretical calculations, we also studied the oxygen-oxygen bond formation through first-principles molecular dynamics with the aid of the well-tempered metadynamics sampling technique. From the observation of the free energy surfaces from metadynamics simulations, it is evident that the hydroxide transfer has a lesser free energetic reaction as compared to the proton transfer. This complete mechanistic study may give an idea to design a suitable water oxidation catalyst.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000611410000031	33370125

For the oxygen evolution reaction, iridium oxide containing materials are state-of-the-art due to their stability in acidic conditions. Moreover, precious metal content can be reduced by using small nanoparticles that show high catalytic activities. We performed DFT calculations on a 1.2 nm large IrO2 Wulff-like stoichiometric nanoparticle model (IrO2) with the aim of determining the factors controlling the catalytic activity of IrO2 nanoparticles. Results show that at reaction conditions tetra- and tricoordinated iridium centers are not fully oxidized, the major species being IrO(OH) and IrO(OH)(2), respectively. Although the computed overpotential show that all centers present relatively similar reactivities, low coordinated iridium centers tend to be more active than the pentacoordinates sites of the well-defined facets. These low coordination sites are likely more abundant on amorphous nanoparticles, which could be one of the factors explaining the higher catalytic activity observed for non-crystalline materials.

The electrochemical activity of the film was affected by the temperature of thermal decomposition. Cerium ions introduced into the oxide film could increase the surface area and improve the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of the electrode. Compared with thermal decomposition of nitrates, the OER activity of the film prepared with acetates was higher. When the nickel foam/Ni-Ce-Co-O film electrode prepared with acetates was used as the anode, in 30% KOH solution (88 +/- 2 degrees C) at the current density of 4000 A/m(2), the cell voltage was 250 mV lower than that of the nickel foam anode. Furthermore, the film electrode exhibited good stability. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000245500200054

The alkaline water splitting efficiency of Ni-Mo alloy coatings, for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction were tested using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry (CP) techniques. Moreover, the practical utility of these electrode materials were evaluated by measuring the amount of H-2 and O-2 gas evolved. The variation in electrocatalytic activity with composition, structure, and morphology of the coatings were examined using XRD, SEM, and EDS analyses. The experimental results showed that Ni-Mo alloy coating is the best electrode material for alkaline HER and OER reactions, at lower and higher deposition current densities (c. d.'s) respectively. This behavior is attributed by decreased Mo and increased Ni content of the alloy coating and the number of electroactive centers.					1st International Conference on Design, Materials and Manufacture (ICDEM)1st International Conference on Design, Materials and Manufacture (ICDEM)	JAN 29-31, 2018JAN 29-31, 2018	Natl Inst Technol Karnataka, Dept Mech EngnNatl Inst Technol Karnataka, Dept Mech Engn	Surathkal, INDIASurathkal, INDIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0094-243X		978-0-7354-1638-3	WOS:000432773200108

Zeradjanin, Aleksandar/0000-0002-0649-0544			Impact of the spatial distribution of morphological patterns on the efficiency of electrocatalytic gas evolving reactions								JOURNAL OF THE SERBIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				79	3			325	330		10.2298/JSC131002106Z				2014	2014	The efficiency of electrocatalytic gas evolving reactions (hydrogen, chlorine and oxygen evolution) is a key challenge for important industrial processes, such as chlor-alkali electrolysis or water electrolysis. The central issue for the aforementioned electrocatalytic processes is their huge power consumption. Experimental results accumulated in the past, as well as some predictive models ("volcano" plots) indicate that altering the nature of the electrode material cannot significantly increase the activity of the mentioned reactions. Consequently, it is necessary to find a qualitatively different strategy for improving the energy efficiency of electrocatalytic gas evolving reactions. A usually disregarded fact is that gas evolution is an oscillatory phenomenon. Given the oscillatory behavior, a key parameter of macrokinetics of gas electrode is the frequency of gas-bubble detachment. Bearing in mind that gas evolution greatly depends on the surface morphology, a methodology is proposed that establishes a rational link between the morphological pattern of an electrode with its activity and stability. Characterization was performed using advanced analytical tools. The frequency of gas-bubble detachment was obtained in the configuration of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), while the corrosion stability was analyzed using a miniaturized scanning flow electrochemical cell connected to a mass spectrometer (SFC-ICPMS).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0352-5139			WOS:000333770600006

Herein, this study reports a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) derived trifunctional electrocatalyst, composed of Co5.47N and Co7Fe3 (CoFeN) that embedded into 1D N-doped carbon nanotubes modified 3D cruciform carbon matrix (NCNTs//CCM). Benefiting from the robust interfacial conjugation of Co5.47N/Co7Fe3 and the 1D/3D hierarchical structure with a large surface area, the as-prepared CoFeN-NCNTs//CCM display trifunctional electrocatalytic activity for ORR (half-wave potential of 0.84 V), OER (320 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), and HER (-151 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). The assembled Zn-air battery exhibits high power density (145 mW cm(-2))(,) enhanced charge-discharge performance (voltage gap of 0.76 V at 10 mA cm(-2)), and long-term cycling stability (over 445 h). The resultant overall water-splitting cell achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.63 V, which can compete with the best reported trifunctional catalysts. What is more, the self-assembled Zn-air batteries are utilized to power the overall water splitting successfully, verifying great potential of the CoFeN-NCNTs//CCM as functional material for sustainable energy storage and conversion system.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000705173600001

Recent experiments show that tellurium (Te) atoms can be effectively doped into black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets, and they greatly improve its OER catalytic performance. However, the specific active sites and microscopic configurations in the atomic-scale are still ambiguous. Here, we show that the doped Te atoms prefer to bond with each other to form clusters in phosphorene and they can be further stabilized by various intrinsic defects (Stone-Wales, single vacancy defects and zigzag nanoribbon). Benefiting from the reduced binding strength of O*, Te dopants and intrinsic defects synergistically boost the catalytic activity of phosphorene. The best OER catalytic activity could be realized in the cluster SW2-Te1p (Stone-Wales defect decorated by one Te atom). For ORR, the cluster Pri-Te3p (pristine phosphorene decorated by three Te atoms) exhibits optimal catalytic activity. Calculated ORR/OER potential gaps indicate that the SW2-Te3p cluster most likely acts as the efficient bifunctional catalytic site for both ORR and OER.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000492992600024	31598612

Half metals, with an exotic quantum state of 100% spin-polarized conduction electrons, and the spin associated atomic magnetization could show great potential in catalyst applications, however the corresponding research is insufficient. In this work, a prototype study of (Co and/or Fe)-N-x (x = 1-6) embedded configurations (FeCoNx-gra) is conducted within density functional theory (DFT) via spin-polarized calculation. The results indicate that an itinerant ferromagnetic half metal can be recognized as a promising candidate for a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Specifically, the ferromagnetically coupled spin-polarized electrons in a half metal tend to attract oxygen molecules so as to stimulate ORR, while the formation of the O-O bond in OER requires spin conservation. The delocalized spin character (metallic spin of a half metal) guarantees the moderate binding strength of main reaction intermediates, i.e., *O-2, *O, *OH, and *OOH, which can be measured by the atomic spin moment in the reaction center (0.4-1.5 mu(B) for Fe in this study). This study identifies a new specific link between the electron structure and catalytic activities which has predictive power for catalyst design.									71	7	0	0	3	0	72			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000501811800045

Available synthesis methods of the composites need to be urgently exploited; especially in situ construction. Here, a NiS/NiFe2O4 composite through a local metal-S coordination at the interface is reported, which is derived from phase reconstruction in the highly defective matrix. X-ray absorption fine structure confirms that long-range order is broken via the local metal-S coordination and, by using electron energy loss spectroscopy, the introduction of NiS/NiFe2O4 interfaces during the irradiation of plasma energy is identified. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that in situ phase reconfiguration is crucial for synergistically reducing energetic barriers and accelerating reaction kinetics toward catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a result; it leads to an overpotential of 230 mV @10 mA cm(-2) for the OER and a half-wave potential of 0.81 V for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR); as well as an excellent zinc-air battery (ZAB) performance with a power density of 148.5 mW cm(-2). This work provides a new compositing strategy in terms of fast phase reconstruction of bifunctional catalysts.									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000765254600001	35170104

Heteroatom doping is an effective way to improve the catalytic performance of OER by modulating the local electronic environment and stimulating the synergy. However, the complicated manufacturing methods have hindered their practical application. Herein, we demonstrate a method based on FeOOH/CC precursor to realize the preparation of Ni-P-S@FeOOH/CC catalyst through fast electrodeposition method. The overpotential of Ni-P-S@FeOOH/CC catalyst is 210 mV (10 mA cm(-2)), and still has an initial voltage of 97.35 % for 48 h. The surface area analysis shows a higher electrochemically active surface area for the amorphous structure prepared by electrodeposition method. XPS and DFT results show that the co doping of P and S can stimulate the synergistic effect and the minimum energy of adsorption/desorption in OER process is only 0.83 eV. The strategy shows good prospects for preparing efficient OER pre catalysts. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0009-2509	1873-4405		WOS:000811745000007

However, it is a challenge to simulate the effects of potential theoretically. Normally, DFT calculations are performed at a constant number of electrons, not a constant voltage. In this work, we apply a new fixed-potential method (grand canonical method) in the DFT simulation to mimic the electrochemical processes, in which the total number of the electron in the system was floated to match the "applied voltage,', or the electrode Fermi energy at the atomic level. Here, the single-atom catalysts on two-dimension substrates for the oxygen evolution reaction process are used as examples to test the fixed-potential method. This fixed-potential method changes the rate-determining step and yields an overpotential difference of as much as 0.48 V in comparison with the conventional charge-neutral method. The quantitative error in the overpotential is not as important as the qualitative error in rate-determining steps. These errors can be avoided via the fixed-charge method with the proper charge. We believe our work advances the understanding of the effects of potential on the catalytic process in real electrochemical reactions and offers practical guidance for designing catalysts.

Here we report for the first time that the synergy mechanism between surface oxygen defects and graphene nanodots over the TiO2 photocatalyst boosts the solar-to-chemical energy conversion and hence enables the ultra-efficient photocatalytic decomposition of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). As a proof of concept, the surface oxygen defect incorporation not only can effectively suppress surface charge recombination, but also can promote the chemisorption of oxygen and hence enables robust H2O2 evolution over the TiO2 photocatalyst through visible-near-infrared illumination. The graphene nanodots (GDs), which were originally synthesized via an electrochemical tailoring method and possess excellent peroxidase activity can substitute Fe3+ to trigger robust solid-gas interfacial Fenton-like reaction (the rigorous reaction environment of the classic Fenton reaction greatly limits its implementation under ordinary air conditions). In addition, the excellent photophysical properties of GDs also can act as a sensitizer to further optimize the light harvesting performance of the resultant hybrid from the UV to NIR region. As a surprising achievement, the robust interfacial Fenton-like reaction, broader optical window and efficient charge separation endow the hybrid catalyst with ultra-efficient energy coupling between photons, excitons and oxygen-related radicals, and hence enable excellent photocatalytic oxidation activity for the decomposition of various VOCs.									10	1	0	0	1	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000397605300021

To accelerate the reaction processes, there is a constant need for efficient new catalysts. In the present work, we have developed a facile pyrolysis-based process for the co-synthesis of palladium- cobalt nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes (Pd-CoCNTs), which exhibit superior catalytic activity for the HER and enhanced ORR performance. Non-agglomerated Pd nanoparticles of diameters 2-4 nm are uniformly distributed on the surface of CoCNTs, while the inner Co particles are an essential element in forming the framework of the CoCNTs. Compared to the Pd-free N-rich CoCNTs, Pd-CoCNTs have a more defective surface with a larger electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), and show enhanced ORR activity, outstanding methanol tolerance, and long- term stability in alkaline solution. At a low Pd loading of 0.0292 mgcm(-2), the Pd- CoCNTs require overpotentials of 0.024 V and 0.215 V to catalyze the HER and to drive a current density of 50 mAcm(-2) in acidic solution, respectively. The palladium nanoparticles on the surface of the CoCNTs are considered to be highly active sites for HER, based on the results of control experiments, and it is easy to adjust the catalytic activity of the Pd-CoCNTs by changing the concentration of Pd therein. The proposed method provides a means of fabricating efficient bifunctional catalysts with controllable low contents of precious metals.									28	1	0	0	1	0	28			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000402799200015	28258967

Because the corrosion of electrochemical devices is effectively reduced in neutral environments, the associated cost is consequently lowered. In this context, two-dimensional transition metal compounds have enjoyed extensive applications in the field of renewable energy because of their abundant storage capacity, easily regulated electronic structure, and unique physical and chemical features. As such, this review summarizes recent advances in the use of two-dimensional transition metal compounds as hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, and bifunctional catalysts for neutral water splitting.

To date, TMD-based HER catalytic performance has been enhanced mostly by chemical modification, such as introducing defects, doping, and phase control. Herein, we enhanced the HER performance by precise control of wettability via hierarchical wrinkling. This hierarchical wrinkling confers tunability of the receding contact angle (2-30 degrees) by controlling the wavelength of the hierarchical wrinkles. Minimization of the receding contact angle is directly related to overpotential reduction on the MoS2 wrinkles through gas detachment from the catalytic surface. Unlike in previous studies, in this work, we demonstrated the effect of wettability only without changing other parameters such as surface chemistry. We showed that our method can be applied to other TMD materials such as WS2. This study will contribute to future TMD-based catalyst applications, such as hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction, and oxygen evolution.									26	1	0	0	1	0	26			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000459642200093	30694642

Herein, an alternative approach to the synthesis and coating of alloys and MMOs by femtosecond laser direct writing (FsLDW) is reported. A solution-based precursor ink is deposited and dried on the substrate and illuminated by a femtosecond laser. During the illumination, dried precursor ink is transformed to MMO/alloys and is simultaneously bonded to the substrate. The formulation of the alloy and MMO precursor ink for laser processing is universally applicable to a large family of oxides and alloys. The process is conducted at room temperature and in an open atmosphere. To demonstrate, a large family of 57 MMOs and alloys are synthesized from a group of 13 elements. As a proof of concept, Ni0.24Co0.23Cu0.24Fe0.15Cr0.14 high entropy alloy synthesized on stainless-steel foil by FsLDW is used for the oxygen evolution reaction, which achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a significantly low overpotential of 213 mV. Further, FsLDW can also achieve microfabrication of alloys/MMO with feature sizes down to 20 mu m.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000844806100001	36026538

Here, various Ni, Ni-Fe, Ni-Mn nanosheets and Ni-Fe-Mn ternary nanosheets were created using cost-effective, versatile and binder-free electrochemical deposition methods, and the electrocatalytic activity of various electrodes for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were investigated in an alkaline environment. Due to the high electrochemical active surface area due to the fabrication of nanosheets, the synergistic effect between different elements on the electronic structure, the high wettability due to the formation of nanosheets and the quick detachment of formed gasses from the electrode, the Ni-Fe-Mn nanosheets electrode showed excellent electrocatalytic activity. In order to deliver the 10 mA cm(-2) current density in HER and OER processes, this electrode required values of 64 mV and 230 mV overpotential, respectively. Also, the stability test showed that after 10 h of electrolysis at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), the overpotential changes was very small (less than 4%), indicating that the electrode was excellent electrostatic stability. Also, when using as a bi-functional electrode in the full water splitting system, it only needed a cell voltage of 1528 V to deliver a current of 10 mA cm(-2). The results of this study indicate a new strategy for the synthesis of active and stable electrocatalysts. (c) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The high redox potential of the O-2/water couple makes it an extremely powerful electron sink that enables energy to be transduced in respiration. In addition to the tetravalent interconversion of O-2 and water, there exist a plethora of reactions that involve the partial reduction of O-2 or photodynamic energy transfer to produce active oxygen species (AOS). All these redox reactions have become integrated during evolution into the aerobic photosynthetic cell. This review considers photosynthesis as a whole-cell process, in which O-2 and AOS are involved in reactions at both photosystems, enzyme regulation in the chloroplast stroma, photorespiration, and mitochondrial electron transport in the light. In addition, oxidants and antioxidants are discussed as metabolic indicators of redox status, acting as sensors and signal molecules leading to acclimatory responses. Our aim throughout is to assess the insights gained from the application of mutagenesis and transformation techniques to studies of the role of O-2 and related redox components in the integrated regulation of photosynthesis.									710	106	5	0	654	14	843			0028-646X	1469-8137		WOS:000088299900004

To understand the influence of reactive oxygen species' concentration and ambient temperature on the evolution behavior of the chemical bond during plasma cleaning, microscopic reaction models between organic contaminants and reactive oxygen species were established and performed by reactive molecular dynamics. Dibutyl phthalate, as a representative organic contaminant, was selected as the research object. The simulation results suggested that hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl radicals reduced the mobility of reactive species, resulting in the cleaning ability of hydroxyl radicals being much lower than atomic oxygen and ozone radicals. The concentration of reactive species dominated the efficiency of plasma cleaning, and the increase in ambient temperature further improved the cleaning ability. C-H, C-C and C-O bonds were gradually oxidized to C=C, C-O, C=O and O-H bonds by hydrogen abstraction reaction during the reaction of reactive species with organic contaminants. An increase in ambient temperature induced the possibility of benzene ring destruction under the action of reactive species, which was considered a method of complete dissociation of aromatic hydrocarbons.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000874024100001

The chemical structure of the resulting water-soluble copolymer, P(DMAM-co-AQ), is verified using techniques such as proton nuclear magnetic resonance, attenuated total reflection-infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and UV-vis spectroscopy. The evolution of the oxygen scavenging abilities of aqueous P(DMAM-co-AQ) solutions after UV irradiation is monitored as a function of UV irradiation time, concentration of AQ moieties, and pH. The copolymer is proved an effective UV-triggered oxygen scavenger, leading to dissolved oxygen contents below 1 ppm for the optimized experimental conditions. This behavior is related with the appearance of novel chemical species with interesting optical properties, as suggested by the respective evolution of the UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra after UV irradiation.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1438-7492	1439-2054		WOS:000425103200015

The deposition conditions, for peak performance of the electrodeposits for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH medium have been optimized. Electrocatalytic activity of the coatings, deposited at different current densities (c.d.'s) for water splitting reactions of HER and OER was tested by cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry. It was found that Ni-W alloys deposited, at 4.0 A/dm(2) (having about 12.49 wt.% W) and 1.0 A/dm(2) (having about 0.95 wt.% W) are good electrode materials as cathode (for HER) and anode (for OER), respectively. A dependency of the electrocatalytic activity for HER and OER with relative amount of Ni and W, in the deposit was found. The variation of electrocatalytic activity with W content showed the existence of a synergism between high-catalytic property of W (due to low hydrogen overvoltage) and Ni (having increased adsorption of OH- ions), for hydrogen (as cathode) and oxygen (as anode) evolution, respectively. Electrocatalytic activities of the coatings, developed at different c.d.'s were explained in the light of their phase structure, surface morphology, and chemical composition, confirmed by XRD, FESEM, and EDX analysis. The effect of c.d. on thickness, hardness, composition, HER, and OER was analyzed, and results were discussed with possible mechanisms.									34	3	0	0	0	0	36			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000366106600002

Our focus is on atomic scale simulations at the density functional theory level. First, we investigate the models and the approximations that have been assumed, and thence we reach the conclusion that trends in electrocatalysis are well captured by only considering binding energies of reaction intermediates to the catalyst surface. We show, assuming a simple and very likely series of intermediates, the existence of a universal scaling relation common to all ORR catalysts, which determines the overpotential.					10th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells Symposium (PEFC) Conducted Under the Auspices of the 218th Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society (ECS)10th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells Symposium (PEFC) Conducted Under the Auspices of the 218th Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society (ECS)	OCT, 2010OCT, 2010	Electrochem Soc (ECS); Energy Technol (ETD); Phys & Analyt Electrochem (PAED); Battery (BATT); Ind Electrochem & Electrochem Engn; Asahi Kasei E-Mat Corp; Ion Power Inc; UTC Power Corp; Umicore; Tokuyama Corp; Toyota Motor Eng & Mfg N Amer; Pine Res Instruments; Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K KElectrochem Soc (ECS); Energy Technol (ETD); Phys & Analyt Electrochem (PAED); Battery (BATT); Ind Electrochem & Electrochem Engn; Asahi Kasei E-Mat Corp; Ion Power Inc; UTC Power Corp; Umicore; Tokuyama Corp; Toyota Motor Eng & Mfg N Amer; Pine Res Instruments; Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K K	Las Vegas, NVLas Vegas, NV	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1938-5862		978-1-56677-820-6	WOS:000313331100005

Herein, we describe our recent finding that a Fedoped Ni3S2 particle film with 11.8% Fe-content hydrothermally grown on nickel foam (Fe-11.8%-Ni3S2/NF) behaves as a highly active robust oxygen evolution electrode in strongly alkaline media. This electrode needs an overpotential of only 253 mV to achieve 100 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 65.5 mV dec(-1) and maintains its catalytic activity for at least 14 h in 1 M KOH, and the NiOOH and FeOOH formed at the Fe-11.8%-Ni3S2 surface are the actual catalytic sites. Notably, it also operates efficiently and stably in 30 wt% KOH, capable of affording very high current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2) at small overpotentials of 238 and 269 mV, respectively, with a faradaic efficiency of 100%.									260	14	0	0	6	0	262			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000365216000016

Here, we use chlorine evolution reaction (CER), instead of OER, to integrate with CO2 electroreduction mediated by an efficient metal-nitrogen doped carbon catalyst derived from the mixture of nickel porphyrin and commercial carbon black. The combined system was evaluated in two electrolyzer configurations that have been adopted in the chlor-alkali process to produces CO, Cl-2, and KHCO3 simultaneously. To allow continuous operation, we designed a continuously operating system to collect produced KHCO3 in a precipitate tank with improved techno-economics and efficient CO2 utilization. Also, it could serve as an environmental-friendly alternative to the Solvay process for soda production. This work may provide a new strategy for the design of CO2 electrolysis systems with better economic viability.									28	3	0	0	1	0	29			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000539373300022

Herein, we report that Bi2WO6 concave nanoplates (CNPs) with oxygen vacancies enable the electrocatalytic OER under neutral conditions with high activity and good durability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example on W-based electrocatalysts containing no first-row transition metal or precious metal elements for the OER in near-neutral water. Experimental results and first-principles calculations revealed that the presence of oxygen vacancies in Bi2WO6 CNPs could significantly decrease the charge-transfer resistance and adsorption barrier of H2O molecules in the process of electrochemistry, thus benefiting the improvement of OER activity. The fabrication of concave surfaces with high energy facets could further enhance the OER activity of the Bi2WO6 NP electrocatalysts. As a result, the synergistic effect of oxygen vacancies and concave surfaces led to impressive performance of Bi2WO6 CNPs for the OER, which is comparable to the best electrocatalysts among known inorganic non-precious metal compounds. The present strategy on the combination of defect and crystal facet engineering could open a new avenue to design new and highly efficient OER electrocatalysts.									81	3	0	0	4	0	82			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000369665800008

However, the activation mechanism of Ba-containing perovskite materials is still ambiguous, because of the complex four-electron transfer process on the gas-solid interfaces. Here, we directly observe that BaO and BaO2 segregated on Ba-containing material surface participate in the oxygen activation process via the formation and decomposition of BaO2. Tens of times of increase in catalytic activities was achieved by introducing barium oxides in the traditional perovskite and inert Au electrodes, indicating that barium oxides are critical for oxygen activation. We find that BaO and BaO2 are more active than the B-site of perovskite for ORR and OER, respectively, and closely related to the high activity of Ba-containing perovskite.									6	0	0	0	0	0	5			2375-2548			WOS:000786201300037	35417241

The electrocatalytic activity of the new anode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) initially decreased and then gradually increased, which was attributed to the phase transition occurring at the surface of the anode, and its corrosion resistance was gradually improved with the progress of electrowinning. Further, the electrochemical characteristics, cell voltage, current efficiency, and energy consumption of the two anodes were evaluated after 16 days of electrowinning. The OER electrocatalytic activity and corrosion resistance of the new anode were observed to be higher than those of the traditional anode. In addition, the cell voltage and power consumption of the new anode were significantly lower than those of the traditional anode. Furthermore, compared to the traditional anode, the energy consumption for producing 1 t of zinc was reduced by 358.13 kWh based on the new anode.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			0304-386X	1879-1158		WOS:000537628300022

The one-step fabrication method involves annealing the mixture of cobalt salt, thioacetamide, and graphene oxide with the assistance of small amount of glycol without any further purification steps. The Co1-xS/G shows a morphology with small-sized Co1-xS nanocrystals strongly and uniformly anchored on the graphene surface. Systematically electrochemical studies demonstrate that the Co1-xS/G with optimized components shows superior catalytic activities toward oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution, which are comparable or even superior to commercial Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts. As a result, the potential hysteresis of Co1-xS/G is the lowest among all the samples. The facile operability of the fabrication method and the high bifunctional activity of Co1-xS/G may pave one practical way for broad applications including fuel cell, metal-O-2 battery, and water electrolysis.									16	2	0	0	1	0	16			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000382859400016

It can detect basically all molecules involved in trigger reactions and the structural information obtained is complementary to that by X-ray crystallography. Light-induced FTIR difference spectra of the photosynthetic oxygen-evolving center (OEC), which consists of the Mn4Ca cluster embedded in photosystem II protein complexes, were obtained as spectral changes upon the first S-1-to-S-2 transition or during the S-state cycle. Band assignments were performed by isotopic substitution, quantum chemical calculations, and site-directed mutagenesis, while the structures and reactions of OEC were analysed by applying certain perturbations on the OEC and detecting concomitant spectral changes. This review summarizes the FTIR studies on OEC thus far performed for understanding the molecular mechanism of photosynthetic oxygen evolution. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, by combining theoretical predictions and experiments, we reported a general strategy to engineer the electronic properties of iron-nitrogen-carbon (FeN4/C) catalysts via the incorporation of the boron (B) atom for achieving improved catalytic activity in oxygen electrocatalysis. Our theoretical results revealed that B modulation effectively tunes the d-band center of the iron (Fe) active site to optimize its adsorption strength with oxygenated species, greatly enhancing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) activity. Our experimental measurements then confirmed the above theoretical predictions: the as-synthesized B-doped FeN4/C (Fe-N4-B) material can perform as an eligible bifunctional catalyst for ORR and OER in alkaline media, and its catalytic activity even outperforms the commercial noble metal benchmarks. The present findings provide a promising strategy to further design the advanced catalysts for a wide range of electrochemical applications.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, as-prepared LaCo(1-x)Fe(x)O(3)perovskite nanoparticles (x=0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) were found to contain a high degree of combustion residuals, and mostly consist of both, stoichiometric and oxygen-deficient perovskite phases. Heating them at moderate temperature (250 degrees C) in oxygen could remove combustion residuals and increases the content of stoichiometric perovskite while preventing particle growth. A higher surface crystallinity was observed with increasing iron content coming along with a rise in oxygen deficient phases. With heat treatment, OER activity and stability of perovskites improved at 30 and 40 at.% Fe while deteriorating at 20 at.% Fe. This study highlights spray-flame synthesis as a promising technique to synthesize highly active nanoscale perovskite catalysts with improved OER activity.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2196-0216			WOS:000544040500006

The present work is an investigation on the electrocatalytic activity towards both Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) and Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) of ZnMn2O4 (ZMO) nanofabrics synthesized by sol?gel electrospinning followed by calcination (at 500, 600 and 700 & xfffd;C). Poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) was used as the polymeric binder for the production of nanofabrics. The morphological features of ZMO nanofabrics were studied by scanning electron microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The electrocatalytic behavior of ZMO nanofabrics obtained at different calcination temperatures was evaluated using chrono-potentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, and linear sweep voltammetry in an alkaline medium (1 M KOH). The ZMO nanofabrics calcined at 500 & xfffd;C exhibited the maximum electrocatalytic activity towards HER. This can be ascribed to their superior specific surface area (79.5 m(2) g(?1)). The nanofabrics calcined at 700 & xfffd;C displayed the least potential for O-2 evolution and hence they are considered to be effective for OER. The results prove that ZMO nanofabrics are promising candidates as bifunctional electrocatalysts for water-splitting applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2053-1591			WOS:000499824400001

Here, we show that the more acidic precursors, such as commercially available 5-aminotetrazole, upon pyrolysis in LiCl/KCl salt melt yield PHI with the greatly improved structural order and thermodynamic stability. Tetra-zole-derived PHIs feature long-range crystallinities and unconventionally small layer stacking distances, leading to the altered electronic band structures as shown by Mott-Schottky analyses. Under the optimized synthesis conditions, visible-light driven hydrogen evolution rates reach twice the rate provided by the previous gold standard, mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride, which has a much higher surface area. More interestingly, the up to 0.7 V higher valence band potential of crystalline PHI compared with ordinary carbon nitrides makes it an efficient water oxidation photocatalyst, which works even in the absence of any metal-based co-catalysts under visible light. To our knowledge, this is the first case of metal-free oxygen liberation from water.									101	3	0	0	5	0	102			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000395797000026

A new measurement of this reaction has been performed at the University of Notre Dame using particle-gamma coincidence techniques with SAND (a silicon detector array) at the high-intensity 5U Pelletron accelerator. New results for C-12 + C-12 fusion at low energies relevant to nuclear astrophysics are reported. They show strong disagreement with a recent measurement using the indirect Trojan Horse method.

In this work, Co nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) tangled with nitrogen-doped carbon (Co@CNT-NC) has been obtained via a facile in-situ growth-pyrolysis route with the hybrid of zeolitic-imidazole-framework-67 nanoparticles and a triazine-containing poly(Schiff-base). Benefiting from its high surface area (1458 m(2) g(-1)), effective N dopant, interwoven with CNTs and the synergistic effects of Co nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped carbon matrix, the optimized Co@CNT-NC exhibits a superior bifunctional activity with a small potential difference (0.76 V) between OER and ORR. The assembled Co@CNT-NC-based zinc-air battery displays a high power density of 179.3 mW cm(-2), a high energy density up to 949 mAh g(Zn)(-1) and outstanding long-term durability.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000782393900001

In addition, among all porous samples with different metal stoichiometric ratios, Ni2/3Fe1/3Al shows the highest OER activity with an overpotential of 299 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 58.9 mV dec(-1), which can be attributed to the high intrinsic activity and large electrochemical surface area from the leaching of Al.

A mesophase-derived activated carbon was further heat treated to 600 or 1000 degrees C in nitrogen. The changes in texture and surface chemistry induced by the thermal treatment were deeply studied. The electrochemical behaviour of the samples was studied in two- and three-electrode cells. The contribution of pseudocapacitance was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and by the differences of specific capacitance obtained from galvanostatic tests performed in acidic (H2SO4) and basic (KOH) media. The presence of an extra capacitance due to redox reactions has been proved both in acidic and basic media for the samples with high oxygen content, although its contribution in basic media is significantly lower. The results obtained clearly indicate that the oxygen responsible for CO-evolution participates in redox reactions, whereas the oxygen responsible for the CO2-evolution is of minor importance.(c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Since Ni-Fe oxides reduce overpotentials occurring in the OER dramatically they are regarded as anode materials of choice for the electrocatalytically driven water-splitting reaction. We herewith show that a straightforward surface modification carried out with AISI 304, a general purpose austenitic stainless steel, very likely, based upon a dissolution mechanism, to result in the formation of an ultra-thin layer consisting of Ni, Fe oxide with a purity 499%. The Ni enriched thin layer firmly attached to the steel substrate is responsible for the unusual highly efficient anodic conversion of water into oxygen as demonstrated by the low overpotential of 212 mV at 12 mA cm(-2) current density in 1 M KOH, 269.2 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density in 0.1 M KOH respectively. The Ni, Fe-oxide layer formed on the steel creates a stable outer sphere, and the surface oxidized steel samples proved to be inert against longer operating times (4150 ks) in alkaline medium. In addition Faradaic efficiency measurements performed through chronopotentiometry revealed a charge to oxygen conversion close to 100%, thus underpinning the conclusion that no "inner oxidation'' based on further oxidation of the metal matrix below the oxide layer occurs. These key figures achieved with an almost unrivalled-inexpensive and unrivalled-accessible material, are among the best ever presented activity characteristics for the anodic water-splitting reaction at pH 13.									146	1	0	0	5	0	146			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000360456600014

Therefore, it is highly desirable to design efficient and dual electrocatalysts for replacing the traditional noble-metal-based catalysts. Herein, we have developed a high-efficiency and low-cost MnCo2O4-rGO nanocomposite derived from bimetal-organic frameworks. For OER, MnCo2O4-rGO showed an onset potential of 1.56 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and a current density of 14.16 mA/cm(2) at 1.83 V, being better than both pure MnCo2O4 and Pt/C. For ORR, MnCo2O4-rGO exhibited a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.77 V (vs RHE), a current density of 3.33 mA/cm(2) at 0.36 V, a high electron transfer number n (3.80), and long-term stability, being close to the performance of Pt/C. The high activity of MnCo2O4-rGO was attributed to the synergistic effect among rGO, manganese, and cobalt oxide. As a result, the resultant MnCo2O4-rGO has a great potential to be applied as a high-efficiency ORR and OER electrocatalyst.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2470-1343			WOS:000505078800007	31909315

Specifically, P-NiMoP nanorods (NRs) comprising tri-phases of MoP2, Ni3P and MoO2 have been synthesized by plasma-assisted phosphorization of NiMoO4 NRs. The specific features of the plasma technique provide P-NiMoP NRs with rich crystalline interfaces and oxygen vacancies in MoO2. P-NiMoP NRs are demonstrated to be a stable and efficient catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). They only need overpotentials of 3 and 162 mV to drive current densities of 10 and 150 mA cm(-2), both of which are lower than those of Pt/C. The DFT calculations indicate that the tri-phase structure with rich crystalline interfaces and oxygen vacancies plays an important role in the high catalytic activity of P-NiMoP NRs. It promotes a strong electronic coupling between MoP2, Ni3P and MoO2, which facilitates H2O adsorption and dissociation and reduces the |Delta G(H*)| value.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000721018800001

The morphologies and phase compositions of the anodic layers formed after galvanostatic polarization were investigated by using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD), respectively.

Herein, an efficient OER electrocatalyst was designed by doping trace Fe into Ni2P via a simple structural transformation. The crystal structure and surface chemical state analysis demonstrated the introduction of Fe dopant and the successful formation of the host Ni2P. As-prepared Fe-Ni2P microspheres greatly optimized the intrinsic activity of the active site and accelerated the mass transfer rate. Intriguingly, the electrochemical tests certified that trace Fe doping can increase the activity of nickel phosphide more significantly. High valence state transition from Ni-P bond to Ni-O bond was clearly observed, suggesting the new active species can be easily formed during OER. This article provides a trace Fe doping strategy for the study of efficient electrocatalysts to improve the kinetics of OER. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, the application of SABs is currently restricted by their limited cycling life and low energy efficiencies due to insoluble and nonconductive discharge products (NaO2 and Na2O2) generated on air electrodes. By contrast, hybrid SABs (HSABs) have resolved these daunting challenges by adopting an aqueous electrolyte cathode via a unique solid ceramic-ion-conductor-layer design separating the aprotic and aqueous electrolytes, resulting in extended cycle life. Thus, HSABs have aroused immense attention as promising next-generation energy storage systems. However, HSABs still face the key challenge of unsatisfactory cycling life that hinders their practical applications. In this review, HSAB principles are introduced, and the synthesis and rational designs of electrocatalysts based on the oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction from other metal-air batteries are comprehensively reviewed for the purpose of providing insight into the development of efficient air electrodes for HSABs. Furthermore, research directions of anodes, electrolytes, and air electrodes toward high-performance HSABs are proposed.									37	3	0	0	2	0	38			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000484119200002

Traditional electrochemical processes for converting HCl to chlorine (Cl-2) are completed by anodic oxidation reaction coupled with cathodic reduction reactions (two major types: hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction). Herein, a triiodide (I-3(-))/ iodide (I-) redox-mediated cathode is implemented for the first time for converting HCl to Cl-2. The iodide (I-) can be converted back to triiodide (I-3(-)) by air in a reactor external to the eletrolyzer. The desirable redox potential and facile kinetics of I-3(-)/I- offer a substantially lower operational cell voltage, reducing energy consumption by 20%-25% at a typical current density of 4 kA m(-2) and improving the efficiency of Cl-2 recovery.

However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of various electrocatalysts already reported in previous studies are not standardized. This work reports on the use of perovskite materials (LaFeO3, LaCoO3, LaNiO3, PrCoO3, Pr0.8Sr0.2CoO3, and Pr0.8Ba0.2CoO3) as OER electrocatalysts for alkaline water electrolysis. A facile co-precipitation technique with subsequent thermal annealing (at 700 degrees C in air) was performed. Industrial requirements and criteria (cost and ease of scaling up) were well-considered for the selection of the materials. The highest OER activity was observed in LaNiO3 among the La-based perovskites, and in Pr0.8Sr0.2CoO3 among the Pr-based perovskites. Moreover, the formation of double perovskites (Pr0.8Sr0.2CoO3 and Pr0.8Ba0.2CoO3) improved the OER activity of PrCoO3. This work highlights that the simple characterization and electrochemical tests performed are considered the initial step in evaluating candidate catalyst materials to be used for industrial alkaline water electrolysis.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5				2073-4344		WOS:000602216600001

Through a series of time-dependent experiments, the formation mechanism of the yolk-shell structured ZnFe2O4 microspheres is attributed to the Ostwald ripening process. It is worth noting that the yolk-shell structured ZnFe2O4 microspheres show a high surface area of 69.94 m(2) g(-1) with a total pore volume of 5.54 cm(3) g(-1). The as-prepared yolk-shell structured ZnFe2O4 microspheres exhibit an overpotential of 280 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope is 70 mV dec(-1) which results in excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution capability. Compared with ZnFe2O4 particles (without yolk-shell structure), the superior oxygen evolution reaction property can be attributed to one of the most important factors: namely the mesopore/macropore structure with a high surface area and the unique yolk-shell morphology assembled by nanoparticles, which can provide more active sites and enhance the contact of the reactant and active sites to help the transfer of electrons, thereby improving the catalytic activity.									44	2	0	0	0	1	45			2052-1553			WOS:000461666900020

Based on advantage of two-dimensional (2D) structure, in this work, cobalt prussian blue nanosheets (Co-PB-NSs) are designed and synthesized. Theoretically, single-atom layered Co-PB-NSs can provide 100% exposed transition metal catalytic centers toward OER. As a result, the ultrathin 2D structure brings more transition metal active sites to Co-PB-NSs. Meantime, 2D structure is also an effective way to regulate the electronic structure of Co-PB, which is benefit improving conductivity. More interestingly, sun-light can effectively improve the OER electrocatalytic activity of Co-PB-NSs, the current density under radiation is about twice as high as that in dark at 1.7 V vs. RHE. These findings open up opportunities to develop more types of metal organic coordination materials, explore the new class of efficient electrocatalysts toward OER. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Whereas recent studies of size-dependent activity in nanoparticles and thickness-dependent activity of thin films imply that the sub-surface layers of a catalyst can contribute to the catalytic activity as well, most of these studies consider actual modification of the surfaces. In this study, the role of catalytically active sub-surface layers was investigated by employing atomic-scale thickness control of the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) films and heterostructures, without altering the catalyst/electrolyte interface. The activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) shows a non-monotonic thickness dependence in the LSMO films and a continuous screening effect in LSMO/SrRuO3 heterostructures. The observation leads to the definition of an "electrochemically-relevant depth" on the order of 10 unit cells. This study on the electrocatalytic activity of epitaxial heterostructures provides new insight in designing efficient electrocatalytic nanomaterials and core-shell architectures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000709889700001	34677915

This work reports the structure change investigations of phosphide-based catalysts in both HER and OER. Specifically, nickel foam supported Co2P-Ni2P (Co2P-Ni2P/NF) is synthesized by in-situ growth of Co2P-Ni2P on the current collector, i.e. nickel foam, and then used for the investigation of the structure changes during HER and OER. This method avoids the use of polymer binders, allowing for the systematic analysis of the structure changes of the catalysts after HER and OER. The obtained Co2P-Ni2P/NIF shows an excellent catalytic bifunctionality for HER and OER in alkaline solutions. It only needs an overpotential of 90 mV vs RHE to offer a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and needs an overpotential of 230 mV vs RHE to offer a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for OER. Both HER and OER activities of Co2P-Ni2P/NF are higher than those of most bifunctional catalysts reported. Post-analysis shows the occurrence of the surface roughening and the formation of M-P-O (M=Co and Ni) at the surface in its initial period of the HER, and the surface roughening and the formation of a thin layer of amorphous MOOH (Mo and Ni) at the surface in its initial period of OER. The surface roughening and formation of M-P-O and amorphous hydroxide layer can be attributed to the main reason responsible for its high performance for HER and OER. Additionally, the Co2P-Ni2P/NF is also usable as both the cathode and anode for an electrolyzer for overall water splitting and shows high performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The content and ratio of Fe/Co/Ni in N-C can be adjusted by adding different quantities of metal ions in microemulsion. Compared to Fe/N-C, FeCoNi/N-C demonstrates high conductivity, fast mass transport, superior catalytic properties of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The results showed multi-doping can facilitate the combination of metal and nitrogen and sustain their contents in pyrolysis process to improve conductivity and enhance bifunctional activities. According to the density functional theory calculations, co-doping of Co or/and Ni with Fe element on N-C material can help the desorption of *OH into water in ORR and accelerate the transformation of *O to *OOH in OER. Besides, FeCoNiN4 is a dominant contributor to bifunctional activities. (C) 2022 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

In this study, porous Pt was structurally evaluated and found to have a porous structure composed of connected Pt particles. The resulting specific electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of porous Pt was 12.4 m(2) g(-1), which was higher than that of commercially available Pt black. Accordingly, porous Pt showed higher oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity than Pt black. When the activity was compared to that of a common carbon-supported electrocatalyst, Pt/ketjen black (KB), porous Pt showed a comparable ORR current density (2.5 mA cm(-2) at 0.9 V for Pt/KB and 2.1 mA cm(-2) at 0.9 V for porous Pt), and OER current density (6.8 mA cm(-2) at 1.8 V for Pt/KB and 7.0 mA cm(-1) at 1.8 V), even though the ECSA of porous Pt was only one-sixth that of Pt/KB. Moreover, it exhibited a higher durability against 1.8 V. In addition, when catalyst layers were spray-printed on the Nafion((R)) membrane, porous Pt displayed more uniform layers in comparison to Pt black, showing an advantage in its usage as a thin layer.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				1420-3049		WOS:000539293400131	32455721

Herein, we present a facile one-pot solvothermal method to successfully synthesize diverse bimetallic organic framework {[MFe(tda)(H2O)]n (M = Mn/Co/Ni), tda = thiodiacetate}. Significantly, the morphology of [MFe(tda)(H2O)]n can be efficiently changed by regulating metal components. Among them, [NiFe(tda)(H2O)]n with unique pompon-like architecture not only can be directly used as electrocatalyst, but also delivers extraordinary OER performance with low overpotential of 264 mV at current density of 10 mA cm-2 in O2-saturated 1 M KOH solution, low Tafel slope of 53.9 mV dec- 1, and high durability after long-term testing. In addition, the effect of mixed ligands and metal ratio on morphology has also been investigated, which demonstrates the hierarchical structure of prepared materials plays a crucial role in enhancing OER activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000763367500003

We use the pulse electrodeposition method as a versatile and cost-effective approach to synthesize three-dimensional Ni-Fe-P electrocatalysts on nickel nanostructures under various applied frequencies and duration times, in which nanostructures exhibit excellent intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. Benefiting from the three-dimensional structure, as well as the simultaneous presence of the three elements nickel, iron, and phosphorus, the electrode fabricated at the optimal conditions has indicated outstanding electrocatalytic activity with a eta(10) of 66 and 198 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, in a 1.0 M KOH solution. Also, the water electrolysis cell constructed with this electrode and tested as a bifunctional electrode exhibited 1.508 V for 10 mA cm(-2) in overall water splitting. In addition, the lowest amount of potential change in 100 mA cm(-2 )was observed for HER and OER, indicating excellent electrocatalytic stability.

To help circumvent this problem we have synthesized a class of novel Ir oxohydroxides by rapid microwave-asisted hydrothermal synthesis, which bridges the gap between electrodeposited amorphous IrOx films and crystalline IrO2 electrocatalysts prepared by calcination routes. For electrode loadings two orders of magnitude below current standards, the synthesized compounds present an unrivalled combination of high activity and stability under commercially relevant OER conditions in comparison to reported benchmarks, without need for pretreatment. The best compound achieved a lifetime 33times longer than the best commercial Ir benchmark. Thus, the reported efficient synthesis of an Ir oxohydroxide phase with superior intrinsic OER performance constitutes a major step towards the targeted design of cost-efficient Ir based OER electrocatalysts for acidic media.									29	1	0	0	2	0	29			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000401165900012	28164470

Here we demonstrate that the OER activity on spinel oxides is intrinsically dominated by the covalency competition between tetrahedral and octahedral sites. The competition fabricates an asymmetric M-T-O-M(O)backbone where the bond with weaker metal-oxygen covalency determines the exposure of cation sites and therefore the activity. Driven by this finding, a dataset with more than 300 spinel oxides is computed and used to train a machine-learning model for screening the covalency competition in spinel oxides, with a mean absolute error of 0.05 eV. [Mn](T)[Al0.5Mn1.5](O)O(4)is predicted to be a highly active OER catalyst and subsequent experimental results confirm its superior activity. This work sets mechanistic principles of spinel oxides for water oxidation, which may be extendable to other applications.									125	5	0	0	10	0	126			2520-1158			WOS:000540419200001

In this paper, we report on trends in the adsorption energy of different adsorbed intermediates derived from the oxidation and reduction of water for ternary ABO(3) oxides in the cubic perovskite structure. Our findings support a previously reported trend that rationalizes the observed lower bound in oxygen evolution (OER) overpotentials from correlations in OH* and OOH* adsorption energies. In addition, we report hydrogen adsorption energies that may be used to estimate hydrogen evolution (HER) overpotentials along with potential metrics for electrochemical metastability in reducing environments. We also report and discuss trends between atom-projected density of states and adsorption energies, which may enable a design criteria from the local electronic structure of the active site.									63	2	0	0	2	0	63			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000423897900091	29349458

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the essential half-reaction in electrochemical water splitting, and thus development and exploration of electrocatalysts with excellent performance are vital to prompt the application of OER. Due to the unique electronic properties of NiTe and strong synergistic interaction between NiTe and FeOOH, NiTe@FeOOH hybrid nanorods were successfully fabricated on Ni foams (NF) by a hydrothermal reaction step and another in-situ growth step for the first time without consuming any extra energy. The 3D structure of the NiTe@FeOOH/NF was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) mapping technologies. Electrochemical measurements showed that the as-prepared NiTe@FeOOH/NF needs only an overpotential of 241 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH and requires 1.341 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH with a 0.33 M urea, showing excellent long-term stability. The NiTe@FeOOH/NF as the bifunctional electrocatalyst in an electrolyzer shows high efficiency with a cell voltage of 1.50 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This work can provide a new efficient method to construct highly active and cost-effective OER catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2196-0216			WOS:000683393100001

Although manganese oxides were rarely used as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, they were still considered as active and efficient OER catalysts due to the earth-abundant and low toxic nature of manganese. In this work, we proposed a facile method for the synthesis of high-performance electrochemical OER catalyst by magnetically stirring the mixture of 1,3,4-thiadiazole-2,5-dithiol (DMTD), Ni2+ and MnO2 nanowires (NWs) in ethanol at room temperature, noted as Ni/DMTD/MnO2. The Nil DMTD complex and MnO2 NWs showed synergistically enhanced OER activity and excellent durability in alkaline solution. The introducing of MnO2 and the presence of Ni3+ after the oxidation of Ni2+ were the key factors which improve the OER performance. The potential at 10 mA cm(-2) was 1.492 V (vs RHE) with a Tafel slope of 69.46 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH aqueous solution, comparable to the state-of-art RuO2.

Herein, a hybrid material, consisting of encapsulated cobalt sulfide (CoxSy) particles and S,N-codoped carbon (SNC), was prepared via a simple template-assisted pyrolysis process. The as-prepared catalyst possesses a mass of mesopores and abundant N-doped coordination species. By a feat of synergistic effects between the encapsulated CoxSy and SNC, the hybrid displays superior electrocatalytic performances toward both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes, for example, a positive ORR half-wave potential of 0.802 V and a low OER overpotential of 336 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), as well as excellent electrochemical stability. Moreover, the as-prepared catalyst applied in ZABs exhibits a high power density (132 mW cm(-2)), good rate capability, outstanding rechargeable ability, and robust cycling stability (SOO h at 2 mA cm(-2)).									4	0	0	0	0	0	3			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000750883400079

Most of the over-potentials are due to electrochemical processes at the anode, where oxygen evolution occurs. This paper investigates the oxygen evolving half cells for different complete systems including photoelectrochemical, photo-catalytic and electro-catalytic water splitting. An electrochemical model is developed to evaluate the over-potential losses in the oxygen evolving reaction and the effects of key parameters are analyzed. The transient diffusion of hydroxide ions through the membrane and bulk electrolyte are modeled and simulated for improved system operation. The results of the thermodynamic and electrochemical analyses show that for each water splitting configuration, there are optimal values of the operating parameters such as electrolyte concentration, current density, and membrane-electrode distance. The operating criteria of key parameters and the optimal working region of the oxygen evolving reactor are examined for assessment and optimization of a complete water splitting system. The analysis of the oxygen evolving reaction is performed for three variations of ruthenium based supramolecular complexes and molybdenum-oxo catalysts for catalytic hydrogen production.

Herein, we developed a method for synthesizing multimetallic hydroxide nanosheets by corroding nickel foam with chloride ions, which enabled the screening and discovery of various multimetallic hydroxide electrocatalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We discovered that Ni5Co3Mo-OH nanosheets exhibited electrocatalytic performances toward OER (eta(100) = 304 mV) and HER (eta(10 )= 52 mV). Moreover, Ni5Co3Mo-OH can be employed as active bifunctional catalysts toward overall water splitting with a low cell voltage of 1.43 Vat 10 mA.cm(-2) (1.60 Vat 100 mA.cm(-2)) and stable operation for 100 h (100 mA.cm(-2)).

In light of the burgeoning interest in layered structures towards various electrocatalytic applications, we endeavored to study the inherent electrochemical properties of representative layered materials of this class, GaSe and GeS, and their impact towards electrochemical sensing of redox probes as well as catalysis of oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions. In contrast to the typical sandwich structure of MoS2 layered materials, GeS is isoelectronic to black phosphorus with the same structure; GaSe is a layered material consisting of GaSe sheets bonded in the sequence Se-Ga-Ga-Se. We characterized GaSe and GeS by employing scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy complemented by electronic structure calculations. It was found that the encompassing surface oxide layers on GaSe and GeS greatly influenced their electrochemical properties, especially their electrocatalytic capabilities towards hydrogen evolution reaction. These findings provide fresh insight into the electrochemical properties of these IIIA-VIA and IVA-VIA layered structures which enables development for future applications.									65	2	0	0	2	0	65			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000369482100039	26675834

Herein, a highly efficient bifunctional electrode consisting of Ni-doped molybdenum nitride nanorods on Ni foam is prepared through topotactic transformation of NiMoO4 nanorods that are in situ hydrothermally grown on Ni foam. The electrode not only contains rich, accessible, electrochemically active sites but also possesses extraordinary chemical stability. It exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction performance in 1.0 M KOH with low overpotentials of 15 and 218 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), superior to the commercial benchmark materials Pt/C and RuO2 under the same condition. A simple water electrolyzer using the obtained electrode as both the anode and cathode needs a very low cell potential of 1.49 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and maintains stability for 110 h without degradation. The excellent performance of the electrode could be attributed to the formation of highly conductive, corrosion- and oxidation-resistant metal nitrides and the synergetic effect between intimately interconnected, electrochemically active nickel molybdenum nitride and Ni or NiO nanoparticles. This study shows that the use of transition metal nitrides in combination of nanostructured heterojunctions of multiple active components enables one to develop highly stable and efficient water electrolyzers without precious metals. The preparative strategy used in this work could be applied to devise new electrocatalysts.									69	3	0	0	3	0	69			1944-8244			WOS:000444793000043	30124043

Metal-free catalysts such as porous carbons are promising candidates for ORR and the performance of porous carbons strongly depends on their nanostructure. Herein, we reported the synthesis of high surface area N doped carbon nanotube (CNT-900) by using ZnO@zeolite imidazolate framework (ZnO@ZIF-8) nanowire as a precursor. When used for an ORR catalyst, the CNT-900 show obvious superior performance compared with the carbon derived from ZIF-8. In addition, it exhibits comparable activity with 20 wt% Pt/C and superior stability. Combined with green and facile synthesis strategy, the method in this work can be easily extended to synthesis other nanomaterials for energy storage and conversion application.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1387-7003	1879-0259		WOS:000459840400005

We synthesized mesoporous carbon nanostructures with multi-dopants such as iron, nitrogen, and sulfur as a cathode catalyst using the ordered silica templates and porphyrinic iron. The co-doped mesoporous carbon cathode catalysts exhibited a high ORR performance in an acid medium, i.e. complete ORR process and improved durability. The enhanced ORR properties of the catalysts might be ascribed to iron containing catalytic active sites surrounded by nitrogen/sulfur species and a well-defined mesoporous carbon nanostructure.

Poor cycle life has been associated with parasitic chemistry caused by the reactivity of electrolyte and electrode with NaO2, a strong nucleophile and base. Its reactivity can, however, not consistently explain the side reactions and irreversibility. Herein we show that singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) forms at all stages of cycling and that it is a main driver for parasitic chemistry. It was detected in- and ex-situ via a O-1(2) trap that selectively and rapidly forms a stable adduct with O-1(2). The O-1(2) formation mechanism involves proton-mediated superoxide disproportionation on discharge, rest, and charge below ca. 3.3V, and direct electrochemical O-1(2) evolution above ca. 3.3V. Trace water, which is needed for high capacities also drives parasitic chemistry. Controlling the highly reactive singlet oxygen is thus crucial for achieving highly reversible cell operation.									77	0	0	0	3	0	77			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000416244200043	29024316

Here, using polyoxotungstate (POT) as precursor, Pt-based bifunctional catalysts were fabricated, which are composed of Pt, WOx and graphene (Pt-WO3-x@rGO). The Pt-WO3-x@rGO (1.58% Pt-loading) catalyst shows an enhanced catalytic activity, namely, overpotentials of 37 mV for Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 174 mV for Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and achieves a working voltage of 1.55 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for water splitting in alkaline-medium. Electrochemical analyses and DFT calculation suggest that the WOx mediated interface (Pt0...O -W) plays a key role to enhance the electron transfer and reduce the activation energy for both HER and OER. Moreover, this kind of Pt-0...O -W interface enhances the Pt based catalyst stability in alkaline-medium significantly.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000784266400005

Therefore, we developed a simple and effective method to grow ZIF-67 in situ on graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) and then annealed it to generate nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) loaded with CO@C nanoparticles (Co@C/NC). Benefiting from this in situ growth method, after annealing, a large number of N atoms on the surface of NC nanosheets anchor more metal Co to form more catalytic Co-N active sites. At the same time, the Co@C/NC composites use NC nanosheets as the matrix, which can improve the electrochemical double-layer capacitance and conductivity of the composites. As demonstrated in electrochemical measurements, the OER and HER overpotentials of Co@C/NC composites at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) were only 300 and 175.4 mV in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. The preparation method is suitable for synthesizing various metal and carbon composite electrocatalysts. It provides ideas for designing and manufacturing high-performance non-noble-metal dual-function OER/HER catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000744968900001

Adsorption of oxygen on (110) Na-MO2 is investigated, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which is important in the discharging and charging of Na-air batteries. Adsorption of oxygen on Na/MO2 was investigated, and it was observed that the catalysts encourage the formation of the discharge product reported in the literature, i.e., NaO2. The surface NaO2 appears to have bond lengths comparable to those reported for monomer NaO2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-1343			WOS:000835574200001	35936399

However, the sluggish kinetics of OER and ORR often require the use of precious metal-based catalysts such as iridium, ruthenium, and platinum to lower the energy barriers of OER and ORR. Developing a highly efficient and stable bifunctional catalyst that is made of non-precious elements for ORR and OER still remains a significant challenge. Here, we show a novel catalyst architecture based on coupling non-precious Co3O4 nanocrystals onto nitrogen-doped, core-shell structured carbon nanotube-graphene nanoribbon (N-csCNT-GNR) scaffolds prepared by microwave-assisted, controlled upzipping of multiwall carbon nanotubes. The unzipped graphene nanoribbon shell enables a high surface area for loading of Co3O4 nanocrystals while the intact inner carbon nanotube core facilitates efficient transport of electrons. The as-prepared Co3O4/N-csCNT-GNR composite catalysts exhibit remarkably high activity towards both OER and ORR as a result of synergistic interactions between Co3O4 and the N-csCNT-GNR substrates.									48	2	0	0	1	0	48			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000356455200025

We herein report the successful construction of a new class of hierarchical catalysts with defect-enriched nickel-molybdenum phosphide nanosheets anchored on the surface of carbon nanotubes for efficient water splitting. Via the construction of a hierarchical nanostructure, more efficient electron mobility and mass transfer occurrence were achieved, resulting in a substantial enhancement of electrocatalytic performances. Interestingly, overpotentials of only 255 and 135 mV are required for the optimized Ni1Mo1P NSs@MCNTs to afford a current of 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively. More significantly, the introduction of molybdenum and phosphorus is also significant for exposing surface active sites and modifying the bonding energy between hydrogen and metals; all of these advantages have endowed the Ni1Mo1P NSs@MCNTs//Ni1Mo1P NSs@MCNTs couple to display highly efficient water electrocatalysis property with a relatively low overall potential of 1.601 V at 10 mA cm(-2), shedding bright light for large-scale overall water electrocatalysis.									58	4	0	0	3	0	59			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000444355700046	30079718

Electrochemical performance of 50 nm thin catalysts (Ir pure, Ir-Ru 1:1, Ir-Ru 1:3, Ru pure) is tested in a Rotating Disk Electrode. Corresponding Tafel slopes are measured before and after the CV-based procedure to compare the activity and stability of prepared compounds. Calculated activities prior to the procedure confirm higher activity of ruthenium-containing catalysts (Ru pure > Ir-Ru 1:3 > Ir-Ru 1:1 > Ir pure). However, after the procedure a higher activity and less degradation of Ir-Ru 1:3 is observed, compared to Ir-Ru 1:1, i.e. the sample with a higher amount of unstable ruthenium performs better. This contradicts the expected behavior of the catalyst. The comprehensive chemical and structural analysis unravels that the stability of Ir-Ru 1:3 sample is connected to RuO2 chemical state and hcp structure. Obtained results are confirmed by measuring current densities in a single cell. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The OER activity decreased upon increasing the Al content for the Co-and Al-based LDH catalysts, whereas a synergistic effect in Co-and Fe-based LDHs was observed, which resulted in an optimal Fe content of 35 at %. This catalyst was spray-coated on Ni foam electrodes and showed very good stability in a flow-through cell with a potential of approximately 1.53 V at 10 mAcm(-2) in 1m KOH for at least 48 h.									97	2	0	0	3	0	97			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000394571800023	27865059

Herein, an in situ growth method is proposed to prepare the ultrathin NiFe MOF nanosheets with a thickness of 1.5 nm, which are vertically inlaid into a 3D ordered macroporous structure of NiFe hydroxide. The well-designed composite delivers an efficient electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 270 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and stable electrolysis as long as 10 h toward the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction, much superior to the state-of-the-art RuO2 electrocatalyst. A comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the excellent performance originates from the desirable combination of the highly exposed active centers in the ultrathin bimetallic MOF nanosheets, effective electron conduction between MOF nanosheets and ordered macroporous hydroxide, and efficient mass transfer across the hierarchically porous hybridization. This study sheds light on the exploration of powerful protocols to gain diverse high-performance MOF nanosheets and may open a perspective to achieve their efficient electrocatalytic performance.									78	8	0	0	5	0	79			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000477222700001	31293075

In this article, a metal-organic framework, MOF(Fe), was prepared by a hydrothermal process using ferric nitrate as the metal ion precursor and trimesic acid as an organic ligand. The structure of the MOF(Fe) was characterized by X-ray diffraction, N-2 adsorption-desorption, Transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Thermo-gravimetric analysis. The activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the kinetic behavior of the ORR using the MOF(Fe) were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and rotating disk electrode voltammetry, respectively, using an alkaline electrolyte. The characterization results showed that the MOF(Fe) was highly crystalline with abundant micropores, large specific surface area and high thermal stability. The MOF(Fe) exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the ORR. The ORR mechanism varies with the applied potentials. The ORR occurs through a two-electron pathway at potentials in the range of -0.30 to -0.50 V, but shifts to four-electron pathway with the potentials in the range -0.50 to -0.95 V. In addition, the MOF(Fe) shows excellent catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline electrolyte. This work opens a new route for the development of effective non-precious metal catalysts based on MOFs for the ORR and OER.

In chemical reduction two different reducing agents are used namely; hydrazine hydrate and formaldehyde giving Pt supported over CeO2. Solution combustion method is used to prepare Pt doped CeO2. Detailed characterization using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurement and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is carried out to distinguish the Pt supported and doped compounds. XRD and TEM results have clearly shown the differences in the structure and morphology, however, BET results do not show significant differences. Further, electrochemical measurements are performed in neutral medium to differentiate the electrochemical activity. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) indeed shows noticeable differences between Pt supported over CeO2 and Pt doped CeO2. CeO2 alone has also shown different electrochemical behavior compared to the Pt containing CeO2. Considering oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as a model reaction, Tafel slope measurements are performed for CeO2, Pt supported over CeO2 and Pt doped CeO2 to observe the differences. It was noted that CeO2 and Pt doped CeO2 showed similar Tafel slope indicating the same mechanism, while Pt supported over CeO2 showed different Tafel slopes, hence the different mechanism.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000329105400024

Here, based on density functional theory calculations, the electrocatalytic behaviors of pure and metal (Ni, Co) doped Fe-terminated Fe2O3 (0001) are investigated. The potential-limiting step for OER is determined as the formation of O* by dehydrogenating surface hydroxyl and it is suggested that the doping enhances the catalytic activity of Fe2O3 (0001) by reducing the free energy change of rate limiting step on doped Ni or Co atom. Especially, the calculated over-potential of Co-doped Fe2O3 (0001) surface is about 0.63 eV on Co site, which is comparable with the theoretical over-potential of 0.56 eV for RuO2.									4	3	0	0	0	0	4			1674-0068	1003-7713		WOS:000416732400010

IrO2 nanoparticles were obtained in the process of photodeposition on the surface of TiO2 powder by UV illumination from appropriate Ir salt aqueous solution. Physicochemical characterization of the resulting IrO2/TiO2 composite, containing 25% w/w Ir, was carried out by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical behaviour of the prepared IrO2/TiO2 catalyst was compared with that of commercial unsupported IrO2. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry (CA) were performed to identify the surface electrochemistry and OER of the IrO2/TiO2 catalyst. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to determine uncompensated and charge transfer resistance. CA experiments were carried out in order to evaluate the stability of the IrO2/TiO2 composite during OER in the dark and under UV light irradiation. The photodeposition method on a TiO2 support resulted in 1-2 nm Ir nanoparticles, very well dispersed on the surface and in their oxidized state (IrO2). Electrochemical results indicated that despite its lower conductivity, the IrO2/TiO2 composite exhibits comparable intrinsic electrocatalytic activity for OER with that of the commercial IrO2 catalyst. It was found that under UV light irradiation there has been improvement of the stability of the IrO2/TiO2 performance during oxygen evolution (presumably due to sustained activation of reactive species via photogenerated holes or OH radicals) as well as current enhancement (due to the interaction between the photogenerated holes in TiO2 support and IrO2 nanoparticles). These would be beneficial effects in prolonged water photo-electrolysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000709863700014

Herein, we combine electrochemical measurements, operando X-ray scattering and absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the catalytically active phase, reaction center and the OER mechanism. We provide the first direct atomic-scale evidence that, under applied anodic potentials, MFe LDHs oxidize from as-prepared alpha -phases to activated gamma -phases. The OER-active gamma -phases are characterized by about 8% contraction of the lattice spacing and switching of the intercalated ions. DFT calculations reveal that the OER proceeds via a Mars van Krevelen mechanism. The flexible electronic structure of the surface Fe sites, and their synergy with nearest-neighbor M sites through formation of O-bridged Fe-M reaction centers, stabilize OER intermediates that are unfavorable on pure M-M centers and single Fe sites, fundamentally accounting for the high catalytic activity of MFe LDHs. NiFe and CoFe layered double hydroxides are among the most active electrocatalysts for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction. Here, by combining operando experiments and rigorous DFT calculations, the authors unravel their active phase, the reaction center and the catalytic mechanism.									284	13	0	0	20	0	283			2041-1723			WOS:000537059500001	32433529

Applying a suitable bifunctional catalyst can be an effective way to solve this problem. We anticipated that the ruthenium ion dissolved in the electrolyte will not only overcome the disadvantages of solid phase catalysts, but also reduce the overpotential for both charge and discharge. This is possible due to the suitable redox potential of the ruthenium ion, which effectively reduced the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential, and the affinity between the ruthenium ion and oxygen, which facilitated the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and suppressed the degradation of the cathode. Here, we propose a new soluble catalyst, ruthenium bromide, for Li-O-2 batteries. The battery using ruthenium bromide clearly exhibited enhanced cycling performance, increasing round-trip efficiency (from 68.2% to 80.5%) and rate capability. A new understanding and application of the soluble ruthenium catalyst, which is commonly used as a solid catalyst, will not only overcome the existing problems but also provide a promising platform for Li-O-2 batteries.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000406672400006

The changes in lattice parameter (chemical expansivity) were used to quantify oxygen reduction reaction processes and vacancy concentration changes in lanthanum strontium cobaltite. At 550 degrees C, the observed lattice parameter reduction at an applied bias of -0.6V was equivalent to that from the reducing condition of a 2% carbon monoxide atmosphere with an oxygen non-stoichiometry delta of 0.24. At lower temperatures (200 degrees C), the application of bias reduced the sample much more effectively than a carbon monoxide atmosphere and induced an oxygen non-stoichiometry delta of 0.47. Despite these large changes in oxygen concentration, the epitaxial thin film was completely re-oxidized and no signs of crystallinity loss or film amorphization were observed. This work demonstrates that the effects of oxygen evolution and reduction can be examined with applied bias at low temperatures, extending the ability to probe these processes with in-situ analytical techniques.

The materials are characterized by physical and electro-chemical characterizations, and the results show that Ni(OH)(2) @NiFe/NF has better catalytic activities than other monomers. Furthermore, the Ni/Fe ratio in the electrodeposition step and the CV deposition cycles could affect the performances. While the sample with Ni/Fe= 2:2 and 60 CV deposition cycles (Ni(OH)(2) @ Ni2Fe2/NF-60) exhibits the best activities towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution re-action (OER), and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Furthermore, the two-electrode electrolyzer composed of Ni (OH)(2) @Ni2Fe2/NF-60 exhibits the smallest driving potential (1.696 V (HER & OER) and 1.601 V (HER & UOR) at 50 mA.cm(-2)), with excellent stability. These may be due to the Mott-Schottky structure (metal-semiconductor interface) could reduce the binding energy of hydrogen atoms, promote charge transfer and generate abundant active sites, while producing a synergistic effect and promoting electrocatalytic reactions.(C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Co3O4 incorporating metals with different valences (M/Co=1:4; M=Cu, Ni, Fe, Cr, and W) were also prepared with similar sheet-like structures comprising nanosized crystallites. After detailed characterization by X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and nitrogen sorption, the oxides were employed as OER electrocatalysts. Substitution of octahedral and tetrahedral sites of the spinel structure with divalent and trivalent transition metals (Cu, Ni, Fe, and Cr) increased the activity of Co3O4 for the OER, whereas incorporation of hexavalent W led to formation of a second crystal phase and significantly higher electrocatalytic performance. Furthermore, this method is easily scaled up for mass production of Co3O4 with the same nanostructure, which is highly desirable for large-scale application.									28	1	0	0	0	0	28			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000424762600013	29194977

We found that aliovalent doping tunes the electronic features to be optimal for the ORR and lattice expansion-driven surface reconstruction stabilizes the key *OOH intermediate for the OER. The resulting ORR/OER overpotentials are very low (similar to 0.5 V), suggesting the application of this material as an air electrode in reversible solid oxide electrochemical cells.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000404571500008

Herein, single Co-N-C catalysts with well-defined symmetric Co-N-4 sites are selected as atomic platforms for electronic structure tailoring. Density function theory reveals that P-doping into Co-N-C can lead to the formation of asymmetric Co-N3P1 sites with symmetry-breaking electronic structures, enabling the affinity of strong oxygen-containing intermediates, moderate H adsorption, and weak Cl- adsorption. Thus, ORR/OER/HER activities and stability are optimized simultaneously with high Cl--corrosion resistance. The asymmetric Co-N3P1 structure based catalyst with boosted ORR/OER/HER performance endows seawater-based Zn-air batteries (S-ZABs) with superior long-term stability over 750 h and allows seawater splitting to operate continuously for 1000 h. A self-driven seawater splitting powered by S-ZABs gives ultrahigh H-2 production rates of 497 mu mol h(-1). This work is the first to advance the scientific understanding of the competitive adsorption mechanism between Cl- and reaction intermediates from the perspective of electronic structure, paving the way for synthesis of efficient trifunctional catalysts with high Cl--corrosion resistance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000844123300016	35790038

Herein, we successfully prepared an efficient ternary electrocatalyst of porous cobalt oxynitride (Co3OxNy) nanosheets by a simple nitridation strategy. Specifically, CoONPNS-400 (cobalt oxynitride with porous nanosheet structure obtained at 400(degrees)C) offered a low OER overpotential of 0.23V to achieve the catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 48m V dec(-1) in alkali media, outperforming most of the first-row transition-metal-based OER electrocatalysts. The calculated density of states (DOS) analysis and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements revealed that the introduction of foreign N atoms into pristine Co3O4 nanosheets can optimize the electronic structure and create more oxygen vacancies, thus leading to enhanced electrical conductivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the foreign N atoms can also improve the energetics for OER by modulating the free energy for adsorbed intermediates (OOH*, OH*, O*), further improving the OER electrocatalytic activity of CoON PNS-400. This work provides a possibility for rationally designing ternary transition-metal compounds as advanced OER electrocatalysts.									23	1	0	0	2	0	23			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000431975700012	29575748

Therefore, a need exists to develop cost-effective and highly active alternative electrocatalysts for ORR and OER This study investigates the influence of metal coordination fashion on electrocatalytic ORR and OER activities among three types of Co-Mn bimetallic oxides (CMOs): tunnel-type (CMO_T), layer-type (CMO_L), and spinel-type (CMO_S) structures. An electrochemical evaluation for CMOs verifies that CMO_L has the highest ORR and OER specific activities, which is relatively better than the previously reported bifunctional metal oxides. Additionally, atomic configuration analysis for the oxides suggests that the excellent ORR and OER activities of CMO_L result from the difference in Co and Mn coordination states. This paper not only presents an excellent electrocatalyst for alkaline fuel cells and water electrolyzers but also provides an important guideline for the design of oxygen electrocatalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2470-1343			WOS:000592834400051	33225170

However, the design and development of an efficient bifunctional catalyst for simultaneous generation of hydrogen and oxygen remains extremely challenging yet is critical for the practical implementation of water electrolysis. Here, we report a facile method to fabricate novel N-doped carbon nanotube frameworks (NCNTFs) by the pyrolysis of a bimetallic metal organic framework (MIL-88-Fe/Co). The resultant electrocatalyst, Co3Fe7@NCNTFs, exhibits excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, achieving 10 mA/cm(2) at a low overpotential of just 264 mV in 1 M KOH solution, and 197 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The high electrocatalytic activity arises from the synergistic effect between the chemistry of the Co3Fe7 and the NCNTs coupled to the novel framework structure. The remarkable electrocatalytic performance of our bifunctional electrocatalyst provides a promising pathway to high-performance overall water splitting and electrochemical energy devices.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000529194200001	32293808

A major challenge to the technique's applicability to these systems has to do with the choice of substrate, which requires a wide inert potential range for quantitative electrochemistry, and is also responsible for minimizing background gas generation in the confined microscale environment. Here, we report on the feasibility of electrochemical experiments using the standard redox couple Fe(CN)(6)(3-/4)(-) and microchips featuring carbon-coated electrodes. We electrochemically assess the in situ performance with respect to flow rate, liquid volume, and scan rate. Equally important with the choice of working substrate is the choice of the reference electrode. We demonstrate that the use of a modified electrode setup allows for potential measurements relatable to bulk studies. Furthermore, we use this setup to demonstrate the inert potential range for carbon-coated electrodes in aqueous electrolytes for HER, OER, ORR, and eCO(2)R. This work provides a basis for understanding electrochemical measurements in similar microscale systems and for studying gas-generating reactions with liquid electrochemical TEM.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1431-9276	1435-8115		WOS:000502313700002	31647046

Herein, a new non-precious metal electrocatalyst by synergistically coupling spindle-like Fe3N hollow nanorods with Ni2Co layered double hydroxides (Fe3N@Ni2Co-LDHs) was fabricated via annealing spindle-like Fe2O3 hollow nanorods in NH3 atmosphere, followed by refluxing in oil bath in the existence of Co(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O, Ni(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O, urea and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Impressively, the Fe3N@Ni2Co-LDHs nanohybrids with heterointerfaces shows remarkable OER performance with extremely low overpotential (only 240 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) and small Tafel slope (38.9 mV dec(-1)) for OER in alkaline medium. The enhanced OER performance could be attributed to the strong interfacial interaction between Fe3N and Ni2Co-LDHs, and improved electrical conductivity of the nanohybrids. This work might provide a feasible route for the development of efficient electrocatalysts with hetero-interfaces in renewable energy system. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The crystal structures of both Ag3PO4 and h-BN were confirmed by TEM, and XRD. The surface chemical states of the composites were determined by XPS. The photocatalytic performance of Ag3PO4/h-BN composites was investigated in oxygen evolution reaction. The results showed that the presence of h-BN could increase the photocatalytic performance of Ag3PO4. However, an excessive amount of h-BN in Ag3PO4/h-BN resulted in decreased photocatalytic performance, possibly due to the reduced number of active sites. Moreover, the photocatalytic performance of room temperature and cryogenic ball milled Ag3PO4/h-BN composites was compared. Finally, both the stability and mechanism of the enhanced photocatalytic performance in Ag3PO4/h-BN composite were investigated.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000474320600118

However, the composition-activity relationship of such doping has not been systematically investigated yet because of the challenge in constructing bimetal TMPs with continuously variable composition while keeping homogenous elemental distribution. Herein, we develop a strategy of using bimetal Prussian blue analogues with homogenous elemental distribution at molecular scale as an ideal platform to achieve bimetal cobalt-iron phosphides (Co1-xFexP) with a continuously changeable Co/Fe ratio (0 < x < 1) and uniform metal distribution. Such a system allows us to draw out a composition-activity volcano profile of Co1-xFexP for OER. By optimizing the composition, the best catalytic activity is obtained at the Co/Fe ratio of 1.63 in Co1-xFexP with small overpotentials of 230 and 268 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, which outperform most of the reported TMPs. These results may inspire the use of multicomponent molecular platforms to understand composition-dependent performance and explore highly efficient catalysts for diverse applications.									24	1	0	0	0	0	24			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000448754500024	30265514

Herein, a well-designed pre-catalyst composed of nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) nanocubes on crystalline Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets is demonstrated to achieve outstanding OER catalysts via cascading reconstruction. The NiHCF phase experiences a complete reconstruction and simultaneously functions as an inducing mediator to enable the reconstruction of the underneath Ni(OH)(2) to form highly disordered Fe-Ni(O)OH. Benefiting from the cascading reconstruction process, the electrode shows obvious self-activation behavior with a notable overpotential decrease of 92 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) relative to that of the pristine catalysts. Accordingly, the as-activated highly disordered Fe-Ni(O)OH exhibits excellent OER performance with an ultralow overpotential of 242 mV to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and good stability at about 100 mA cm(-2) over 100 h. The facile cascading reconstruction strategy offers a new perspective for obtaining superior catalysts toward OER.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000764255200001

Metal (Co, Fe, Ni, etc.) phosphide nanoparticles uniformly encapsulated in porous N,P-codoped nanofibrous carbon coated on carbon paper (MeP@NPC/CP) are prepared through one-pot carbonization-phosphorization strategy, which are potential for effective electrocatalytic water reduction/oxidation reactions. The well-designed self-supported structure and the abundant accessible active centers together contribute to the high electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen and oxygen evolution. Remarkably, an alkaline electrolyzer assembled from CoP@NPC/CP as cathode and anode can afford the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the voltage of 1.67 V for overall water splitting in alkaline media with excellent stability.

Hydroxide ion oxidation is followed by oxygen evolution with gas bubble formation. The image analysis was performed in situ in order to find correlation between bubbles related phenomena and the current of OH- oxidation. Bubble formation was tested in four different regimes having different scan rate and/or electrode rotation rate. The videometry using high speed camera was applied to observe the bubble related phenomena. The integral effect of presence of bubbles was analyzed. The fast Fourier transformation and normalized power spectra were used for advanced image analysis. Using this type of analysis, two different characteristic periodical behaviors were reported for the first time. The obtained periods were in accordance with scan rate and electrode rotation rate. The former periodic component of bubble formation process was correlated with well defined CV cycles, and hence, related to electrocatalytic oxidation-reduction of OH-. The other periodic component of bubble behavior induced by rotation rate (600 rpm) was shifted from 0.01 s toward slightly higher values probably due to hydrodynamic conditions in the investigated system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1878-5190	1878-5204		WOS:000354099000006

In this work, an effective FexNiyOOH/ESS with high surface area and good catalytic activity was prepared for water electrolysis. Its morphologies at different ratio of Fe/Ni atoms were diverse, such as flower ball, flake, and block, etc. Test results showed that at 10 mA cm(-2) and 300 mA cm(-2), the hydrogen evolution overpotentials of Fe1.5Ni0.5OOH/ESS were 172 mV and 258 mV. The oxygen evolution overpotentials of Fe0.2Ni1.8OOH/ESS were 208 mV and 308 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 600 mA cm(-2). During the 136-h stability test, the oxygen evolution activity of Fe0.2Ni1.8OOH/ESS was basically unchanged.

In this work, Zn and Co bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZnCo-ZIF) templates were used to synthesize Zn0.975Co0.025S/CoS2 nanoparticles embedded in N,S-codoped carbon nanotube/nanopolyhedra (ZnCoS-NSCNT/NP) via a facile two-step method. Benefitting from the synergetic effect of two metal sulfide species, mesoporous polyhedral structure, N,S-codoped carbon matrix and deep-rooted CNT networks, the product exhibits excellent catalytic performance for both the HER and OER in 1 M KOH, affording a low overpotential of 270 mV for the OER and 152 mV for the HER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).

Similarities between hydrous nickel oxide films and electroprecipitated 'battery type' nickel oxide were shown due to their similar change in redox and oxygen evolving properties as a result of film ageing. This ageing method was found to significantly enhance the OER performance of the hydrous nickel oxide electrode with the OER overpotential decreasing by 60 +/- 2 mV and experiencing a 10 fold increase in OER rate for a fixed overpotential over that of an un-aged electrode. The OER turnover frequency for an aged electrode was found to be 1.16 +/- 0.07 s(-1) in comparison to 0.05 +/- 0.003 s(-1) for a hydrous nickel oxide electrode not subjected to ageing.

For the oxygen evolution, a 30 mV Tafel slope is obtained in the presence of CeO2, while in its absence a 40 mV coefficient is observed. The intrinsic electrocatalytic activity is mainly due to electronic factors, as result of the synergism between Ru and Cc oxides. For chlorine evolution, the Tafel slope (30 mV) is independent on oxide composition. The best global electrocatalytic activity for CIER was observed in the absence of Nb2O5 additive. Variation of the voltammetric charge throughout the experiments confirms high CeO2 content compositions are fragile, due mainly to the porosity caused by CeO2 presence. On the other hand, Nb2O5 addition decreases considerably this instability. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									76	10	0	0	4	0	83			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000237377300027

Using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopies, we observe that a surface active layer of oxyhydroxide-like phase with contracted Co-Co distance was evolved during the OER, which is responsible for the highly-active large-current-density activity.

The overpotentials of the NiMn1.5PO4/NF catalysts were 72 mV and 198 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER process, respectively. When NiMn1.5PO4/NF was used as both anode and cathode electrocatalyst in 1 M KOH, a low cell voltage of 1.48 V was achieved at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and showed a good long-term stability for 50 h.

Atomic replacement of Fe(II)by other metal(II) ions (e.g., Zn-II/Co-II) via synthesizing isostructural trinuclear-complex precursors (Fe2Zn/Fe2Co), namely the "heteroatom modulator approach", is inhibiting the aggregation of Fe atoms toward nanoclusters with formation of a stable iron dimer in an optimal metal-nitrogen moiety, clearly identified by direct transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure analysis.

J	Li, Yiming; Yan, Zheng; Wang, Qiaodi; Ye, Huating; Li, Mengli; Zhu, Lianwen; Cao, Xuebo								Ultrathin, highly branched carbon nanotube cluster with outstanding oxygen electrocatalytic performance								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				282				224	232		10.1016/j.electacta.2018.06.058				AUG 20 2018	2018	Metal-free heteroatom-doped porous carbons such as N, P co-doped nanoporous carbon materials with designed properties are attracting increased attention for metal-air battery applications. Herein, we report a general approach to synthesizing highly branched N, P co-doped carbon nanotube cluster (NPCTC) derived from metal-organic frameworks as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. NPCTC were obtained by treating ZIF-8 with butyl methylphosphinate, followed by two-step pyrolysis. Benefiting from the cross-linking polymerization and self-aggregation between ZIF-8 and the monomer, the resulting NPCTC exhibited higher mechanical stability and strength. Although the wall thickness was <5 nm, no obvious shrinkage and collapse were observed after graphitization, thereby maximizing the exposure of the active sites. Studies of oxygen electrocatalysis demonstrate that the NPCTC can deliver outstanding bifunctional performance with a more positive half-wave potential, higher limiting current density for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than Pt/C, and lower onset potential for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than IrO2. Homemade Zn-air battery exhibited stable charge-discharge durability over 180 cycles, with an overpotential increase of only 0.15 V. The improved electrochemical performance was mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of N, P co-doping and the distinct geometry of NPCTC, i.e., three-dimensionally interconnected hollow ultrathin nanotube branches facilitating electron and mass transfer.

In this work, a series of samples, including black phosphorus (BP) sheets, iron Bolide (Fe2B), Fe2+ doped BP (Fe2+/BP) sheets, and iron Bolide/black phosphorus (Fe2B/BP) sheets were prepared, and their electrochemical properties were investigated. It was found that the composite of amorphous Fe2B/BP sheets showed the best OER performance, which was significantly superior to BP sheets, Fe2B, and Fe2+/BP sheets. It could be seen that Fe2B/BP sheets composite had only a low overpotential of 179 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in 1 M KOH, and its Tafel slope was 70 mV/dec. In particular, after 1000 cycles, its overpotential only rose by 11 mV at the same current density of 10 mA/cm(2), while, after 10 h, its current density only decreased by 0.91 mA/cm(2) at the overpotential of 179 mV, showing good stability. This study will mainly explore the performance improvement mechanism in an attempt to synthesize better catalysts for OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0361-5235	1543-186X		WOS:000787604400001

Influence of erbium (Er) ions on the structural and electrocatalytic properties of SmFe1-xErxO3 perovskites were studied under varied alkaline pH (8.5-14) conditions. The rod-like dimensional analysis was obtained through scanning/transmission electron microscopes. Diffraction signals affirmed the presence of samarium oxide (Sm2O3) traces in processed perovskites. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data signified the presence of corresponding oxides and determined the valence state of Sm, Er and Fe ions. Er ions were found to boost the production of oxygen and hydrogen molecules. The anodic overpotential values improved from 216 mV to 184 mV, while cathodic overpotential values improved from 231 mV to 213 mV upon Er inclusion. Electrocatalytic results approved SmFe1-xErxO3 as a promising oxygen/hydrogen liberating electrocatalyst with remarkable stability and Tafel slopes that improved from 96 to 77 mV/dec and 78 to 55 mV/dec upon Er incorporation in host perovskite.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000595323900001

Recently, metal-nitrogen-doped carbon (M-N-C) components formed by transition metal (TM) combined with nitrogen-doped carbon materials have drawn extensive interests due to their inexpensive cost and great activity. Herein, a straightforward evaporation-pyrolysis strategy is designed for the preparation of 3D hierarchical electrocatalyst (abbreviated as Co@NeHCCs@NG, which represented carbonization products at 900 degrees C) made of nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanocapsules combined with Co nanoparticles bridged N-doped graphene by carbonization of a pristine ZIF-67/GO, enables hierarchical porous structure, high surface area (618.12 m(2) g(-1)) and a hollow capsule-like nanostructure. Of these, the Co@NeHCCs@NG composite displays outstanding electrocatalytic performances for OER (overpotential of 298 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2)) and ORR (0.86 V @ E-1/2) in alkaline electrolyte, which could rival the most of reported materials. The tactics presented in this research may provide a powerful platform to engineer non-precious highly electroactive catalysts with a well-excogitated structure and preferable activity for clean energy conversion technologies.

The prohibitive price and insufficient stability of the state-of-the-art IrO2 electrocatalyst for the OER inhibits its use in practical devices. Here, SrM0.9Ti0.1O3-delta (M = Co, Fe) perovskites with different B-site transition metal elements were investigated as potentially cheaper OER electrocatalysts. They were prepared through a typical sol gel route, and their catalytic activities for the OER in alkaline medium were comparatively studied using rotating disk electrodes. Both materials show high initial intrinsic activities in alkaline electrolyte for the OER, comparable to the benchmark perovskite-type electrocatalyst Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF), but SrCo0.9Ti0.1O3-delta (SCT) possessed more operational stability than SrFe0.9Ti0.1O3-delta (SFT), even better than BSCF and IrO2 catalysts. Based on the X-ray photoelectron spectra analysis of the oxidation states of the surface Co/Fe in both SFT and SCT before and after the OER tests, an explanation for their different operational stabilities was proposed by adopting a reported activity descriptor correlated to the e(g) occupancy of the 3d electron of the surface transition metal cations in the perovskite oxides. The above results indicate that SCT is a promising alternative electrocatalyst for the OER and can be used in electrochemical devices for water oxidation.									104	3	0	0	1	0	104			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000360027100018	26222739

The activity depended on the method of catalyst preparation used. The most efficient method was CVD with high-Fe loading. Results from in situ FT-IR revealed that NO was initially generated on ion-exchanged Fe sites, temporarily adsorbed, and then desorbed. For the most active samples, the result of temperature-programmed desorption of NO2, from which ion-exchanged sites may be estimated, indicated that the amount of NO evolution corresponded to nearly half the amount of exchanged Fe. Assuming that most of the exchange sites in these samples are binuclear structures, it may be postulated that one NO molecule evolves from each binuclear site. From this, we propose that NO2 is decomposed into NO and atomic oxygen at the binuclear Fe sites. The oxygen occupies a bridging vacancy site between Fe atoms. NO evolves and is replaced by follow-on NO2. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									48	4	0	0	5	0	49			0021-9517			WOS:000279969300004

The as-prepared Ag/NCF demonstrated superior catalytic behavior toward ORR and OER. Besides improved cycling stability, a much lower discharge/charge gap of 0.89 V (vs Li/Li+) compared with 1.38 V for NCF cathode with a fixed capacity of 500 mAh g(-1) was obtained in lithium oxygen batteries. The introduction of Ag crystals into NCF facilitates the oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction kinetics. X-ray diffraction analysis coupled with Raman spectroscopy confirmed that Ag/NCF cathode could reversibly catalyze Li2O2 formation and decomposition. The NCF matrix offers a conductive network to realize rapid mass transfer and the encapsulated Ag nanocrystals supplied effective catalytic active sites. The combined action between both contributes to the superior electrocatalytic performance.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10				2575-0356		WOS:000628982800001

In this paper, we report a simple and effective approach to load Ni(OH) (2) electrocatalyst nanosheets on TiO2 surface via electrochemical deposition. The results indicated that deposition of Ni(OH)(2) on TiO2 photoelectrode could remarkably promote the PEC activity by suppressing electron-hole recombination under AM1.5G illumination. The effects of OH-concentration in the electrolyte and coating thickness of Ni(OH)(2) layer were investigated. As a result, we find that electrocatalytic effect of Ni(OH)(2) with appropriate amount increased monotonically in alkaline solution, while excessive Ni(OH)(2) electrocatalyst could reduce the photocatalytic effect by limiting the light absorption. The result demonstrates a new route for improving the performance of photoanode for oxygen evolution reaction.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2053-1591			WOS:000417566100002

The key to achieving this goal is to explore efficient photocatalysts with high productivity. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) polymeric carbon nitride nanosheets were reported as efficient photocatalysts toward various products because of their outstanding properties, such as high specific surface area, more reactive sites, the quantum effect in thickness and unique electronic properties. This minireview attempts to overview recent advances in the preparation, structure and properties of crystalline and amorphous carbon nitride nanosheets, and their applications in photocatalytic hydrogen/oxygen evolution, water splitting and hydrogen peroxide production. We also thoroughly discuss the effect of defects, dopants and composites on the photocatalytic efficiency of these carbon nitride nanosheets. Finally, we outlook the ongoing opportunities and future challenges for 2D carbon nitride nanosheets in the field of photocatalysis.									26	4	0	0	1	0	26			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000528686100001	32291899

In the present study, we doped ruthenium ions into NiFe LDH (Ru-NiFe LDH) to accelerate the OER kinetics. Electrochemical measurements of NiFe LDH and Ru-NiFe LDH at similar mass loadings showed that Ru-NiFe LDH demonstrated a higher OER activity than that of NiFe LDH. Ru-NiFe LDH only requires an overpotential of 246 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media. This attributes to ruthenium doping primarily, which can promote the catalytic activity of Fe sites and boost the electronic interaction among the Ni, Fe, and Ru metals according to the theoretical calculations. Ru-NiFe LDH is stable during OER stability measurements, which was confirmed by structure and elemental analysis. These findings will provide a useful approach for promoting the intrinsic activity of multi-metallic (oxy) hydroxide electrocatalysts toward the OER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000749310700001

This strategy results in a relatively high degree of graphitization for GCMs at 900 degrees C and excellent microsphere structure succeeded from the precursor. The Co nanoparticles were well enwrapped by porous graphited carbon nanofilms which have been grown on the surface of GCMs. Such a unique Co@GCMs hybrid architecture could afford a very high catalytic activity as well as a desirable electrochemical stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Co@GCMs sample sintered at 900 degrees C shows an ideal onset potentials of 1.36 V and a very high catalytic current density of 6.43 A g(-1) at 1.60 V potential, which demonstrates a positive application prospect of this hybrid material.

However, effective, low-cost and durable electrochemical catalysts for the involved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are highly desired. Herein, a new N, B co-doped Co3C multifunctional catalyst with enhanced ORR, OER and HER activities, as well as improved ORR and OER stabilities, in alkaline media has been synthesized. The strategy used, immersing N-doped Co3C in NaBH4 solution, not only achieves N, B co-doping via the N anchoring effect to B at room temperature for the first time, but also engineers the outmost surface of Co3C-N by forming nanosheet arrays. Besides, Co-N-x-B and N-B bonds have been successful produced via the anchoring effect of N during the immersion treatment, which is proved by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results. In particular, both liquid and solid-state Zn-air batteries that are equipped with Co3C-NB as air-cathodes all exhibit superior cycling stabilities over those with Co3C, N-doped Co3C and Pt/C + IrO2 air-cathodes. Furthermore, a Co3C-NB-based full water splitting device can be successfully driven using two solid-state zinc-air batteries with a Co3C-NB air-cathode in series.									55	7	0	0	1	0	55			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000474712700051

The as-prepared Ni-Fe-P/NF shows attractive catalytic performance in alkaline medium with a low overpotential of 156 mV at a 10 mA cm(-2) current density, a Tafel slope of 69 mV dec(-1), and the long-term (> 36 h) durability, which is superior to other well-performed metal-phosphide catalysts reported and the commercial catalyst IrO2. Such remarkable OER catalytic performance can be attributed to the synergism of Ni and Fe elements, the amorphous holey structure, the surface superaerophobicity and self-supportive configuration of the as-prepared Ni-Fe bimetal phosphide.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000464931800066

Herein, a biomimetic leaf-vein-like g-C(3)N(4)as an efficient photocatalyst for H(2)O(2)evolution is reported, which owns tenable band structure, optimized charge transfer, and selective two-electron O(2)reduction. The mechanism for the regulation of band structure and charge transfer is well studied by combining experiments and theoretical calculations. The H(2)O(2)yield of CN4 (287 mu mol h(-1)) is about 3.3 times higher than that of pristine CN (87 mu mol h(-1)), and the apparent quantum yield for H(2)O(2)evolution over CN4 reaches 27.8% at 420 nm, which is much higher than that for many other current photocatalysts. This work not only provides a novel strategy for the design of photocatalyst with excellent H(2)O(2)evolution efficiency, but also promotes deep understanding for the role of defect and doping sites on photocatalytic activity.									127	6	0	0	20	0	126			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000558666200001

However, it is often restricted by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its sluggish kinetics. To overcome the problem, precious metal oxide-based electrocatalysts, such as RuO2 and IrO2, are widely used. The lack of availability and the high cost of precious metals compel researchers to find other resources for the development of cost-effective, environmentally friendly, earth-abundant, nonprecious electrocatalysts for OER Such catalysts should have high OER performance and good stability in comparison to those of available commercial precious metal-based electrocatalysts. Herein, we report an inexpensive fabrication of bimetallic iron nickel nanoparticles on FeNi-foil (FeNi4.34@FeNi-foil) as an integrated OER electrode using a one-step calcination process. FeN4.34@FeNi-foil obtained at 900 degrees C shows superior OER activity in alkaline solution with an overpotential as low as 283 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1). The high performance and durability of the as-prepared nonprecious metal electrode even exceeds those of the available commercial RuO2 and IrO2 catalysts, showing great potential in replacing the expensive noble metal-based electrocatalysts for OER.									88	3	0	0	4	0	88			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000409395500054	28825790

For kinetic determination, the O-2 concentrations were varied between 0 and 9 vol.% for reduction, and between 21 and 1.5 vol.% for oxidation reactions; temperature was varied between 1148 and 1273 K for the reduction and between 1123 and 1273 K for the oxidation. The oxygen carrier showed high reactivity both in oxidation and reduction reactions. The nucleation and nuclei growth model with chemical reaction control properly described the evolution of solids conversion with time. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood model was able to describe the effect of oxygen concentration on reduction and oxidation rates. The reaction order was 0.5 for reduction and 1.2 for the oxidation. The kinetic constant activation energies were 270 kJ mol(-1) for the reduction and 32 kJ moll for the oxidation. The kinetic model was used to calculate the solids inventory needed in the fuel reactor for complete combustion of three different rank coals. It was possible to use a low oxygen carrier inventory in the fuel reactor (160 kg/MWth) to supply the oxygen required to full lignite combustion. However, to reach high CO2 capture efficiencies (>= 95%), oxygen carrier inventories in fuel reactor higher than 600 kg/MWth were needed with the lignite. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Exner, Kai S.								Does a Thermoneutral Electrocatalyst Correspond to the Apex of a Volcano Plot for a Simple Two-Electron Process?								ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION				59	26			10236	10240		10.1002/anie.202003688		MAY 2020		JUN 22 2020	2020	Volcano analyses have been established as a standard tool in the field of electrocatalysis for assessing the performance of electrodes in a class of materials. The apex of the volcano curve, where the most active electrocatalysts are situated, is commonly defined by a hypothetical ideal material that binds its reaction intermediates thermoneutrally at zero overpotential, in accordance with Sabatier's principle. However, recent studies report a right shift of the apex in a volcano curve, in which the most active electrocatalysts bind their reaction intermediates endergonically rather than thermoneutrally at zero overpotential. Focusing on two-electron process, this Viewpoint addresses the question of how the definition of an optimum catalyst needs to be modified with respect to the requirements of Sabatier's principle when kinetic effects and the applied overpotential are included in the analysis.									55	1	0	0	1	0	55			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000530661700001	32182397

Herein, we report the preparation of a Pt-partially coated PtNiFe nanoalloy electrocatalyst that shows excellent activity for the ORR and OER. For the ORR, the onset potential is +1.02 V, the half-wave potential is +0.95 V, and the mass activity is 0.91 A mg(Pt)(-1), 13 times that of commercial Pt/C. For the OER, the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) is as low as 308 mV. All of this results in a very low ORR-OER overpotential gap of 588 mV, outperforming previously reported bifunctional catalysts in alkaline media. The remarkable bifunctional catalytic performance can be attributed to the co-existence of energy-optimized and synergistic ORR and OER active surfaces on nanoalloys caused by the Pt partially coated core-shell structure, as indicated by density functional theory calculations. This work will promote the development of platinum-based bifunctional electrocatalysts for practical applications in renewable energy storage and conversion.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000674280900001

To achieve improved catalytic activity, the few-layered oxygen-incorporated MoS2 ultrathin nanosheets are prepared for the construction of hybrid nanosheets with graphene substrates using one-pot hydrothermal method for the first time. XRD, Raman, SEM, TEM, EDS and TGA techniques are used to characterize the hybrids. The moderate oxygen-incorporation into MoS2 creates abundant edge sites and improves the conductivity. The tight coupling between the hybrid nanosheets expedites the electrical transfer. Endowed with the above advantages, the hybrid nanosheets are ideal electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and exhibit high activity, which is demonstrated by the ultralow onset overpotential (120 mV), large cathodic current density (65.5 mA cm(-2) at eta = 300 mV), and small Tafel slope (51 mV decade(-1)), as well as superior cycling stability. Our enhanced understanding of this highly active MoS2 hybrid catalyst for HER may facilitate the development of economical electrochemical hydrogen production systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Indeed, alloying Pt or Ir with a single metal can modulate the d-band center of the metal for better catalytic performance. However, such a strategy usually leads to single-functional high-performance nanocatalysts. Herein, we report a new class of Pt-rich PtCo/Ir-rich IrCo trimetallic fishbone-like nanowires (PtCo/Ir FBNWs) with tailored surface/interface structure for achieving remarkable trifunctional catalytic properties effectively tuned by d-band pinning and offsetting with morphological and compositional controls. Through such a metallic hetero-d-band-junction mechanism, the optimal multifunctional performance has been robustly pinned via precise ternary alloying ratios. Particularly, as-made Pt62Co23/Ir(1)(5 )FBNWs exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic activities for HER and OER in both acidic and alkaline solutions, exceeding that of commercial Pt/C or Ir/C, respectively. The overall water-splitting devices driven by Pt62Co23/Ir(1)(5 )FBNWs are applicable in a wide pH medium, which has achieved the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the acid electrolyte at a low potential of 1.53 V, 23.3 times higher than that of Pt/C-Ir/C. Notably, the ORR performance of Pt62Co23/Ir-15 FBNWs also maintains a higher level than Pt/C, which makes FBNWs usable in high-performance zinc-air batteries to drive the water-splitting in a self-powered manner. Theoretical calculations reveal that their superior multifunctional catalytic activities can be attributed to the unique morphologically induced interfacial stress, which can facilitate an effective combination of d-band pinning and offsetting for dynamic self-activations among HER, OER, and ORR catalysis.									38	1	0	0	2	0	38			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000489678800036

However, the design and demonstration of efficient and strongly coupled interfaces remains a bottleneck in the progress of efficient and durable OER catalysts. Herein, we designedly anchored RuSe2 nanoparticles to CoSe2 nanosheet arrays support on nickel foam (NF) to fabricate a RuSe2-CoSe2 nanosheet arrays with robust structure and strong electron coupling. Co-MOF was used as a template to conduce Ru ion exchange and then the precursor was selenized at low temperature to obtain RuSe2 modified CoSe2 nanosheet arrays. Thanks to the strong electron coupling between Ru with Co and the unique nanoarray structure, RuSe2-CoSe2 exhibits excellent OER performance with ultra-low overpotential of 200 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the performance did not degrade significantly during 100 h of continuous operation. Furthermore, the assembled RuSe2-CoSe2 (+)//Pt/C (-) can reach 50 mA cm(-2) in a two-electrode system with a low battery voltage of 1.61 V, which is superior to the commercial RuO2 (+)//Pt/C (-) (1.79 V) electrode. This work provides an effective avenue for the design of highly active and durable electrocatalysts. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we report heterostructural Ni3S2-Fe(5)Ni(4)S(8)hybrids directly grown on redox-NiFe foams (denoted as NFS/rNF) as excellent pre-catalysts for OER in 1 M KOH media. The electrochemical performance can be tuned by amount of sulfur source, and the optimized electrode only needs low overpotentials of 199 mV and 240 mV to attain 10 mA cm(-2)and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, the overpotential is further reduced to 231 mV to deliver 100 mA cm(-2)after multi-cyclic voltammogram scans, due to the exposure of abundant in situ generated Ni(Fe)OOH species. Excellent stability with continuous 40 h operation is also demonstrated. Our study provides a new strategy for direct synthesis of self-standing integrated hybrid electrodes for efficient and durable water oxidation.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000563608200010

The rational design of a catalyst by constructing heterostructures and a doping element are possibly expected to achieve it. Herein, the utilization of flower-like Fe/C-doped-MoS2/Ni3S2-450 spherical structural materials for electrocatalytic HER and OER is introduced in this study. The carboxyferrocene-incorporated molybdenum sulfide/nickel sulfide (MoySx/NiS) nanostructures were prepared by solvothermal method. After annealing, the iron and carbon elements derived from ferrocenecarboxylic acid enhanced the electrical transport performance and provided rich electronic sites for HER and OER in alkaline media. Specifically, the optimized flower-like Fe/C-doped-MoS2/Ni3S2-450 exhibited efficient bifunctional performance in alkaline electrolyte, with low overpotentials of 188 and 270 mV required to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively.

Nevertheless, the OVs-induced evolution of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) and associated mechanisms in the Fenton-like process remain insufficient. Herein, a series of oxygen-defective AgFe1-xNixO2 were synthesized to enhance peroxymonosulfate (PMS) decomposition and efficient degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) in water. The total amounts of OVs were regulated by varying the ratio of Ni dopant. Compared with original AgFeO2, the AgFe1-xNixO2 with rich OVs exhibited a better redox potential for PMS interaction and a lower reaction energy barrier of PMS decomposition. Superoxide radical (O-2(center dot-)) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) worked as the dominant ROSs during the oxidation, rather than traditional sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) or hydroxyl radical (% OH). Notably, in situ electron spin resonance witnessed the evolution of growing O-2(center dot-) and O-1(2), as well as lessened SO4 center dot- and %OH with increasing OVs content. It was mainly attributed to the preferential dissociation of PMS into O-2 on the OVs, additionally, OVs facilitated the superior surface oxygen mobility and electrical conductivity, which also gave rise to a significant enhancement in O-2(center dot-) and O-1(2) generation. Consequently, an OVsdependent PMS activation mechanism was proposed.									55	0	0	0	25	0	55			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000545646800069

Herein, we report a new 3D hierarchical sulfur and nitrogen co-doped carbon nanocages (hSNCNC) as a promising bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst by an in-situ MgO template method with pyridine and thiophene as the mixed precursor. The as-prepared hSNCNC exhibits a positive half-wave potential of 0.792 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) for ORR, and a low operating potential of 1.640 V at a 10 mA cm(-2) current density for OER. The reversible oxygen electrode index is 0.847 V, far superior to commercial Pt/C and IrO2, which reaches the top level of the reported bifunctional catalysts. Consequently, the hSNCNC as air cathodes in an assembled Zn-air battery features low charge/discharge overpotential and long lifetime. The remarkable properties arises from the introduced multiple heteroatom dopants and stable 3D hierarchical structure with multi-scale pores, which provides the abundant uniform high-active S and N species and efficient charge transfer as well as mass transportation. These results demonstrate the potential strategy in developing suitable carbon-based bi-/multi-functional catalysts to enable the next generation of the rechargeable metal-air batteries.

Oxygen can also produce toxic molecules, reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS is a collective term that includes both oxygen radicals and certain oxidizing agents that are easily converted into radicals. They can be produced from both endogenous and exogenous substances. ROS play a dual role in biological systems, since they can be either harmful or beneficial to living systems. They can be considered a double-edged sword because on the one hand oxygen-dependent reactions and aerobic respiration have significant advantages but, on the other, overproduction of ROS has the potential to cause damage.

Therefore, exploring an efficient way to improve the activity of Cu-based electrocatalysts is very important for their practical application. Modifying electronic structure of the electrocatalytically active center of electrocatalysts by metal doping to favor the electron transfer between catalyst active sites and electrode is an important approach to optimize hydrogen and oxygen species adsorption energy, thus leading to the enhanced intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. Herein, Co-doped Cu7S4 nanodisks were synthesized and investigated as highly efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the optimized electronic structure of the active center. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Co-engineered Cu7S4 could accelerate electron transfer between Co and Cu sites, thus decrease the energy barriers of intermediates and products during OER, which are crucial for enhanced catalytic properties. As expected, Co-engineered Cu7S4 nanodisks exhibit a low overpotential of 270 mV to achieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2) as well as decreased Tafel slope and enhanced turnover frequencies as compared to bare Cu7S4.

Although incredible efforts have been made to develop efficient catalysts for OER and HER, great challenges still remain in the development of bifunctional catalysts. Here, we report a novel hybrid of Co3O4 embedded in tubular nanostructures of graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) and synthesized through a facile, large-scale chemical method at low temperature. Strong synergistic effects between Co3O4 and GCN resulted in excellent performance as a bifunctional catalyst for OER and HER. The high surface area, unique tubular nanostructure, and composition of the hybrid made all redox sites easily available for catalysis and provided faster ionic and electronic conduction. The Co3O4@GCN tubular nanostructured (TNS) hybrid exhibited the lowest overpotential (0.12 V) and excellent current density (147 mA/cm(2)) in OER, better than benchmarks IrO2 and RuO2, and with superior durability in alkaline media. Furthermore, the Co3O4@GCN TNS hybrid demonstrated excellent performance in HER, with a much lower onset and overpotential, and a stable current density. It is expected that the Co3O4@GCN TNS hybrid developed in this study will be an attractive alternative to noble metals catalysts in large scale water splitting and fuel cells.									89	9	0	0	4	0	89			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000364576400029

Systematic studies linking material properties to catalytic activity are lacking, in part due to the heterogeneous nature of powder-based electrodes. We demonstrate, for the first time, that epitaxial strain can tune the activity of oxygen electrocatalysis in alkaline solutions, focusing on the model chemistry of LaCoO3, where moderate tensile strain can further induce changes in the electronic structure leading to increased activity. The resultant decrease in charge transfer resistance to the electrolyte reduces the overpotential in the ORR more notably than the OER and suggests a different dependence of the respective rate-limiting steps on electron transfer. This provides new insight into the reaction mechanism applicable to a range of perovskite chemistries, key to the rational design of highly active catalysts.									124	6	0	0	10	0	126			1948-7185			WOS:000349137400031	26261968

However, the exorbitant over voltage mainly caused by sluggish Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) and Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) impedes the extraction of full potential of Li/air system. Essentially Li/air system needs bifunctional catalyst to enhance the rate of both OER and ORR. The formation of insoluble discharge product, oxides of Li and decomposition of non-aqueous electrolytes complicate the mechanism of ORR/OER and hence finding an effective catalyst for non-aqueous Li/air system is a challenging task. Even the catalytic activity of well-known catalysts for ORR/OER of aqueous system could not be translated to non-aqueous Li/air system. Different kind of materials like noble metals, non-noble metals and their oxides as well as carbon based materials have been investigated for their bifunctional catalytic activity in non-aqueous Li/air system. In this context, this paper presents the overview of advancement in bifunctional low-cost non-noble transition metal oxides based catalysts for non-aqueous Li/air battery.									33	1	0	0	0	0	33			0167-2738	1872-7689		WOS:000428101100014

Herein, we report a new amorphous Co(0.63)Fe(0.21)P(0.1)6 OER catalyst, which was prepared through a one-step solvothermal process. This catalyst exhibits extraordinary OER catalytic activity in alkaline media and is superior to the state of the art IrO2 in 1.0 M KOH, capable of yielding a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of only 217 mV. This newly achieved high activity outperforms most reported transition metal phosphide catalysts. During the OER, the surface layers of the Co0.63Fe0.21P0.16 nanospheres (200-500 nm) are oxidized, which show the typical Tafel slope of oxides around 40 mV dec(-1). The in situ formation of surface Co oxides in the catalysts during the OER along with an optimal doping of Fe are found to be crucial for their remarkable activity. In particular, the metal-rich amorphous phosphide cores, i.e., substrates, probably contribute to OER performance of the catalysts due to their high electrical conductivity. This new type of surface oxidized amorphous transition metal phosphide would provide a new pathway for the design of high-performance OER electrocatalysts.									77	7	0	0	3	0	81			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000417953100027

Earth-abundant transition metal oxide like materials are synthesized and extensively studied in research laboratories to replace expensive IrO2 and RuO2 anodes for the oxygen evolution half reaction. However, pristine materials mined from the earth's crust are yet to be explored for such an application. Here the electrocatalytic activity of iron ore is investigated and a novel approach is reported to significantly improve its catalytic properties via formation of a nickel hydroxide layer on the surface. This electrocatalyst achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 280 mV and maintains its activity for extended periods of electrolysis under alkaline conditions. This simple process to convert an abundant commodity into a value-added product should be of considerable interest.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2366-7486			WOS:000438709500001

Herein, we developed iron-doped (Fe-doped) NiCoO2 nanoplates with NaCl-type structure as an efficient electrocatalyst to speed up OER. NiCoO2 nanoplates doping with different concentration of Fe were optimized. Specifically, the catalytic properties of 10 mol% Fe-doped NiCoO2 (denoted as FNC0.1) showed outstanding OER catalytic activity, with an overpotential of 302 mV and a low Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH. More importantly, the activity of FNC0.1 was only about 3% loss after 10 h of stability measurements at 1.53 V vs. RHE. The dramatically enhanced OER performance of the FNC0.1 might derive from the synergistic interplay of Co, Ni and Fe, a certain level of amorphization and easily hydroxylation after doping Fe. This work demonstrated that doping Fe would be beneficial to improve the OER activities and the stabilities of the catalysts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, earth-abundant NiMoFe (NMF) and phosphorized NiMoFeP (NMFP) are synthesized as complementary overall water splitting (OWS) catalysts. First, NMF is tested as both the HER and OER promoter, which exhibits low overpotentials of 68 (HER) and 337 mV (OER). A quaternary NMFP is then prepared by simple phosphorization of NMF, which shows a much lower OER overpotential of 286 mV. The enhanced OER activity is attributed to the unique surface/core structure of NMFP. The surface phosphate acts as a proton transport mediator and expedites the rate-determining step. With the application of OER potential, the NMFP surface is composed of Ni(OH)(2) and FeOOH, active sites for OER, but the inner core consists of Ni, Mo, and Fe metals, serving as a conductive electron pathway. OWS with NMF-NMFP requires an applied voltage of 1.452 V to generate 10 mA cm(-2), which is one of the lowest values among OWS results with transition-metal-based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the catalysts are combined with tandem perovskite solar cells for photovoltaic (PV)-electrolysis, producing a high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 12.3%.									29	3	0	0	3	0	30			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000493821800001	31682059

In this respect, a series of bimetallic ZnO-Ni(OH)2 composite materials were prepared as electrode materials for OER. The synthetic procedure followed the polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and dopamine (DA) assisted hydrothermal process. The growth modification ability of PVP and adhesive property of polydopamine (from DA) were utilized to attain the 3D interconnected structures. The precursor concentrations were varied to obtain most efficient catalyst, ZNDP-1. In alkaline medium, ZNDP-1 showed a low over potential of 170 mV (@10 mAcm- 2 current density) and a Tafel slope of 61 mV dec- 1 with significant stability. The surface defects, porosity and synergism within metal centers might cause efficient electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, DFT studies were performed to understand the mechanistic pathway.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000663739300001

However, it is still challenging to develop an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst that can be coupled with light due to inefficient light utilization. Here, we demonstrate that N, Fe-co-doped CoS2 (N, Fe-CoS2) nanorod arrays can act as a highly efficient photo-coupled electrochemical OER catalyst. In dark conditions, the N, Fe-doped CoS2 on self-supported stainless steel (SS) mesh shows a small OER overpotential (215 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a reduced Tafel slope (43.2 mV dec(-1)), and negligible activity decay after 10 000 cycles. Upon visible-NIR light illumination, the N, Fe-doped anode exhibits superior photoelectrochemical performance because of the enhanced photoresponse, excellent light harvesting ability and promoted interfacial kinetics of charge separation. Our well-designed photoelectrochemical OER electrode can not only serve as a light absorption semiconductor but also the active catalytic sites for the OER reaction; the electrode composed of the single phase can efficiently avoid photocarrier recombination at the grain boundary. This study provides an insight into photoanode synthesis for photoelectrochemical OER and offers guidance on the future electrocatalyst design.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000500415700041	31682105

In this communication, we developed a high-performance cobalt-borate nanowire array on a Ti mesh (Co-Bi NA/Ti) from a CoSe2 nanowire array via rapid topotactic conversion. As a three-dimensional water oxidation electrode, such Co-Bi NA/Ti, demands only 420 mV to drive a geometrical catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2). It exhibits superior activity when compared to most of the reported non-precious metal catalysts working under benign conditions. In addition, Co-Bi NA/Ti also displays good stability and high turnover frequency (0.59 s(-1) at an overpotential of 600 mV) in 0.1 M potassium borate (pH: 9.2).

The introduction of Ru not only significantly enhances the electron transport property of the catalyst, but also contributes to platelet-like morphology which causes a large number of step and dislocation defects on the catalyst surface in addition, electrochemical tests reveal that both Ru and Ni2P are effective active components for electrocatalysis. These factors jointly enhance the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances of the Ru-doped Ni2P catalyst. For HER, the Ru-doped Ni2P catalyst shows superior onset potential (35 mV), Tafel slope (34 mV.dec(-1)) and long-term cycling stability (3 000 cycles), superior than that of the individual Ni2P, Ru and close to the commercial 20%Pt/C catalyst. For OER, the Ru-doped Ni2P catalyst displays a small onset potential of 1.54 V and overpotential (eta(10)) of 0.49 V, superior to the Ni2P, Ru, 20%Pt/C, and close to the commercial IrO2 catalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1001-4861			WOS:000539209800010

For a uniform coating of CoOx layers along the carbon fiber paper, the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique was applied. We achieved a uniform and conformal coating of atomic-layer deposited CoOx (ALD-CoOx) on the carbon fiber paper. The overpotential for oxygen evolution measured for the optimized ALD-coated carbon fiber paper was as low as 343 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is competitive with the activity of state-of-the-art CoOx prepared on electrodes with large surface areas. Oxygen evolution is not enhanced after a critical thickness, about 28 nm in our study, is reached. The optimal thickness of the ALD-CoOx film is dependent on two competing effects: the high oxidation state of cobalt ions in thicker CoOx helps the oxygen evolution, whereas the introduction of a thick oxide coating decelerates the rate of charge transfer at the surface.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000462260000018	30799602

Characterization is done using XRD, TEM and BET surface area analysis. XRD shows pure nano-crystalline phase of Co3O4. Crystallinity of as prepared material improves by calcining the compound at 900 degrees C for 10 h while no effect is seen at 600 degrees C. TEM studies show that particles of around 50 nm size are formed at 400 degrees C. At 600 degrees C a well-defined hexagonal morphology could be seen both by TEM and SEM and the particle size is around 70 nm. However, TEM of the sample at 900 degrees C shows big agglomerates of cobalt oxide and no specific geometry could be obtained. Estimated-BET surface area for the sample calcined at 600 degrees C is 10 m(2)/g. Detailed electrochemical studies are carried out in neutral and basic electrolytes where Ag/AgCl is used as the reference electrode. It is found that Co3O4 is active for oxygen evolution reaction in basic medium as well as in neutral medium. KOH is used as the basic medium while KNO3, K2SO4 and phosphate buffer is used for neutral medium. However, it is not active for hydrogen evolution reaction in any of the medium even at -1.0 V. This is confirmed by gas analysis of the output gas in the cell by using a mass spectrometer. When compared with the buffer medium, it is observed that local pH changes in KNO3 and K2SO4 medium are possibly affecting the oxygen evolution reaction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

By removing O-2 in electrolyte, a dramatic decrease in Tafel slope of over 20% and early onset potential of 1.344 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode are achieved. Our studies reveal that O-2 reduces hydroxyl ion density at catalyst interface, resulting in poor kinetics and negative catalytic performance. The obtained in-depth understanding could provide valuable clues for catalysis system design. Our method could also be useful to analyze other catalytic processes.									36	4	0	0	0	0	38			2041-1723			WOS:000411416100005	28935942

Herein, we developed disordered sandwich-like multi-layer structure with abundant oxygen vacancies as a highly excellent electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which was derived from amorphous Ni40Fe40B20 ribbons precursors through in situ hydroxylation and electro-oxidation in alkaline solution. The as-fabricated product shows the low overpotential of 249 mV and 338 mV at a current of 10 mA?cm?2 and 250 mA?cm?2with a Tafel slope of 43 mV?dec?1, respectively. This excellent catalytic performance is attributed to the synergistic effect resulted from the hybrid composition of disordered ?-Ni(OH)2 and ?-FeOOH, excellent electron/mass transfer due to the presence of abundant oxygen vacancies and expandable actual surface area. Moreover, the catalysts after structural reconstruction still maintain good flexibility, which is good for industrial applications. This work may provide insight into the combination of disordered structure and oxygen vacancies through in situ grown on amorphous alloys and make them as promising industrial OER electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000639352200001

However, the limitations of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and electrical conductivity significantly lower the OWS activity compared to noble metal catalysts. To overcome this problem, V-doping of 2D Ni(Co,Fe) phosphide was performed to increase the electrical conductivity and catalytic activity by tuning the electron density of the active sites. The synthesized NiCoVP had a low Tafel slope of 30 mV dec(-1) and a reduced overpotential of 42 mV compared to NiCoP (75 mV), which has high stability as an alkaline HER catalyst, yielding 10 mA cm(-2). The charge transfer resistance also decreased from 8.8 omega (NiCoP) to 7.1 omega (NiCoVP). As an alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, NiFeVP showed a low overpotential of 234 mV to generate 10 mA cm(-2) compared to NiFeP (249 mV) with a Tafel slope of 34.4 mV dec(-1). V doping reduced the charge transfer resistance from 3.6 omega (NiFeP) to 1.2 omega (NiFeVP). The OWS system combining NiCoVP-NiFeVP required 1.50 V for 10 mA cm(-2), which is the lowest among the transition metal-based phosphide catalysts reported so far. This marked improvement in alkaline OWS activity through V doping was also proven by the density functional theory (DFT) calculation results of high affinity to *OH, which enhances water dissociation for the HER and strong metal-O covalence bonds for the OER.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000649682400001

ZnCoV-LDH nanosheet was prepared by a fast and simple electrodeposition method. Compared to the bare BiVO4, the composite photoanode showed a 370-mV cathodic shift in onset potential and an enhancement in photocurrent density by a factor of around 4, which delivering 2.7 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode. In addition, the modified electrode was of greater steadiness for water oxidation. It is postulated that the enhanced PEC performance results from the efficient utilization of photogenerated holes in water oxidation due to the improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics in the presence of the ZnCoV-LDH cocatalyst. More importantly, the role of each component in the electrocatalyst was also explored, in which Co species provide active sites to capture photogenerated holes for the water oxidation reaction while Zn species serve as structural support. It was found that the introduction of strongly electron-withdrawing V5+ can not only facilitate the in-situ formation of highly active Co3+ species for the OER, but can also adjust the electronic conductivity, thereby leading to the improved intrinsic activity and accelerated OER reaction kinetics. This work provides not only a demonstration of a novel and promising co-catalyst for PEC water splitting, but also a facile method for the rational design other hydroxide-based materials.

However, the deliberate control over rich-phase boundaries in a simple and effective manner is still challenging. Herein, an effective bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst of mesoporous CoS/CoO heterojunction nanorods (CoS/CoO PNRs) is constructed through two-step topological transformations of Co(CO3)(0.5)OH center dot 0.11H(2)O nanorods induced by unique citrulline molecule. The designed CoS/CoO PNRs present multiple advantages of mesoporous rod-like architecture, abundant heterointerfaces, increased oxygen vacancies, as well as dual-phase synergy, which trigger outstanding electrocatalytic performance towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with low overpotential (265 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), low activation energy (E-a = 36.14 kJ mol(-1)) and robust long-term stability. The CoS/CoO PNRs is also demonstrated to be highly active for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a positive half-wave potential (0.84 V), making the CoS/CoO PNRs a potential bifunctional oxygen catalyst. As an air-cathode, the CoS/CoO PNRs can enable the solid-state Zn-air battery to achieve a large power density, a fast dynamic response, and long cycle life, outperforming that assembled with commercial Pt/C + RuO2. Theoretical calculations finally unveil that the interfacial electron transfer from CoS to CoO modulates the electronic structure of CoS/CoO, and subsequently adjusts the binding strength of the intermediates in the OER and ORR. This work opens up a new design strategy for the synthesis of high-efficiency oxygen electrocatalysts to be applied in energy-related electrochemical devices.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000799077600003

Optimisation of layer thickness is aiming on diminishing limitations by the electronic conductivity within the photoabsorber, thus increasing the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the samples. Furthermore, the Mo to V ratio leading to the highest photocurrent density was determined, and the optimised Mo : BiVO4 samples were decorated with a variety of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts such as cobalt phosphate and layered double hydroxides. A mass loading gradient of Ni-Fe LDH was sprayed on top of the Mo : BiVO4 photoanode for optimisation of the OER catalyst loading. The photocurrent density was enhanced by up to 5.8 times at 0.8 V vs. RHE in comparison with the pristine Mo : BiVO4 sample in absence of any OER electrocatalyst.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000497223500001

In this work, imidazolate-induced production of cobalt layered double hydroxide (Co-LDH) electrocatalysts with different assembled structures is presented. Porous Co-LDHs exhibit a remarkable OER catalytic performance with a low overpotential of eta(10) = 312mV, while cage-like Co-LDHs prepared by the transformation of ZIF-67 show a slightly inferior performance. Such a phenomenon is attributed to the assembled structure difference, giving rise to a difference in electron transfer and mass transport as well as the number of accessible active sites. After disassembly, these disperse Co-LDH sheets give a similar catalytic performance (eta(10): 288-290 mV) due to bearing similar components. Importantly, the reversible/cycling transformation between Co-LDHs and ZIF-67 provides an effective method to radically reduce pollutant release and resource consumption, from the point of view of material synthesis.									36	1	0	0	1	0	36			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000428848400008

Three types of carbon support as Vulcan carbon, reduced graphite oxide (RGO) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MCNTs) were used to study the influence on electrochemical reactions. Spherical shaped Co3O4 nanoparticles with 8-10 nm was found uniformly distributed on Ppy/C composite, which were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy techniques. Amongst, Co3O4/Ppy/MWCNT shows improved bifunctional electrocatalytic activity towards both OER and HER with relatively low over potential (340 mV vs. 490 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (87 vs. 110 mV dec(-1)). In addition to that, MWCNT supported Co3O4/Ppy nanocomposite exhibits good electronic conductivity and electrochemical stability up to 2000 potential cycles. The results clearly indicate that the Co3O4/Ppy/MWCNT nanocomposite could be the promising bi-functional electrocatalyst for efficient water electrolysis. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In addition, the S element is doped into the PANI by forming C-S covalent bond. Thus, the prepared FeS2/PANI/EG film shows excellent catalytic activity with the potential of 1.49 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH solution, comparing with the 1.59 V and 1.65 V for FeS2/EG and PANI/EG, respectively.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000510846500087

Depending on demand, the VRFB can be conventionally discharged or supply H-2 by using the catalytic reactor. However, during hydrogen generation, protons are consumed and a state-of-charge imbalance is created. Therefore, the corresponding discharge of the positive compartment is necessary to maintain proton and charge balance. Water oxidation is a suitable reaction providing regeneration of the positive electrolyte (reduction of VO2+ to VO2+) and also protons. VO2+/VO2+ does not possess a potential high enough to spontaneously drive the oxygen evolution reaction thus an additional energy input is required. We introduce the V-O-2 cell, a secondary flow cell to integrate into the "dual-circuit redox flow battery" that provides a high rate of conversion while minimizing the energy required. This was tested in a complete dual-circuit system and required 140 mW cm(-2) of additional energy at 110 mA cm(-2). The total efficiency of the coupled system in term of electricity to hydrogen was between 42 and 62% depending on the current density and stable operation was demonstrated during extended tests.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000494891700014

Here, we rationally optimized an interface material of ceria nanoparticles and nickel hydroxide by adsorbing ethylene glycol (EG-Ni(OH)(2)@CeO2), which produced ultrasmall nanosheets uniformly attached onto carbon cloth substrate. According to the characterization and density functional theory (DFT), the ethylene glycol-induced nickel-cerium interface had strong electron interaction, generating numerous of Ni(3-\gd)+ active sites, reducing the energy reaction barrier, and promoting the electron-transport kinetics in the catalytic system. EG-Ni(OH)(2)@CeO2 showed excellent OER performance, with a low overpotential (335 mV) at 50 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope (67.4 mV dec(-1)). And the EG-Ni(OH)(2)@CeO2 also maintained stable for up to 60 h at 10, 20, and 30 mA cm(-2).

However, to meet the ever-increasing global energy demand, it is imperative to develop high-performance non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as the OER is considered the bottleneck for electrocatalytic water splitting. Spinels, in particular, are considered promising OER electrocatalysts due to their unique properties, precise structures, and compositions. Herein, the recent progress on the application of bimetallic-based spinels (AFe(2)O(4), ACo(2)O(4), and AMn(2)O(4); where A = Ni, Co, Cu, Mn, and Zn) as electrocatalysts for the OER is presented.

Herein, ultrafine Fe3O4 nanoparticles (diameter: 6 +/- 2 nm) are homogeneously immobilized on 2D Ni based MOFs (Ni-BDC, thickness: 5 +/- 1 nm) to improve the OER stability. Electronic structure modulation for enhanced catalytic activity is studied via adjusting the amount of Fe3O4 nanoparticles on Ni-BDC. The optimal Fe3O4/Ni-BDC achieves the best OER performance with an overpotential of 295 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 47.8 mV dec(-1) anda considerable catalytic durability of more than 40 h (less than 5 h for Ni-BDC alone). DFT calculations confirm that the active sites for Fe3O4/Ni-BDC are mainly contributed by Fe species with a higher oxidation state, and the potential-determining step (PDS) is the formation of the adsorbed O* species, which are facilitated in the composite.

The procedure consists in direct electrodeposition, in a free-nitrate bath, of CoFe alloy films covered with layered double hydroxides (LDH), by potentiostatic mode, in continuous or pulsed regime. The catalyst is directly formed on glassy carbon substrates. The best-prepared catalyst material reveals a mixed morphology with granular and dendritic CoFe alloy covered with a sponge of CoFe-LDH containing a Cl interlayer. An overpotential of eta 10 mA = 286 mV, with a Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1), is obtained for the OER which displays the enhanced properties of the catalyst. These improved results demonstrate the competitiveness and efficacy of our proposal for the production of OER catalysts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here, the significant enhancement of OER activity and long-term stability of electrodeposited FeOOH on zeolitic imidazolate framework-derived N-doped porous carbons (NPCs) are reported. In alkaline media, FeOOH/NPC supported on nickel foam as a 3D electrode delivers a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 230 mV and exhibits a low Tafel slope of 33.8 mV dec(-1) as well as excellent durability, making it one of the most active OER catalysts. Such high performance is attributed to a combined effect of the excellent electron conductivity of NPC and the synergy between FeOOH and NiO derived from Ni substrate.									73	2	0	0	4	0	73			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000429535300021

Hollow multi-shell nanomaterials with large specific surface area and abundant active sites have become high energy conversion catalytic materials. The first prepared the transition metal chalcogenides of the nano-structure of the hollow core-shell and then grew the zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-67 in situ on the nanoparticles of core-shell. Then, through pyrolysis to obtain multilayer core-shell particles with porous outer shell of Co/N-doped carbon skeleton. WS2@Co9S8-2@N/C is applied in dye-sensitized solar cells as counter electrode material, showing good catalytic performance for I-/I-3(-) redox reaction, and the power conversion efficiency is as high as 9.85%. As the electrode material of oxygen reduction reaction, the half-wave potential can reach E-1/2 = 0.855 V. For oxygen evolution reaction tests, there is a low overvoltage of 1.757 V when the current density is 10 mV cm(-1). In addition, the MOF can be grown in situ in different nanostructures, which can gain its advantages as a multifunctional material in terms of structure and multi-element, and this method can be applied to the fabricate of composite materials with different structures.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000767744200001

However, its photocatalytic activity still needs to be further improved. Herein, an in-situ photoreduction route was employed to anchor PtOx onto the surface of Cr2Bi3O11 for improved carrier transport and enhanced photocatalytic activity. The high crystallinity and uniform crystal structure of the Cr2Bi3O11 nanorods matrix were beneficial to evenly deposit the PtOx nanodots (diameter: 0.5 nm-2.0 nm). The optimal PtOx modified Cr2Bi3O11 (1.0Pt-Cr2Bi3O11) exhibited higher photocatalytic activity in organic pollutants (i.e. phenol, chlomphenol and tetracycline) removal than other noble metals (Ag, Au, and Pd) modified Cr2Bi3O11. Besides, 1.0Pt-Cr2Bi3O11 also exhibited enhanced activity in oxygen evolution (210.5 mu L/g(cat)/h, 4.3 times higher than pristine Cr2Bi3O11). The PtOx can effectively capture the photogenerated electrons, hence repressing electron/hole recombination and providing active sites for charge-transfer reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000830057000004

For evaluating their electrocatalytic behavior the determination of the onset potential in each studied electrolyte is a key parameter. Nevertheless, this evaluation becomes particularly problematic for first transition metal catalysts as well as by the use of electroactive collectors (e.g. Ni foams) whose redox peaks overlap the onset potential. A usual solution to detect the onset potential requires the availability of in-situ mass spectrometric determination of the generated oxygen. In this work, we present fast and easier available cyclic voltammetry and coulovoltammetric responses to determine the onset potentials of three benchmark electrocatalysts: a layered double hydroxide, a Prussian blue analogue and a beta-Layered hydroxide. Cyclic coulovoltammetric responses allow, as we demonstrate here, a quantitative separation in the same potential range of the charge consumed by reversible (redox) reactions and the charge consumed by the irreversible reaction: the oxygen release. Quantifying the irreversible charges (that correspond to the OER) for different anodic potential limits permits the unambiguous determination of both, the onset potential and the Tafel slope values without the catalyst redox contributions. As far as we know, this is the first time that this fast, available and cheap methodology has been applied for the OER determination. Thus, coulovoltammetry arises as a friendly and powerful tool for the investigation of electrocatalytic performances. (C) 2021 The Authors.

However, it is necessary to design efficient and durable electrocatalysts, especially the durability, for bifunctional oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). Therefore, it is imperative to developing reliable zinc-air batteries with long-lasting cycle lifetime. Herein, we report long-range interconnected nanoporous Co/Ni/C composites in mu m-length scale as highly active and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts for long-life rechargeable zinc-air batteries. The composite catalysts consist of N and S co-doped hollow carbon and carbon-encapsulated CoNi alloy nanoparticles, which serve as catalytically active sites for the ORR/OER. Meanwhile, the long-range interconnected nanoporous carbon structure in mu m-length scale favors fast ion and electron transfer during the reactions, and can prevent the catalyst deterioration against nanoparticles collapse and agglomerate into large ones during the long-term battery operation. As a result, compared to the commercial precious metal-based catalysts, the Co/Ni/C composite catalysts exhibit a significantly improved stability towards the ORR/OER with small activity decay after 100 h/10 h of operation under chronoamperometric polarization. Especially, the resulting zinc-air battery demonstrates remarkable cycling stability exceeding 620 h and 430 h at 5 and 10 mA cm(-2), respective.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000798175000004

A solar fuels device couples a solar photoabsorber with catalysts to convert solar energy to chemical energy via reactions such as oxygen evolution (water splitting). Widespread deployment of this technology hinges upon discovery of new materials through efforts such as the high throughput screening of oxygen evolution catalysts, as discussed in this manuscript. We derive an expression for the efficiency of the oxygen evolution catalyst that combines catalytic and optical properties. Using this hybrid efficiency, we screen 5456 samples in a (Fe-Co-Ni-Ti)O-x pseudo-quaternary catalyst library using automated, high throughput electrochemistry and optical experiments. The observed compositional trends in this catalyst efficiency lead to the discovery of a new high performance composition region.

It is appealing but still challenging to find or design an appropriate catalyst which is inexpensive and efficient for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the same electrolyte. In this work, we develop a facile synthesis of amorphous defectrich CoMoS4 via a one-step hydrothermal method, and under alkaline conditions; the CoMoS4 electrode can generate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotentials of 143 mV for HER and 342 mV for OER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. A cell voltage of 1.72 V is required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with long-term stability in an electrolyzer using the CoMoS4/CC electrode as both the anode and cathode.									73	2	0	0	0	0	73			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000387859800008	27824197

Overall, this article shows how the orbital physics of magnetic compositions relates with spin lattice interactions and then band gaps and bond lengths together become relevant descriptors in catalytic oxygen technologies. Active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) include magnetic oxides with metals at relatively high oxidation states, so chemisorbed molecular O-2 is not very stable. On the other hand, ideal compositions for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have metals in a comparatively lower oxidation state, which can supply electrons to activate O-2 molecules toward electron-richer oxygen atoms. Spin-lattice interactions in these strongly correlated oxides relate the orbital configurations and oxidation state with distinctive metal-oxygen bond distances, indicating localized or itinerant electronic behavior and selectivity in oxygen electrochemistry. OER at low overpotentials coincides with anti-Jahn-Teller contractions in ferromagnetic (FM) metal-oxygen (M-O) bonds; however, active oxides for ORR have longer FM M-O bonds, electron-richer. In both cases of OER and ORR, dominant FM couplings moderate the binding energies of the reactants because of the stabilizing quantum spin exchange interactions associated with the open-shell orbital configurations, and correspondingly, their catalytic efficiencies improve in accordance with Sabatier's principle. The presence of FM holes in the M-O bonds also enhances spin-selective charge transport, the other crucial enthalpic contribution in electrocatalysis. These specific effects of spin-dependent potentials in heterogeneous catalysis define the explicit field of spintro-catalysis, needed to allow the inclusion of strongly correlated electrons in theoretical models, and as we show here also with the advantage of the recognizing structural descriptors ligated to spin lattice interactions.									22	1	0	0	3	0	22			1932-7447			WOS:000465488600038

Perovskite oxides have emerged as a new class of highly efficient non-precious metal catalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis in alkaline media. In this work, an IrO2-incorporated La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 composite has been developed as a novel bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst using a polymer-assisted approach with a subsequent wet impregnation-calcination method. Due to the synergistic effect between the high ORR activity of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 and the good OER activity of IrO2 as well as the improved electrochemically active surface area, the electrocatalytic activities of the composite for both the OER and ORR have been improved, compared with those of the pristine La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (E = 1.043 V), resulting in its enhanced bifunctionality (E = 0.652 V) as an oxygen catalyst in alkaline solution, which is also superior to the reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. The stability test shows that after 1000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV), there is only 15 mV positive shift for achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the OER and 17 mV negative shift to reach a current density of -1 mA cm(-2) in the ORR, which indicates the good stability of the electrocatalyst (5 wt% IrO2 incorporated La0.8Sr0.2MnO3) in alkaline solution. Our study not only reports a new composite material as a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, but also opens a new avenue to develop novel perovskite oxide-based electrocatalysts with enhanced bifunctional electrocatalytic activities.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2052-1553			WOS:000468004900017

Here, we report a novel Fe-doped NiCoP hyperbranched hierarchical arrays grown on nickel foam (referred as NC1-xFxP HHAs/NF) prepared by a facile hydrothermal method followed by a phosphorization treatment. Compared to traditional nanosheet arrays, the secondary one-dimensional nanowire arrays were grown on primary two-dimensional NC1-xFxP nanosheets arrays supported on the nickel foam to maximum exposed catalytic active sites and provide a large electrolyte contact area and accelerate electrolyte transport, thus greatly improving catalytic activity. Benefit from the synergy of modified electronic structure induced by the Fe-doping and special hyperbranched hierarchical architecture, the optimal NC0.9F0.1P HHAs/NF electrocatalyst show an over potential of 122.5 and 269 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm(-2), under 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The material system operates at 1.57 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in two-electrode measurements. This permits new design principles for highly-efficient multicomponent metal phosphides electrocatalysts with special hierarchical architecture for water splitting. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a series of Co(SxSe1-x)(2)@C core-shell nanoparticles with tunable compositions were successfully synthesized via a facile two-step approach including pre-oxidation followed by the sulfurization/selenylation process. Notably, the co-introduced sulfur and selenium triggers the generation of abundant Co3+ active sites and structural defect sites, as well as improve electrical conductivity. Owing to the merits of high surface area, good conductivity of carbon shell, and enriched Co3+ sites, the resulting Co (S0.46Se0.54)(2)@C exhibits an OER activity with an ultralow overpotential of 220 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 56.8 mV dec(-1) in 0.1 M KOH, transcending the most reported non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts. Moreover, Co(S0.46Se0.54)(2)@C possesses comparable electrocatalytic activity to that of the HER.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) show its morphology of nanotube and subunit of nanoflake. BET N-2 adsorption-desorption test shows a high specific surface area of 129.03 m(2) g(-1) and hierarchical pores ranging 2-5 nm. When used as lithium-oxygen batteries electrocatalyst, it evidently reduces overpotential (2.64/3.92 V) and improves the specific capacity (1979 mAh g(-1)) and cycle life (42 cycles) of the cell.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1452-3981			WOS:000430452300012

Herein, we report on a synthetic method that leads to an in situ growth of ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets and transition metal disulfide nanocubes onto the surface of Fe1/3Co1/3Ni1/3MoO4 nanorods for the first time. Such hybrids are found to serve as a bifunctional electrocatalyst with high activities for OER and HER, as represented by an impressive anodic and cathodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.53 and -0.25 V, respectively. More importantly, the performance for OER is even better than that of IrO2, the conventional noble metal electrocatalyst. These striking observations were interpreted in terms of the combination of strongly synergistic effect of multimetal components, large amount of exposed active site, and super-aerophobia. The present methodology has been confirmed universal for synthesizing other molybdate solid solutions, which would open up new possibilities for designing novel non-noble bifunctional electrocatalysts for OER and HER.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			2470-1343			WOS:000427933200051	31457905

To break the thermodynamic limitation, chlorine gas slightly evolved was quickly removed from the reactor by flowing O-2. From the data obtained at the early stage of reaction, the rate equation for Cl-2 evolution was determined to be d[Cl-2]/dt = k(Po-2)(n)/(1 + k'[CaO]), where 0.7 < n < 0.9, with an activation energy of 157.6 kJ/mol. Upon prolonged reaction, the rate Of Cl-2 evolution rapidly decreased because of the progress of the reverse reaction between Cl-2 and CaO generated during the reaction. Through the addition of silica powder into molten CaCl2, the rapid decrease in the Cl-2 evolution rate on prolonged reaction was significantly moderated: about 60% of the Cl ions contained in the CaCl2 were recovered as Cl-2 gas. This is due to the reaction of SiO2 with CaO to form calcium silicate, which is less reactive with Cl-2 gas.					10th International Conference on Polymers and Organic Chemistry10th International Conference on Polymers and Organic Chemistry	JUL 14-18, 2002JUL 14-18, 2002		UNIV CALIF LA JOLLA, SAN DIEGO, CAUNIV CALIF LA JOLLA, SAN DIEGO, CA	4	0	1	0	0	0	5			0888-5885			WOS:000186714200016

Compared to the most graphene-based carbons reported in the literature that show only good oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, our N,S-doped carbon nanofiber network coated with N,P-doped carbon nanoparticles showed good bifunctionality toward ORR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities. The HER performance with doped carbon material exhibited an onset potential of 233 mV (vs. RHE), a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 331 mV (vs. RHE), and Tafel slope of 99 mV decade(-1). The same material was also used for ORR, which could deliver an onset potential 10 mV more negative than commercial Pt/C and a cathodic peak of 0.84 V (vs. RHE). These values are better than most reported metal-free electrocatalysts. The superior performance of carbon hybrid may be attributed to the combination of a more exposed highly active N,P-doped carbon, a good integration of N,P-doped carbon with N,S-doped carbon nanofibers, and an accelerated electron transport through N,S-doped carbon nanofibers as good conductivity channels.									102	5	0	0	8	0	105			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000397003700041

The XRD patterns revealed the existence of WS2 (1T phase) crystalline structure. Both WS2 nanodiscs and graphite were ultrasonicated to exfoliate the sheets and the suspension was solvothermally treated to design a WS2/graphite (WS2/G) nanocomposite. Fascinating flower-like nanostructures composed of nanodiscs observed during the detailed morphological investigation. The FE-SEM observation demonstrated well-dispersed graphite sheets in WS2 nanodiscs. The photoelectrochemical water splitting performance of bare WS2 and WS2/G hybrid photoanodes investigated under simulated 1 SUN irradiations revealed threefold increase in the photocurrent density of WS2/G hybrid photoanode compared to WS2.

Considering the regulatory effect of Zn for electrocatalytic OER, the Zn doped alpha-Fe2O3 nanowire is successfully prepared and served as the photoanode for PEC water oxidation. The results reveal the theoretical overpotential for the limiting step (from OH* to O*) is decreased by ca. 320 mV after Zn doing, which indicates an incredibly improved catalytic performance of OER. The Zn doped alpha-Fe2O3 displays PEC performance improvement over the bare alpha-Fe2O3, photocurrent density increases up to 0.88 mA/cm(2) (1.23 V-RHE, 1 M NaOH), which shows a 44-fold increase than the alpha-Fe2O3. Meanwhile, the onset potential also shifts negatively by 300 mV, which also agrees well with the decreased OER overpotential. This work provides a deep understanding of the role of Zn in the alpha-Fe2O3 photoanodes and the strategy could be extended to other photoactive systems. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, despite of a rapidly increasing number of publications devoted to the oxygen electrocatalysis on transition metal oxides, a clear picture regarding the relations between their structure and composition on the one hand and electrocatalytic activity on the other hand is lacking.

Stability and porosity are several of the features of LDH which help them to serve as efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. Based on these considerations, we synthesized NiCo(OH)(2) LDH and probed its OER electrocatalytic performance. The synthesized catalyst was subjected to X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for structural analysis and investigation of its surface morphology, surface composition, and oxidation states. The LDH-NiCo(OH)(2) was anchored over the FTO surface and the fabricated electrode was found to exhibit a much lower OER onset potential of 265 mV, a much higher current density of 300 mAcm(-)(2) and a smaller Tafel slope of 41 mVdec(-1). Moreover, the designed catalyst was found to be stable up to 2500 repeated voltametric scans. These figures of merit regarding the structure and performance of the designed LDH are expected to provide useful insights into the fundamental understanding of the OER catalysts and their mechanisms of action, thus enabling the more rational design of cost effective and highly efficient electrocatalysts for use in water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2079-4991		WOS:000809157600001	35683675

The LSMOs with orientations of (001), (110), and, (111) exhibit different OER activities owing to the discrepant surface density of Mn. Furthermore, tuning of the surface atomic terrace width of LSMO shows a more efficient path to modulate the OER performance by introducing a high-valence Mn state owing to the surface dangling bonds of LSMO. As the electrochemical process is dominated by the interface of the TMO surface and electrolyte, our investigation can approach the fundamental understanding of a perovskite-type TMO surface state and its OER performance while highlighting the role of the nonbulk electron state in a promising TMO electrocatalyst in abundant electrochemical processes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000733772800001	34914875

Herein, a novel hybrid composite constructed from Co9S8/Co-doped ZnS (Zno(0.8)Co(0.2)S) nanorods with the atomic-level coupled nanointerface rooted in porous carbon polyhedra (Co9S8/Zn0.8Co0.2S@C) have been fabricated and investigated as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for OER. The composite catalyst can afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of only 292 mV and a small Tafel slope of similar to 52 mV decade(-1), which are superior to the state-of-the-art IrO2/C and most reported Co-based catalysts. Experimental and computational studies reveal an electronic coupling between Co9S8 and Zn0.8Co0.2S that can facilitate the electron injection from the electrode and transport to the active site, and thus generates a favorable local coordination environment and greatly enhances the OER process.

Herein, heterogeneous vanadium oxide EF system (VO-EF) was proposed by electrodepositing VO on carbon paper cathode (VOx@CP) and anode (V3O7@CP) for levofloxacin degradation. The VOx@CP cathode showed the optimal potential of 2e(-) ORR at-0.90 V (vs. SCE) with H2O2 generation rate of 1.44 x 10(-4) mmol.L-1.cm- 2.s(-1). Though overpotential disparity of 0.35 V was exhibited between the redox of VOx and 2e- ORR, rapid H(2)O(2)consumption rate was still achieved and facilitated .OH generation. The oxygen vacancies existed in V3O7@CP anode reduced oxygen evolution reaction potential, leading to the cell voltage decrease of 0.36 V. Levofloxacin (30 mg.L-1) degradation efficiency of 97.67% was achieved in the VO-EF system within 120 min, and 19.19 mg.L-1 TOC was mineralized with energy consumption of 12.3 J.mg.(-1) TOC under neutral pH condition. Complete mineralization and low H2O2 residue allowed good bioavailability in the effluent. Levofloxacin degradation pathways and mechanism were proposed based on identified intermediates and theoretical calculation. This study provides inspiration for developing novel EF systems for efficient pollutants degradation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000784266100001

Theoretical studies based on density functional theory (DFT) were performed to systematically understand the temperature-dependent sulfur evolution chemistry of CO2-assisted pyrite oxidation. The results show that there is a strong interaction between CO2 and FeS2 surface. The interaction intensity is promoted by the presence of surface O atom. The adsorbed CO2 molecule dissociates into CO molecule and active surface O atom, which can supply oxygen source for SO2 formation. CO molecule strips a lattice sulfur atom from FeS2 surface to generate COS species. CO2 decomposition on FeS2 surface at 1073 K is activated by 677.73 kJ/mol, and exothermic by 405.69 kJ/mol. SO2 evolution from CO2-assisted pyrite oxidation includes different elementary reaction steps: CO2 adsorption, CO2 decomposition, CO desorption, SO2 formation, SO2 desorption, and O replenishment. CO2 decomposition is regarded as the rate-limiting step of SO2 evolution. S vacancy produced from surface lattice sulfur consumption can be replenished by the active oxygen atoms from CO2 decomposition. Compared with COS formation pathway, sulfur evolution of CO2-assisted pyrite oxidation prefers SO2 formation pathway. The proposed reaction network can be used to better understand the CO2-mediated sulfur evolution chemistry of pyrite oxidation. (C) 2020 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The development of earth-abundant, efficient, and durable electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a vital role in the commercialization of water electrolysis. The self-supported electrode is regarded as an effective approach to developing highly active electrocatalysts with exceptional stability, compared to the conventional coated powdery-type electrocatalysts. However, lack of systematic reviews for the development of self-supported electrodes limits its innovation. The one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures are substantially investigated for boosting catalytic activity due to their large surface areas, effective mass transport, and fast electron transfer. Herein, we review the state of-the-art development of self-supported transition-metal-based electrodes with 1D/2D nanostructures for HER, OER, as well as both HER and OER, classify them as general 1D/2D nanoarrays, hierarchical 1D/2D nanostructures, and hollow 1D/2D nanostructures. This review will advance future researches and provide a guideline in developing self-supported electrodes with excellent electrocatalytic performances.									42	4	0	0	1	0	43			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000571870700004

Platinized titianium dioxide Degussa P25 was used as catalyst. No significant hydrogen evolution was detected without organic electron donors - sacrificial agents.The hydrogen evolution rate was shown to grow slowly with the rise of initial DMMP concentration. The initial rate vs. DMMP concentration curve is well fitted by Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) equation. The DMMP adsorption constant obtained from the L-H equation fit is markedly higher than that obtained from the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Reactions of full destruction into inorganic products of the four organophosphorous compounds were conducted. Amounts of evolved hydrogen and carbon dioxide were completely consistent with stoichiometry of proposed reaction. There were no initial compounds and only trace of total organic carbon after the end of the reaction. Complete water purification and production of an amount of valuable hydrogen was achieved.Intermediates of DMMP oxygen-free destruction were identified by means of GC/MS. They were the same as those in the case of DMMP photocatalytic oxidation. A mechanism of hydrogen evolution that explains smaller rates of mineralization compared to photocatalytic oxidation by oxygen was proposed. (C) 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu.

The aforementioned electron requirement implies that the OER requires more energy than the HER, thus limiting the overall water splitting efficiency. Here, we propose a novel anode catalyst by using an advanced composite material of selenized nickel-iron electrodes together with NiFe_LDH. An analysis of the water splitting performance was carried out in different concentrations of a seawater-like electrolyte, which, in terms of corrosion reactions, is a relatively harsher environment than that found in natural seawater. In this study, we discovered that a Se_NiFe foam electrode with an LDH layer exhibited extraordinary stability and activity in an aqueous sea-like solution, demonstrating an improved overpotential from the original 1.62 V-1.43 V in a seawater electrolyte mixture. Furthermore, the Tafel slope significantly decreased from 115.1 mV dec(-1) to 26.3 mV dec(-1). Notably, the lifespan of this novel electrode was extended from 80 h to 250 h.

In electrochemical oxidation degradation, phenol underwent the generation of benzodiphenol and benzoquinone, and further oxidation process, hi the reaction process, benzodiphenol oxidized rapidly to benzoquinone with very little accumulation; while the benzoquinone intermediates were further-oxidized more hardly, and the concentration of accumulation was higher. Phenol had different ways of electrochemical oxidation reaction; under the oxygen evolution potential of the diamond membrane electrode, the direct electrochemical oxidation occurred. While above the oxygen evolution potential, indirect electrochemical oxidation and direct electrochemical oxidation took place together.			采用循环伏安法、交流阻抗法、恒电位计时电流法,并结合高效液相色谱方法,研究了苯酚在金刚石膜电极上的电化学氧化降解过程.结果表明,苯酚在电化学氧化降解中经历了苯二酚、苯醌的形成和进一步被氧化的过程,苯二酚在反应过程中的积累很少,迅速氧化为苯醌,而醌类中间产物则较难进一步氧化,在反应过程中积累的浓度较高.苯酚在金刚石膜电极上有不同的电化学氧化反应途径,在低于金刚石膜电极析氧电位下,发生单纯直接电化学氧化过程;在高于金刚石膜电极析氧电位下,间接电化学氧化和直接电化学氧化将同时发生作用.						2	8	0	0	0	0	8			1000-6923			CSCD:1994508

In this communication, we report the development of an FeMoO4 nanorod array on nickel foam (FeMoO4/ NF) via a facile hydrothermal process. As a 3D oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst, such FeMoO4/ NF shows superior catalytic activity with a geometrical catalytic current density of 50 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of only 293 mV in 1.0 M KOH. Notably, this electrode also shows good long-term electrochemical durability with a high turnover frequency value of 0.43 mol O2 s-1 at an overpotential of 390 mV.

Herein, we demonstrate that surfactant modification of a NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) array electrode, one of the best catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), could achieve superaerophobic surface with balanced surface charges, affording fast mass transfer, quick gas release, and boosted OER performance. The assembled surfactants on the electrode surface are responsible for lowering the bubble adhesive force (similar to 1.03 mu N) and corresponding fast release of small bubbles generated during OER. In addition, the bipolar nature of the hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) molecule lead to bilayer assembly of the surfactants with the polar ends facing the electrode surface and the electrolyte, resulting in neutralized charges on the electrode surface. As a result, OH- transfer was facilitated and OER performance was enhanced. With the modified superaerophobic surface and balanced surface charge, NiFe LDHs-CTAB nanostructured electrode showed ultrahigh current density increase (9.39 mA/(mV cm(2))), 2.3 times higher than that for conventional NiFe LDH nanoarray electrode), dramatically fast gas release, and excellent durability. The introduction of surfactants to construct under-water superaerophobic electrode with in-time repelling ability to the as-formed gas bubbles may open up a new pathway for designing efficient electrodes for gas evolution systems with potentially practical application in the near future.									15	3	0	0	0	0	16			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000485041800030

Pressingly, we urgently need to use highly efficient bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts for the enhancement of rechargeable metal air batteries research. Herein, the unique CoS2@N-doped carbon (CoS2@NC-X) hybrids are successfully achieved via direct calcination and sulfurization of 2D leaf-like bimetallic imidazole framework (ZnCo-ZIF-L). Owing to the synergic effect between intrinsic activity of CoS2 nanoparticles, the unique core-shell structure and small-size pores, the optimal CoS2@NC-60 is demonstrated to exhibit excellent ORR- and OER- catalytic activity. In particular, the ORR of CoS2@NC-60 not only possesses a half-wave potential of 0.84 V (compared to RHE), but also has a limiting current density of 5.18 mA cm-2. Furthermore, CoS2@NC-60 possesses an overpotential (compared to RHE) of 350 mV required to drive the current density of 10 mA cm-2. As a validation, the CoS2@NC-60 catalyst is intended for use in rechargeable Zn-air batteries, where it has the outstanding long-term stability (550 h) and an exceptional power density (170.6 mW cm-2). This facile synthetic strategy renders a feasible way to further probe non-noble metal electrochemical catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000870696700008

This special structure, with both graphitized carbon and Ni foam, possesses a huge specific surface area, high electroconductivity, and a porous structure, effectively enhancing electrocatalytic activities for OER. Furthermore, the sandwiched structure with coupled graphitized carbon sheets encapsulating the outside can hinder active materials from agglomeration and falling off during long-term operation, leading to outstanding durability, even in large temperature ranges.									94	2	0	0	2	0	95			2155-5435			WOS:000379457300051

However, it is still challenging to develop a stable, inexpensive, and efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst that can overcome the sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics in water electrolysis. To address the aforementioned concerns, a metal-organic framework-derived Fe-doped Ni3Fe/NiFe2O4 heterostructural nanoparticle-embedded carbon nanotube (CNT) matrix (Fe(0.2)/Ni-M@C-400-2h) is synthesized via a facile hydrothermal reaction and subsequent carbonization of an earth-abundant Ni/Fe/C precursor. With a novel porous nanoarchitecture fabricated by a Ni3Fe/NiFe2O4 heterostructure on a highly conductive CNT matrix, this catalyst exhibits exceptional bifunctional activity during water electrolysis over the Ni/Fe-based electrocatalysts reported recently. It delivers a low overpotential of 250 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with a small Tafel slope of 43.4 mV/dec for oxygen evolution reaction. It requires a low overpotential of 128 mV (eta(10)) for hydrogen evolution reaction and displays a low overpotential of 1.62 V (eta(10)) for overall water splitting. This study introduces a facile and straightforward synthesis strategy to develop transition metal-based nanoarchitectures with high performance and durability for overall water-splitting catalysis.									31	1	0	0	1	0	31			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000600202300022	33258579

The electrocatalytic activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on CuMnO2 deposits has been studied in 1.0M KOH (25 degrees C) by means of cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, chronoamperometric and electrochemical impedance techniques. The study has shown that the catalytic activity had increased with the increase of Cu content in the electrode composition, where the optimum improvement in the apparent electrode catalytic activity was obtained at the M30 electrode (with x = 30). At E = 0.6V versus Ag/AgCl, the apparent oxygen evolution current density observed at the M30 electrode is 4 times greater than that observed with M10 (x = 10). The order of the OER with respect to OH- concentration measured at low and high potentials is similar to 1.0 and the roughness of the electrodes was decreased with the increase of the Cu content.									9	0	0	0	0	1	10			0942-9352			WOS:000386487000005

But, they are still far from practical use because of moderate catalytic activity. Two-dimensional (2D) materials with porous nanostructures are attractive for the efficient conversion of electrochemical energy. Herein, Co1-xS novel porous microplates were synthesized through a facile self-templated strategy based on the Kirkendall effect. By taking advantages of porous nanostructure and good catalytic properties of the hexagonal Co(OH)(2) template, the unique Co1-xS microplates provide higher efficient surface area and more accessible active sites. Moreover, the mass transfer and gas diffusion are also promoted, owing to the pores developed inside the microplates. As expected, the optimized porous Co1-xS microplates demonstrate remarkable OER performance in alkaline electrolyte with an overpotential of 311mV at 10mAcm(-2), a Tafel slope of 55mVdec(-1) and long-term stability, which outperform the commercial IrO2 catalyst. The facile preparation, high catalytic activity, and excellent durability of the Co1-xS porous hexagonal microplates show great promise in energy conversion applications.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2196-0216			WOS:000430102600007

Various descriptors of perovskite catalysts have been proposed successfully for understanding either ORR or OER, but previous studies are insufficient to explain and thus boost up both ORR and OER simultaneously due to obstacles such as many different chemical compositions, structures, and metal orbital bands. Therefore, we investigate ORR/OER activities as a function of only oxygen vacancy concentration in perovskite oxides of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (SSC) to check the close relationship between delta (delta) and the electronic structure. Interestingly, the improved performance of both ORR and OER is explained by the change in the oxidation state of the transition metal caused by the increase in oxygen vacancies. Unfortunately, most previous research studies have focused on the effect of only oxygen vacancy (delta) on responsiveness. To confirm this, we performed density functional theory (DFT) analysis to find the more dominant factor on whether the activity descriptor is either delta or oxidation states of transition metals. The DFT analysis reveals that the ORR and OER activities of SSC are simultaneously improved by the reduced gap between d- and p-band centers (Delta Ed-p) caused by the raised d-band center (M-d). X-ray absorption spectroscopy has provided the exact electronic states of all the transition metals. Here, we report that an important factor of ORR/OER is affected only by the oxidation state of the transition metal in the perovskite oxide, not by the oxygen vacancy concentration.									53	2	0	0	0	0	53			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400019

Nevertheless, the overall solar-to-hydrogen efficiency and the cost-effectiveness of this technology are still unsatisfactory for practical implementation. This can be primarily attributed to the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the relatively low economic value of cogenerated O-2 production. Over the past decades, there are extensive efforts to explore more kinetically favorable photooxidation reactions, which coupled with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can simultaneously improve H-2 production yield and produce higher valuable alternatives to conventional O-2. This review aims to present recent progress on the alternative anodic choices to OER. Here, the fundamental of PEC water splitting and the critical components required for this system are first shortly summarized. Then the benefits and issues of alternative photooxidation reactions including photooxidation of water to hydrogen peroxide, chlorine, alcohol, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, or urea oxidation when combined with the concurrent HER, are reviewed and analyzed. This review is concluded by presenting a critical evaluation of the challenges and opportunities of these alternative HER-coupled photooxidation reactions for solar energy production and environmental treatment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000856145500001

Herein, we present a new convenient synthesis of copper nitride (Cu3N) that acts as a bifunctional electro(pre)catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water electrolysis in alkaline media. Strikingly, the electrophoretically deposited Cu3N on nickel foam (NF) displayed extremely low overpotentials for both OER and HER, and the overall water splitting cell potential was merely 1.62 V with a remarkable durability of over 10 days. Most notably, the coordinatively unsaturated Cu in Cu3N transformed in situ under a reducing environment and in an oxidative environment into a copper-rich shell that serves as the active site over an equally important electrically conductive Cu3N core to drive proficient catalysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on copper nitride for efficient and durable alkaline water electrolysis.									114	10	0	0	5	0	115			2380-8195			WOS:000461271600019

The oxide him with a loading of similar to 6 mg cm(-2) was found to be the best electocatalyst among the electrodes prepared in situ. The activity of this film electrode was better than those prepared by othermethods, following sequential coatings of solution or mixed oxide coatings. Electrode kinetic parameters, such as Tafel slope, reaction order and activation energy, were found to be similar to 65 mV decade(-1), similar to 1.2 and 18.4 kcal, respectively. Cyclic voltammetric studies, prior to the onset of oxygen evolution, exhibited two characteristic peaks corresponding to a diffusion-controlled surface redox process: Ni2+ --> Ni3+ Based on these results, a probable mechanism for oxygen evolution on the oxide film electrode is suggested.									22	0	0	0	1	1	22			0360-3199			WOS:A1995QG13800004

In this work, a series of Bi/Nb co-doped BaCoO3-delta-based perovskite oxides BaBi0.05Co0.95-xNbxO3-delta (BBC0.95-xNx, x=0.1, 0.15, 0.2) were synthesized and evaluated as oxygen electrocatalysts for ORR and OER. It is interesting to note that Nb-doping amount is related to the contents of surface oxygen vacancies and oxidation states of cobalt, subsequently inducing performance differences among BBC0.95-xNx. Results show that BBC0.95-xNx have bifunctional electrocatalytic activities toward both ORR and OER in alkaline media. Compared with the BBC0.85N0.1 and BBC0.8N0.15, BBC0.75N0.2 with the highest Nb-doping rate delivered a lowest total overpotential between the ORR and the OER.

The OER catalytic activity of Mn3-xCoxO4 (0 <= x < 1) dramatically improved with an increase in Co content. We found that the OER activity of Mn3-xCoxO4 (0 <= x < 1) increased linearly with the suppression of the Jahn-Teller distortion. We therefore propose that the Jahn-Teller distortion plays an important role in the OER activities of compounds containing Mn3+. Mn3-xCoxO4 (0 <= x < 1) provides a rare case for directly studying the effect of the Jahn-Teller distortion on OER activity.									62	0	0	0	3	0	62			2046-2069			WOS:000368191100040

However, there are still needs to improve their electrochemical performance by designing and fabricating heterostructures with desired crystal architectures as well as tailorable compositions for electrocatalysis. Herein, for the first time a strategy is reported for the synthesis of binary hybrid hydroxide microstructures which are wrapped by few-layer carbon with iridium doping. The synthesized nickel hydroxides enable the epitaxial overgrowth of cobalt hydroxides due to their similar crystal lattice, resulting in the formation of hybrid NiCo layered double hydroxides heterostructures. Moreover, the NiCo layered double hydroxides are coated by few-layer carbon, which is eventually doped by iridium. Our results show that NiCo-Ir hybrid microarchitecture with tunable compositions display excellent electrocatalytic behaviors towards the oxygen evolution reaction, due to their microstructural advantages with thin carbon layers and electronic interaction of iridium/hydroxides.

Herein, we report a novel biomimetic architectural design and development of 3D flexible electrodes with high electrocatalytic activity and durability in a mild alkaline system. Benefiting from the ultralong single-crystal Co-doped ZnO nanowires densely and in situ grown on highly conductive carbon fabric, the novel material and unique composite electrode architecture favor the direct electrochemical water splitting process over the conventionally fabricated electrodes by providing abundant active sites, efficient electron transfer pathways, and sufficient gas exchange channels. A low overpotential of 360 and 275 mV is required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively. When these thick electrodes are used as electrocatalysts for both anode and cathode in an overall water electrolyzer, a low cell voltage of 1.90 V and 2.06 V is required to reach a current density of 4.0 and 10.0 mA cm(-2), respectively, with an extremely long durability. Such a single-cell prototype exhibiting superior performance to noble metal-based precious catalyst counterparts holds great promise in future practical applications for pure hydrogen generation.									21	2	0	0	2	0	22			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000402734600014

WO3 nanowires were prepared by flame vapor deposition (FVD) process and BiVO4 nanoparticles were spin-coated on top of WO3 nanowires. In order to improve oxygen evolution kinetics, WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction photoanode was modified by photo-assisted electrodeposition of Co-Pi. Co-Pi improve the PEC water oxidation efficiency of 1 D-WO3/BiVO4 by reducing the charge recombination, facilitating the hole transfer and reducing the overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction. The optimum amount of Co-Pi for high photocurrent density was proposed. The loaded Co-Pi has enhanced the overall PEC performance showing largely shifted onset potential (similar to 450 mV) with significantly increased photocurrent (2.7 times at 1.23 V vs. RHE). The prepared composite photoanode of 1-D WO3/BiVO4/Co-Pi shows the higher incident photon to current efficiency and applied bias photon-to-current efficiency than without Co-Pi loading. We obtain the highest level of PEC performance with WO3/BiVO4/Co-Pi heterojunction composite photoanode which is based on 1-D framework of WO3 prepared by facile, rapid and economical FVD in this study.

The partial oxygenation of g-C3N4 was simultaneously achieved, providing the opportunity to collaboratively affect both structure and electron for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The O-g-C3N4 monolayer exhibited a production rate of similar to 44.37 mmol/g (similar to 8874.7 mu mol/h g) for hydrogen evolution leading to the highest external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 13.7% (at 420 nm) of the reported g-C3N4 nanosheets in a 5 h duration under visible light irradiation. More promisingly, the photocatalytic reaction proceeded for more than 25 h without performance degradation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, nickel hydroxide carbonate nanosheets obtained through a urea assisted route were loaded with iron species by immersing nickel hydroxide carbonate in aqueous Fe3+ solution. The different K w values of nickel hydroxide and iron hydroxide induce the formation of Fe species on nickel hydroxide carbonate nanosheet surface with the releasing of Ni2+ ions. Owing to the loading of island-like Fe species on nickel based nanosheets, the thus designed and prepared composites show amounts of exposed heterointerfaces with strong interactions between the species, and so present excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution. At a lower overpotential of 277 mV, the optimized catalyst can drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with higher stability. This study provides a new avenue for the development of OER electrocatalysts; that is, direct immersing with ion adsorption is effective.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1387-7003	1879-0259		WOS:000521513500027

Among all transition-metal-based materials, NiFe-based electrocatalysts have been regarded as the most promising substitute to commercial noble metals in alkaline conditions. To overcome their leaching problem and improve intrinsic stability without compromising activity, we report a NiFe alloy covered with a discrete N-doped graphitic shell for the OER. The alloy core@discrete graphitic shell structure exhibits enhanced OER activity and stability with a low onset potential of 1.48V, reduced overpotential of 320mV@10mAcm(-1), and small Tafel slope value of 41mVdec(-1), which is superior to Ir/C. It is believed that the nitrogen doping, a discrete graphitic shell, and a mesoporous structure work in harmony to enhance the OER performance.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			2196-0216			WOS:000426495000002

To fulfill these requirements, a simple approach is adopted by developing a nanostructured active material directly on a conducting backbone. The self-grown nanorod template on a conducting backbone of Cu is used as a sacrificial template and to convert this nanorod template into Cu2S nanorods, a simple ion-exchange method is adopted for the first time. When used as an electrocatalyst for the OER Cu2S nanorods required an overpotential of 270 mV to achieve a current density 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibited an excellent stability.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000539351700011

The chemical nature of elements (Ni, Fe) in electrocatalysts has been elucidated from Fe and Ni K- and L-edge XANES. The increase of oxidation states of Ni from Ni(III) to Ni(3.6) together with a highly covalent Fe(IV)-O bond under OER process is observed. Charge transfer between Ni and Fe through a "Ni-O-Fe" bond is proposed, accounting for the high catalytic activities of NiFe(OH)(x).									115	5	0	0	8	0	116			1932-7447			WOS:000360415700001

However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as one half-cell reaction of water splitting, always suffers from slow kinetics and a large overpotential due to the four proton-coupled electron transfer process, and dominates the overall process efficiency. IrO2 is a promising and widely used catalyst for the OER in commercial applications. Herein, we obtained low-crystalline nano-IrO2 particles confined in an amorphous Ir-based MOF (IrO2@Ir-MOF) through a simple solvothermal reaction, in which ultrafine IrO2 particles are uniformly distributed in the Ir-MOF skeleton. The fabricated IrO2@Ir-MOF-ppy electrode exhibits excellent OER activity with an overpotential of 207 mV, to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution, outperforming most previously reported OER catalysts. The IrO2@Ir-MOF||IrO2@Ir-MOF couple exhibits promising activity and stability for the overall water splitting reaction in 1 M KOH (1.53 V).									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000601282900010

Rutherford and colleagues solve this problem elegantly: bicarbonate tunes water-oxidising photosystem II to make onward electron transfer efficient; an absence of bicarbonate retunes, redirects, and safely shuts down energy flow.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			1360-1385			WOS:000393929200001	27979715

The integrated CoNiSe2/NF functions as a robust electrocatalyst with an extremely high activity and stability for emerging renewable energy technologies, and electrochemical oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER, respectively). The overpotentials required to deliver a current density of 100 mA.cm(-2) are as low as 307 and 170 mV for the OER and HER, respectively; therefore, the obtained CoNiSe2 is among the most promising earth-abundant catalysts for water splitting. Furthermore, our synthetic sample validates a two-electrode electrolyzer for reducing the cell voltage in the full water splitting reaction to 1.591 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), which offers a novel, inexpensive, integrated selenide/NF electrode for electrocatalytic applications.									118	5	0	0	2	0	119			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000424049300015

However, developing such a catalyst is still a challenge. Zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4) is non-toxic and made from cheap and earth-abundant materials making it a potential raw material for synthesizing "green" low-cost catalysts for the OER. However, it has largely been ignored due to its low stability, conductivity and OER-inactive Zn2+. Herein, ZnFe(2)O(4)is used effectively as a pre-catalyst to synthesize core-shell ZnFe2O4@Zn(Fe)OOH polycrystalline heterostructures in situ via cyclic voltammetry. The ZnFe2O4@Zn(Fe)OOH heterostructures display much higher OER catalytic activity and stability than the benchmark RuO(2)catalyst in alkaline medium, owing to its high conductivity, stability and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). Our findings thus reveal a new and effective way by which ZnFe(2)O(4)can be applied in water electrolysis.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2196-0216			WOS:000567306600011

However, researchers have not created a reliable method to optimize the interfaces of components existing in electrocatalysts, although it is very crucial for the technological development of high-performance electrodes. Here, we develop a strategy aiming at the in situ anchorage of Co9S8 nanoparticles into a nitrogen (N), sulfur (S) co-implanted three-dimensional carbon matrix (Co9S8@NSCM) as a highly active and durable nonprecious metal electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. This strategy offers an opportunity to optimize the interface interaction and affords high activity for the ORR and OER in terms of low overpotentials and high current intensities. In addition, by confining Co9S8 nanoparticles into a N,S-doped carbon matrix, corrosion and aggregation can be effectively prevented, and thus the catalyst exhibits nearly unfading ORR catalytic performance after 100 000 s testing, a low discharge-charge voltage gap (0.81 V) and a long cycle life (up to 840 cycles) in Zn-air batteries. The present work highlights potentially powerful interface engineering for designing multi-component heterostructures with advanced performances in oxygen electrochemistry and related energy conversion.									54	3	0	0	2	0	55			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000424075400054	29355860

The hybrid or heterostructure of two different atomically thin materials exhibits completely different chemical and electronics behavior as compared to its parent components. Here, MoS2 quantum dots (QDs) are decorated onto ultrathin NiO nanosheets (NSs) by using a one-pot hydrothermal process. Uniformly dispersed MoS2 QDs and ultrathin NiO NSs hybrid/heterostructure can provide more active reaction sites and accelerate the charge transfer rate. Benefiting from the heterointerfaces synergistic effect between MoS2 QDs and NiO NSs, the MoS2 QDs/NiO NSs electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity towards both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

Given this, synthesis of nanostructured 3D transition metal nitrides is of contemporary interest. Here, a hard templating simple and efficient pathway to synthesize 3D ordered-mesoporous ternary nitrides NiCo2N is reported using the mesoporous silica KIT-6 hard template. Benefitting from its large surface area and accessible pores, uniform shape, and enhanced infiltration capacity for electrolyte, mesoporous NiCo2N demonstrates superior electrode performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. As-synthesized mesoporous ternary nitride NiCo2N shows desirable performance with very low overpotential (289 mV), and yields approximate to 10 mA cm(-2) geometric current density. This is lower than the values of IrO2 and that of mesoporous binary nitrides CoN and Ni3N electrocatalysts. NiCo2N shows a small Tafel slope and smallest semicircle. Moreover, as-synthesized NiCo2N exhibits low loss of activity after 10 h test for OER in alkaline solution. This work explores a promising way to produce OER electrocatalyst Co-Ni-based ternary nitrides for water splitting applications.									40	5	0	0	3	0	40			2196-7350			WOS:000484415200001

With this method, the degree of oxidation can be readily controlled and the effect of surface S residues in the resulted metal (oxy)hydroxides for the OER is revealed for the first time. The developed NiFe (oxy)hydroxide catalyst with residual S demonstrates an extraordinarily low OER overpotential of 190 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) after coupling with carbon nanotubes, and outstanding performance in Zn-air battery tests. Theoretical calculation suggests that the surface S residues can significantly reduce the adsorption free energy difference between O* and OH* intermediates on the Fe sites, which should account for the high OER activity of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide catalysts. This work provides significant insight regarding the effect of surface heteroatom residues in OER electrocatalysis and offers a new strategy to design high-performance and cost-efficient OER catalysts.									187	15	0	0	10	0	186			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000436930800025	29782683

Here we present a high-performance bifunctional catalyst with cobalt and nitrogen embedded carbon nanotubes (CNCNs), which exhibits high electrocatalytic activity towards the ORR and OER. For comparison, iron and nickel embedded carbon nanotubes (FeNCNs and NiNCNs) are also investigated to reveal the electrochemical performance upon transition metal doping. In the half-cell testing, FeNCN-44 and CNCN-100 show better electrochemical activities towards the ORR, while the compositionally optimized CNCN-44 outperforms other prepared catalysts during the OER including commercial RuO2 and Pt/C. The CNCN-44 exhibits a low oxidation overpotential of 0.38 V and stability with negligible deactivation over extended operation, which make it the best catalyst in overall bifunctional performance. We also test the suitability and durability of CNCN-44 as the oxygen electrode for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. The homemade battery exhibits a high open-circuit potential of 1.45 V and stable charge-discharge durability over 12 hours in 6 M KOH electrolyte at 10 mA cm(-2), which make our compositionally optimized CNCN-44 a promising candidate as a cathode material for rechargeable zinc-air batteries.									62	2	0	0	5	0	62			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000372754000025

In this report, a new intermetallic nickel/cobalt silicide-decorated carbon-rich silica-based ceramic composites (Co/SiOC or Ni/SiOC) were successfully synthesized as alternative bifunctional electrocatalysts. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics of the prepared composite materials were evaluated by electrochemical characterization. Co/SiOC exhibited more positive ORR kinetics with the onset potential of 0.87 V vs. RHE compared to that of Ni/SiOC, which is slightly lower compared to Pt/C. Conversely, Ni/SiOC exhibits a 50 mV more positive OER onset potential compared to Co/SiOC with almost similar OER kinetics to RuO2. The bifunctional ability concluded that Ni/SiOC was a good bifunctional catalyst with an oxygen electrode potential 0.89 V. As Co/SiOC performs as a better ORR catalyst, it was utilized as a cathode catalyst for the construction of anion exchange membrane fuel cell and its fuel cell performance was evaluated. The Co/SiOC composites produce a peak power density of 54 mW/cm(2), representing a satisfactory result when compared with Pt/C. The results reveal that the intermetallic nickel/cobalt silicide nanosphere decorated ceramic materials can have a promising future as efficient alternative electrocatalysts in electrochemical devices.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2196-0216			WOS:000475512500006

Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with nickel and iron can be synthesized through controlled electrospinning and subsequent pyrolysis processes to investigate the effect of metal content on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Following detailed physico- and electrochemical characterization, the metal-derived mesoporous structure of CNF, with pores of 39 nm in diameter, seems to provide superior active sites for more favorable OER. This observation suggests a new perspective that can be extended to the preparation of both nonnoble-metal and metal-free electrocatalysts for a number of alkaline galvanic and electrolytic energy cells.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2196-0216			WOS:000388377200025

However, the intrinsic low conductivity and the blockage of metal active sites by organic linkers still seriously hinder their large-scale application. In this study, as a proof of principle, constructing cofacial pi-pi stacking in the terminal ligand (4,4 '-bipyridine) of a Ni/Fe-chain-based MOF to fabricate strong pi-pi interaction, in combination with unique hexagonal nanorod (HXR) structure, is found to be an effective strategy to enhance one-dimensional charge carrier efficiency and thus achieve excellent activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The approach yields a high turnover frequency (4.54 s(-1)) in well-designed bimetallic chain-based MOFs (NiFe-HXR) at an overpotential of 350 mV, which is about 8.7 and 34.9 times higher than those in Ni-HXR (0.52 s(-1)) and IrO2 (0.13 s(-1)), respectively. This work effectively combines "through-bond" channel in chain-based structure of NiFe-HXR and "through-space" transport between face-to-face terminal ligands, thus resulting in outstanding OER activity. This strategy of modulating the structure chemistry and morphology of MOFs to promote the OER may open a new perspective to synthesize MOFs for energy-relevant electrochemical reactions.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000627039800001	33656797

Bimetallic oxides are considered promising candidates as the electrocatalysts for OER because of their remarkable electrocatalytic activity, good stability, and low cost. In this work, ZIF-67 precursors were prepared via microwave irradiation and used as a self-sacrificing template. We proposed a rapid and scalable strategy to prepare Fe, Co bimetal embedded nanoporous carbon (Fe-Co/NPC) polyhedron composites by thermal decomposition of Fe species incorporated ZIF-67 precursor. Benefiting from the distinctive 3D polyhedron structural and compositional advantages, Fe-Co/NPC with hierarchical porous structure showed excellent electrochemical performance as ideal electrode material for OER. The resulting Fe-Co/NPC displayed outstanding electrocatalytic activity for OER with appreciable onset potential (1.59 V (vs. RHE)), small Tafel slope (53.55 mV dec(-1)), low over-potential (396 mV) to reach 10 mA cm(-2), and excellent durability with negligible loss in current density after 1000 cycles.

Herein, we demonstrate a hierarchical oxygen vacancy-rich WO3 with nanowire array on nanosheet array (WO3 NWA-NSA) structure as a highly efficient catalyst for the OER. The vertical structure can not only highly improve the mass loading of WO3 catalysts on Ni foam, but also provide efficient paths and channels for electron and mass transfer, leading to superior catalytic activity. Besides, the oxygen vacancies in WO3 further promote the OER activity. The as-prepared WO3 NWA-NSA catalyst requires an extremely low overpotential of 0.23 V to achieve a benchmark of 10 mA cm(-2), with a Tafel slope of only 33 mV dec(-1), superior to most reported state-of-the-art nonprecious metal-based catalysts and noble oxide catalysts. Further theoretical modeling calculations indicate that the electronic structure of WO3 with oxygen vacancies fits extremely well with the requirements of OER catalysts. This facile strategy provides a new avenue toward the hierarchical design of electrocatalysts, and our research opens a brand-new field for the applications of WO3.									45	1	0	0	4	0	45			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463814800010

Nevertheless, the correlation between the fundamental electronic structure at room temperature and the corresponding electrocatalysis is not fully accessible. In this paper, we combine the ground state density functional theory (DFT) method and dynamic mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) at room temperature to investigate the origin of the OER difference for electrocatalysts A(2)Mn(2)O(5) (A = Ca, Sr). We find that at room temperature the highest occupied Mn dz(2) orbital in the square pyramidal crystal field of oxygen-deficient perovskites A(2)Mn(2)O(5) with insulating properties can provide a moderate bonding strength with intermediate hydroxyl OH*, leading to a high OER catalytic activity. According to the electronic structure analysis, we observe that replacing the A-site element Ca by Sr with the larger ionic radii would result in a higher OER activity due to the weakened hybridization between the Mn d(z2) orbital and the O p sigma orbital of OH*. This insight could provide hints for the screening metal oxide electrocatalysts in the applications of the energy storage and conversion.

It is observed that on Fe addition, the Tafel slope decreases from similar to 60 to similar to 35 mV, however, the order of the OER with respect to OH(-)concentration as observed similar to 2 on the base oxide (i.e. MnMoO4) does not change.

Very recently, few-layer and single-layer Fe3GeTe2 have been successfully exfoliated from its bulk and revealed as 2D ferromagnets (Nature 2018, 563, 94; Nat. Mater. 2018, 17, 778). Here, the basal plane of Fe3GeTe2 is demonstrated to be of high electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) without resorting to any chemical modifications, by means of systematic density functional theory computations. The Fe3GeTe2 nanosheet preserves the metallic character of the bulk, and its 2D layered structure provides abundant exposed active sites to catalyze OER. All these unique characteristics suggest that the Fe3GeTe2 nanosheet may be an excellent catalyst for electrochemical OER. More importantly, it is found that the self-reduction of surface hydroxyl into water can significantly reduce the overpotential for OER, which greatly boosts the OER activity. This work not only reveals new mechanisms for OER but also opens the door for the application of emerging 2D ferromagnets in the field of energy storage and conversion.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000483937300001

The sustainable production of hydrogen fuel from electrochemical water splitting requires the development of a highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst with low overpotential that drives electrochemical redox reactions. Electrochemical water splitting using highly active nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) catalyst having a very high turnover frequency and mass activity is considered as a potential contender in the area of electrocatalysis owing to the practical challenges including high efficiency and long durability at low overpotential, which shows great potential in future hydrogen economy. This review includes certain recommendations on enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of NiFe LDH-based electrocatalyst, particularly through morphology engineering, construction of hierarchical/core-shell nanostructures, and doping of heteroatoms through combined experimental assessment and theoretical investigations, which in turn improve the electrocatalytic performance. Finally, emphasis is made on the bifunctional activity of the NiFe LDH catalyst for overall water splitting. At the end, the conclusions and future outlook for the design of the NiFe LDH catalyst towards scale-up for their use as electrolyzer at the industrial level are also discussed.									87	5	0	0	5	0	87			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000618794400003

In this paper, the flower-like Ni0.7Co0.3P architecture consisted of self-assembled nanosheets with numerous holes was fabricated by a facile hydrothermal-phosphorization method. The nanoflowers with open architecture and rippled nanosheets with numerous holes can enlarge the efficient reaction interface area and facilitate the mass transport, boosting the efficiency for water splitting. The obtained Ni0.7Co0.3P electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performances for both OER and HER in alkaline media with low overpotentials of 230 and 105 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), as well as small Tafel slopes of 78 and 58 mV dec(-1), respectively. Moreover, the resultant catalyst demonstrates excellent durability, maintaining a steady overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) after testing for 25 h toward both OER and HER. The exceptional electrocatalytic properties of Ni0.7Co0.3P nanoflowers can be explained by the following two points: (i) the exposure of abundant electroactive sites in the 3D flower-like architectures assembly by nanosheets with numerous defective holes, and (ii) the promoted kinetics of OER and HER achieved by the partial Co substitution and moderate electron delocalization.									22	3	0	0	2	0	23			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000487838900004

The lattice oxygen (O2-) site on the stoichiometric La2O3 surface activates CH(4)via heterolytic C-H bond cleavage to yield CH3- and H+ fragments, which bind to surface Lewis acid (La3+) and Bronsted base (O2-) sites, respectively. In the presence of the H+ fragment, the CH3- fragment binds quite strongly to the above La2O3 surface, but O-2 adsorption facilitates its desorption as a gaseous CH3 radical at relatively low reaction temperatures, while molecular O-2 adsorbed at the La3+ site becomes a superoxo radical (O-2 & x2d9;(-)) species. This O-2 & x2d9;(-) species reacts with a second CH4 molecule via direct H abstraction to produce another gaseous CH3 radical, accompanied by its transformation into a hydrogenperoxo (HO2-) species, which transfers an O atom to a neighboring O2- site and converts the latter into a peroxo (O-2(2-)) site. Whereas CH4 activation at the O2- site is essentially an acid-base reaction, that at the O-2(2-) site is clearly a redox reaction, which occurs via an O insertion mechanism to directly form gaseous CH3OH as further confirmed by our ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations. CH3OH is further oxidized by an additional O-2(2-) site to yield CO2 following a similar mechanism, whereas CO may form from dehydrogenation of the CH2O intermediate at the same site. Thus, the O-2(2-) site is proposed to be responsible for complete oxidation of CH4 in the OCM reaction, whereas the O2- and O-2 & x2d9;(-) sites are responsible for the formation of gaseous CH3 radicals and thus C-2 products. Our proposed catalytic mechanism is based on first principles DFT calculations, which gives a comprehensive view of CH4 interaction with the different oxygen species on the La2O3 catalyst surface, and provides critical insights into the possible evolution of surface oxygen species and the detailed surface reaction network.									13	3	0	0	1	0	14			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000530288800026

In the Fe3C@Fe,N,S-GCM nanocomposite, the Fe3C nanoparticles are uniformly anchored on the Fe,N,S-codoped graphene-like carbonaceous matrix. Synergetic multiple electrocatalytic active sites of Fe3C, Fe-N-x and N,S-co-doped carbon are identified for Fe3C@Fe,N,S-GCM. The Fe3C@Fe,N,S-GCM nanocomposite also possesses the high BET surface area and meso/macropore volume from the hierarchical porous superstructure, which may benefit the storing and transport of electrolyte ions. Attributed to the rational content and microstructure, the Fe3C@Fe,N,S-GCM presents a high bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the Delta E (= E-OER - E-ORR) of only 0.750 V. The bifunctional electrocatalytic activity is not only better than the commercial precious metal couples of RuO2 (OER) and Pt/C (ORR), but also represents the superiority among the non-precious metal ferrous bifunctional electrocatalysts.

The horizontal design features a horizontally positioned ORR electrode and a vertically positioned OER electrode, allowing effective management of oxygen transport and pressure. The ORR catalyst (MnOx) and OER catalyst (Co-Fe alloy) are fabricated via one-step electrodeposition on carbon paper and Ni foam, respectively. MnOx is identified as a combination of Mn3O4 nanorods and alpha-Mn2O3 spheres. Co-Fe is deposited as a solid solution film with an oxidized surface. Electrochemical tests show that both catalysts have comparable or even better activity than their commercial Pt-Ru catalyst counterpart. The catalysts are cycled at 20 mA cm(-2) to examine their durability. Cycling potential affects catalyst durability, with improved lifetime under separate ORR and OER conditions compared with the full ORR-OER voltage range. The fabricated catalysts are assembled into a Zn-air battery for discharge-charge cycling tests and show the same average efficiency (58%) as commercial Pt-Ru catalysts.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000438000100014

Herein, sulfur-doped bimetal FeCo phos-phide nanoparticles dispersed on N,P,S-tri-doped graphene (donated as S-FeCo3P/NPSG) are rationally prepared through a controllable one-step carbothermal-phosphorization strategy. The modified charge distribution and electron-donor properties of S-FeCo3P/NPSG caused by S decoration render a significantly beneficial effect on the electrocatalytic activities. Consequently, the S-FeCo3P/NPSG electrode exhibits extraordinary bifunctional activities toward oxygen electrochemistry of the OER overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and the ORR half-wave potential of 0.83 V, approaching to that of noble-metal IrO2 (289 mV) and Pt/C (0.84 V), respectively, but with more stronger operation stability in alkaline media. When S-FeCo3P/NPSG serves as the air cathode for liquid-state Zn-air battery, the large peak power density and energy density, as well as superb discharge-charge durability (cycling life > 600 h) of this device are obtained. Furthermore, all-solid-state Zn-air battery with S-FeCo3P/NPSG as air electrode also displays excellent mechanical flexibility, high power density and stable cycling stability. The self-reconstruction behavior of the S-FeCo3P/NPSG cathode catalysts is also investigated during the elec-trocatalytic Zn-air battery operation. This work would provide some novel inspiration from aspects of bonding and charge distribution for the rational construction of active and cost-efficient bifucntional oxy-gen electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion devices.

The characterization results show that the recombination of electron-hole pairs could be inhibited by the heterojunction structure. The LaVO4/g-C3N4 composite shows superior photocatalytic water splitting performance for the generation of hydrogen and oxygen under visible light irradiation. Experimental data show that under visible light irradiation, the hydrogen and oxygen evolution rates of the LVOCN1 composite are much higher than those of fresh carbon nitride. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of LaVO4/g-C3N4 composites could be significantly enhanced by O defects. Mechanism studies display that the possible mechanism of the photocatalytic water splitting reaction is the Z scheme mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000700449200001

Cyclic voltammetry experiments show that the current of oxygen evolution on Pb-Ca-Sn-Ce electrode is lower than that of Pb-Ca-Sn electrode in the same anodic voltage. Moreover, the oxygen evolution potential on the former electrode is greater than that on the latter, and this means that Cc can increase the potential of oxygen evolution on Pb-Ca-Sn alloy. The AC impedance experiments show that Cc can also enhance the resistance of hydrogen evolution on Pb-Ca-Sn electrode, i.e., Ce can inhibit the hydrogen evolution on Pb-Ca-Sn electrode. The reason why Ce decreases the volume of hydrogen evolution on Pb-Ca-Sn alloy is that Ce increases the resistance of absorbing step of hydrogen evolution reaction. All the experimental results indicate that Pb-Ca-Sn-Ce alloy can rapidly decrease the oxygen and hydrogen evolution on Pb-Ca-Sn-Ce alloy. It is concluded that Pb-Ca-Sn-Ce alloy can promote the maintenance-free property of lead acid battery, and can serve as the candidate of the grid material for maintenance-free lead acid battery.									11	3	0	0	0	0	13			1002-0721			WOS:000237335200022

Herein, we design an unreported hydrate-melt Li-O-2 battery without use of an unstable organic solvent. Its redox reaction depends on the formation of Li2O2 in high yield (96%) and its full decomposition. The designed battery shows an ultralow charge potential of similar to 3.16 V, a high discharge capacity of 38 mAh cm(-2), and stable cycling ability. After careful comparison of the discharge and charge products by XRD, SEM, Raman, FTIR, NMR, and quantitative titration, the great improvement in performance is attributed to the efficient avoidance of side reactions related to organic solvent degradation, which may be the primary cause of the high charge potential in a nonaqueous Li-O-2 battery. These results should initiate a deep understanding of Li-O-2 batteries and indicate another strategy toward practical Li-air batteries with moisture-proof properties and high safety.									21	2	0	0	1	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000424735000043

Herein we report an in-situ growth of the ternary NiCoFe-layered double hydroxide nanosheets on surface etching nickel foam (NiCoFe LDHs/NF) without adding any nickel precursor. In this method, etching Ni matrix by Fe3+ not only provides the slowly released nickel ions, but also intensifies the Fe-Niinteraction between the directly grown active species and Ni foam. Therefore the composition, electronic structure, and morphology of the electrocatalysts can be easily regulated only by adjusting Co2+ :Fe3+ ratio in the precursor solution. The obtained NiCo1Fe1 LDH/NF, which is formed in 1:1 Co2+ :Fe3+ solution, has highest content of Ni3+ and Co3+ active sites and the largest electrochemical active area. It exhibits an outstanding OER performance with a small overpotential of 231 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent durability at 50 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution.

Rationally designed catalysts with rich active sites and high intrinsic activity have been considered as a hopeful strategy to address the sluggish kinetics for OER. However, constructing such active sites in non-noble catalysts still faces grand challenges. To this end, we fabricate a Ni2P@Fe2P core-shell structure with outperforming performance toward OER via chemical transformation of rationally designed Ni-MOF hybrid nanosheets. Specifically, the Ni-MOF nanosheets and their supported Fe-based nanomaterials were in situ transformed into porous Ni2P@Fe2P core-shell nanosheets composed of Ni2P and Fe2P nanodomains in homogenous dispersion via a phosphorization process. When employed as the OER electrocatalyst, the Ni2P@Fe2P core-shell nanosheets exhibits excellent OER performance, with a low overpotential of 238/247 mV to drive 50/100 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 32.91 mV dec(-1), as well as outstanding durability, which could be mainly ascribed to the strong electronic interaction between Ni2P and Fe2P nanodomains stabilizing more Ni and Fe atoms with higher valence. These high-valence metal sites promote the generation of high-active Ni/FeOOH to enhance OER activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000858753500001	36144941

Here we report the direct growth of heterostructural Ni2P-Fe2P hybrid electrocatalysts on NiFe foams. The redox engineered NiFe foam (rNF) significantly enhances the OER performance.

Meanwhile, it can maintain 100 mA cm(-2) for 24 h without obvious degradation. The morphology and composition of NFP/rNF after OER test were carefully studied.

LaFeO3 has attracted great interest as a promising electrocatalyst due to the abundance, low cost and non-toxity of Fe. But LaFeO3 bulk is almost inactive. Herein, we have developed a facile novel soft-template route to successfully prepare oxygen vacancies-enriched LaFeO3-x nanosheets which show a largely enhanced electrocatalytic activity on both ORR and OER. The electronic structure, bonding and coordination environment of O, Fe and La atoms have been comprehensively analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Li-O-2 battery with LaFeO3-x nanosheets as catalysts show a high specific capacity, low overpotential and long cycle stability owing to the synergy of oxygen defect, Fe valence modulation and 2D nanosheets engineering. DFT calculation further reveals that oxygen adsorption will more likely occur on vacancy sites. In addition, the overpotential can be further lowered to about 0.6 V by LiI making the Li-O-2 battery with the catalysis of LaFeO3-x more practical. This study presents some insights into designing the efficient electrocatalysts for Li-O-2 battery through an integration of defect engineering, 2D nanosheets architecture and metal valence modulation.

The mutually beneficial Ni3Fe-Co9S8 bifunctional active components efficiently balance the performance of oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER), in which Co9S8 promotes the ORR and Ni3Fe facilitates the OER This balance behavior has an obvious advantage over that of monocomponent Ni3Fe/rGO and Co9S8/rGO catalysts. Meanwhile, the additional synergy between porous rGO aerogels and Ni3Fe-Co9S8 endows the composite with more exposed active sites, faster electrons/ions transport rate, and better structural stability. Benefiting from the reasonable material selection and structural design, the Ni3Fe-Co9S8/rGO exhibits not only outstanding ORR activity with the high onset- and half-wave potentials (E-onset = 0.91 V and E-1/2 = 0.80 V) but also satisfactory OER activity with a low overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (0.39 V). Moreover, rechargeable Zn-air cells equipped with Ni3Fe-Co9S8/rGO exhibit excellent rechargeability and a fast dynamic response.									61	2	0	0	0	0	61			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000457816900039	30652847

Herein, a flexible, binder-free composite air electrode for zinc-air batteries is reported, which utilizes a lightweight, conductive, and crosslinked aerogel film of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) functioned as a 3D catalyst-supporting scaffold for bifunctional cobalt (II/III) oxides and as a current collector. The composite electrode shows high catalytic activities for both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, resulting from the synergistic effect of nitrogen-doped CNTs and spinel Co3O4 nanoparticles. Solid-state Zn-air batteries assembled using such free-standing air electrodes (without the need of additional current collectors) are bendable and show low resistances, low charge/discharge overpotentials, and a high cyclic stability.									88	8	0	0	1	0	89			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000406795700004	28594437

Herein, we firstly fabricate a self-supported air electrode with manganese (Mn) doping nickel sulfide growing on the nickel foam (Mn-Ni3S2/NF) for ZABs via a facile approach. The optimized Mn-Ni3S2/NF electrode (S6M8) demonstrates an overpotential of 347 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), being lowest among those of the most of reported metal sulfides. Also, S6M8 shows an improved catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.63 V, compared with the pristine sample (0.61 V). The self-supported electrode of S6M8 can directly serve as the air cathode of the flexible quasi-solid-state ZAB after a facile hydrophobic treatment, which exhibits the high maximum power density (P-max = 75.8 mW cm(-2)), excellent charge-discharge property with a narrow charge-discharge voltage gap (0.86 V at 60 mA cm(-2)) and superior stability after 100 cycles. Moreover, the flexible ZAB with the self-supported electrode of S6M8 shows a superior charge-discharge reversibility among most of ZABs with the self-supported electrode. Our work sheds a light on the development of the low-cost self-supported air electrode for ZABs. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, the catalytic activity of LDHs needs to be further improved as the large lateral size and thickness of the bulk material limit the number of exposed active sites. However, the development of efficient strategies to exfoliate bulk LDHs into stable monolayer LDH nanosheets with more exposed active sites is very challenging. On the other hand, the intrinsic activity of monolayer LDH nanosheets can be tuned by surface engineering. Herein, we have exfoliated bulk CoFe LDHs into ultrathin LDH nanosheets through Ar plasma etching, which also resulted in the formation of multiple vacancies (including O, Co, and Fe vacancies) in the ultrathin 2D nanosheets. Owing to their ultrathin 2D structure, the LDH nanosheets expose a greater number of active sites, and the multiple vacancies significantly improve the intrinsic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).									648	55	0	0	32	0	657			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000400755800039	28429388

Herein, we construct a prismlike cobalt-iron layered double hydroxide (Co-Fe LDH) with a Co/Fe ratio of 3:1 utilizing a facile self-templated strategy. Instead of carbon-species-coupled treatment, we focus on ameliorating the intrinsic properties of LDHs as OER electrocatalysts accompanied by the hierarchical nanoflake shell, well-defined interior cavity, and numerous microporous defects. In contrary to conventional LDHs synthesized via a one-pot method, Co-Fe LDHs fabricated in this work possess a huge specific surface area up to 294.1 m(2) g(-1), which not only provides abundant active sites but also expedites the kinetics of the OER process. The as-prepared Co-Fe LDH electrocatalysts exhibit advanced electrocatalytic performance and a dramatic stability of the OER in an alkaline environment. In particular, the contribution of micropore defects is clearly discussed according to the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis, in which the time constant of the OER at the micropore defect is several orders of magnitude smaller than that at the exterior of Co-Fe LDHs, forcefully verifying the intrinsic catalytic activity enhancement derived from the micropore defects. This work provides a promising model to improve OER electrocatalyst activity via produce defects and research the contribution of micropore defects.									17	0	0	0	3	0	17			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000484073400040	31370394

Their potential applications range from biomedical, drug delivery, environmental, photocatalytic to energy storage sectors. Among these, investigations have largely focused on their behavior in environmental sensing, biosensing, and optoelectronics, yet energy storage and conversion systems are progressing rapidly as new promising methods are emerging to solve some of the outstanding challenges with energy at low cost and environmental footprint. By virtue of their rapid electron transfer and high surface area, CQD/GQDs are desirable in these electrochemical applications. Further, functional groups with rich heteroatoms (oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, boron) on OD carbon nanomaterials offer desirable active sites for enhanced electrochemical properties. Our review presents recent advances in the fabrication of CQD/GQD based composites for electrochemical systems, their mechanism of action, applications in energy storage (electrochemical capacitors, lithium/sodium ion batteries) and electrocatalysis (oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions, CO2 electroreduction, biofuel cells and electrochemical biosensors) with an analysis of their potential prospects.									105	8	0	0	7	0	106			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000503062400013

Two-dimensional cluster-based metal-organic layers (CMOLs) would have good performance in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) because of their stable and layered structure. Here, we first report the synthesis of CoNi bimetal two-dimensional CMOLs directly grown on Ni foam, which show excellent catalytic activity for the OER under alkaline conditions. Co0.6Ni0.4-CMOLs exhibited the best OER performance, compared with Co-CMOLs and Ni-CMOLs. The findings are expected to help understand the fundamental concept of enhanced electrochemical activity based on pristine metal-organic frameworks with high stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1466-8033		WOS:000663883600001

It is found that oxygen evolution rate varies in a non-linear way with Photosystem II excitation rate in this region, but asymptotically approaches a linear relationship (with a slope of one oxygen molecule per four excitations) as excitation rate increases. The asymptote gives an intercept (zero oxygen evolution rate) on the excitation rate axis. The question is raised, whether this model is compatible with photoautotrophy in a red alga found at 268 m depth and able to carry out photosynthesis in extremely weak light. It is found that no unorthodox mechanisms for the S-cycle in this alga have to be assumed to explain its performance.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0166-8595			WOS:A1995TQ94600024	24301583	
J	Wijethunge, D.; Lei Zhang; Cheng Tang; Aijun Du								Tuning Band Alignment and Optical Properties of 2D van der Waals Heterostructure via Ferroelectric Polarization Switching [arXiv]								arXiv								14 pp.	14 pp.						2 Sept. 2020	2020	Favourable band alignment and excellent visible light response are vital for photochemical water splitting. In this work, we have theoretically investigated how ferroelectric polarization and its reversibility in direction can be utilized to modulate the band alignment and optical absorption properties. For this objective, 2D van der Waals heterostructures (HTSs) are constructed by interfacing monolayer MoS2 with ferroelectric In2Se3. We find the switch of polarization direction has dramatically changed the band alignment, thus facilitating different type of reactions. In In2Se3/MoS2/In2Se3 heterostructures, one polarization direction supports hydrogen evolution reaction and another polarization direction can favour oxygen evolution reaction. These can be used to create tuneable photocatalyst materials where water reduction reactions can be selectively controlled by polarization switching. The modulation of band alignment is attributed to the shift of reaction potential caused by spontaneous polarization. Additionally, the formed type-II van der Waals HTSs also significantly improve charge separation and enhance the optical absorption in the visible and infrared regions. Our results pave a way in the design of van der Waals HTSs for water splitting using ferroelectric materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						INSPEC:20103858

Manganese oxides are suitable materials to be used as electrodes in such devices presenting an electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reactions close to Pt and, most importantly, being a low cost, abundant and environmentally friend material. However, as a drawback, manganese dioxide has low electrical conductivity thus requiring the combination with some highly conductive carbon support to be efficiently used as catalyst for the oxygen reactions in ESD. The low stability of carbon for water splitting reaction, however, limits the MnO2 to act as bifunctional catalyst. In this work, to overcome this problem, three and tetravalent cation doped (Bi3+, Ce4+) manganese dioxide nanorods exhibiting higher electrical conductivity were prepared and used as carbon free electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in alkaline medium. X-ray power diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) measurements were performed to determine the structure, morphology, surface chemical composition and band gap values of the catalysts confirming the formation of nanorod structures with lower band gap values (E-BG). The electrochemical results of Bi3+ and Ce4+ doped MnO2 confirmed that these materials have higher conductivity than K+1 doped MnO2 in agreement with the lower EBG inferred from DRS measurements. The electrocatalytic performance of doped electrocatalysts for the OER was close to that reported for conventional MnO2/C catalysts. On the other hand, they presented a remarkable performance for the ORR, higher than that presented by a commercial state of art Pt/C catalyst. The excellent catalytic performance was confirmed by Zn-air mini battery tests which presented a peak power density of 45 mW cm(-2), higher than that presented by a conventional MnO2/C 50 wt.% catalyst (40 mW cm(-2)).									29	2	0	0	2	0	30			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000487570000050

Cyclic voltammetric results showed that oxygen reduction occurred at the Ir(III)/Ir(IV) transition on IrO2 electrode. Evaluation of kinetic parameters in relation to Tafel lines allowed the formulation of a mechanism in which oxygen adsorbed on IrO2 electrode surface and the rate determining step was one-electron transfer as well as O-2 physisorbed to O-2(-) chemisorbed. The reaction order of oxygen reduction at low overpotential was -0.7 in OR concentration over pH range of 10.8-13.8; while that at high overpotential was practically pH independent. The reaction order in oxygen concentration was found to be one. Tire analysis of H2O2 production current efficiencies through galvanostatic electrolysis allowed the determination of the pathways of oxygen reduction as a function of current density and OH- concentration.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0256-1654			WOS:A1995RU48000005

Direct reaction of molecular oxygen is observed on the Pt(111) surface for the first time, as indicated by the desorption of nitrogen beginning at 130 Ii with a maximum rate at 145 Ii, below the molecular oxygen dissociation temperature, Direct reaction of hydrazine with adsorbed molecular oxygen results in the formation of water and nitrogen. With excess hydrazine, all surface oxygen is reacted, forming water. When only adsorbed atomic oxygen is present, the low-temperature nitrogen yield decreases by a factor of 3 and the peak nitrogen desorption temperature increases to 170 K, No high-temperature (450-650 K) nitrogen desorption characteristic of nitrogen atom recombination is seen indicating that during oxidation the nitrogen-nitrogen bond in hydrazine remains intact, as observed previously for hydrazine decomposition on the Pt(111) surface and hydrazine oxidation on rhodium. Two water desorption peaks are observed. characteristic of desorption-limited (175 K) and reaction-limited (200 K) water evolution from the Pt(lll) surface. For low coverages of hydrazine, only the reaction-limited water desorption is observed, previously attributed to water formed from adsorbed hydroxyl groups. When excess hydrazine is adsorbed. the usual hydrazine decomposition products, H-2, N-2 and NH3, are also observed. No nitrogen oxide species (NO, NO2 and N2O) were observed in these experiments, even when excess oxygen was available on the surface.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0039-6028			WOS:A1996UX92300019

Current synthetic strategies about electrocatalysts mainly target the single or double structural defects, while the researches about the synergistic effect of multiple structural defects are rare. In this work, the ultrathin NiFe layered double hydroxide nanosheets with a holey structure, oxygen vacancies and Ni3+ defects on nickel foam (NiFe-LDH-NSs/NF) are prepared by employing a simple and green H2O2-assisted etching method. The synergistic effect of the above three defects leads to the exposure of more active sites and significant improvement of the intrinsic activity. The optimized catalyst exhibits an excellent OER performance with an extraordinarily low overpotential of 170 mV at 10 mAcm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 39.3 mV.dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution. Density functional theory calculations reveal this OER performance arises from pseudo re-oxidized metal-stable Ni3+ near oxygen vacancies (O-vac), which suppresses 3d-e(g) of Ni-site and elevates d-band center towards the competitively low electron-transfer barrier. This work provides a new insight to fabricate advanced electrocatalysts for renewable energy conversion technologies.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000657607800002

Ir metal/hydroxide is significantly more active than Ir oxide, which may be due to oxide skins at the surface weakening O-binding relative to pure metal or oxide surfaces. Here we report a disparity in activity between Ir and Ir oxide in half-cells not observed in single-cells. Extended operation at elevated temperature and potential were found to result in oxide growth, limiting how surface differences affect electrolyzer performance. Comparisons of half- and single-cell testing were used to assess how well rotating disk electrode testing predicts membrane electrode assembly performance and durability. Although oxygen evolution activities in half-cells can translate to single-cells, standard rotating disk electrode test procedures can exaggerate the activity benefit of a metal/hydroxide surface relative to membrane electrode assembly performance under typical operating conditions; it also appears that a half-cell test cannot reasonably accelerate activity loss from continual operation. While a variety of novel catalyst approaches, including alloying, faceting, morphology, and supports can improve oxygen evolution kinetics, these results suggest that Ir surfaces at different oxide states may struggle to improve performance at the device level.

By examination of a number of common graphite materials used in battery cathodes it is found that both the type and the amount of graphite present in the electrode influence the self-discharge rate. Two competing self-discharge phenomena exist, namely, reaction of NiOOH with surface active sites on the graphite, as well as the graphite catalyzing oxygen evolution. Their respective contributions to the overall self-discharge are evaluated. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									11	2	0	0	0	0	12			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000251591000023

The influence of Ce content on the OER activity is investigated in terms of geometric and electronic factors. Ce can remarkably enhance the OER activity of CoOx due to the synergistic effect of surface area, Co3+ content, and metal-OH bond strength when the content of Ce is less than 60%. Co0.9Ce0.1Ox supported on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrate shows overpotential of 320 (2) mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution. The OER mechanism exploration reveals that the rate determining step changes with the Ce content due to the variation of metal-OH bond strength. This work sheds light on the design of high-performance yet cost-effective OER catalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, a facile method is developed to synthesize a series of trimetallic (W/Co/Fe) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived carbon nanoflakes (CNF) with various Fe content, and an Fe-dependent volcano-type plot can be drawn out for WCoFex-CNF. The optimized WCoFe0.3-CNF (when the feed ratio of Fe/Co is 0.3) demonstrates superior electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of only 254 mV@10 mA cm(-2) and excellent durability of 100 h. Further researches show that appropriate amount of iron doping can regulate the electronic structure, resulting in a favorable synergistic environment. This method may stimulate the exploration of electrocatalysts by utilizing MOFs as precursors while realizing electronic modulation by multimetal doping.									148	6	0	0	6	0	148			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000485338300001	31486591

However, the high-efficiency water splitting is limited by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been extensively utilized as precursors to synthesize high-performance electrocatalysts. Herein, a facile template-engaged strategy is adopted to fabricate hollow microspheres derived from a Co-MOF. After a thermally induced selenylation process under an argon atmosphere, the Co-MOF is successfully converted into CoSe2 microspheres at different temperatures. The optimized CoSe2-450 microspheres display excellent OER electrocatalytic performance in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution, exhibiting 10 mA cm(-2) at eta = 330 mV with a small Tafel slope of 79 mV dec(-1), even superior to those of a commercial IrO2 catalyst. Moreover, CoSe2-450 shows excellent durability without obvious decay after 1000 cyclic voltammetry cycles. This is due to the hollow interior of CoSe2 microspheres and well-distributed active sites, which can effectively offer space for fast mass transport and electron transfer.									138	8	0	0	5	0	140			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000406187800042

In this study, the influences of the electrolyte molarity and identity on the OER at alkaline to neutral pH were investigated at an appreciable current density of around 10 mAcm(-2), revealing both the clear boundary of reactant switching between H2O/OH-, owing to the diffusion limitation of OH-, and the substantial contribution of the mass transport of the buffered species in buffered mild-pH conditions. These findings suggest a strategy of electrolyte engineering: tuning the electrolyte properties to maximize the mass-transport flux. The concept is successfully demonstrated for the OER, as well as overall water electrolysis in buffered mild-pH conditions, shedding light on the development of practical solar fuel production systems.									31	0	0	0	0	0	31			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000414810200006	28846205

In this work, novel ionic cobalt and iron co-doped CDs (CoFe-CDs) were synthesized in a straightforward manner through the one-step hydrothermal treatment of cobalt gluconate and ferrous gluconate salts. The CoFe-CDs exhibited superior electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction activity with a small overpotential of 308 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), which is comparable and even lower than those of previously reported CDs/Co, Fe-based metal composites. The activity origin of Co-II sites and the synergistic effect of Fe-III within CoFe-CDs were fully understood by DFT calculations and XPS analysis, respectively. This work provides a strategy to construct active metal-ion-doped CDs with boosted electrocatalytic activities, and such new CDs might find potential in the field of energy storage.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			2196-0216			WOS:000466798700018

Microelectrode Diagnostics of Lithium-Air Batteries								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				161	3			A381	A392		10.1149/2.073403jes				2014	2014	We demonstrate that a microelectrode can be used as a diagnostic tool to optimize the properties of electrolytes for non-aqueous Li-air batteries, and to elucidate the influence of ion-conducting salts on O-2 reduction reaction mechanisms. Oxygen reduction/evolution reactions on carbon microelectrode have been studied in dimethyl sulfoxide-based electrolytes containing Li+ and tetrabutylammonium((C4H9)(4)N+) ions. Analysis of chronoamperometric current-time transients of the oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in the series of tetrabutylammmonium (TBA) electrolytes, TBAPF(6), TBAClO(4), TBACF(3)SO(3), TBAN(CF3SO2)(2) in DMSO revealed that the anion of the salt exerts little influence on oxygen transport. Whereas steady-state ORR currents(sigmoidal-shaped) were observed in TBA-based electrolytes, peak-shaped current-voltage profiles were seen in the electrolytes containing their Li salt counterparts. The latter response results from the combined effects of the electrostatic repulsion of the superoxide intermediate as it is reduced further to peroxide (O-2(2-)) at low potentials, and the formation of passivation films at the electrode. Raman spectroscopic data confirmed the formation of Li2O2 and Li2O on the microelectrode surface at different reduction potentials in Li salt solutions. Out of the four lithium electrolytes, namely LiPF6, LiClO4, LiCF3SO3, or LiN(CF3SO2)(2) in DMSO, the LiCF3SO3/DMSO solution revealed the most favorable ORR kinetics and the least passivation of the electrode by ORB. products.

Herein, we report carbon nanofiber supported NiCo nanoalloys encapsulated in a N-doped carbon, NiCo/CNF@NC catalyst, with multifunctional activities. Benefiting from the unique hybrid structure and synergistic coupling between nanoalloys and N-doped carbon which can effectively inhibit the aggregation and detachment of nanoparticles while generating additional active sites, the resultant catalyst demonstrates remarkable ORR, OER and HER performances. NiCo/CNF@NC displays ORR performance with a comparable onset potential of 1.00 V and superior operational durability than the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Additionally, the NiCo/CNF@NC catalyst exhibits OER activity with an overpotential of 0.40 V at 10 mA cm(-2) which is close to that of RuO2. The Zn-air battery based on the NiCo/CNF@NC catalyst delivers a specific capacity of 764 mA h g(Zn)(-1) with an energy density of 871 W h kg(Zn)(-1) at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the electrically rechargeable Zn-air battery operates with stable cyclic performance for more than 130 cycles. The water splitting device made of symmetric NiCo/CNF@NC catalyst coated nickel foam (NiCo/CNF@NC/NiF) electrodes has demonstrated an overall water splitting performance of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2) at a high catalyst loading of 4.6 mg cm(-2).									43	6	0	0	0	0	44			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000472455800009

In this work, NiCo2S4 spheres grown on N,S co-doped reduced graphene oxide sheets with sulfur vacancies (V-s-NiCo2S4/N,S-rGO) have been successfully fabricated through a facile solution method with post heat-treatment. As ORR catalyst, it presents more positive half-wave potential (0.84 V), smaller Tafel slope (43.8 mV dec(-1)) than that of pure NiCo2S4 nanoparticles (0.59 V and 75.6 mV dec(-1)) and N,S-rGO (0.54 V and 113.7 mV dec(-1)) in 0.1M KOH. As OER catalyst, the Vs-NiCo2S4/N,S-rGO only requires an overpotential of 340 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH. Significantly, as oxygen bifunctional electrocatalyst, the V-s-NiCo2S4/N,S-rGO provides a smaller potential difference (0.73 V) than that of pristine NiCo2S4 nanoparticles (1.11 V), N,S-rGO (1.36 V) and most non-precious electrocatalysts. The much improved electrochemical performance of the Vs-NiCo2S4/N,S-rGO for both OER and ORR in 0.1 M KOH could be ascribed to considerable high-valence Ni3+ and Co3+ in spinel-type material and sulfur vacancies, which can improve electrical conductivity and increase the exposure of metal active sites, respectively, and thereby facilitate catalytic process. This work provides a feasible strategy to develop high-efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts with promising applications in rechargeable metal-air batteries and fuel cells. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To address this problem, NiFe LDH is synthesized and exfoliated into positively charged nanosheets, followed by assembling with negatively charged carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Under the effect of electrostatic interaction, NiFe LDH and CNTs layers are alternately stacked to form an intercalating heterostructure of NiFe LDH/CNTs. This unique configuration provides both sufficient active sites and efficient charge/electron transport channels for OER electrocatalysis. By tuning the relative amounts of NiFe LDH and CNTs, the optimized composite only needs a low overpotential of 234 mV (vs. RHE) to reach a current density of 10 mA cm-2, showing better OER activity than that of RuO2. The excellent performance should be attributed to the synergy between active NiFe LDH and conductive CNTs, as well as the intercalated structure with high accessible surface area.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0169-1317	1872-9053		WOS:000727750200005

Herein, novel trifunctional electrocatalysts of a hierarchically-structured Pt/NiO/Ni/CNT with ultrasmall Pt nanoparticles (similar to 2 nm) were synthesizedviasubstrate-enhanced electroless deposition. The resulting catalysts exhibited a higher ORR activity (half-wave potential at 0.942 V) than that of the benchmark commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) and a similar OER activity (overpotential of 350 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) to that of RuO(2)in alkaline media. Moreover, the newly-developed Pt/NiO/Ni/CNT catalysts also showed a high mass activity superior to Pt/C towards the HER in both acid and alkaline electrolytes. The Pt/NiO/Ni/CNT catalysts, when used for overall water splitting, self-powered by two Zn-air batteries with the Pt/NiO/Ni/CNT air electrodes connected into series, displayed superb performance with 1.61 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This work represents a breakthrough in the development of facile approaches to trifunctional catalysts from low-cost Earth-abundant materials for efficient energy conversion and storage.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000549588900021	32614020

Its electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and corrosion resistance were evaluated using galvanostatic polarization and ionic equilibrium method. The microcosmic morphology of the anodic layer during the polarization was observed using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The results indicate that this kind of composite anode displays particular anodic behaviors during the galvanostatic polarization due to the changes of surface state: A "potential valley" with the minimal potential of about 300 mV lower than that of Pb anode can be observed at the very beginning of the polarization; then the anodic potential gradually decrease. The stable potential after 72 h is 100-150 mV lower than that of Pb anode and comparable to industrial Pb-Ag (1.0%) anode. Furthermore, the corrosion resistance of the composite anode largely depends on the MnO2 content in deposit. The dissolution of Pb is very little at the early stage, then, after standing a period of heavy intergranular corrosion, a stationary PbO2-MnO2 composite layer will be formed on the anode surface, which is predicted to present satisfactory corrosion resistance in the long-time electrolysis.

Herein, oxygen plasma processing is conducted on MoSe2 nanosheets and the effects of the plasma parameters including ion energy and radical flux are investigated by plasma simulation and molecular dynamics (MD) to fathom the interactions between the plasma and catalyst. A moderate ion energy and flux produce doping effects leading to proper replacement of Se sites by oxygen atoms to balance vacancy generation. Consequently, the HER characteristics are improved as exemplified by a small overpotential of 165 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 55.2 mV dec(-1). Based on first-principles density-functional theory calculation, increased polarization and state density distributions close to the Femi level introduced by oxygen and vacancies reduce the bandgap and Delta G(H) at the Mo, Se, and O sites, consequently enhancing charge transfer between the catalyst and electrolyte. The results convey new fundamental knowledge about plasma surface functionalization of electrochemical catalysts and enable precise and optimal selection of plasma processing parameters to control and balance the active sites for efficient water splitting.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000627586500001

However, it suffers from slow kinetics due to the multistep proton-coupled electron-transfer processes. Electrochemical activation is often used to obtain highly effective electrocatalysts with various precatalysts including sulfides and metal-organic frameworks, while details for the related phase transformation are often overlooked. Herein, micro-/nanoscale building blocks of Fe/Co-based 8-hydroxyquinoline compounds were loaded on a copper foam acting as a precatalytic electrode for oxygen evolution. The obtained precatalytic electrode can be activated in situ and shows an excellent catalytic activity for OER with an overpotential of 247 mV for 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. The phase transformation of the catalytic electrode during the OER operation was carefully investigated.

Herein, an exceptionally efficient trifunctional metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) catalyst electrode, composed of a hierarchical carbon matrix embedding isolated nickel atoms with nickel-iron (NiFe) clusters, is presented. 1D microfibers and nanotubes grow sequentially from 2D nanosheets as sacrificial templates via two stages of solution- and solid-phase reactions to form a 1D hierarchy. Exceptionally efficient bifunctional activity with an overpotential of only 13 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and an overpotential of 210 mV at 30 mA cm(-2)toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is obtained, surpassing each monofunctional activity ever reported. More importantly, an overpotential of only 126 and 326 mV is required to drive 500 mA cm(-2)toward the HER and OER, respectively. For the first time, industrial-scale water splitting with two bifunctional catalyst electrodes with a current density of 500 mA cm(-2)at a potential of 1.71 V is demonstrated. Lastly, trifunctional catalytic activity including oxygen reduction reaction is also proven with a half-wave potential at 0.848 V.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000563928200004	33439543

Nevertheless, the monotonic performance and insufficient stability hinder their practical application in rechargeable batteries. Herein, we simultaneously combine Ni(Fe)OOH and Ni/Fe-N-C active sites together into 3D interconnected core-shell nanochains (Ni2Fe1@PANI-KOH900). The obtained catalyst exhibits robust activity and durability in both OER and ORR reactions with a startlingly low overpotential of 240 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (E-j=10 = 1.47 V vs. RHE) and a more positive half-wave potential (E-1/2 = 0.92 V vs. RHE), superior to those of the benchmark RuO2 and Pt/C catalysts. The potential gap (Delta E = E-j=10 - E-1/2) is merely 0.55 V. Intensive investigations through in situ confocal Raman and HTEM-HAADF techniques indicate that the Ni(Fe)OOH and Ni/Fe-N-C active species as well as the unique 3D interconnected network-like structure are responsible for the state-of-the-art OER and ORR performances. Furthermore, the assembled rechargeable Zn-air battery comprising Ni2Fe1@PANI-KOH900 exhibits unprecedented superior charging-discharging performance and durable cycle life, holding great potential for energy conversion and storage devices.									50	3	0	0	2	0	50			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000481578000031

Here, simple hydrothermal and hydrogen reduction methods were used to fabricate a uniform distribution of Fe-doped MoO2/MoO3 sheets with abundant oxygen vacancies and heterojunctions on etched nickel foam (ENF). The FeMoO2/MoO3/ENF exhibited a small over potential of 36 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), an excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 310 mV at 100 mA cm-2 and outstanding stabilities of 95 h and 120 h for the HER and OER, respectively. As both cathode and anode catalysts, the heterogeneously structured FeMoO2/MoO3/ENF required a low cell voltage of 1.57 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that Fe doping and MoO2/MoO3 heterojunctions can significantly reduce the band gap of the electrode, accelerate electron transport and reduce the potential barrier for water splitting. This work provides a new approach for designing metal ion doping and heterostructure formation that may be adapted to transition metal oxides for water splitting.

Herein, the ethylenediaminetetraacetic cobalt complex as a precursor to synthesize ultrafine Co3O4 nanoparticles encapsulated into a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (NC) composites is presented. The as-prepared Co3O4/NC-350 obtained by pyrolysis at 350 degrees C demonstrates superior rate performance (372 mAh g(-1) at 5.0 A g(-1)) and high cycling stability (92% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 1.0 A g(-1)) as anode for LIBs. When evaluated as an electrocatalyst for OER, the Co3O4/NC-350 achieves an overpotential of 298 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The NC-encapsualted porous hierarchical structure assures fast and continuous electron transportation, high activity sites, and strong structural integrity. This works offers novel complex precursors for synthesizing transition metal-based electrodes for boosting electrochemical energy conversion and storage.									16	2	0	0	1	0	16			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000488518400001	31565859

Herein, a universal strategy for a class of metal wavy nanowires (NWs) for the enhanced electrocatalysis is reported. Benefiting from the structural features of ultrathin nature and numbers of defects, the obtained NWs generally exhibit attractive performances in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction at pH-universal conditions. More significantly, the optimized Ru O-2 NWs-Ir NWs electrolyzer shows superior performance for overall water splitting with only cell voltages of 1.50 and 1.47 V in 0.05 and 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.56 and 1.49 V in 0.1and 1 M KOH at 10 mA cm(-2), much lower than those of the Ir/C-Pt/C electrolyzer. First-principles calculations reveals that the appearance of Ru-atom point defects on RuO2(200) surface will lower the OER overpotential during which the adsorption free energies of OER intermediates are weakened due to the right-shift of d-band center. The RuO2 NWs-Ir NWs electrolyzer also exhibits excellent durability in long-term electrolysis, showing exciting prospect for water splitting in different pH electrolytes.									49	4	0	0	1	0	49			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000446550700011

The mechanism of its electron transfers and oxygen evolution including the structure of the protein and rates of the S-state cycle has been extensively investigated. Substantial progress has been made; however, the thermodynamics of PS II electron transfer and of the oxygen cycle are poorly understood. Recent progress in thermodynamic measurements in photosynthesis provides novel insights on the enthalpic and entropic contribution to electron transfer in proteins. In this review the thermodynamic parameters including quantum yield, enthalpy, entropy, and volume changes of PS II photochemistry determined by photoacoustics and other laser techniques are summarized and evaluated. Light-driven volume changes via electrostriction are directly related to the photoreaction in PS II and thus can be a useful measurement of PS Il activity and function. The enthalpy changes of the reactions observed can be directly measured by photoacoustics. The apparent reaction entropy can also be estimated when the free energy is known. Dissecting the free energy of a photoreaction into enthalpic and entropic components provides critical information about mechanisms of PSI! function. Potential limitations and future direction of the study of the thermodynamics of PS II electron transfer and oxygen evolution are presented.

Herein, we have prepared a catalyst from high speed steel powder (HSSP) for OER in the alkaline medium (1 M KOH) which owns potential to replace the benchmark RuO2 catalyst. The HSSP was obtained through ball milling of high speed steel (HSS) alloy was characterized for physico-chemical and electrochemical catalytic properties. The physico-chemical characterizations reveal that HSS has Fe as major constituent and Cr, Mo, W, V and C as minor constituents which are uniformly distributed in the whole alloy. Electrochemical studies indicate that HSSP has 439 +/- 20 and 359 +/- 2 mV of overpotential ( 77) at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) initially and after 50 h study of OER in 1 M KOH. This initial and 50 h study of 77 is comparatively higher than the benchmark RuO2 catalyst under identical measurement. This study reveals that HSSP acts as a pre-electrocatalyst due to the presence of electrocatalytically active minor constituents of Cr, Mo, W and V with major content of Fe. It can be considered as a possible alternative to the high cost and precious RuO2 catalyst for OER and can also be utilized in other catalytic applications in alkaline medium. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been demonstrated that the used deposition procedure provides porous and amorphous samples with a strict control of the total catalyst load and Co/Cu ratio. Electrocatalytic tests showed a maximum performance for the oxygen evolution reaction at Co/Cu atomic ratio around 1.8. The optimized anodic catalyst presented a long-term stability confirmed by accelerated lifetime tests together with the chemical surface analysis of the used samples. The effect of the crystallization of a single layer CuxCo3-xO4 and a multilayer (CuO/Co3O4)(n) anodic catalyst samples was also investigated. The observed loss of catalytic performance found in both cases may prove that a particular local chemical environment around the Co and Cu sites acts as an efficient catalytic site for the oxygen evolution reaction. A catalyst film with the optimum Co/Cu atomic ratio was incorporated into a Membrane Electrode Assembly, using a sputtered Ni film as cathode. Current density values up to 100 mA cm(-2) at 2.0 V were obtained in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Upon normalization by the amount of catalyst, this performance is one of the highest reported in literature.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000459842800017

Developing efficient electrocatalysts is considered to be a feasible way. Here, we prepared Co and N co-doped carbon material from ZIF-8 via a two-step rout; in which Co is atomically dispersed into the ZIF-8-derived N-doped carbon matrix. This obtained single atom Co-N-C catalyst was applied as an efficient catalyst for the lithium-oxygen battery. The Co-N-C cathode lithium-oxygen battery can deliver a high platform of 2.7 V during discharge, and the charging platform is below 4 V. Co-N-doped carbon can improve the work function of the carbon material, effectively reduce overpotential of both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, and thus improve the performance of the lithium-oxygen battery.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000563095800104

Although modulating active sites and electron transfer is of great significance to boost electrocatalysis activity, it still remains a big challenge to desirably actualize this goal. Herein, engineering of active sites and electronic framework is implemented via oriented modulation of crystal planes and construction of lacunaris architecture supported by ammonification-elicited simultaneous incorporation of nitrogen and oxygen-defect strategy. The new class porous nitrogen-incorporated Fe2PO5 with oxygen-defect (N-Fe2PO5-x) polyhedron with dominantly exposed {110} reactive facets exhibits superior performance toward water oxidation, achieving current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) at quite low overpotentials of 235 and 315 mV in alkaline and neutral media, respectively. Furthermore, density functional theoretical calculations reveal the energetically favorable {110} planes of lower absorption energy of intermediates and remolding of electronic density framework arising from the ammoniated elicitation process, contributing to excellent OER performance of lacunaris N-Fe2PO5-x polyhedrons. This work may offer a feasible guideline for regulating active sites and electron transfer to develop low-cost and highly efficient OER electrocatalysts in energy conversion systems.									31	3	0	0	0	0	32			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000442731200004

The presence of a binder, however, may influence the properties of the materials under examination to an unknown extent. Herein, we investigate the impact of Nafion on a highly active ORR/OER catalyst consisting of MnFeNi oxide nanoparticles supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Electrochemical studies revealed that, in addition to enhancing the mechanical stability and particle connectivity, Nafion poses a major impact on the ORR selectivity, which correlates with a decrease in the valence state of Mn according to X-ray absorption spectroscopy. These findings call for awareness regarding the use of electrode additives, since in some cases the extent of their impact on the properties of electrode films cannot be regarded as negligible.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-0216			WOS:000690906100029	34595088

Pyrolysis of a nanocubic prussian blue analogue precursor (KmMnx[Co(CN)(6)](y)center dot nH(2)O) embedded in a bisphenol A and aniline-based pBO led to the formation of a N-doped carbon matrix modified with MnxCoyOz nanocubes.

Metal modified N-doped carbon materials have attracted tremendous interest due to the evidently improved activities and fascinating features, whereas the development of facile and efficient fabrication methodologies is still highly challenging. Herein, we elaborately developed a reliable and scalable graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-templated method to prepare uniformly dispersed N-coordinated metal (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, Mo and Sn) species in porous carbon nanosheets (M-N-C PCSs) using cost-effective and sustainable polyacrylonitrile (PAN) as a heteroatom precursor and carbon source. With the assembly of sufficiently distributed N-coordinated metal species, and advanced porous nanosheet architectures, the as-synthesized M-N-C PCSs, especially Fe-N-C PCSs, exhibit an outstanding catalytic efficiency for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in an alkaline medium, even competing with the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts and recently reported highly active non-noble electrocatalysts, thus possessing an ability to work as an air cathode for rechargeable Zn-air batteries with a large peak power density and high long-term durability. This reported synthesis approach will provide novel but facile guidance to the exploration and preparation of various porous carbon materials with an outstanding efficiency for diverse energy systems.									37	6	0	0	1	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000470928800015

CURRENT OPINION IN ELECTROCHEMISTRY				8				110	117		10.1016/j.coelec.2018.03.025				MAR 2018	2018	The adsorption energies of numerous species on homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts scale linearly with each other. Such linear dependence lowers the degrees of freedom in multistep reactions, greatly simplifying computational electrocatalysis models. The downside of scaling relations is that they limit the efficiency of electrocatalytic reactions. For instance, the scaling relation between *OOH vs *OH supposedly limits the oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER, ORR): while the energetic separation of these intermediates should ideally be 2.46 eV, on most catalysts it is similar to 3.20 eV. Thus, it is currently assumed that breaking such scaling relation might lead to significant enhancement of OER/ORR electrocatalysis. In this review, we evaluate this hypothesis using literature data. The analysis suggests that breaking the *OOH vs *OH scaling relation is a necessary yet insufficient condition to optimize OER/ORR electrocatalysts. Alternatively, we define a new descriptor: the electrochemical-step symmetry index (ESSI), the optimization of which effectively corresponds to low calculated overpotentials.									75	2	0	0	6	0	75			2451-9103			WOS:000442793300018

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Mossbauer, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) analysis supported that pyridine acts as an axial ligand to yield penta-coordinated catalytic active Fe sites. The impedance analyses show an increase in the double-layer capacitance (C-dl) value, corroborating the adsorption of the complexes to give FePc-Py-CNT. The evaluation of the electrocatalytic activity for the ORR was performed in both acid (0.1 M H2SO4) and basic (0.1 M KOH) media, while the evaluation of the OER activity was investigated only in alkaline medium. DFT studies revealed an increased length in the Fe-N binding of the pentacoordinate Fe-based site, leading to a decreased O-2-Fe binding energy, explaining the higher ORR and OER activity of FePc-Py-CNT relative to FePc-CNT.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000702488900001

In recent years, NiFe-based materials have proven to be excellent electrocatalysts for OER. Understanding the characteristics that affect OER activity and determining the OER mechanism are of vital importance for the development of OER electrocatalysts. Therefore, in situ characterization techniques performed under OER conditions are urgently needed to monitor the key intermediates together with identifying the OER active centers and phases. In this Minireview, recent advances regarding in situ techniques for the characterization of NiFe-based electrocatalysts are thoroughly summarized, including Raman spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Mcssbauer spectroscopy, Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, and surface interrogation scanning electrochemical microscopy. The results from these in situ measurements not only reveal the structural transformation and the progressive oxidation of the catalytic species under OER conditions, but also disclose the crucial role of Ni and Fe during the OER. Finally, the need for developing new in situ techniques and theoretical investigations is discussed to better understand the OER mechanism and design promising OER electrocatalysts.									262	18	0	0	14	0	267			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000458826100002	29665168

Herein, CuO MCSs enriched with O vacancies have been fabricated via an appealing metal-organic framework (MOF)-based topotactic alkalization route for the first time. Mechanism analysis indicates that the formation of the CuO mesocrystal superstructure undergoes a gradual structural evolution from nanocrystal to nanobelt and then to nanosheet with escalating order. The porous two-dimensional nanosheet coupled with mesocrystal characteristic endows CuO MCSs with rich surface active sites and significantly improved electric conductivity. When served as an OER electrocatalyst in the alkaline media, the CuO MCS exhibits an overpotential of 304 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a stable delivery of the OER current for more than 15 h, which surpasses most of the Cu oxide OER electrocatalysts ever reported. Theoretical calculations indicate that high OER activity of CuO MCSs can be traced to the modified electronic structure caused by the O vacancies, resulting in much enhanced Cu 3d-O 2p covalency as well as lifted d-band center, which alters CuO MCSs into a half-metallic nature with optimized binding strength toward O-containing intermediates for OER. This work could provide valuable insights into the design of other MOF-derived advanced catalysts for OER and beyond.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5				2574-0970		WOS:000668366800055

The present CoP nanoparticles, efficient alkaline hydrogen-evolving materials at the cathode, are revealed to experience unique metamorphosis upon anodic potential cycling in an alkaline electrolyte, engendering efficient and robust catalytic environments toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our extensive ex situ characterization shows that the transformed catalyst bears porous and nanoweb-like dispersed morphologies along with unique microscopic environments mainly consisting of discrete cobalt-oxo/hydroxo molecular units within a phosphate-enriched amorphous network. Outstanding OER efficiency is achievable with the activated catalyst, which is favorably comparable to even a precious iridium catalyst. A more remarkable feature is its outstanding long-term stability, superior to iridium and conventional cobalt oxide-based materials. Twelve-hour bulk electrolysis continuously operating at high current density is completely tolerable with the present catalyst.									350	13	0	0	17	0	351			2155-5435			WOS:000357626800020

Perovskite oxides have emerged as one of the promising bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, their bifunctional activity, especially towards HER, is still not meeting the anticipated energy efficiency. Herein, we highlight a facile and efficient surface modification approach for boosting the bifunctionality of perovskites for overall water splitting. The construction of amorphous cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)(2)) on the Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-delta(SFM) surface is conductedviaan atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology. The optimized crystalline core-amorphous shell structure only needs 384 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)for the OER and 322 mV at -10 mA cm(-2)for the HER in alkaline media. The optimized catalytic activity is probably due to the unique structure and the synergistic effect between Co(OH)(2)and SFM, resulting in the large electrochemical surface area, abundant oxygen vacancies and fast electron transfer. The cell assembled with Co(OH)(2)/SFM-NF as both cathode and anode electrodes delivers a low voltage of 1.60 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2)and remarkable stability over 68 h in practical operation, offering a viable alternative for overall water splitting.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000547297700048	32271859

Herein, the in situ growth of hexagonal copper-coin-shaped NiCoSe2@NiO@CoNi2S4@CoS2 on NF was successfully achieved via a simple and mild hydrothermal and calcination method. During the calcination process, the NiCo precursor was calcined using selenium powder as the Se source firstly and then using sublimed sulfur as the S source. The as-synthesized NiCoSe2@NiO@CoNi2S4@CoS2/NF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a lower overpotential of 310 mV@30 mA cm(-2). The better electrocatalytic activity of the electrocatalyst is associated with the well-defined hexagonal nano-copper-coin-shaped structure, great intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and synergetic effects among NiCoSe2, NiO, CoNi2S4 and CoS2. In addition, the as-obtained (NiCoSe2NiO)-Ni-@@CoNi2S4@CoS2/NF catalyst could be used as both the cathode and anode in a two-electrode water splitting cell, which can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.583 V. The electrode also shows good water splitting durability over 24 h with negligible degradation. The great OER performance and outstanding stability indicated that NiCoSe2@NiO@CoNi2S4@CoS2/NF may work as a promising OER electrocatalyst.									48	1	0	0	2	0	48			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451380800035

Herein, orthorhombic CCO NWs with rich oxygen vacancies (Vo-CCO NWs) have been manufactured by the self-photoetching approach under vacuum. Notably, the unsaturated coordinated cobalt centers, formed by destroying the interlayer carbonate ions bonded with Co species, act as the active sites, which can preferably adsorb and activate CO2 molecules, effectively inhibiting hydrogen evolution. Surprisingly, the Vo-CCO NWs manifest remarkable activity for CO2 reduction with a high CO evolution rate (1333.20 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) and remarkable selectivity (98.2%) under visible light irradiation. Insightfully, a typical Co-II/I reaction pathway can be demonstrated as the reduction mechanism supported by the combined evidence including in situ FTIR, CV, and in situ EPR results. This work provides a mild strategy for controllable oxygen vacancy generation on the surface of CCO, and also a deeper mechanistic study to understand the reaction process of PCR.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000695968000001

Herein, we demonstrate that the electrocatalytic water splitting efficiency could be significantly improved by constructing 2D reduced graphene oxide (RGO) supported NiP/Fe4P nanosheets as OER electrocatalysts through a facile wet chemical and subsequent in situ phosphating method. Impressively, using NiP/Fe4P/RGO composites, which are prone to displaying largely exposed surface active area and remarkably improved electrical conductivity to boost the electron transfer. As a consequence, the electrochemical measurements reveal that the NiP/Fe4P/RGO composites could enable water oxidation at an overpotential of 268 mV with a nominal current density of 10 mA cm(-2), along with outstanding long-term electrochemical stability. This work presents an advanced electrocatalyst with both high electrocatalytic OER activity and durability, which will allow us to produce hydrogen at low voltages in scale-up potential with the assistance of cost-effective electrocatalysts.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000737099500001

However, most OER catalysts are unstable in the acidic solution, while HER shows poor kinetics in the alkaline solution, which hinders the scale-up application of electro-catalytic water splitting. In this work, a CoP/Co3O4 heterostructure is firstly fabricated and then O and P defects are introduced via surface engineering (s-CoP/Co3O4). The as-prepared material was employed as the catalyst towards electrochemical water splitting in an alkaline environment. In alkaline HER, a current density of -10 mA cm(-2) can be achieved at an overpotential of 106 mV vs. RHE. In the OER process, the overpotential of s-CoP/Co3O4 electrode is only 211 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, and the corresponding Tafel slope is only 58.4 mV dec(-1) so that the s-CoP/Co3O4 electrode could be used as the bifunctional catalyst for alkaline water splitting. This work provides a simple and low-cost approach to fabricate a Co-based heterojunction electrode with unsaturated metal sites to improve the electro-catalytic activities towards water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000721932500001	34817488

We report the synthesis of a variety of nanoparticulate LaCo1-xFexO3 perovskite materials through a specifically optimized spray-flame nanoparticle synthesis method, using different ratios of La, Co, and Fe precursor compounds. Structural characterization of the resulting materials by XRD, TEM, FTIR, and XPS analysis revealed the formation of mainly perovskite-type materials. The electrocatalytic performance of the formed perovskite-type materials towards the oxygen evolution reaction and the ethanol oxidation reaction was investigated by using rotating disk electrode voltammetry. An increased Fe content in the precursor mixture leads to a decrease in the electrocatalytic activity of the nanoparticles. The selectivity towards alcohol oxidation in alkaline media was assessed by using the ethanol oxidation reaction as a model reaction. Operando electrochemistry/ATR-IR spectroscopy results reveal that acetate and acetaldehyde are the final products, depending on the catalyst composition as well as on the applied potential.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			2196-0216			WOS:000481928500028

In contrast to OER, alcohol oxidation reactions can be implemented at lower applied potentials along with generating higher value-added byproducts than oxygen. Here, the ultrafine Ni/WC hybrid nanoparticles (NPs) were successfully synthesized via an in situ trapping and space-confinement pyrolysis strategy. The as-synthesized Ni/WC hybrid NPs exhibit high electrooxidation performances in oxidizing methanol, ethanol, iso-propanol, ethylene glycol, and propylene glycol in alkaline solution. Particularly, for the methanol oxidation reaction, Ni/WC NPs demonstrate high reaction activity (specific activity: 325 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl/3.5 M KCl; mass activity: 1363 mA mg(-1)) and excellent stability (catalytic current drops similar to 6.8% after 4 h). In the first 6 h of the electrolysis process, methanol was effectively converted into formate with ca. 93.8% Faraday efficiency. Based on in situ IR spectra and control catalyst experiments, tungsten carbide (WC) and nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH, derived from Ni) species are capable of activating different functional groups of methanol. More interestingly, their hybrid structure (Ni/WC) demonstrates improved catalytic performance in converting methanol into a formate product for the synergistic effect.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000763584500006

Due to the sluggish anodic reaction of water splitting, exploration of high-efficiency and cost-effective electrocatalysts enabling low driving potential for hydrogen generation is highly desirable. Here, we report a bifunctional electrocatalyst consisting of two-dimensional NiCo-BDC nano sheet arrays coated with Ni-S thin layers, presenting promising catalytic activity and durability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Impressively, this anode could reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 229 mV in 1.0 M KOH for OER. For UOR, only a small potential of 1.31 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) is required for driving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea. Furthermore, a full electrochemical cell was constructed using the as-prepared catalyst as anode and the Pt/C as cathode. For overall water splitting, only a low potential of 1.53 V is required to gain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, whereas the urea-mediated electrolysis cell demonstrates a lower operating potentials of 1.46 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This work presents a solid step towards lowing the driving potential for hydrogen generation via water splitting.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2452-2627			WOS:000617915200002

Herein, nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon nanosheet/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrids have been synthesized by the pyrolysis of glucose, urea and CNTs. Impressively, in 0.1 M KOH, the resulting hybrids afford remarkable OER activities with a low onset potential (1.50 V vs. RHE) and an exceptional over-potential (only 320 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). Moreover, the same hybrids show comparable catalytic performance but better durability compared to the benchmark Pt/C (20 wt%) catalyst for ORR. The achieved ultrahigh catalytic performance of the hybrids originates from their large specific surface area (594.1 m(2) g(-1)), high content percentage of N doping (8.5 wt%), and mesoporous structure, which leads to fully exposed active sites, improved mass/electron transport capability, easy adsorption/release of oxygen gas bubbles, and high structural stability.

Herein, we demonstrate a hierarchical oxygen vacancy-rich WO3 with ldquonanowire array on nanosheet arrayrdquo (WO3 NWA-NSA) structure as a highly efficient catalyst for the OER. The vertical structure can not only highly improve the mass loading of WO3 catalysts on Ni foam, but also provide efficient paths and channels for electron and mass transfer, leading to superior catalytic activity. Besides, the oxygen vacancies in WO3 further promote the OER activity. The as-prepared WO3 NWA-NSA catalyst requires an extremely low overpotential of 0.23 V to achieve a benchmark of 10 mA cm-2, with a Tafel slope of only 33 mV dec-1, superior to most reported state-of-the-art nonprecious metal-based catalysts and noble oxide catalysts. Further theoretical modeling calculations indicate that the electronic structure of WO3 with oxygen vacancies fits extremely well with the requirements of OER catalysts. This facile strategy provides a new avenue toward the hierarchical design of electrocatalysts, and our research opens a brand-new field for the applications of WO3.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488			INSPEC:19559449

Perovskite oxides (ABO(3)) with versatile structures and multiple physicochemical properties have triggered considerable interest in the OER. The leaching of A site cations can create nanostructures and amorphous motifs on the perovskite matrix, thus facilitating the OER process. However, selectively dissolving A site cations and simultaneously obtaining more active amorphous motifs derived from the B site cations remains a great challenge. Herein, a top-down strategy is proposed to transform bulk crystalline perovskite (LaNiO3) into a nanostructured amorphous hydroxide by FeCl3 post-treatment, resulting in an extremely low overpotential of 189 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The top-down-constructed amorphous catalyst with a large surface area has dual NiFe active sites, where high-valence Ni3+-based edge-sharing octahedral frameworks are surrounded by interstitial distorted Fe octahedra and contribute to the superior OER performance. This top-down strategy provides a valid way to design novel perovskite-derived catalysts.									181	13	0	0	13	0	183			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000477972300022	31099042

The enhanced catalytic activity of the Li-bir/rGO composite can be ascribed to the elevated electrical conductivity of the birnessite suggested via a lower charge transfer resistance obtained from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Moreover, the local oxidation states of Mn in the Li-bir/rGO were investigated by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy during the ORR and OER processes. Interestingly, the generated oxygen gas from the OER process observed via the in situ gas chromatography of the Li-bir/rGO is 5.44 mmol g(-1) which is higher than that of the pristine Li-bir (4.98 mmol g(-1)). These results suggest that the Li-bir/rGO can be further utilized as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for high-performance metal-air batteries.

Catalyst is the key to the promotion and application of HER. However, the precious metal catalysts with good catalytic performance are expensive, and the preparation process of non-precious metal catalysts is extremely complicated. The simple preparation process is the most important problem to be solved in HER catalyst development. We synthetized cobalt oxide (CoOx) catalyst for HER through a simple hydrothermal process. The CoOx catalyst shows excellent HER catalytic activity. Characterization results reveal that there are a great deal of surface hydroxyl groups or oxygen vacancy on the surface of CoOx catalyst. In alkaline media the CoOx catalyst shows an over-potential of 112 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 94 mV dec(-1). This paper provides a simple and easy method for HER catalyst preparation.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2296-2646			WOS:000536693500001	32457876

Different morphologies such as nanograins, branched mesh-like architecture, and agglomerated nanograins with nanoporous are obtained for NiSSe, NiSe, and NiS, respectively. The overpotentials of 247, 266, and 329 mV (vs RHE) are obtained to attain a current density of 30 mA cm(-2) for NiSSe, NiS, and NiSe nanocomposites, respectively. Interestingly, ternary nanocomposite reaches a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) by operating only at an overpotential of 342 mV. The low Tafel slope of 175.7 mV dec(-1) reveals that the ternary nanocomposite consists of most favorable catalytic kinetics for mass and electron transport during the OER reaction. The improved catalytic performance of NiSSe nanocomposite is attributed to the synergy between electrochemcial surface area and improved electronic conductivity.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000502557100001

Of the two half-cell reactions in AEMWE, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is kinetically sluggish, requiring an electrocatalyst to promote the reaction. Nickel (Ni) is a promising non-noble metal catalyst for OER due to its low cost, high stability, and activity in alkaline media. In an AEMWE, Ni particles form a catalytic layer bound together using an anion exchange ionomer (AEI), which also serves to provide hydroxide ion transport throughout the layer. RESULTS In this review, reports of lab synthesized Ni particle-based anode catalytic layers with AEIs, used specifically in AEMWE devices, are summarized from 2015 onwards to highlight the recent research and development of active Ni-based AEMWE anodes. The synthesis and electrode fabrication method for the anodes is analyzed to offer a perspective on the feasibility of industrial scale AEMWE. As ionomeric binders are an important component of AEMWE anodes, the ionomer type and loading used with the Ni-based particles is also summarized with a focus on how those parameters affect catalytic performance. CONCLUSION The literature analysis performed in this work demonstrates the potential of the AEMWE process and provides recommendations for future work on furthering the current understanding of the interactions between the various components of the system. Additionally, it is recommended that future research efforts be focused on further understanding how developed materials perform in a working AEMWE device.

Herein, we report the synthesis of ultrathin CoMoP nanosheets through a simple ion etching and phosphorization method. The obtained catalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity and stability towards oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER), with overpotentials down to 273 and 89 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. The produced CoMoP nanosheets are also characterized by very small Tafel slopes, 54.9 and 69.7 mV dec(-1) for OER and HER, respectively. When used as both cathode and anode electrocatalyst in the overall water splitting reaction, CoMoP-based cells require just 1.56 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media. This outstanding performance is attributed to the proper composition, weak crystallinity and two-dimensional nanosheet structure of the electrocatalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000780628100001	35407217

The results demonstrate that the incorporation of Fe can effectively tune the morphology, composition, electronic structure, and electrochemical active surface area of the electrocatalysts, thus greatly enhancing the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. The optimal electrocatalyst (F0.25C1CH/NF) can deliver 10 and 1000 mA cm(-2) at very small overpotentials of 77 and 256 mV for HER and 228 and 308 mV for OER in 1.0 m KOH without significant interference from gas evolution. The F0.25C1CH-based two-electrode alkaline water electrolyzer only requires cell voltages of 1.45 and 1.52 V to achieve current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm(-2). The results demonstrate that such fascinating electrocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the increase in the catalytic active surface area, facilitated electron and mass transport properties, and the synergistic interactions because of the incorporation of Fe.									83	6	0	0	2	0	86			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000438706700016

However, its practical application is largely hindered by both the high reaction overpotential and severe electrochemical corrosion of the active centers. To overcome these limitations, innovative design strategies are necessary, which remains a great challenge. Herein, robust interface Ru centers between RuO2 and graphene, via a controllable oxidation of graphene encapsulating Ru nanoparticles, are presented to efficiently enhance both the activity and stability of the acidic OER. Through precisely controlling the reaction interface, a much lower OER overpotential of only 227 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic electrolyte, compared with that of 290 mV for commercial RuO2, but a significantly higher durability than the commercial RuO2, are achieved. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the interface Ru centers between the RuO2 and the graphene can break the classic scaling relationships between the free energies of HOO* and HO* to reduce the limiting potential, rendering an enhancement in the intrinsic OER activity and the resistance to over-oxidation and corrosion for RuO2.									68	5	0	0	4	0	68			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000533213700001	32419157

Herein, we have successfully prepared a novel nanohybrid consisting of Co2P nanocores encased in N,P-codoped carbon layers (denoted as Co2P@NPC) through an extremely facile and effective pyrolysis route utilizing easily available raw materials. The as-prepared Co2P@NPC exhibits excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performances for both ORR and OER in alkaline solution. For ORR, Co2P@NPC shows comparable activity to the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C in terms of the half-wave potential and limited current density under the identical linear sweep voltammetry measurement conditions. Moreover, the ORR durability and methanol tolerance of Co2P@NPC are much better than those of 20 wt% Pt/C. As regards OER, Co2P@NPC affords lower activity but better stability than the fresh RuO2. The high electrocatalytic performances originate from the strong interaction between Co2P nanocores and N,P-codoped carbon layers, the high BET surface area and the conductive network formed by the crosslinking of carbon coatings.

The rational construction of dual-functional catalysts is meaningful because most nanomaterials can perform only a single electrocatalytic activity. Herein, nitrogen (N)-doped carbon (C) nanotubes encapsulating CoNi alloy (CoNi@NCNTs) nanoparticles coupled with a cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni) dual atom hybrid are successfully designed and synthesized through a simple metal-organic-framework-assisted strategy, which are explored as a catalyst for ORR and OER. The optimized catalyst exhibits highly efficient bifunctional catalytic activity with a low voltage spacing of 0.78 V between an overpotential of 370 mV (at 10 mA/cm(2)) toward OER and a half-wave potential of 0.822 V toward ORR, as well as high durability. The excellent electrocatalytic performance should be attributed to the advantages of uniformly dispersed CoNi alloy nanoparticles, highly conductive nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes and the formation of metal-N (x) species. This work provides a novel strategy for rationally designing bifunctional catalysts for reversible energy conversion.									22	2	0	0	1	0	22			2050-6252	2050-6260		WOS:000601753900005

The meso-Co3O4 nanostructures showed high activity for OER in an alkaline medium (0.1 M KOH), which makes them comparable to the most active Ir/C catalyst and better than Co3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) and the Pt/C catalyst. Furthermore, meso-Co3O4 exhibited enhanced stability, compared to Co3O4 NPs. The enhanced activity and stability of meso-Co3O4 over Co3O4 NPs could be attributed to its high surface area and structural stability of the gyroid network structure in the meso-Co3O4 catalysts. The meso-Co3O4 nanostructures also showed promising activity for ORR and exhibited a methanol-tolerance superior to the Pt/C catalyst. The total overpotential of meso-Co3O4 for OER (at 10 mA cm(-2)) and ORR (at -3 mA cm(-2)) was 1.034 V, which is on a par with noble metal-based catalysts. This work demonstrates that directing metal oxides into mesostructures is a promising means of preparing highly active, stable, bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts that can potentially replace expensive noble metal-based catalysts. This design strategy can be extended to other reactions relevant to energy conversion and storage applications.									241	11	0	0	7	0	245			2050-7488			WOS:000322792900057

A high-intensity oxygen beam, produced by the 5 MV pelletron accelerator at the University of Notre Dame, impinged on a thick, ultrapure graphite target. Protons and. rays were simultaneously measured in the center-of-mass energy range from 3.64 to 5.01 MeV for singles and from 3.73 to 4.84 MeV for coincidence events, using silicon and Ge detectors. Statistical model calculations were employed to interpret the experimental results. The emergence of a new resonance-like broad structure and a decreasing trend in the S-factor data towards lower energies (opposite to previous data) are found for the C-12 + O-16 fusion reaction. Based on these results the uncertainty range of the reaction rate within the temperature range of late stellar burning environments is discussed.									16	2	0	0	0	0	16			2469-9985	2469-9993		WOS:000412515900007

However, the catalytic efficiency of pure CoSe2 is still far below what is expected, because of its poor active site exposure yield. Herein, we successfully overcome the disadvantage of insufficient active sites in bulk CoSe2 by reducing its thickness into the atomic scale rather than any additional modification (such as doping or hybridizing with graphene or noble metals). The positron annihilation spectrometry and XAFS spectra provide clear evidence that a large number of VCo? vacancies formed in the ultrathin nanosheets. The first-principles calculations reveal that these VCo? vacancies can serve as active sites to efficiently catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction, manifesting an OER overpotential as low as 0.32 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in pH 13 medium, which is superior to the values for its bulk counterparts as well as those for the most reported Co-based electrocatalysts. Considering the outstanding performance of the simple, unmodified ultrathin CoSe2 nanosheets as the only catalyst, further improvement of the catalytic activity is expected when various strategies of doping or hybridizing are used. These results not only demonstrate the potential of a notable, affordable, and earth-abundant water oxidation electrocatalyst based on ultrathin CoSe2 nanosheets but also open up a promising avenue into the exploration of excellent active and durable catalysts toward replacing noble metals for oxygen electrocatalysis.									792	50	0	0	44	0	798			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000344516600038	25310506

The Ni-Zn catalyst exhibits an extraordinary HzOR performance with a high current density of 970 mA cm(-2)at 0.7 V, and 93.8% of its initial activity after 5000 s, simultaneously delivering an overpotential of 68 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Moreover, the electrolytic cell is constructed employing Ni-Zn catalysts as both the anode and cathode, achieving 100 mA cm(-2)at an ultralow cell voltage of 0.497 V with an outstanding stability over 10 h. The superior electrocatalytic performance can be ascribed to its porous structure with large active surface area, high electrical conductivity, and most importantly the super-aerophobic nature of the Ni-Zn surface. This work also provides a novel approach to designing and constructing porous structured non-noble metal bifunctional electrocatalysts with super-aerophobic surface to be used for energy-saving hydrogen production.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000544640200001	32413873

In this study, firstly, we prepared CoFe-layered double hydroxide (CoFe-LDH) via one-step electrodeposition. The CoFe-LDH nanosheets grew on the nickel foam and formed a 3D hierarchical structure, making the CoFe-LDH exhibit excellent activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The overpotential was 250 mV and the Tafel slope is 35 mV dec(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline condition. With such a 3D porous structure as a framework, we fabricated CoFe phosphides using a solid-phase reaction. After phosphorization, the nanosheets retained the original 3D porous structure and electrochemical performance for hydrogen evolution reaction had been greatly enhanced. The overpotential in alkaline condition was 58 mV and the Tafel slope is 46 mV dec(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2). The CoFe-LDH and CoFe-P with Ni foams were used as asymmetric electrodes for overall water splitting. At the potential of 1.51 V, this electrolysis apparatus can reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, which is superior to all of the reported non-precious metal based ones.									72	7	0	0	4	0	74			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000457952600060

However, the relevant promotional mechanism remains unclear. Here, we investigated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) behaviors of nickel-based catalysts (Ni(OH)(2), NiO, and Ni) under an in situ applied magnetic field, by using a self-designed electrochemical system coupled with a vibrating sample magnetometer that can fine-tune the intensity of the magnetic field (0-1.4 T). It is revealed that the magnetoresistance (MR) effect caused by spin electron scattering is dominant in affecting the apparent electrocatalytic activity (in terms of overpotential) in the magnetic field-assisted OER process. Notably, the magnetic field-induced spin-polarized kinetics will be more distinct in the case that the first electron transfer step is the rate-determining step of the OER. As a result, the magnetic field assisted OER activity can be most enhanced for Ni (the overpotential to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) can be reduced by 20 mV at 1.4 T). Besides, the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect caused by the Lorentz force, and charge transfer effect at the electrode/electrolyte interface are very likely for all catalysts. These discoveries may emerge as an essential and comprehensive understanding of the magnetic field-involved electrochemical reactions and help in the rational design of "magnetic effect" catalysts.									8	0	0	0	1	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000729857700001

Herein, we present a bifunctional, thermally stable cesium-promoted mesoporous manganese oxide (Cs-MnOx) tuned by simple heat treatment from an amorphous to a crystalline phase with controlled surface and bulk active Mn centers. The Cs-MnOx material exhibited the highest ORR activity (0.87 V vs. RHE at -3 mA cm(-2)) among all noble-metal-free manganese oxide catalysts reported to date with superior activity compared to state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. In addition, Cs-MnOx exhibited comparable OER performance with the highly active Ir/C and RuO2 catalysts. Extensive characterization and density functional theory (DFT) computations suggested that the stabilization of the surface and bulk enriched Mn3+ species, increase of relative basicity and maintaining active crystalline phase due to Cs incorporation, are the main decisive factors for the profound ORR and OER activities. Findings from our study provide general guidance for designing of cost effective and active metal oxide based electrocatalysts.									97	3	0	0	2	0	97			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000367272800034

Accordingly, the exchange current density, the oxygen solubility, the diffusion coefficient and the corresponding activation parameters have been determined. H3PW12O40 manifests promising characteristics for the oxygen electroreduction process especially in terms of oxygen solubility (5.03 x 10(-6) mol cm-3 at 25-degrees-C) and H+ concentration (pK1 = 4.77 in HOAc) which account for high exchange current density values (8.63 x 10(-8) A cm-2 and 6.06 x 10(-7) A cm-2 at 25 and 60-degrees-C, respectively). A one electron process has been singled out as the rate limiting step for the oxygen reduction, suggesting that this reaction occurs on Pt under Langmuir conditions in phosphotungstic acid. The results are compared with those reported in the literature for concentrated H3PO4 and TFMSA solutions.									36	0	0	0	0	0	36			0013-4686			WOS:A1993LT54500008

Here, we demonstrate that the morphology of the catalyst layer is equally important in maintaining integrity of the catalyst coating during product formation in LOBs. We demonstrate this by comparing the performance of smooth, conformal coated Mn2O3 catalyst nanoparticles prepared by electric field-assisted deposition, and more irregular coatings using conventional film assembly techniques both on three-dimensional mesh substrates. Smooth coatings lead to an improved overpotential of 50 mV during oxygen reduction and 130 mV during oxygen evolution in addition to a nearly 2X improvement in durability compared to the more irregular films. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy combined with imaging studies elucidates a mechanism of morphology-directed deactivation of catalyst layers during charging and discharging that must be overcome at practical electrode scales to achieve cell-level performance targets in LOBs.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000412633100001	27831936

Cleaner and efficient recycling of waste lead-acid batteries is of significance in environmental protection and comprehensive recycling of resources. In this study, oxygen-enriched side-blow pool smelting technique was developed and innovatively employed to recycle lead battery paste. This study investigated the reaction mechanism of lead recycling in lead paste-CaO-FeO-SiO2-C reaction system. Therefore, the phase transformation and evolution of lead paste in oxidizing atmosphere were described in detail. XRD and SEM-EDS analysis results indicated that the whole reaction evolution can be summarized as follows: PbO and PbS were formed from PbSO4 in a weak oxidizing atmosphere through the thermal decomposition and reduction reactions. Then, the lead oxide formed was combined with slag-forming components (CaO, SiO2, and FeC2O4 center dot 2H(2)O) to generate new oxides phase. As the temperature increases, metallic lead was extracted and recycled through the reactions between lead sulfide and the new-formed oxide phase.					9th International Symposium on Lead and Zinc Processing (PbZn)9th International Symposium on Lead and Zinc Processing (PbZn)	FEB 23-27, 2020FEB 23-27, 2020	Minerals, Met & Mat Soc; MetSoc; GDMB; MMIJ; NFSocMinerals, Met & Mat Soc; MetSoc; GDMB; MMIJ; NFSoc	San Diego, CASan Diego, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2367-1181	2367-1696	978-3-030-37070-1; 978-3-030-37069-5	WOS:000661245700086

The Co-CH@NiFe-LDH/ NF electrode demonstrates excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances, which mainly result from the synergic effect between Co-CH and NiFe-LDH. The unique stepped hierarchical "rod-sheet" structure of CoCH@NiFe-LDH/NF not only benefits the inherent catalytic activity, but also enhances the electron transfer and increases the exposed active sites. Moreover, the superhydrophilic/superaerophobic joint properties of CoCH@NiFe-LDH/NF promote the diffusion of aqueous electrolyte and ensure the rapid release of bubbles. Furthermore, a water-splitting device has been assembled with commercial Pt/C/NF and Co-CH@NiFe-LDH/NF as cathode and anode, respectively, which can work stably for 200 h without obvious degradation. Hence, the strategy of engineering stepped hierarchical structures with synergistic effect may offer a new pathway to synthesizing highly efficient OER electrocatalysts.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000672571000005

Owing to its complex four-electron redox process, the OER process with sluggish kinetics often requires electrocatalysts to reduce the overpotential and promote the reaction rate. Herein, we have proposed an "all-inone" strategy to synthesize mutil-elemental perovskite oxides nanofibers (NFs) with hollow and porous structures by using electrospinning technology and Ostwald ripening approach. The hollow La0.7Sr0.3Co0.25Mn0.75O3 nanofibers (LSCM NFs) consist of large amounts of building block La0.7Sr0.3Co0.25Mn0.75O3 nanoparticles (LSCM NPs), forming the unique architecture and the morphologies can be engineering by adjusting the calcination temperatures and the heating rates. Notably, the hollow LSCM NFs prepared at 800 degrees C and 10 degrees C min(-1) demonstrated the excellent electrocatalytic performance, with overpotential of 340 mV at current density of 10mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 111mV dec(-1), as well as the long-term stability in alkaline electrolyte. The hollow NFs architectures exhibited a large specific surface area, a high porosity and a large inner space, which are beneficial for the OER, reducing the overpotentials and accelerating the electrode kinetics.

Studying the structure-activity relationship of defective electrocatalysts under operando conditions is crucial for understanding their intrinsic reaction mechanism and dynamic behavior of defect sites. Co3O4 with rich oxygen vacancy (V-O) has been reported to efficiently catalyze OER. Herein, we constructed pure spinel Co3O4 and V-O-rich Co3O4 as catalyst models to study the defect mechanism and investigate the dynamic behavior of defect sites during the electrocatalytic OER process by various operando characterizations. Operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) implied that the V-O could facilitate the pre-oxidation of the low-valence Co (Co2+, part of which was induced by the V-O to balance the charge) at a relatively lower applied potential. This observation confirmed that the V-O could initialize the surface reconstruction of V-O-Co3O4 prior to the occurrence of the OER process. The quasi-operando X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and operando X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) results further demonstrated the oxygen vacancies were filled with OH center dot first for V-O-Co3O4 and facilitated pre-oxidation of low-valence Co and promoted reconstruction/deprotonation of intermediate Co-OOH center dot. This work provides insight into the defect mechanism in Co3O4 for OER in a dynamic way by observing the surface dynamic evolution process of defective electrocatalysts and identifying the real active sites during the electrocatalysis process. The current finding would motivate the community to focus more on the dynamic behavior of defect electrocatalysts.									334	18	0	0	21	0	339			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000551495700024	32538073

Here, a new catalyst architecture comprising a nanoneedle network of iridium-containing oxides assembled into macroporous micrometric particles with approximate to 75% of porosity is reported. The rationally designed porous hierarchical structure optimizes the accessibility of reactants and products to the surface of the nanoparticles and maximizes catalyst activity. The materials are easily prepared from aqueous solutions by an industrially viable spray-drying route through an evaporation self-assembly mechanism. The versatility of the process enables the preparation of mixed oxides with low iridium content, particles with tunable crystallinity, and various iridium surface species with high electrochemical activity. Highly porous Ir0.7Ru0.3O2 outperforms commercial iridium oxide. These materials also represent an ideal platform to assess the reactivity of the iridium and oxygen species involved in the oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that these highly porous particles are optimal building blocks to be integrated into catalyst layers, without the drawbacks associated with the use of discrete nanoparticles. Fresh- and end-of-test membrane-electrode assemblies' characterization shows that their particular architecture is preserved upon catalyst layer preparation and after operation in a proton-exchange membrane electrolysis cell.									56	4	0	0	5	0	56			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000456712500012

Herein, ultrathin single-crystalline Fe-doped nickel thiophosphate (NiPS3) nanosheets prepared in large scale by an easy solid-state method were demonstrated to be highly efficient OER electrocatalysts. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the Fe-doping effectively decreases the energy barrier of OER path by reducing the binding of the oxygen-containing species on the surface of NiPS3. As such, the Fe-doped NiPS3 nanosheets show a low overpotential of 256 mV to reach a current density of 30 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1). To our knowledge, this is one of the best OER electrocatalysts in alkaline medium to date. The in-depth mechanism study demonstrates that the in-situ formed Fe-doped nickel oxides/hydroxides shell, resulting from the surface oxidation during the OER process, not only may serve as favorable electrocatalytic species but also improves the chemical stability of the Fe-doped NiPS3 in alkaline electrolyte. This work provides a new perspective for designing highly efficient OER electrocatalysts based on the ternary two-dimensional layered metal thiophosphates.									94	6	0	0	0	0	96			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000430057000026

This is, however, an intimidating challenge that appeals to a general strategy to effectively regulate the catalytic activity of cobalt-based catalysts. Herein, a general strategy to enhance the HER properties of Co-based heterojunction catalysts with dual nanostructures on 3D Stainless steel mesh (SSM) through anionic regulation of the CoO parent compound with non-oxygen species is reported. The as-prepared CoO/CoX heterojunction catalysts (X = P, N, S) obtained exhibit better HER activity than the corresponding directly oxygen-and non-oxygen-treated catalysts. The optimized CoO-CoP on SSM (denoted SSM/ CoOP) displays an overpotential of-21 mV@10 mA cm(-2), exhibiting similar kinetics to the benchmark Pt-C catalysts (-19 mV). Due to the attractive OER performance of SSM/CoOP, a potential of 1.57 V@10 mA cm(-2) was achieved when SSM/CoOP was used as bifunctional catalysts in the overall water splitting device. The HER properties is enhanced due to the electronic coupling between CoO and CoX that significantly reduces the adsorption free energy, and the 1D-2D dual nanostructures that exposes the active sites and fasten the ion/ electron transportation in the hybrid system.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000784267200003

The gas evolved on the surface of the electrode reduced the active surface area and increased the overpotential for electrolysis. We investigated how the shape of the electrode affects the bubble behavior and how to obtain an optimal non-blockage electrode surface using a Pt rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE). Standard deviation (SD) of the electrolysis currents was obtained. The value of the SD is corelated with the bubble detachment phenomenon. We found that the rotation induced flux field removes the generated bubble with decrease of the SD. So, a larger SD indicates the bubble accumulation on the electrode surface, and the surface stranding in the gas film. The ring electrode showed higher current with smaller SD than disk electrode at an overpotential for both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction. Therefore, a ring electrode is better than a disk electrode to evaluate gas evolution reaction. The optimum current measurement condition is using ring electrode under rotation speed higher than 2500 rpm, because dependence of current and the SD on rotating speed was small enough. Under this condition, HER at - 0.1 V, the ring electrode delivers - 260 mA cm(-2), and the disk delivers - 160 mA cm(-2). For OER at 2.2 V, the ring electrode delivers 195 mA cm(-2), and the disk electrode delivers 130 mA cm(-2). The ring electrode capture about 35% more current than disk, which might be loss by the effect of the bubble blockage. In order to get better current measurement in a gas evolution reaction, using ring electrode to remove the bubbles from the electrode surface in a high rotation speed is recommended.[GRAPHICS].									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000516145400001

In this work, an electrocatalyst system consisting of different vertically aligned heteroatom-doped graphene arrays (X-rGO, X = N, P, B, O, S) integrated with FeCoNiP nanoparticles (FeCoNiP@X-rGO, X = N, P, B, O, S) is prepared for overall water splitting. The unique vertical structure and the synergistic effect between the P in P-rGO and the P in FeCoNiP leads to the excellent electrocatalytic performance of FeCoNiP@P-rGO by exhibiting low overpotentials (121 and 216 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. As well as a low overpotential (354 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction in 1.0 M KOH. The FeCoNiP@P-rGO electrocatalyst exhibits an outstanding durability toward overall water splitting in alkaline electrolytes, and excellent Faraday efficiency (about 92%) as well. This work provides an insight in proper tuning and the development of appropriate substrates for IMPs and other transition metal compounds toward cost-effective and high efficiency electrocatalysts for water splitting reactions.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2366-7486			WOS:000772491400001

To date, there is still a challenge in designing ideal cost-effective OER catalysts with excellent activity and robust durability. The hybridization of transition metal oxides and carbonaceous materials is one of the most effective and promising strategies to develop high-performance electrocatalysts. Herein, this work synthesized hybrids of NiFe2O4 spinel materials with two-dimensional (2D) graphene oxide and one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes using a facile solvothermal approach. Electrocatalytic activities of NiFe2O4 with 2D graphene oxide toward OER were realized to be superior even to the 1D carbon nanotube-based electrocatalyst in terms of overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm2 as well as Tafel slopes. The NiFe2O4 with 2D graphene oxide hybrid exhibits good stability with an overpotential of 327 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 103 mV/dec. The high performance of NiFe2O4 with 2D graphene oxide is mainly attributed to its unique morphology, more exposed active sites, and a porous structure with a high surface area. Thus, an approach of hybridizing a metal oxide with a carbonaceous material offers an attractive platform for developing an efficient electrocatalyst for water electrochemistry applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1995-8196			INSPEC:22100149

The booming development of nanotechnology affords emerging but effective tools in designing advanced energy material. We reviewed the significant progress and dominated nanostructured energy materials in electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices, including lithium ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, lithium-oxygen batteries, lithium metal batteries, and supercapacitors. The use of nanostructured electrocatalyst for effective electrocatalysis in oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions for fuel cells and metal-air batteries was also included. The challenges in the undesirable side reactions between electrolytes and electrode due to high electrode/electrolyte contact area, low volumetric energy density of electrode owing to low tap density, and uniform production of complex energy materials in working devices should be overcome to fully demonstrate the advanced energy nanostructures for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. The energy chemistry at the interfaces of nanostructured electrode/electrolyte is highly expected to guide the rational design and full demonstration of energy materials in a working device.

Here we report a nanoporous intermetallic compound typically composed of platinum-cobalt-aluminum intermetallic core with in-situ grown atomic-layer-thick Pt skin as a novel oxygen-reduction-reaction nanocatalyst with remarkably enhanced performance. Both Pt and Co atoms thermodynamically prefer to locate nearby Al element within face-centered cubic Pt3Al matrix via the formation of strong Pt-Al and Co-Al bonds, which not only enable synergistic ligand and compressive strain effects to moderately weaken the oxygen adsorption energy of Pt skin, but alleviate the evolution of surface Pt atoms to protect against the further dissolution of less-noble Co and Al. As a result, the nanoporous platinum cobalt aluminum nanocatalyst exhibits specific activity of 3.40 mA cm(Pt)(-2) and mass activity of 2.2 A mg(Pt)(-1), for the oxygen reduction reaction at 0.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (similar to 13- and similar to 20-fold enhancement relative to commercially available platinum nanoparticles supported carbon) with an exceptional durability, showing genuine potential as cathode catalyst in next-generation electrochemical energy conversion devices.

In this paper, a micron spherical NiO-CoFe2O4 film composed of nanosheets was synthesized on Ni foam (NF) as a high-efficiency bifunctional electrode through one-pot hydrothermal method. The NiO-CoFe2O4/NF owns excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability due to the combination effect between NiO and CoFe2O4, good electrical conductivity of three-dimensional (3D) porous Ni foam and unique flower-spherical structure of NiO-CoFe2O4/NF. In alkaline solution, HER and OER only need low overpotential of 97 mV and 157 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) current density, respectively.

The question remains as to whether in situ observation of degradation during OER will be possible. We design a model system and fabricate a structure that is ideal for in situ detection of interfacial degradation that could occur at the anode, i.e. corrosion and passivation. The synthesized structure is based on carbon (C) or non carbon (Ti); this is not only because it is a practical and general choice as an anode substrate, but also because it can represent the degradation reaction of corrosion or passivation, respectively. Interfacial responses from the ideally structured surface are observed (spectro)electrochemically under OER-operating conditions. We reveal that while electrochemical oxidation of C is inevitable over time, the passivation of Ti can be circumvented under controlled conditions. We also disclose that the use of Ti can be more beneficial for electrolytic cells, than that of C. These results highlight future research strategies required for the optimization of Cand Ti-based components used in electrolytic cells. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we describe the simple construction of a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst with a "framework-active sites" structure, namely Fe/Fe3C@C (Fe@C) nanoparticles encapsulated in 3D N-doped graphene and bamboo-like CNTs (Fe@C-NG/NCNTs). The Fe@C structure provides additional electrons on the carbon surface, promoting the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on adjacent Fe-N-x active sites. The 3D NG hybrid with a bamboo-like CNTs framework facilitates fast reactant diffusion and rapid electron transfer. The optimized sample displays excellent ORR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, with a potential difference of only 0.84 V; this places it among the best bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts. Most importantly, Zn-air batteries using Fe@C-NG/NCNTs as the cathode catalyst deliver a peak power density of 101.2 mW cm(-2) and a specific capacity of 682.6 mA h g(-1)(energy density of 764.5 W h kg(-1)). After 297 continuous cycle tests (99 h), the rechargeable batteries using Fe@C-NG/NCNTs show a voltage gap increase of only 0.13 V, almost half that of Pt/C + Ir/C (0.22 V) under the same conditions. This work provides new insight into advanced electrocatalysts utilizing the structural features of host nanocarbon materials and guest active species toward energy conversion.									297	20	0	0	13	0	299			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000419188300023

Carbon based air electrodes are conventionally used in metal-air batteries due its high electrical conductivity, high specific surface area and porosity. However, the highly oxidative environment of metal-air batteries during charging, corrodes the carbon air electrodes which lead to poor cyclic stability. The current study develops a hybrid air electrode with a nickel interlayer between carbon and electrocatalyst. This approach protects the carbon from corrosion and also provides an enhanced electocatalytic activity for silver catalyst by improving the electron conduction pathway through metallic nickel interlayer. The electroless deposition of nickel interlayer was optimized by deposition time. The electrochemical performances of the electrodes with Zn as anode were investigated to study the stability during cycling. The C-Ni-Ag electrode exhibited a round trip efficiency of 55%, a voltage gap of about 0.9 V over the entire cycle life of more than 1300 cycles and similar to 350 h of operation with capacity retention of 98%.

Herein, ultrathin gamma-Fe2O3 nanosheets (Fe2O3-NS) were prepared by a facile solution reduction-low temperature calcination method. The prepared photocatalyst has a leaf-like morphology with an average thickness of 2.0 nm and a large number of slit-like pores. Compared with gamma-Fe2O3 bulk, Fe2O3-NS exhibits excellent photocatalytic OER activity. The apparent quantum yield (AQE) and oxygen yield (measured at 420 nm) are 12.95% and 57.04%, respectively. The OER efficiency is superior to those reported iron oxide photocatalysts. This excellent performance may benefit from the ultrathin porous structure, appropriately narrow bandgap, and abundant oxygen vacancies. In addition, the photocatalyst shows good cycling stability, retaining 91.5% of the initial capacity in the fifth cycle test, which may be attributed to the magnetic cycling capability and good structural stability. This study confirms that Fe2O3-NS is a competitive candidate material for photocatalytic oxygen evolution and provides ideas for the design and construction of other defect-rich metal oxide nanosheets.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000729993700004

The reaction is however kinetically hindered by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involving four proton-electron transfer steps. The ideal OER catalyst should avoid using precious elements, such as Ir, Ru, and Pt, and have a long-term stability under positive bias potential. Recent experiments have shown that most 3d oxides are OER active catalysts, while some can even achieve comparable activities to commercial Ir/Ru catalysts in lab condition. In this article, we review the recent theoretical progress for characterizing the structure of 3d oxides and understanding the photo-electrocatalytic water splitting mechanism over these catalysts. The methodology for global structure exploration, including evolutionary algorithm and stochastic surface walking method, is first introduced together with their applications in exploring the potential energy surface of TiO2 and NiOx systems. The current theoretical approaches to investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics of photo-/electrochemical reactions are discussed and the latest understanding for OER reactions are summarized.

Herein, N, S co-doped carbon (NS/C) was developed by a molecular-level doping strategy using a new precursor of N and S co-containing bis(imino)-pyridine based polymer, copolymerized by three monomers of 2, 6-Diacetylpyridine (DAP), 1, 5-naphthalenediamine (NDA) and 2, 5-dithiobiurea (DBU) with Schiff base reaction. The results demonstrated that the ratio between the three monomers strongly affects the texture characteristics of the corresponding carbon materials, doping types and contents of N and S, as well their synergetic effects in carbon matrix. The NS/C obtained by the copolymer of DAP , NDA and DBU with their corresponding molar ratio of 1: 0.5: 0.5 exhibits a small overpotential difference of 0.72 V vs RHE and a remarkable stability in 0.1 M KOH for overall ORR/OER activity, outperforming most of metal-free catalysts reported. Meanwhile, a single rechargeable Zn-Air battery test further identified its excellent activity, in which the battery delivers a maximum power density output of 149 mW.cm(-2), a specific capacity of 769 mAh.gZn (-1), and long charge-discharge capability at 5 mA.cm(-2) with 600 cycles in 100 h, surpassing that with the mixed Pt/C and IrO2 (1:1 wt.%) catalysts under the same mass loading. The theoretical calculation results show that the oxygen redox activity of NS/C critically roots in C atoms with positive charge and spin density, induced by the strong interaction between the specific N and S dopants derived from the new designed precursors.

Attractive alternatives to expensive noble metals used in these renewable energy technologies are earth-abundant transition metal oxides. However, they are often limited by catalytic and conductive capabilities. Here reported is a spinel oxide, Co2VO4, by marrying metallic vanadium atomic chains with electroactive cobalt cations for superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)-a key process for fuel cells, metal-air batteries, etc. The experimental and simulated electron energy-loss spectroscopy analyses reveal that Co2+ cations at the octahedral sites take the low spin state with one e(g) electron (t2g6eg1), favoring advantageous ORR energetics. Measurement of actual electrical conductivity confirms that Co2VO4 has several orders of magnitude increase when compared with benchmark cobalt oxides. As a result, a zinc-air battery with new spinel cobalt vanadate oxide as the ORR catalyst shows excellent performance, together with a record-high discharge peak power density of 380 mW cm(-2). Crucially, this is superior to state-of-the-art Pt/C-based device and is greatest among zinc-air batteries assembled with metal, metal oxide, and carbon catalysts. The findings present a new design strategy for highly active and conductive oxide materials for a wide range of electrocatalytic applications, including ORR, oxygen evolution, and hydrogen evolution reactions.									85	11	0	0	8	0	87			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000510054400001	31999016

Here, a 1D nanothorn-like Nb-CoSe2/CC (CC=carbon cloth) structure was developed as an efficient OER catalyst. The optimized Nb-CoSe2/CC catalyst exhibited remarkable OER performance with the low overpotentials of 220 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 297 mV 200 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope (54.1 mV dec(-1)) in 1.0 m KOH electrolyte. More importantly, the Nb-CoSe2/CC electrode displayed superior stability after 60 h of continuous operation. In addition, cell voltages of 1.52 and 1.93 V were required to achieve 10 and 500 mA cm(-2) for the electrolyzer made of Nb-CoSe2/CC (anode) and the Pt/C (cathode). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with experimental results revealed that incorporating niobium into the CoSe2 could optimize the adsorption free energy of the reaction intermediates and enhance the conductivity to improve the catalytic activity further. Additionally, the super-hydrophilicity of Nb-CoSe2/CC resulting from the surface defects increased the surface wettability and facilitated reaction kinetics. These results indicate that Nb-CoSe2/CC intrinsically enhances OER performance and possesses potential practical water electrolysis applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000821213600001	35704336

However, a remarkable issue was revealed by this type of battery: the water consumption [ 1]. This process is caused by secondary reactions that occur during charging or even by the self-discharge: the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) [2].The damaging effect due to OER could be reduced since the oxygen produced by the positive plate goes through the separator to the negative plate where is reduced back to water. This process is called "internal oxygen cycle" [3].The previous reactions are influenced by the presence of metallic impurities in the battery, since, these processes are catalyzed by them [4]. Thus, the negative effects caused by the secondary reactions, as the decrease of high-temperature durability and the increase of self-discharge, could be increased.Due to this fact, the impurity influence on HER and OER was researched in two different experimental systems (three electrode cell and 2 V/ 1 Ah cell). The investigated impurities were nickel, silver and selenium, and their effect was measured at different concentrations. Lastly, the search of similar trends between the results of the two experimental systems and the determination of a HER rate were established as the aims of this study.					11th International Conference on Lead-Acid Batteries (LABAT)11th International Conference on Lead-Acid Batteries (LABAT)	JUN 08-11, 2021JUN 08-11, 2021	Inbatec; Kustan; Terranova Papers; Elhim Iskra; Wavetech; Cabot; CMWTEC; Microporous; Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Electrochemistry & Energy Syst, Lead Acid Batteries DeptInbatec; Kustan; Terranova Papers; Elhim Iskra; Wavetech; Cabot; CMWTEC; Microporous; Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Electrochemistry & Energy Syst, Lead Acid Batteries Dept	ELECTR NETWORKELECTR NETWORK	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					*****************	WOS:000719299600027

By monitoring the dissociation of molecular oxygen ions, we show that autoionization cannot occur until the internuclear separation is 30 angstrom or greater. As the ion and excited neutral atom separate, we directly observe the transformation of electronically bound states of the molecular ion into Feshbach resonances of the neutral oxygen atom. We achieve this by using laser high-harmonics in a femtosecond EUV-IR pump-probe scheme, combined with a triple coincidence reaction microscope measurement. Finally, we show control of the dissociation pathway through IR pulse induced ionization.					26th International Conference on Photonic, Electronic and Atomic Collisions26th International Conference on Photonic, Electronic and Atomic Collisions	JUL 22-28, 2009JUL 22-28, 2009	CRYOGENIC Ltd; IOP; Kalamazoo Cty Convent & Visitors Bur; Natl Electrostat Corp; PhysMath Cent; RoentDek Handels GmbH; Taylor & Francis Grp; WIENER Corp; WMU, Dept Phys; WMU, Coll Arts & Sci; WMU, Off Vice President Res; WMU, Grad Coll; WMU, Diether H Haenicke Inst Global EducCRYOGENIC Ltd; IOP; Kalamazoo Cty Convent & Visitors Bur; Natl Electrostat Corp; PhysMath Cent; RoentDek Handels GmbH; Taylor & Francis Grp; WIENER Corp; WMU, Dept Phys; WMU, Coll Arts & Sci; WMU, Off Vice President Res; WMU, Grad Coll; WMU, Diether H Haenicke Inst Global Educ	Western Michigan Univ, Kalamazoo, MIWestern Michigan Univ, Kalamazoo, MI	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-6588	1742-6596	*****************	WOS:000282024600014

Here, we report a metal-free bifunctional photoassisted catalyst of a polyaniline/carbon dots (PANI/CDs) composite for overall water splitting. In a neutral electrolyte, under visible light, the overpotentials of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for PANI/CDs/NF are reduced by 150 and 65 mV to reach the current densities of 30 and 20 mA cm(-2), respectively. In a full water-splitting cell, under visible light, the current density is 13.27 mA cm(-2) at 2.0 V, which increases by 62.8% compared with that under the dark conditions (8.15 mA cm(-2)). The in situ transient photovoltage (TPV) tests were used to study the light-induced effects on half-reactions of water splitting, as well as the charge-transfer kinetic characteristics at the catalyst interface.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000659315800044	34009941

However, the energy efficiency and power density of Zn-gas batteries are restricted by the kinetically sluggish cathode reactions, such as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during charging and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR)/nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR)/nitric oxide reduction reaction (NORR) during discharge. In this review, battery configurations and fundamental reactions in Zn-gas batteries are first introduced, including Zn-air, Zn-CO2, Zn-N-2, and Zn-NO batteries. Afterward, recent advances in active site engineering for enhancing the intrinsic catalytic activities of cathode catalysts are summarized. Subsequently, the structure and surface regulation strategies of cathode materials for optimizing the three-phase interface and improving the performance of Zn-gas batteries are discussed. Finally, some personal perspectives for the future development of Zn-gas batteries are presented.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000860435400003

Two groups of samples with low [Ge] <= 1 x 10(17) cm(-3) and high [Ge] = 2 x 10(20) cm(-3) were used. We found that the annealing temperature of vacancy-oxygen complexes (A-centers) produced in the course of irradiation at room temperature is substantially decreased in the samples with high [Ge]. This effect is explained taking into account an influence of the elastic stresses due to Ge atoms in the Si lattice on the migration barrier of A-centers as well as the rate of oxygen-related reactions, i.e. VO + O-i -> VO2, VO + Si-I -> O-i, etc. We also found that the ratio of A-centers converted to VO2 defects is smaller in the material with high [Ge]. The same is also true for the conversion reaction VO2+O-i -> VO3, Contrary, the next reaction VO3+O-i -> VO4 shows a markedly enhanced rate if the Ge content is high. This observation can be explained considering the effects of Ge-induced stresses in the Si lattice on the successive trapping of oxygen atoms by A-centers and other VO, complexes as well as on the enhanced diffusivity of oxygen.

In this work, we demonstrate that metal organic frameworks (MOFs) can be controllably converted into catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) or the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The OER catalyst is composed of FeNi alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanotubes, which is obtained by thermal decomposition of a trimetallic (Zn2+, Fe2+, and Ni2+) zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF). It reaches 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 300 mV with a low Tafel slope of 47.7 mV dec(-1). The HER catalyst consists of Ni nanoparticles coated with a thin layer of N-doped carbon. It is obtained by thermal decomposition of a Ni-MOF in NH3. It shows low overpotential of only 77 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) with low Tafel slope of 68 mV dec(-1). The above noble metal free OER and HER electrocatalysts are applied in an alkaline electrolyzer driven by a commercial polycrystalline solar cell. It achieves electrolysis efficiency of 64.4% at 65 mA cm(-2) under sun irradiation of 50 mW cm(-2). This practical application shows the promising prospect of low-cost and high-efficiency sustainable hydrogen production from combination of solar cells with high-performance noble metal free electrocatalysts.									115	9	0	0	5	0	115			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000391081700048	27966855

Here we report the fabrication of a bubble-like N,S-codoped porous carbon nanofibers with encapsulated fine Fe/Fe(5)C(2)nanocrystals (similar to 10 nm) (FeNSCs) by a facile one-pot pyrolysis strategy. The novel FeNSC nanostructures with high Fe content (37.3 wt.%), and synergetic N and S doping demonstrate remarkable ORR and OER catalytic activities in alkaline condition. Particularly for ORR, the optimal FeNSC catalyst exhibits superior performance in terms of current density and durability in both alkaline and acidic media. Moreover, as catalysts on the air electrodes of Zn-air batteries, the optimal FeNSCs show a high peak power density of 59.6 mW/cm(2)and extraordinary discharge-charge cycling performance for 200 h with negligible voltage gap change of only 8% at current density of 20 mA/cm, surpassing its noble metal counterpart (i.e. Pt). The impressive battery stability can be attributed to favorable electron transfer resulting from appropriate graphitization of the bubble-like carbon nanofibers and thorough protection of Fe/Fe(5)C(2)nanoparticles by carbon wrapping to prevent oxidation, agglomeration and dissolution of Fe nanoparticles during battery cycling. The present FeNSC catalyst, which is highly active, robust yet affordable, shows promising prospects in large-scale applications, such as metal-air batteries and fuel cells.									30	4	0	0	1	0	30			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000543572000006

However, cycle degradation and voltage drop caused by the irreversible structural changes and O-2 release upon electrochemical cycling hinder their commercial applications. Herein, a Na-deficient layered compound Na0.67Mn0.72Zn0.28O2 is employed to study the relationship between the oxygen redox reaction and the (O-2)(n-) stabilization mechanism by using a combined experimental and computational approach. Our results indicate that Na0.67Mn0.72Zn0.28O2 has a long plateau of approximately 4.1 V with a total capacity of 157 mAh g(-1), majorly stemming from the oxygen redox reactions of O2-/(O-2)(n-). The O-2p nonbonding states originating from the weak Zn-O interaction and the shortened O-O bonds induced by the absence of Na atoms in the alkali layers catalyze the formation of peroxo-like O-O dimer between the Mn-Mn atoms. The honeycomb TM layer of the Na-deficient materials remains stable with a small O-O bond length evolution from 2.55 angstrom to 2.48 angstrom during the oxygen redox process, which stabilizes the lattice oxygen in electrochemical cycles. This finding is important for further understanding the mechanism underlying the oxygen redox chemistry of high energy Na-deficient cathode materials.									17	3	0	0	1	0	17			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000494891700003

To enhance the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction in an acidic medium, it is of paramount importance to redesign iridium electrocatalysts into novel structures with organized morphology and high surface area. Here, we report on the designing of a well-defined and highly active hollow nanoframe based on iridium. The synthesis strategy was to control the shape of nickel nanostructures on which iridium nanoparticles will grow. After the growth of iridium on the surface, the next step was to etch the nickel core to form the NiIr hollow nanoframe. The etching procedure was found to be significant in controlling the hydroxide species on the iridium surface and by that affecting the performance. The catalytic performance of the NiIr hollow nanoframe was studied for oxygen evolution reaction and shows 29 times increased iridium mass activity compared to commercially available iridium-based catalysts. Our study provides novel insights to control the fabrication of iridium-shaped catalysts using 3d transition metal as a template and via a facile etching step to steer the formation of hydroxide species on the surface. These findings shall aid the community to finally create stable iridium alloys for polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzers, and the strategy is also useful for many other electrochemical devices such as batteries, fuel cells, sensors, and solar organic cells.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000634759500097	33706507

Herein, a simple synthesis combined with electrodeposition and facile electro-oxidation is developed to construct the hollow dendritic self-supported electrode (HDSE). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) reveal that the surface of HDSE contains the abundant NiO, which is further decorated by fluorine (F)-doped and oxygen vacancies after electro-oxidation process. The resultant HDSE achieves an excellent electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline condition, leading to the extremely low overpotential of 13 mV to drive a current density of -10 mA.cm(-2), and exhibits the long-time stability at the current density of -100 mA.cm(-2) and -500 mA.cm(-2), which is superior to the electrocatalytic ability of Pt/C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate the NiO modulated by F-doping and oxygen vacancy, could synergistically improve the charge distribution, enhance the conductivity of NiO structure, and optimize the adsorption energy for intermediates of HER, thus accelerating the electrocatalytic ability for hydrogen evolution. This work opens up a new avenue toward the reasonable design of high-efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction.									28	0	0	0	6	0	28			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000569904100002

The unique nanostructure contains abundant electrocatalytic active sites of sulfides nanocrystals and nitrogen and sulfur dopants which can be fast accessed through highly porous structure originate from both zinc vaporization and sulfurization processes. Such bifunctional electrocatalyst delivers a superior half-wave potential of 0.86 V towards oxygen reduction reaction and overpotential of 350 mV towards oxygen evolution reaction, as well as excellent durability owing to the highly stable carbon framework with a great graphitized portion. The performance boosting is mainly attributed to the unique nanostructure where bimetallic cobalt and zinc provide synergistic effect during both synthesis and catalysis processes. The design and realization pave a new way of development and understanding of bifunctional electrocatalyst towards clean electrochemical energy technologies.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000592106300002

A triple hierarchy catalyst structure based on abundant transition metals in soil (Fe, Co, and Ni) was prepared via chemical bath deposition, followed by a hydrothermal and electrodeposition method for the high-efficiency OER. The obtained electrode consisted of a three-layer porous structure, with a carbon cloth (CC) substrate as the bottom layer, vertically aligned Co9S8 nanotubes as the intermediate layer, and NiFe hydroxide as the top layer, resulting in two synergistic effects between Co9S8 and CC, and NiFe and Co9S8. This layered structure contained no binder, which facilitated catalytic site exposure, enhanced electron transfer, and accelerated the dissipation of gases generated during the catalytic process. This triple hierarchy multimetal/carbon electrode exhibited remarkable OER activity in an alkaline medium with a small overpotential of 219 mV (vs. RHE) at 10 mAcm(-2) and low Tafel slope of 55 mVdec(-1). Furthermore, this triple hierarchy electrode was stable for up to 20 h. The prepared triple hierarchy polymetallic material can be considered to be among the most promising oxygen evolution catalysts.									30	5	0	0	0	0	31			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000459580000030	30724936

A hot injection method has been used to synthesize 1T' WSe2 with a three-dimensional morphology; however, this method requires two or more precursors and long-chain ligands, which inhibit the catalytic performance. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of 1T' WSe2 on a substrate by a simple heating-up method using a single precursor, tetraethylammonium tetraselenotungstate [(Et4N)(2)WSe4]. The triethylamine produced after the reaction is an electron donor that yields negatively charged WSe2, which is stabilized by triethylammonium cations as intercalants between layers and induces 1T' WSe2. The purity of 1T' WSe2 is higher on oxygen-containing crystalline substrates than amorphous substrates because the strong adhesion between WSe2 and the substrate can produce sufficient triethylammonium (TEA) intercalation. Among the oxygen-containing crystal substrates, the substrate with a lower lattice mismatch with 1T' WSe2 showed higher 1T' purity due to the uniform TEA intercalation. Furthermore, 1T' WSe2 on carbon cloth exhibited a more enhanced catalytic performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (197 mV at 10 mA/cm(2)) than has been reported previously.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000826317000001	35776412

The systematic electrochemical study of Fe/Fe3C@NCNTs shows a decent catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The sample of Fe/Fe3C@NCNTs at 750 degrees C exhibits a remarkably high activity with an onset potential of 1.47 V for the OER, and an onset potential of 0.96 V and half-wave potential 0.88 V for the ORR, which inspired us to set up a rechargeable Zn-air battery with such Fe/Fe3C@NCNT nanohybrids as the cathode materials, showing a maximum power density of 198 mW cm(-2) and long-term stability after 500 cycles. We also demonstrate that Fe/Fe3C@NCNTs present favorable electrocatalytic activity towards the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with a low onset potential and good selectivity. The major products are a mixture of H-2 and CO gases that can be used for methanol production in the Fischer-Tropsch process.									34	0	0	0	3	0	34			2196-0216			WOS:000423803900009

To address such issues, herein, for the first time, three-dimensional porous Ni/Ni3Fe anchored boron-doped carbon nanotubes nanochain frameworks (Ni/Ni3Fe/B-CNT), constructed by ultrasmall Ni/Ni3Fe nanoparticles embedded in highly conductive B doped CNT chains, are synthesized via a facile self-assembly hydrolysis method and corresponding growth mechanism is revealed. The low-cost Ni/Ni3Fe/B-CNT hybrid delivers excellent OER performance outperforming that of well-established benchmark electrocatalysts (RuO2): it requires only 265 my to obtain a large current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (mass load similar to 0.28 mg cm(-2)); it shows a small Tafel slope of 62.9 mV dec(-1) and excellent long-term stability even after 40 h. The outstanding OER performance of Ni/Ni3Fe/B-CNT is mainly attributed to its unique porous nanoarchitecture with abundant active sites and the synergistic effect between the ultrathin Ni/ Ni3Fe nanoparticles and highly conductive B-doped CNT skeleton; these merits facilitate the electron/ion transfer and oxygen bubble release thus significantly improve its OER activity. This work presents a well-designed nanoarchitecture design and facile fabrication strategy to obtain nonprecious transition metal-based OER electrocatalysts with excellent efficiency and long-term stability.									25	1	0	0	0	0	24			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000518874300041

The current seawater electrolysis technology is significantly hindered by the poor stability and low selectivity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the competition with chlorine evolution reaction in practical application. Herein, iron and phosphor dual-doped nickel selenide nanoporous films (Fe,P-NiSe2 NFs) are rationally designed as bifunctional catalysts for high-efficiency direct seawater electrolysis. The doping of Fe cation increases the selectivity and Faraday efficiency (FE) of the OER. While the doping of P anions improves the electronic conductivity and prevents the dissolution of selenide by forming a passivation layer containing P-O species. The Fe-dopant is identified as the primary active site for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and meanwhile, stimulates the adjacent Ni atoms as active centers for the OER. The experimental analyses and theoretical calculations provide an insightful understanding of the roles of dual-dopants in boosting seawater electrolysis. As a result, a current density of 0.8 A cm(-2) is archived at 1.8 V with high OER selectivity and long-term stability for over 200 h, which surpasses the benchmarking platinum-group-metals-free electrolyzers.									38	2	0	0	1	0	40			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000670511400001	34235791

Crucial to its standing as a model reaction is a comprehensive mechanistic framework able to explain the entire time evolution of the reaction. While much of this framework is in place, there is still much debate over the cause of the induction period, an initial time interval where no reaction seemingly occurs. Here, we report on the simultaneous monitoring of the spectroscopic signal and the dissolved oxygen content within the aqueous solution. It reveals that the induction period is the time interval required for the level of dissolved oxygen to fall below a critical value that is dependent upon whether Au, Ag, or Pd nanoparticles are used as the catalyst. With this understanding, we are able to exert complete control over the induction period, being able to eliminate it, extend it indefinitely, or even induce multiple induction periods over the course of a single reaction. Moreover, we have determined that the reaction product, 4-aminophenol, in the presence of the same catalyst reacts with dissolved oxygen to form 4-nitrophenolate. The implication of these results is that the induction period relates, not to some activation of the catalyst, but to a time interval where the reaction product is being rapidly transformed back into a reactant by a side reaction.									125	1	0	0	14	0	125			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000389963200071	27960449

In this work, ultrathin cobalt sulfide nanosheets (Co3S4-NSs) on nickel foam (NiF) nanohybrids (termed as Co3S4-NSs/Ni-F) are synthesized using cyanogel hydrolysis and a sulfurization two-step approach. Physical characterizations reveal that Co3S4-NSs with a 1.7 nm thickness have abundant holes, implying the big surface area, abundant active edge atoms, and sufficient active sites. Electrochemical measurements show that as-synthesized Co3S4 NSs/Ni-F have excellent electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for ethanol oxidation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction. Due to their bifunctional property of Co3S4-NSs/Ni-F nanohybrids, a symmetric Co3S4-NSs/Ni-F parallel to Co3S4-NSs/Ni-F ethanol electrolyzer can be effectively constructed, which only requires a 1.48 V electrolysis voltage to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for high-purity hydrogen generation at the cathode as well as value-added potassium acetate generation at the anode, much lower than the electrolysis voltage of traditional electrochemical water splitting (1.64 V).									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000614062400049	33459016

Herein, we have presented a simple procedure to construct a new nanofibrous hybrid structure with the interface connecting the surface of CeO2 and CoO as a high-performance electrocatalyst toward the OER through an electrospinning-calcination-reduction process. The resultant CeO2-CoO nanofibers exhibit excellent electrocatalytic properties with a small overpotential of 296 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER, which is superior to many previously reported nonprecious metal-based and commercial RuO2 catalysts. Furthermore, the prepared CeO2-CoO nanofibers display remarkable long-term stability, which can be maintained for 130 h with nearly no attenuation of OER activity in an alkaline electrolyte. A combined experimental and theoretical investigation reveals that the excellent OER properties of CeO2-CoO nanofibers are due to the unique interfacial architecture between CeO2 and CoO, where abundant oxygen vacancies can be generated due to the incomplete matching of atomic positions of two parts, leading to the formation of many low-coordinated Co sites with high OER catalytic activity. This research provides a practical and promising opportunity for the application of heterostructured nonprecious metal oxide catalysts for high-efficiency electrochemical water oxidation.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000706187100078	34549934

The synthetic approach involves controlled temperature annealing of a homogenous mixture of cobalt and iron complexes of hydrolyzed collagen and the subsequent surface engineering by acid treatment. In situ generated CoFe alloy nanoparticle (12.5 nm) catalyzes the growth of OLC. CoFe nanoparticle is encapsulated with multi-layer graphitic carbon shell.

It is bifunctionally active towards oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions with a potential gap of 0.8 V. It catalyzes oxygen reduction reaction in acidic and alkaline pHs and the kinetics of oxygen reduction in alkaline pH is highly facile with high electron transfer coefficient of 0.95. The Fe-Nx sites of the catalyst actively participate in the oxygen reduction in acidic pH. Rechargeable ZAB is fabricated using the hybrid material based air cathode. It has high open-circuit voltage (1.58 V), peak power density (102 mW/cm(2)) and remarkable charge-discharge cycling stability.

Morphology and composition of the Ti/PbO2 electrode before and after polarization were analyzed by SEM and XRD. The corrosion mechanism was investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV) ,and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses. The cell voltage, current efficiency, corrosion rate, anode lifetime, and failure mechanism of Ti/PbO2 and Ti/PbO2-TiO2-Ce(NO3)(4) were analyzed by simulating zinc electrowinning experiments. It was found that Ce(NO3)(4) promoted the oxygen evolution reaction, and reduced the oxygen evolution potential and energy consumption. The analysis of oxygen evolution peak and reduction peak shows that Ti/PbO2-TiO2-Ce(NO3)(4) electrode has good invertibility. In addition, it was found that the addition of Ce(NO3)(4) increased the activity of the coating, and Ti/PbO2-TiO2-Ce(NO3)(4) (0.5gL(-1)) had the best activity.

Here, via an efficient electrophilic extraction of local electrons in cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) nanosheets realized by confining high-valence transition-metal ions (Mn4+) in cation sites of the basal plane, we significantly facilitate the proton-electron transfer kinetics and reduce the charge transfer resistance by more than 50% for high-efficiency water oxidation. The as-synthesized Mn-doped CoOOH nanosheets exhibit an excellent OER performance with a quite low overpotential of 255 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of similar to 38 mV dec(-1). X-ray absorption spectroscopy and first-principles calculations demonstrate that the high-valence Mn4+ ion with an unpaired 3d(3) configuration extracts local electrons from Co active sites and reduces the adsorption free energy of OH by 0.7 eV for efficient oxygen evolution.									49	1	0	0	1	0	49			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000425302700038

Here erythrite (Co-3(AsO4)(2)center dot 8H(2)O) is used as a Co-based OER electrocatalyst to evaluate its catalytic properties during in situ restructuring into an amorphous Co-based catalyst in four different electrolytes at pH 7. Using diffraction, microscopy, and spectroscopy, a strong effect in the restructuring behavior is observed depending of the anions in the electrolyte. Only carbonate electrolyte can activate the catalyst material, which is related to its slow restructuring process. While the catalyst turnover frequency (TOF) undesirably reduces by a factor of 28, the number of redox active sites continuously increases to a factor of 56, which results in an overall twofold increase in current of the restructured catalyst after 800 cycles. The activation is attributed to an adequate local order, a high Co oxidation state close to 3+, and a high number of redox-active Co ions. These three requirements for beneficial restructuring provide new insights into the rational design of high-performance OER catalysts by electrochemical restructuring.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000682460800001

However, a guiding principle for selecting suitable nonnoble metals is still lacking. Herein, a thorough mechanistic study on the platform oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst of Ir@Co3O4 to deeply understand the synergy between Ir and Co3O4 for the boosted OER has been carried out. It is demonstrated that the pseudocapacitive feature of Co3O4 plays a key role in accumulating sufficient positive charge [Q], while the Ir sites are responsible for achieving a high reaction order (beta), synergistically contributing to the high OER activity of Ir@Co3O4 through the rate law equation. Specifically, Ir@Co3O4 displays a low overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Ir loading of 1.4 wt%. Ir@Co3O4 is further applied to Zn-air batteries, which enables a low charging potential and thus alleviates the oxidative corrosion of the air electrode, leading to improved cycle stability of 210 h at 20 mA cm(.)(-2) This work demonstrates that anchoring active noble metal sites (for high beta) on pseudocapacitive supports (for high [Q]) is highly favorable to the OER process, providing a clear guidance for boosting the utilization of noble metals in electrocatalysis.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000767627400001

Until now, noble metal-based nanocatalysts had shown outstanding performances toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the scarcity and high cost of them impeded their practical use. Recently, hollow nanostructures including nanocages and nanoframes had emerged as a burgeoning class of promising electrocatalysts. The hollow nanostructures could expose a high proportion of active surfaces while saving the amounts of expensive noble metals. In this review, we introduced recent advances in the synthetic methodologies for generating noble metal-based hollow nanostructures based on thermodynamic and kinetic approaches. We summarized electrocatalytic applications of hollow nanostructures toward the ORR, OER, and HER. We next provided strategies that could endow structural robustness to the flimsy structural nature of hollow structures. Finally, we concluded this review with perspectives to facilitate the development of hollow nanostructure-based catalysts for energy applications.									163	9	0	0	9	0	164			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000449968700013	30009297

Herein, we prepared a 3D interwoven structure with Pd atoms deposited on homogeneously bound MnO2 nanowires and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (Pd/MnO2-CNT), allowing the combination of superior catalytic performance of atomic Pd incorporated in the metal oxide and the high conductivity of CNT. Using this nanocomposite, stable bifunctional oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) was achieved. Pd/MnO2-CNT displayed a large Pd mass activity for ORR, which is two magnitudes higher than that of Pd/CNT and 5-fold higher than that of the state-of-the-art Pd-based electrocatalysts operated in alkaline medium. Application of this composite catalyst in Zn-air batteries generates significantly high efficiency and cycling stability. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that MnO2 provided stronger electronic metal-support interaction than CNT. Pd single atoms doped in MnO2 work synergistically with the surrounding metal sites to activate molecular oxygen, and display optimized binding strength to reaction intermediates. Our strategy can be generalized to design new single atom electrocatalysts for numerous functionalities.									43	4	0	0	0	0	44			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451813300015

In this work, nickel-iron based sulfides were synthesized through a one-pot hydrothermal approach which is characterized as defect-rich Ni9S8/Fe5Ni4S8 heterostructured nanoparticles. The presence of two phases, numerous defects, and uniformly distributed nanoparticles with the porous structure are conducive to modulating electronic structure, facilitating electron and mass transport, allowing the effective accessibility of active sites. The as-prepared Ni9S8/Fe5Ni4S8 exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic OER activity and long-lasting stability, which needs an overpotential of 239 mV for yielding 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability better than RuO2. Furthermore, when employed in a two-electrode overall water splitting system, the catalyst coupled with Pt/C configuration exhibits comparable electrocatalytic performance to Pt/C and RuO2 based electrolyzer. This work not only offers a highly efficient and promising candidate catalyst for electrocatalytic water oxidation but also provides a simple synthesis method to heterostructured nanoparticles for other energy-related applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2515-7639		WOS:000642501400001

In this study, the CoFe2 alloy strongly coupling and oxygen-vacancy-rich CoFe2O4 (CoFe2 alloys/CoFe2O4) porous hollow complex nanofibers, as a highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst for OER, have been synthesized via a facile method of electrospinning combining with two-step heat treatment. The obtained CoFe2 alloys/CoFe2O4 porous hollow complex nanofibers show high electrical conductivity with the smaller charge transfer resistance than that of the commercial RuO2, and even two orders of magnitude lower than that of the single CoFe2O4 porous hollow nanofibers. When used as an electrocatalyst for OER, it demonstrates a superior electrochemical performance with an over-potential of 300 mV at the current density of 10 mAcm(-2), which is comparable to that of the commercial RuO2 but obviously better than that of the single CoFe(2)O(4 )porous hollow nanofibers. Moreover, the CoFe2 alloys/CoFe2O4 porous hollow complex nanofibers exhibit remarkably stability with negligible potential increase of only 1.2% at high current density of 100 mAcm(-2) for 16 h. Meanwhile, the CoFe2 alloys/CoFe2O4 porous hollow complex nanofibers also show an excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, affording an over-potential of 152 mV at the current density of 10 mAcm(-2). When using for water splitting in 1 M KOH, the CoFe2 alloys/CoFe2O4 porous hollow complex nanofibers delivers a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.687 V. More important, the direct growth of CoFe2 alloys on the CoFe2O4 base of the porous hollow nanofibers can be an effective way to control the coupling of the CoFe2 alloys and CoFe2O4, the electronic conductivity and the active sites, and then the electrochemical performance of OER.									15	2	0	0	2	0	15			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000455586800006

However, this material suffers the serious capacity decay and poor stability during cycling. Here, we performed the in-situ X-ray diffraction measurement to investigate the relationship among the voltage window, crystal structure evolution and capacity decay. Based on the finding that the capacity decay is mainly caused by the formation of oxygen anion group [O-2](x-)(0 < x < 4), we controlled the voltage in 2.6-3.8 V to avoid the oxygen reaction and the capacity retention of the material has been improved from similar to 14% (for 100 cycles) to 94.5% (for 500 cycles).

However, the poor cyclic stability and low efficiency still hinder their commercialization, which is mainly attributed to the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes.In the present work, we fabricated a three-dimensional (3D) air cathode composed of CoNiO2 nanoneedles decorated N-doped porous carbon nanonet (CoNiO2/SCC-N), using silkworm cocoons as the raw materials and following the carbonization-hydrothermal route.The as fabricated batteries, with CoNiO2/SCC-N air cathode, are exhibited a very good discharge capacity of 1654 mAh g(catode)(-1) at a current density of 0.05 mA cm(-2), presenting a stability of over 147 cycles. The observed electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of the enhanced ORR/OER activity after the introduction of CoNiO2 and the efficient mass transport characteristics of SCC-N.									14	3	0	0	0	0	16			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000460831500013

MXenes prepared from hydrofluoric (HF) acid etching have been widely reported. Nonetheless, the acute toxicity of HF acid impedes the large-scale fabrication of MXenes and their wide utilization in energy-related applications. It is thus greatly encouraging to explore a more innocuous protocol for MXenes synthesis. Thereby, a universal strategy based on thermal-assisted electrochemical etching route is developed to synthesize MXenes (e.g., Ti2CTx, Cr2CTx, and V2CTx). Furthermore, the cobalt ion doped MXenes show an exceptionally enhanced capability of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, demonstrating their multifunctionalities, which is comparable to the commercialized catalysts. Moreover, we successfully exploited our MXenes as cathodes for the novel aqueous rechargeable battery, with proficient retention and excellent electrical output performance. This work paves a nontoxic and HF-free route to prepare various MXenes and demonstrates practical applications of the materials.									224	24	0	0	11	0	233			0002-7863			WOS:000471835600030	31117483

In this work, Gallium (Ga)doped Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays grown on Ti3C2-MXene/nickel foam (Ga-Ni3S2/Ti3C2/NF) have been synthesized by a successive hydrothermal and sulfidization process. The Ga doping modulates the electronic structure of Ni3S2, so tuning the adsorption energies of oxygen intermediate (*OOH). The Ga-Ni3S2/Ti3C2/NF delivers outstanding catalytic activities toward OER with an overpotential of 340 mV at 100 mA cm(-,) and exhibits superior electrochemical durability. The excellent OER performance of Ga-Ni3S2/Ti3C2/NF can be ascribed to the 3D sheet arrays morphology and optimized electronic structure. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations also demonstrate that electronic disturbance attributed to Ga doping effectively improves the activity of Ni sites, leading to stronger binding strength of *OOH intermediate at Ni sites nearby Ga.

In this work, a one-pot, spatially confined strategy was reported to fabricate ultrathin NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanosheets interconnected by ultrafine, strong carbon nanofibers (CNFs) network. The as-fabricated NiFe-LDH/CNFs catalyst exhibits enhanced OER catalytic activity in terms of low overpotential of 230 mV to obtain an OER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and very small Tafel slope of 34 mV dec(-1), outperforming pure NiFe-LDH nanosheets assembly, commercial RuO2, and most non-noble metal catalysts ever reported. It also delivers an excellent structural and electrocatalytic stability upon the long-term OER operation at a large current of 30 mA cm(-2) for 40 h. Furthermore, the cell assembled by using NiFe-LDH/ CNFs and commercial Pt/C as anode (thorn) and cathode (-) ((+) NiFe-LDH/CNFs||Pt/C(-)) only requires a potential of 1.50 V to deliver the water splitting current of 10 mA cm(-2), 130 mV lower than that of (+)RuO2||Pt/C(-) couple, demonstrating great potential for applications in cost-efficient water splitting devices.

In this study, a chelate polymer, composed of copper (II) and dithiooxamide, was used to derive an efficient catalytic system for OER. Upon potential sweep in 1M KOH, copper (II) centers of the chelate polymer were transformed to CuO and Cu(OH)(2). The carbon-dispersed CuO nanostructures formed a nanocomposite which exhibits an enhanced catalytic activity for OER in alkaline media. The nanocomposite catalyst has an overpotential of 280 mV (at 1 mA/cm(2)) and a Tafel slope of 81 mV/dec in 1M KOH solution. It has a seven-fold higher current than an IrO2/C electrode, per metal loading. A catalytic cycle is proposed, in which CuO undergoes electrooxidation to Cu2O3 that further decomposes to CuO with the release of oxygen. This work reveals a new method to produce an active nanocomposite catalyst for OER in alkaline media using a non-noble metal chelate polymer and a porous carbon. This method can be applied to the synthesis of transition metal oxide nanoparticles used in the preparation of composite electrodes for water electrolyzers and can be used to derive cathode materials for aqueous-type metal-air batteries.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14				2073-4344		WOS:000519998900091

The calculated specific activity and turnover frequency normalized by electrochemical active surface area also support the individual half-cell electrode performance, such as 0.05 M (20.19 A g(-1) and 0.69 s(-1)) and 0.025 M (-41.91 A g(-1) and -1.53 s(-1)) at 550 and -150 mV for OER and HER, respectively. An H-type cell constructed with an anion exchange membrane delivers robust stability even at a substantially higher current density of 200 mA cm(-2) for over 56 hours with the highest Faradaic efficiency of 98.64 % at 1.6 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in 1 M KOH.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000864007300001

NH2OH and NaCl treatments, which inactivate oxygen evolution, affected neither the binding to PS II membranes of the extrinsic 33-kDa protein or of atrazine, The atrazine binding sites that are latent in CaCl2-treated PS II membranes was partially restored by the reconstitution of the membranes with isolated extrinsic 33-kDa protein, An oxidizing system involving the 33-kDa protein may provide a suitable structure of PS II reaction center complex for atrazine binding, The level of inhibition of oxygen-evolving activity by atrazine under the saturating intensity of light parallels the fraction of the photosystem (PS) II reaction center with the quinone-binding site blocked by atrazine, In contrast, under a rate-limiting intensity of light, percents of remaining oxygen-evolving activity after the addition of atrazine correlated with the 1.33th power of the fraction of atrazine-free binding sites, Inhibition of PS II complexes more than one that bound with atrazine suggests a cooperation between PS II complexes to evolve oxygen under weak light intensity.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0916-8451	1347-6947		WOS:A1995RB31500006		
J	Niyitanga, Theophile; Kim, Haekyoung								Synergistic effect of trimetallic-based CuxMox/Co1_xO nanoparticles/ reduced graphene oxide as high efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				451						138649	10.1016/j.cej.2022.138649				JAN 1 2023	2023	The development of an efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is urgently required for sustainable renewable energy production. Owing to the increase in chemical complexity, multimetallic catalysts provide the flexibility to alter their electronic structure to attain superior intrinsic catalytic activity via synergistic effects. In this study, trimetallic CuxMox/Co1_xO nanoparticles grown on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as a catalyst for the OER were fabricated via a facile solution-hydrothermal synthesis assisted by a calcination process. In the fabricated CuxMox/Co1_xO NPs@RGO hybrid catalyst, the RGO sheet acted as a conductive network to promote electron transfer, thus increasing the electrocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, additional active sites as bridged sites from the Cu and Mo dopants improved the catalytic activity, resulting in outstanding electrochemical activity for the OER. The optimized Cu0.19Mo0.19/Co0.62O NPs@RGO catalyst exhibited a low overpotential of 250 mV and a small Tafel slope of 61 mV/dec at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and an overpotential of 550 mV at a high current density of 150 mA cm(-2). This study provides a novel strategy for the development of efficient OER electrocatalysts for large-scale applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000851458000001

Here, by using cage-like bicyclocalix[2]arene[2]triazines tri-aldehyde (BCTAL) as the building block, 2D COF Cage-COF-1 was estimated to have a very weak interaction between adjacent layers (around 1/50 compared to that of graphite). As a result, 1.2 nm thick trilayer COF nanosheets were facilely exfoliated from the pristine COFs with large lateral size and high thickness homogeneity. The Cage-COF-1 nanosheet is featured by imine linkage, but it is catalytic inactive in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). After post-metalation with Co2+ under ambient conditions, remarkable catalysis activity and stability was observed for Cage-COF-1-Ns/Co, which has lower overpotential (330 mV) and Tafel slope (56 mV/dec) in catalytic OER compared to many other Co catalysts. This work has confirmed that weakening the interlaminar interaction is an effective strategy for the production of ultra-thin COFs nanosheets. Due to the fully exposed and accessible imine linkage, catalysis active metal site can be controllably produced via post-synthesis from nanosheets under very mild conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2199-692X			WOS:000863947500001

However, quick and accurate assessment of their real electroactive surface area (ECSA), which is of paramount importance for the evaluation of their performance, remains a challenging task. Herein, we present a relatively simple strategy for an accurate in situ determination of the ECSA of commonly used metal oxide catalysts, namely Ni-, Co-, Fe-, Pt-, and Ir-based oxides. Similar to the well -established practice in electrocatalysis, the method is based on the phenomenon of specific adsorption. It uses the fact that at electrode potentials close to the onset of the oxygen evolution reaction, specifically adsorbed reaction intermediates manifest themselves through so called adsorption capacitance, which is unambiguously detectable using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. We determined and calibrated these capacitances for common catalyst metal oxides using model thin films. Therefore, with simple impedance measurements, experimentalists can acquire the adsorption capacitance values and accurately estimate the real electroactive surface area of the above-mentioned oxide materials, including nanostructured electrocatalysts. Additionally, as illustrative examples, we demonstrate the application of the method for the determination of the ECSA of oxide catalyst nanoparticles.									33	0	0	0	2	0	33			2155-5435			WOS:000489204000043

The CuO materials were facilely synthesized by a simple molten salt method at a high temperature and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis. The catalytic water oxidation activity is affected by many factors, such as the catalyst morphologies, electronic double-layer capacitance, and the conductivity. Under optimal conditions, the CuO material prepared at 900 degrees C showed the nanosheets structure with more exposed catalytic active sites and demonstrated high catalytic performance for OER with a low overpotential of only 420 mV to achieve 10 mA/cm(2) and 520 mV to achieve 40 mA/cm(2), respectively. Furthermore, when CuO nanosheets are mixed with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), the catalyst loading can be greatly decreased from 0.7 mg/cm(2) to 0.14 mg/cm(2) and the overpotential for 40 mA/cm(2) is also lowered to 470 mV.

It is known that Ni-based catalysts exhibit remarkable catalytic activities for the OER in alkaline media. In this joint theoretical-experimental study, we provide a thorough characterization of Ni-based double hydroxides with Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, and Zn at the atomic scale that not only explains the reasons for their high activity but also provides simple design principles for the enhancement of their electrocatalytic properties. Our approach, based on the local symmetry and composition of the active sites, helps rationalize the effect of dopants on the catalytic activity of Ni(OH)(2). In particular, NiFe, NiCr, and NiMn double hydroxides (DHs) have superior catalytic activity, which reduce the OER potential to reach 0.5 mA cm(-2) by 230, 190, and 160 mV, respectively, in comparison to IrO2 nanoparticles, the state-of-the-art benchmarking catalysts, with 90% Faradaic efficiency for O-2 generation. The active species in NiFe and NiMn DHs are iron and manganese, while in NiCr DH, nickel is the active species.									398	15	0	0	17	0	398			2155-5435			WOS:000361089700047

Herein, the direct growth of 1D NiCo2S4 nanowire (NW) arrays on a 3D Ni foam (NF) is described. This NiCo2S4 NW/NF array functions as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting with excellent activity and stability. The 3D-Ni foam facilitates the directional growth, exposing more active sites of the catalyst for electrochemical reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The binder-free, self-made NiCo2S4 NW/NF electrode delivers a hydrogen production current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 260 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction and at 210 mV (versus a reversible hydrogen electrode) for the hydrogen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH. This highly active and stable bifunctional electrocatalyst enables the preparation of an alkaline water electrolyzer that could deliver 10 mA cm(-2) under a cell voltage of 1.63 V. Because the nonprecious-metal NiCo2S4 NW/NF foam-based electrodes afford the vigorous and continuous evolution of both H-2 and O-2 at 1.68 V, generated using a solar panel, they appear to be promising water splitting devices for large-scale solar-to-hydrogen generation.									1034	55	0	0	38	0	1042			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000380887300005

Here, the unique NiCo alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in the multi-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon architecture (NiCo/MNC) is reported as an effective bifunctional catalyst for rechargeable zinc-air batteries. The multi-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon architecture was synthesized through the rapid calcination of two-dimensional graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and one-dimensional multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The g-C3N4 serves as the nitrogen source and the precursor for N-doped carbon nanosheets (NCSs). Simultaneously, NCSs can intertwine with MWCNTs to further obtain the multi-dimensional architecture with a large specific surface area. The synergistic effect between multi-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon architectures and NiCo alloy nanoparticles endowed the NiCo/MNC with a positive half-wave potential of 0.83 V (vs. RHE: Reversible Hydrogen Electrode) for oxygen reduction reaction and a low potential of 1.61 V (vs. RHE) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction. Moreover, the zinc-air battery assembled with NiCo/MNC as the air-cathode exhibited a high-power density of 135.2 mW cm(-2), a specific capacity of 701.7 mAh g(-1), and an excellent stability in charging/discharging cycle test (over 115 h). The prepared catalyst could potentially serve to take the place of precious metal catalysts in rechargeable zinc-air batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we developed a simple silica template approach to form porous carbons codoped with nitrogen and cobalt as highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for the ORR and HER. The resulting porous carbons exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the ORR in alkaline media, which compares favorably with that of commercial Pt/C (20 wt%), and had superior durability and excellent methanol tolerance. The porous carbons also showed superior performance for the HER, with a low onset potential of -0.04 V, a Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1), an overpotential of -0.106 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and remarkable durability. These results demonstrate that the Co, N-doped carbons are promising bifunctional catalysts for fuel cell applications.									31	3	0	0	0	0	32			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000445218000036		
J	Hill, Jane F.; Govindjee				Govindjee, Govindjee/ABF-3362-2021				The controversy over the minimum quantum requirement for oxygen evolution								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				122	1			97	112		10.1007/s11120-014-0014-8				OCT 2014	2014	During the early- to mid-twentieth century, a bitter controversy raged among researchers on photosynthesis regarding the minimum number of light quanta required for the evolution of one molecule of oxygen. From 1923 until his death in 1970, Otto Warburg insisted that this value was about three or four quanta. Beginning in the late 1930s, Robert Emerson and others on the opposing side consistently obtained a value of 8-12 quanta. Warburg changed the protocols of his experiments, sometimes in unexplained ways, yet he almost always arrived at a value of four or less, except eight in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, which he dismissed as "unphysiological". This paper is largely an abbreviated form of the detailed story on the minimum quantum requirement of photosynthesis, as told by Nickelsen and Govindjee (The maximum quantum yield controversy: Otto Warburg and the "Midwest-Gang", 2011); we provide here a scientific thread, leaving out the voluminous private correspondence among the principal players that Nickelsen and Govindjee (2011) examined in conjunction with their analysis of the principals' published papers. We explore the development and course of the controversy and the ultimate resolution in favor of Emerson's result as the phenomenon of the two-light-reaction, two-pigment-system scheme of photosynthesis came to be understood. In addition, we include a brief discussion of the discovery by Otto Warburg of the requirement for bicarbonate in the Hill reaction.									12	0	0	0	7	0	13			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000342493000008	24925628

Transition metals are widely used in the synthesis of MPX3, however, divalent cations of alkaline earth metals can also be constituents in MPX3 2D layered structures. Herein, MgPX3 (X = S, Se) are synthesized and their photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity is tested in the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) regions under a wide range of wavelengths. MgPSe3 photoelectrode shows the best PEC performance with a response of 1.6 +/- 0.1 mA cm(-2) under 420 nm. In the light-assisted OER, a 200 mV improvement is obtained in the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) for MgPSe3. The better performance of MgPSe3 is consistent with its lower optical bandgap (E-g = 3.15 eV), as a result of the variation of electronegativity between selenide and sulfide.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000777534000001	35373472

Single molecules attach preferably to three-fold coordinated surface In atoms. Water dissociation is energetically favorable but hindered by an energy barrier that decreases with increasing water coverage. There is an attractive interaction between InP adsorbed water molecules that leads to the formation of molecular dusters and complete water films for water-rich preparation conditions. Water films on InP are stabilized by anchoring to surface-bonded hydroxyl groups. With increasing thickness, the water films resemble the structural properties of ice Ih. The oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions on InP are characterized by overpotentials of the order of 1.7-1.8 and 0.2-0.3 eV, respectively. While the calculated bulk positions of the InP band edges are outside the range of the redox potentials for oxygen and hydrogen evolution within local DFT, the situation is different at the actual interface: Here, the interface dipole lifts the InP valence band maximum above the redox potential for oxygen evolution and favors hydrogen evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-1343			WOS:000820766200001	35722024

Herein, hierarchical interconnected NixCo1-xOOH nanosheet arrays supported on TiO2/Ti substrate have been fabricated through a facile photodeposition method. Compared with pristine NiOOH, the obtained NixCo1-xOOH nanosheet arrays possess larger exposed electrochemical active surface area, faster transfer and collection of electrons and stronger electronic interaction, showing a low overpotential of 350 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 41 mV.dec(-1) in basic solutions, with the OER performance superior to pristine NiOOH and most Ni-based catalysts. Furthermore, the NixCo1-xOOH electrode demonstrates excellent stability at the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) for 24 hours, which is attributed to the structural maintenance caused by the good adhesion of the catalyst and the substrate. Our study provides an alternative approach for the rational design of highly active and promising OER electrocatalysts.									20	3	0	0	0	0	20			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000505357500010

In this study, we report a facile one-step electrodeposition route to prepare self-supported porous Ni-Mo alloy microsphere (Ni-Mo MS) films directly grown on copper foils from a deep eutectic solvent, ethaline (mixture of choline chloride and ethylene glycol), as a highly efficient and durable catalyst for both the HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH. The prepared Ni-Mo MS/Cu, as a hydrogen-evolving cathode, shows remarkable catalytic performance toward the HER with a small Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1) and a low HER overpotential of -63 mV to deliver 20 mA cm(-2). Serving as an oxygen-evolving anode, the catalyst also offers excellent OER catalytic activity with a moderate Tafel slope of 108 mV dec(-1), and reaches 20 mA cm(-2) at an OER overpotential of 335 mV. Utilized as both the cathode and anode in a symmetric two-electrode water electrolysis system, the bifunctional catalyst requires a cell voltage of 1.59 V to reach an overall water splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with robust durability, which could be potentially used in water splitting devices for practical applications.									94	3	0	0	4	0	94			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000397606400017

Fe incorporation into Ni-Co2P leads to (i) the increased amount of high-valence Co3+ and Ni3+, (ii) the improved intrinsic activity of active centers, and (iii) the increased disorder defects in the in situ-formed oxyhydroxide species during the OER activation process. Synergistic actions among them enable the electrocatalyst's exceptional OER activity with an overpotential of 225 +/- 4 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), which outperforms the benchmark catalyst RuO2 and most state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, Fe incorporation decreases the density of states near the Fermi level, which slightly degrades the HER activity compared to the Fe-free electrocatalyst. The FeNi-Co2P parallel to FeNi-Co2P and FeNi-Co2P parallel to Ni-Co2P electrolyzer cells demonstrate voltages of 1.596 and 1.578 V at 10 mA/cm(2) for water splitting in 1 M KOH, respectively. A solar energy-powered electrolyzer cell for water splitting has been realized with the as-proposed electrocatalysts. Our results suggest that multimetallic phosphides are promising as low-cost, efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in alkaline electrolyte. Additionally, this work provides a real-world application scenario of overall water splitting for hydrogen generation by renewable energy sources.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2574-0962			WOS:000703338600132

Herein, a facile one-pot strategy is reported to obtain Ni3S4 nanosheets directly grown on Ni foam (NiS/NF) as bifunctional nonprecious electrocatalyst toward full water splitting through a facile hydrothermal-sulfurization method in Na2S solution. The resultant unique structure with integrated hierarchical three-dimensional (3D) configuration can enhance mass transport and charge mobility and facilitate the diffusion of generated gases (H-2 and O-2). Thus, the prepared NiS/NF exhibits remarkable catalytic activity and outstanding stability for water oxidation and reduction reaction in alkaline electrolyte. For hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it only needs a low overpotential of 122 mV to render a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 69 mV dec(-1), whereas it delivers a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the overpotential of 320 mV together with Tafel slope of 71 mV dec(-1). Importantly, when NiS/NF is assembled as an alkaline electrolyzor, it only needs a cell voltage of 1.61 V to provide current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and maintains this current density for over 20 h with a recession of 4.5%. Various characterizations and controlled experiments reveal that the outstanding activity and robust stability of NiS/NF for electrocatatlytic water splitting are attributed to its integrated electrode configurations of the electrochemically active constituents and the conductive Ni foam and unique superstructure with high electrochemical surface area.									98	11	0	0	4	0	99			2168-0485			WOS:000407410900093

The use of seawater and salted water has advantages for minimum environmental burden; however, the oxidation of Cl- ion to hypochlorous acid (HClO), which has toxicity and heavy corrosiveness, should occur at the anode, along with the oxygen evolution. Here, O-2 and HClO production in aqueous solution containing Cl- on photoanodes modified with various metal oxides was investigated. The modification of MnOx resulted in the promotion of the O-2 evolution reaction (OER) specifically without HClO production over a wide range of conditions. The results will contribute not only to the practical application of artificial photosynthesis using salted water but also to the elucidation of substantial function of manganese as the element for OER center in natural photosynthesis.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2589-0042		WOS:000581985500003	33134889

However, the synergistic effect of elcetrocatalyst and cocatalyst is rarely studied. In this paper, by combining FeNi layered double hydroxide (LDH) electrocatalyst with a two-dimensional (2D) Ti3C2 co-catalyst on TiO2 photocatalyst, the OER performance of TiO2/Ti3C2/FeNi LDH is greatly improved due to the synergistic coupling effect. The microstructure, electrochemical performance and oxygen generation mechanism of TiO2/Ti3C2/FeNi LDH are investigated in this paper. The results showed that the vertical array of FeNi LDH nanosheets created many nanoscale channels for reaction intermediates, enabling them to enter the most active sites on the surface. More importantly, the addition of Ti3C2 with high conductivity greatly effectively improved the charge separation and transfer between TiO2 and FeNi LDH. Therefore, the required over-potential for current density 100 mA/cm(2) was only 633 mV for TiO2/2 Ti3C2/FeNi LDH. Meanwhile, Tafel slope was as low as 30 mV/dec with good stability. This work provides a reference for using Ti3C2 as a new type of co-catalyst material to obtain an efficient, stable and economical OER reaction catalyst.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000682391400002

Herein, we report a novel binder-free efficient Co9S8@Co3O4 core/shell electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via a combined hydrothermal-sulfurization method. The sulfurized net-like Co9S8 nanoflakes are strongly anchored on the Co3O4 nanowire core forming self-supported binder-free core/shell electrocatalysts. Positive advantages including larger active surface area of Co9S8 nanoflakes, and reinforced structural stability are achieved in the Co9S8@Co3O4 core/shell arrays. The OER performances of the Co9S8@Co3O4 core/shell arrays are thoroughly tested and enhanced electrocatalytic performance with lower over-potential (260 mV at 20 mA cm(-2)) and smaller Tafel slopes (56 mV dec(-1)) as well as long-term durability are demonstrated in alkaline medium. Our proposed core/shell smart design may provide a new way to construct other advanced binder-free electrocatalysts for applications in electrochemical catalysis.

RuOx is particularly vulnerable to high overpotential in acidic media, due to the formation of soluble species, thus making it nearly impossible to be used as a commercially viable OER electrocatalyst. Herein, we demonstrate that the charge transfer from Pt to conjoined RuO2 dramatically stabilizes the RuO2 phase against overoxidation, the main culprit of disintegration of RuO2. In this work, we compared the OER performance of three different types of Au@Pt@RuOx nanowires, namely, hetero-interfaced, gradient-alloy, and conformal-shell type, with varying degrees of interaction between Pt and RuO2. Among the studied samples, the hetero-interfaced type exhibited the highest OER mass activity of 1.311 A mg(Ru)(-1) at 1.48 V-RHE and maintained its activity durably, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of charge transfer from Pt to RuO2 in the hetero-interfaced structure against overoxidation of RuO2.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000663885000001

Here we report on 41 kinds of FexCuyNi1-x-y/FeOOH/NiOOH/CuO complexes (FCN-x) to investigate the Cu and Fe induced electronic perturbation and what it brings to OER performance. As result, the activity mapping of FCN-x shows an optimal composition of 1:2:7 (FCN-7) showing a comparable overpotential potential of 170.3 mV, Tafel slop of 75.9 mV dec(-1) and durability of 24 h (similar to 29% activity loss) to that of mainstream Ru/Ir-free catalysts. Such enhancement could be attributed to the role of alloying contribution of Fe/Cu, electronic perturbation and surface modification of surface oxides. Additionally, the incompletely oxidized FexCuyNi1-x-y not only provide a platform for electron conduction, but also work as a sacrificial material to forming fresh oxides to maintain the content of surface oxides, which is a key driver of the excellent durability of FCN-7. This synthetic strategy may give an effective way to design and screen Ru/Ir-free OER catalysts. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Since new elements produced by dying stars are delivered to the interstellar medium, the formation of new generations of stars and planetary systems is influenced by this metal enrichment. We aim to study the role of the metallicity on the gas phase chemistry of the interstellar medium. Using a system of coupled ordinary differential equations to model the chemical reactions, we simulate the evolution of the abundance of molecules in the gas phase for different initial interstellar elemental compositions. These varying initial elemental compositions consider the change in the 'elemental abundances' predicted by a self-consistent model of the elemental evolution of the Galaxy. As far as we are aware, this is the first attempt to combine elemental evolution of the Galaxy and chemical evolution of molecular clouds. The metallicity was found to have a strong effect on the overall gas phase composition. With decreasing metallicity, the number of long carbon chains was found to increase, the time-scale on which small molecular species are increases, and the main form of oxygen changed from O and CO to O-2. These effects were found to be mainly due to the change in electron, H-3(+), and atomic oxygen abundance.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000334115400032

Herein, we designed and synthesized a Ni-N and P-O codoped graphene (NiPG) nanomaterial for trifunctionally electrocatalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CDRR). Beyond the known role of P-O and Ni-N units for the OER/ORR and CDRR, separately, the P-O unit, which expressed high activity in the HER, was found to suppress the competitive HER towards enhanced CDRR on NiPG over Ni-N doped graphene, firstly. Besides, the Ni-N unit also promoted the OER/ORR over P-O doped graphene. Based on this trifunctional NiPG electrocatalyst, we realized dual-model Zn-CO2/Zn-O-2 batteries, switched by supplying CO2 or O-2. This work provides the novel design of multifunctional electrocatalysts and dual-model batteries for the versatile application demands of energy conversion and storage.									37	4	0	0	0	0	38			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000457893400015

The unique structure of NiO-NiCo2O4 with the synergetic effect between NiCo2O4 and NiO, and the heterostructure favour the catalytic activity towards Li-O-2 batteries. NiCo2O4 is helpful for boosting both the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction for the Li-O-2 batteries and NiO is likely to promote the decomposition of certain by-products. The special urchin-like morphology facilitates the continuous oxygen flow and accommodates Li2O2. Moreover, benefitting from the heterostructure, NiO-NiCo2O4 microspheres are able to promote the transport of Li ions and electrons to further improve battery performance. Li-O-2 batteries utilizing a NiO-NiCo2O4 microsphere electrode show a much higher specific capacity and a lower overpotential than those with a Super P electrode. Moreover, they exhibit an enhanced cycling stability. The electrode can be continuously discharged and charged without obvious terminal voltage variation for 80 cycles, as the discharge capacity is restricted at 600 mA h g(-1), suggesting that NiO-NiCo2O4 is a promising catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries.									107	2	0	0	5	0	107			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000454327500005	30534796

While nonprecious transition metal-based (Co, Ni, Fe) materials are extensively studied as cost-effective, high-performance alternatives to noble metal-based catalysts, iron-based catalysts with Fe acting as the single active site are rarely investigated due to their intrinsically low reactivity. Here, by taking advantage of the versatility of perovskite structure, metalloid Si, the second most abundant element in Earth's crust, is doped into an Fe-based perovskite oxide (SrFeO3-delta), to obtain SrFe0.9Si0.1O3-delta as a highly efficient OER catalyst. Remarkably, SrFe0.9Si0.1O3-delta shows an approximately threefold growth in OER activity relative to SrFeO3- with a small Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1), comparing favorably to or even exceeding many Co-/Ni-based perovskite catalysts. This enhancement can be ascribed to a structural transition from tetragonal to cubic symmetry upon Si-doping, which brings about an optimized iron oxidation state, rich oxygen vacancies, and fast charge transfer that are beneficial to the OER catalysis. This work highlights the importance of how incorporating Earth-abundant, nonprecious elements (e.g., Si) into a perovskite oxide structure can be used to create novel materials for the electrochemical water oxidation.									59	2	0	0	3	0	58			2196-7350			WOS:000434945400010

Furthermore, the sample illustrates superior stability and methanol tolerance to Pt/C. The excellent catalytic activity of the Mo0.42C0.58@N-doped carbon can be attributed to the existence of Mo0.42C0.58 nanoparticles, the N doping in carbonized polypyrrole, and the well-maintained one-dimensional nanostructure.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			2365-6549			WOS:000432225900015

The generation of value-added products using low value and harmful EWs could decrease the economic cost on the treatment and the raw materials. In this work, polyaspartic acid modifying magnetic graphene composite (MG) was firstly prepared with promising magnetic separation and heavy metal ions uptake properties. Ni(Zn)-Cr layered double hydroxides coating magnetic-graphene composites (Ni(Zn)Cr-LDH/MG) were prepared by co-precipitation method using simulative electroplating wastewaters, which were further calcined to form layered double oxides (Ni(Zn)Cr-LDO/MG). The resulting materials were carefully examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and electrochemical techniques. The electro-catalysis of the resulting materials towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was investigated by various electrochemical methods in 1 M KOH. NiCr-LDO/MG formed at 500 degrees C showed promising electro-catalysis for OER, with good catalytic stability over long period of 50,000 s. The present results demonstrated that EWs could be reused to fabricating promising value-added catalyst on OER.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000605575800001

Here we report the modulation of electrocatalytic properties of pristine anatase by the doping of an earth-abundant metal (Co). So obtained hybrid materials show enhanced catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It was noted that the retention of free carbon during the synthesis of such hybrid materials further enhances their OER activity bringing it at par with the benchmark IrO2 catalyst. Evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) was used to prepare mesoporous titania using a triblock copolymer (P123) as structure directing agent. Nanostructured titania was first impregnated with a cobalt complex followed by thermal treatment at 500, 700 and 900 degrees C under air, argon and hydrogen atmosphere to obtain a series of catalysts. The effect of metal content and annealing atmosphere was studied on the composition and OER activity of the catalysts. The best OER activity (.: 440mV@10 mA.cm(-2)), comparable to benchmark IrO2 and decent stability was noted for the material annealed under argon and containing 15 wt % Co. Improved OER activity was attributed to better water adsorption, charge transfer and conductivity of titania upon Co doping and carbon retention.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2468-8231			WOS:000527270100005

This reaction demands inexpensive, efficient and robust electrocatalyst for its commercial use. Herein, we demonstrate an effective, facile and scalable method for the synthesis of cerium doped Ni3Fe nanostructures as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by following simple chemical bath deposition route. The different molar ratios (3, 6 and 12 mM) of cerium in the chemical bath were used to study its effect on the structural and the electrochemical properties of the Ni3Fe nanostructured films. Doping of cerium contents induced variations in the morphology of deposited Ni3Fe nanostructures. The optimized electrocatalyst Ni3Fe/Ce-6 yielded high surface area catalyst nanosheets uniformly deposited on three-dimensional conductive scaffold to ensure increase in the exposure of doped Ni3Fe catalytic sites with high electrical conductivity. As a result, this earth-abundant electrocatalyst affords high OER performance with a small overpotential of 310 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RFIE) at 10 mA cm(-2) and retains good stability up to similar to 10 h in alkaline electrolyte. This scalable strategy has great potential in future advancement of efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for their large-scale application in energy conversion systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1011-3924	1726-801X		WOS:000583708200012

As we all know, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key and restricted part of the overall water-spitting process. Highly efficient electrocatalysts are essential components to accelerate the rate of the OER and lower the overpotential. In this paper, an ultrathin nickel-based film on FTO (NiOx-Tris electrode) was prepared through five cycles of cyclic-voltammetry electrodeposition from a 0.1 M borate buffer solution (pH 9.2) that contained a molecular nickel complex as a precursor. The activity of the as-prepared catalyst film for OER was measured in near-neutral borate buffer solution (0.6M, pH 9.2), and the results showed that the NiOx-Tris electrode exhibits a better catalytic activity over the catalyst (NiOx-aqua) that was derived from Ni2+ salts. In detail, the NiOx-Tris ultrathin film achieved a stable catalytic current density of similar to 5.0 mA/cm(2) at 1.3 V versus a normal hydrogen electrode for OER in borate buffer solution.

The spin-coating process forms smooth, thin islands of IrOx with limited cracking and decreases the surface-to-bulk ratio to allow a more intimate study of the growth, composition, and stability of the layer without the complications of the mud crack morphology. XPS and XRD measurements show a resulting (Ir,Ti)O-x surface (x near 2) with OH- groups and H2O. Cyclic voltammetry measurements indicate the expected high catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction as well as a dry IrOx phase resulting from the thermal manufacturing process, although evidence of hydrous phases are found in XPS. Both films required only small overpotentials for the oxygen evolution reaction, with the spin-coated sample showing a slightly lower activity. CO temperature desorption spectroscopy analysis showed CO -> CO2 oxidation and, in combination with XPS, an unstable surface. The oxidation of CO was not due to the TiOx, and the absence of any evidence of an Ir-suboxide phase indicates the presence of near-surface active species present after synthesis or an active surface termination.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000328101200028

Herein, we report the catalysts of NiFe double-layer hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) mixed with different equivalent terephthalic acid (TPA), synthesized by the hydrothermal method. The catalyst synthesized with the use of the precursor solution containing one equivalent of TPA shows the best performance with the current density of 2 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 270 mV, the Tafel slope of 40 mV dec(-1), and excellent stable electrocatalytic performance for OER. These catalysts were characterized in a variety of methods. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR), and Raman spectrum proved the presence of TPA in the catalysts. The lamellar structure and the uniform distribution of Ni and Fe in the catalysts were observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM). In X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of NiFe-LDH with and without TPA, the changes in the peak positions of Ni and Fe spectra indicate strong electronic interactions between TPA and Ni and Fe atoms. These results suggest that a certain amount of TPA can boost catalytic activity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2073-4344		WOS:000776884600001

Basically, a GO hydrogel is printed on Ni foam by the doctor blade technique, forming a GO matrix embedded in Ni foam, which is then freeze-dried to turn into a 3-dimensional (3D) porous GO (3D-GO) matrix. NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanoflakes anchored on the 3D-GO matrix embedded in Ni foam are synthesized by a hydrothermal process, together with the in situ reduction of 3D-GO. The obtained electrode has a high degree of reduction of the porous graphene oxide, the mechanical strength of the NiFe-LDH nanoflakes anchored on the matrix, large active surface area and excellent interface conjunction. Based on optimal conditions, the fabricated electrode shows outstanding electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction performance in 1 M KOH aqueous solution, achieving a small overpotential of 170 mV, a Tafel slope of 57 mV decade(-1) at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) and a relatively stable operating potential after 2000 cycles of the CV test.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000468631600014

Here, we rationally designed a 2D Co-MOF [Co(BDC)(2)(SPDP)(2)(DMF)(H2O)] (H2BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, SPDP = 4,4-(sulfonylbis(4,1-phenylene))dipyridine, DMF = N,N-dimethylformamide) as a single-source precursor through direct carbonization to afford an N, O and S-tridoped carbon matrix encapsulated with Co9S8 nanocomposites (Co9S8@TDC). By virtue of the intrinsic activity of Co9S8 nanoparticles (NPs) as well as the heteroatom-doped carbon shell, Co9S8@TDC possessed excellent electrocatalytic activities for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline solutions. In particular, Co9S8@TDC-900 displayed an overpotential of 330 mV (vs. RHE) at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and a half-wave potential of 0.78 V (vs. RHE) for ORR with the limiting current density of 5.45 mA cm(-2), rivalling the performances of RuO2 and Pt/C. As the proof of concept, Co9S8@TDC-900 was employed as a bifunctional oxygen catalyst for a rechargeable Zn-air battery, exhibiting a considerable open-circuit voltage (1.50 V) and impressive long-term charge/discharge stability (45 h at 5 mA cm(-2)). The straightforward strategy provides a facile method for the further exploration of non-noble metal electrochemical oxygen reaction catalysts.									74	9	0	0	5	0	75			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463819400007

We investigate the interaction of a linear, catacondensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), pentacene (C22H14), and its oxygen-functionalised form 6, 13 pentacenequinone (C22H12O2) with atomic hydrogen (H) under interstellar conditions. We compare their reaction cross-sections and reaction products to elucidate the possible role played by oxygen-functionalised PAHs in the formation of small oxygen-carrying molecules in the interstellar medium. Methods. We present temperature-programmed desorption measurements in combination with mass spectrometry. The evolution of the mass distribution of the desorbed species with increasing H-atom fluence and their peak desorption temperatures give insight into the reaction products. Results. The experiments reveal reaction cross-sections that are significantly larger for the oxygen-functionalised species compared to pentacene. For both pentacene and 6, 13 pentacenequinone, hydrogenated species with an even number of excess H-atoms dominate over hydrogenated species with an odd number of H-atoms. The end product, after exposure to large H-atom fluences, for both pentacene and PQ is fully superhydrogenated pentacene (C22H36), with little evidence for any remaining oxygen-containing species. This suggests the release of small molecules such as OH and/or H2O by the abstraction of oxygen atoms during hydrogenation, indicating that oxygen-functionalised PAHs can enable the formation of small oxygen-bearing molecules under interstellar conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000830127600016

Herein, the hybrid that Co-LDH nanosheets shells grown on Ag nanowires (NWs) cores (Ag@Co-LDH) was constructed and applied as a favorable OER electrocatalyst. The high conductivity of Ag NWs and heterointerface between Ag NWs and Co-LDH gravely accelerate electron transfer. Co-LDH with ultrathin sheet-like structure and abundant grain boundary defects effectively provide lots of active sites. The optimized local environment of Co atoms by Ag dopants and plentiful amorphous regions strongly enhance the intrinsic activity of active site. Therefore, the as-prepared Ag@Co-LDH demonstrates distinguished OER activity with a low overpotential of 217 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to most reported advanced OER electrocatalysts and even commercial Ir/C. Moreover, benefiting from the unique structure and stable heterointerface, Ag@Co-LDH also exhibits robust cycling stability and long-term durability proved by accelerated degradation test (ADT) and galvanostatic test, respectively. This finding provides a practical design direction for high-performance LDHbased OER electrocatalysts.									31	0	0	0	2	0	31			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000696918200006

Here, we report the growth of alpha-IrO2 via epitaxial thin films using pulsed laser deposition. We observe that, in competition with R-IrO2 (100), the films can be optimized to be predominantly (100)-oriented alpha-IrO2. Surprisingly, the activity of alpha-IrO2 shows a large discrepancy of similar to 0.2 V in the overpotential compared to its predicted activity, which is resolved via theoretical calculations to be a crystal orientation effect. This demonstrates that the electrocatalytic activity can be significantly varied upon crystal orientation, a parameter that is difficult to control in conventional polycrystalline systems but accessible in epitaxial thin films. In total, this study demonstrates epitaxial thin film growth as a powerful technique, which can overcome large energetic instabilities on the order of similar to 300 meV to stabilize metastable material structures inaccessible by bulk synthesis. This provides unique opportunities to effectively identify the atomic structure of active catalysts by combining investigations of metastable materials with theoretical predictions.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000644737800012

Herein, a Se-doped hollow heterostructure/defects Co-Fe sulfide (Se-(CoFe)S-2) box has been developed via a facile sulfurization-selenization treatment of hollow Co-Fe Prussian blue analogues precursor. Remarkably, the abundant hierarchical macro-mesopores of hollow Se-(CoFe)S2 nanobox with excellent structural stability and unique electrical properties can not only effectively expose the electrochemically accessible active sites but also significantly improve the electrolyte transport and electron transfer, thus boosting electrochemical performances in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and supercapacitors in alkaline media. For OER, the Se-(CoFe)S-2 electrocatalyst shows a small overpotential of 281 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 51.8 mV dec(-1) as well as high stability. Furthermore, it also shows good performance for supercapacitors, suggesting its great potential as an efficient electrode for sustainable energy applications. Superb properties highlight the great prospects of PBA-based derivatives in applications of energy storage and conversion. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Their activity can be significantly enhanced by doping chromium; however, the optimal catalyst elemental composition is unknown, and the exact role of Cr remains elusive. Here, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and comprehensive catalyst characterization are combined to address these two questions. Guided by DFT calculations, a series of amorphous ternary Co-iron(Fe)-Cr (oxy)hydroxides with systematically tuned elemental compositions are synthesized. Performance atlases of these catalysts are established based on different experimental descriptors, which show that the optimal Co5Fe3Cr2 (oxy)hydroxide reaches a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 232 mV. It delivers a Co-based mass activity of 1486 A g(-1) and a high turnover frequency of 0.23 s(-1), over two orders higher than monometallic Co (oxy)hydroxide. X-ray absorption and photoelectron spectroscopies reveal that Cr promotes Co atoms to occupy octahedral sites and modifies the Co electronic structure. Quasi-operando electron energy loss spectroscopy further experimentally confirm that Cr accelerates the pre-oxidation of Co2+ to higher valence species, resulting in significantly higher catalytic activity. The findings here pave the way to use Co-Fe-Cr (oxy)hydroxides as an efficient OER catalyst.									32	2	0	0	2	0	33			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000613314500001

However, the preparation of such materials usually requires high energy consumption and toxic precursors which are considered to be drawbacks for real applications. In this study, we report ambient temperature synthesis of transition-metal phosphates for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and supercapacitors. The prepared iron-doped porous nickel pyrophosphate (NFPy) nanoparticle is synthesized via simple stirring in ambient temperature using only the precursor for Ni, Fe, and pyrophosphate without any heat treatment. The usage of pyrophosphate promotes facile Ni oxidation and high chemical stability, which overall is beneficial for electrochemical applications and the environment. The OER performance of NFPy shows promising results which required an overpotential of 0.210 V to reach 10 mA.cm(-2). Also, with the help of carbon nanotubes, the supercapacitor using NFPy exhibits a good electrochemical performance with a capacity of 517 C.g(-1) at 1 A.g(-1). The prepared NFPy possesses excellent long-term chemical stability that maintained its chemical valence state and electrochemical performance for over 8 months despite the exposure of air.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			2168-0485			WOS:000516665500028

Herein, mesoporous CoMn and CoMnSe nanobundles are successfully constructed via a facile one-pot hydrothermal approach. It is discovered that the Mn introduction in Co oxides can simultaneously tune their electronic structure and modulate the nanobundle morphology. As a result, benefitting from the 3D open nanobundle structure, the self-supported Co1Mn1 oxide exhibits unprecedented oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an ultralow overpotential of 221 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, such a nanobundle-like structure also enables the Co1Mn1Se catalyst to exhibit outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with a relatively low overpotential of 87.3 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), surpassing those of previously reported non-precious metal catalysts. More importantly, taking advantage of their excellent OER and HER activity, an advanced water electrolyzer through exploiting Co1Mn1 oxide and Co1Mn1Se nanobundles as the anode and cathode is fabricated, which gives an impressive water-splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution at 1.60 V with remarkable stability over 36 h, holding great potential for efficient overall water splitting electrocatalysis.									29	2	0	0	1	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451738200033

Herein we designed a novel OER electrocatalyst by incorporating transition metal oxide (TMO) and sulfide (TMS) into a hierarchical nanoporous structure. Hierarchical porous Co3O4 nanosheet-assembled microspheres (HPMS Co3O4) were fabricated by a facile solvothermal method followed by an annealing process, and the Co3O4/CoS2 composite was easily obtained by a simple subsequent sulfurization process, which maintained the HPMS structure. Due to rapid surface diffusion and mass transfer, increased active sites, improved conductivity and strong synergetic coupling effects, the prepared HPMS Co3O4/CoS2 composite showed significantly enhanced electrocatalytic OER activities with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 280 mV, a small Tafel slope of about 63 mV dec(-1) and satisfactory stability at 20 mA cm(-2). Notablely, it was non-durable at high current density. We expect that more active TMS functionalized hierarchical porous TMO will open a new avenue to innovate non-precious OER electrocatalysts.

However, an understanding of the critical role of temperature during pyrolysis remains lacking, which makes the design of catalysts by thermal activation rely on empirical engineering. In this work, we use ZIF-67 as a model material to study the impact of temperature on microstructural evolution by in situ transmission electron microscopy. Microstructural features of cobalt precipitation, nitrogen loss, and porous carbon support formation were investigated and semi-quantified. A tradeoff between the microstructural features is revealed and confirmed by the ORR performance. By understanding the temperature-microstructure-ORR performance relationship, we further design a simple low-temperature pyrolysis strategy and achieve outstanding ORR activity. Although demonstrated on ZIF-67, the critical role of temperature as disclosed by this work is beneficial for all ZIF-related materials to further boost ORR performance. Meanwhile, our one-step strategy is easy to implement and allows for scaling up for industrial application.									19	0	0	0	3	0	19			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000686545000001

Conventional synthesis of nanomaterials is strongly constrained by room-temperature equilibria and Ostwald ripening. Ultra-fast temperature cycling enables the synthesis of metastable metallic phases of high entropy alloy nanoparticles, which later transform to oxide/hydroxide nanoparticles upon use in aqueous electrolytes. Herein, an in situ synthesis of non-noble metal high entropy oxide (HEO) catalysts on carbon fibers by rapid Joule heating and quenching is reported. Different compositions of ternary to senary (FeNiCoCrMnV) HEO nanoparticles show higher activity towards catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared to a noble metal IrO2 catalyst. The synthesized HEO also show two orders of magnitude higher stability than IrO2, due to stronger carbide-mediated intimacy with the substrate, activated through the OER process. Alloying elements Cr, Mn and V affect OER activity by promoting different oxidation states of the catalytically active TM (Fe, Ni and Co). Dissolution of less stable elements (Mn, V and Cr) leads to enhancements of OER activity. Dynamic structural and chemical perturbations of HEO oxide nanoparticles activate under OER conditions, leading to enlargement in ECSA by forming mixed single atom catalysts and ultra-fine oxyhydroxide nanoparticles HEOs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000831062900001

Nevertheless, the limited edge active sites and intrinsic low conductivity seriously hinder its catalytic activity. Herein, we fabricated a highly active catalyst by entrapping NiFe-LDH nanoparticles in ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) for OER. The mesopores of OMC as nanoreactors can spatially restrict the growth of NiFe-LDH, enabling the formation of ultra-small (similar to 5 nm) nanoparticles. Compared with two-dimensional nanosheets, the NiFe-LDH nanoparticles with less shape anisotropy expose more edge atoms as catalytic active sites. In addition, the NiFe-LDH particles in-situ grown in the pores form intimate contact with the carbon, which triggers the transfer of electrons from NiFe-LDH to OMC and promotes the adsorption of OH, further accelerating OER kinetics. The catalyst exhibited outstanding catalytic performance towards the OER, delivering 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) current density at 223 and 296 mV overpotential, respectively, as well as low Tafel slope 56.6 mV dec(-1). Moreover, its mass activity is more than eight times higher that of NiFe-LDH nanosheets (at 300 mV overpotential).									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000681173500003

However, the construction of efficient trifunctional electrocatalysts for ORR/OER/HER are highly desirable yet challenging. Herein, hollow carbon nanotubes integrated single cobalt atoms with Co9S8 nanoparticles (CoSA + Co9S8/HCNT) are fabricated by a straightforward in situ self-sacrificing strategy. The structure of the CoSA + Co9S8/HCNT are verified by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. Theoretical calculations and experimental results embrace the synergistic effects between Co9S8 nanoparticles and single cobalt atoms through optimizing the electronic configuration of the CoN4 active sites to lower the reaction barrier and facilitating the ORR, OER, and HER simultaneously. Consequently, rechargeable liquid and all-solid-state flexible Zn-air batteries based on CoSA + Co9S8/HCNT exhibit remarkable stability and excellent power density of 177.33 and 51.85 mW cm(-2), respectively, better than Pt/C + RuO2 counterparts. Moreover, the as-fabricated Zn-air batteries can drive an overall water splitting device assembled with CoSA + Co9S8/HCNT and achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low voltage of 1.59 V, also superior to Pt/C + RuO2. Therefore, this work presents a promising approach to an efficient trifunctional electrocatalyst toward practical applications.									73	10	0	0	2	0	75			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000509350700001	31984632

Combining experimental observations with resistance-based model analysis, we establish a quantitative relationship between current density and key voltage losses, including losses due to thermodynamics, kinetics, ohmic, and mass transport. These results demonstrate that the oxygen evolution reaction and bubble effects play crucial roles in determining electrolyzer performance. By varying the distance between electrodes, 2 effective OH- conductivities in 0.4M KOH are found to be 0.1333 and 0.9650second cm(-1), depending on bubble formation and release rate at the electrode interface. Moreover, bubble coverage on electrode surface achieves a steady state of 96% when current density is above 0.1 A cm(-2). In the study of various electrolyte concentrations, all the model predictions show good agreement with experimental results, confirming its ability to capture actual cell performance. This newly presented empirical resistance-based model provides a practical framework to simulate complicated electrolysis reactions, serving as a comprehensive guide for continuous improvement of water electrolysis.									29	1	0	0	0	0	30			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000413319600033

Herein, we propose a new strategy for STH energy conversion based on photothermal-promoted electrocatalysis (PTPE). First, carbon hemispheres were developed with strong capability of collecting and concentrating heat by absorbing photons (>630nm). Second, we incorporated two representative materials, Co(OH)(2) and MoS2, with the heat collectors (carbon hemispheres) as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. The two hybrids showed enhanced electrocatalytic activity of water splitting under light irradiation, owing to the elevated local temperature of carbon that had been heated by the light. PTPE might be widely applied in electrocatalytic systems for solar energy utilization via a simple STH and subsequent heat-promoted electrosynthesis route.									9	1	0	0	1	0	10			2196-0216			WOS:000476572700021

However, to make water-splitting more sustainable and practical, earth-abundant catalysts need to be developed, which can both be synthesized using the principles of green chemistry and have high performance specifically at high hydrogen production rates. In this work, we report four main findings to help contribute toward this goal. First, we report a "green" synthesis method for producing a mixed-metal oxide catalyst that uses only water as the solvent and no harsh oxidizing or reducing agents. Second, we show that this synthesis method can enable an amorphous nickel-iron oxide/(oxy)hydroxide catalyst with a 1:1 Fe/Ni ratio. This increased iron content further improves the performance over the conventional 1:4 Fe/Ni ratio. Third, we show that these catalysts can be easily deposited on a 3D porous Ni-foam electrode and achieve current densities up to 1 A cm(-2) and an overpotential of 245 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and an overpotential of 422 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Finally, we show that combining both HER and OER catalysts, synthesized with our method, in a flow-through water electrolyzer achieves an overpotential of 140 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) at 80 degrees C. In addition, this electrolyzer can achieve 76% efficiency at 1 A cm(-2) and 70% efficiency at 2 A cm(-2).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2168-0485			WOS:000753961000015

Herein, we report a conductive two-dimensional pi-d conjugated Ni and Co bimetal organic framework (MOF)-NiCo-(2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene) (NiCo-HITP) nanorods decorated with highly dispersed Co3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) as a promising bi-functional electrocatalyst towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through an effective and facile strategy by modifying the rod-shaped -Ni3HITP2 crystals using cobalt ions. The triggered electrocatalytic activity of the resulting MOF-based materials was achieved by increasing the electrical conductivity (7.23 S cm(-1)) originated from Ni(3)HITP(2 )substrate and also by creating the cooperative catalysis sites of Co-N (x) and Co3O4 NPs. Optimized syntheses show a promising ORR activity with a high half-wave potential (0.77 V) and also a significantly improved OER activity compared with pure Ni3HITP2 in alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, a rechargeable Zn-air battery using the as-prepared material as air-cathode also shows a high power density (143.1 mW cm(-2))-even comparable to a commercial Pt/C-RuO2-based battery. This methodology offers a new prospect in the design and synthesis of non-carbonized MOF bi-functional electrocatalysts for efficient catalysis towards ORR and OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000741702400001	34823231

Hybrid structures that contain both metal and semiconductor building blocks facilitate the extraction of reactive charge carriers and their utilization for photoelectrocatalysis. Additional functionality arises from hybrid structures that combine noble metal nanostructures with semiconductor components, such as chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) nanocrystals (NCs), which by themselves support quasistatic resonances. In this work, we use a hybrid membrane to integrate Au nanorods (NRs) with a longitudinal LSPR at 745 nm and CuFeS2 NCs with a resonance peak at 490 nm into water-stable nanocomposites for robust and bifunctional photocatalysis of oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions in a wavelength-dependent manner. Excitation of NRs or NCs in the nanocomposite correlates with increased hydrogen or oxygen evolution, respectively, consistent with a light-driven electron transfer between the metal and semiconductor building blocks, the direction of which depends on the wavelength. The bifunctional photoreactivity of the nanocomposite is enhanced by Cu(I)/Cu(II)-assisted catalysis on the surface of the NCs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000813195100001	35349253

Heteroatom doping and oxygen vacancy (Ov) engineering are effective strategies to regulate the physical and chemical properties of the catalysts and thus facilitating the intermediates absorption/desorption. Herein, the rational design of Cu doping CoOOH porous nanoplates with rich Ov grown on carbon fiber paper (Cu-CoOOH/CFP) is performed to enhance the OER performance. Experiment results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations uncovered that the synergistic effect of Cu doping with Ov exceptionally modulated the electronic structure of Cu-CoOOH/CFP so that enormously facilitates the (O-H)* bond cleavage and optimize the Gibbs free energies of OER intermediates, thus contributing to fast kinetics and outstanding OER activity. As expected, the optimized three-dimensional (3D) self-supported Cu-CoOOH/CFP with unique porous structure shows unprecedented OER activity with a low overpotential of 234 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), as well as superior stability in 1.0 M KOH. This work provides an effective electronic engineering approach for the rational design of nonprecious-metal and efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation and beyond.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000623314500007

The PTL was fabricated by coating Ti felt with 0.43 mg(TaOx) cm(-2) and 1 mg(Ir + Ru) cm(-2) IrO2-RuO2-TaOx using a thermal decomposition method. The coated Ti felts exhibited high conductivity, mass transport performance, stability and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activities. The stability of IrO2-RuO2-TaOx coating obviously improved than traditional electroplated Pt coating. Using the PTL, a single cell performance of 1.836 V @ 2000 mA cm(-2) was achieved at 80 degrees C under ambient pressure with 1 mg cm(-2) of precious metal in anode CL. However, the precious metal loading is about 2 mg cm(-2) in common PEM electrolyzer anode catalyst layer (CL). The IrO2-RuO2-TaOx-coated Ti felt proved to be a promising low-cost PTL for PEM water electrolysis with high performance. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The CoNi telluride heterostructure (CoNi LDH@Te) not only provides a high specific surface area with abundant active sites from CoNi LDH, but also shows a high conductivity of nickel telluride. The optimized 0.4CoNi LDH@Te-180C electrode exhibits an impressive oxygen evolution reaction activity, which needs an overpotential of 360 mV to attain an anodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2), with a Tafel slope of 56.6 mV dec(-1), much smaller than those of Ni-Te-180C (eta(10) = 423 mV; a Tafel slope of 65.1 mV dec(-1)) and those of bare NF (eta(10) = 445 mV; a Tafel slope of 97.6 mV dec(-1)). Moreover, 0.4CoNi LDH@Te-180C also shows excellent long-term stability, which can maintain continuous electrolysis for 18 hours with only a little degradation of 23 mV. The excellent oxygen evolution reaction performance of CoNi telluride can be attributed to the inherent layered structure, interconnected nanoarray structures and the synergistic effect of Co and Ni species.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000848137900001

The anodic behaviour of the BDD was investigated by the rotating ring-disc electrode (RRDE) method in 1 M NaOH electrolyte to determine its corrosion current and compare the latter with that of the commercial Vulcan XC-72 carbon from Cabot and Sibunit pyrolytic carbon, the latter known for its high stability against electrochemical corrosion. The BDD has proven to be significantly more stable than either the Sibunit or the Vulcan carbon. The Co3O4-BDD and Co3O4-Sibunit composites prepared by the ISAC method were then tested as catalysts of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Co3O4-BDD composites appear to be competitive electrocatalysts for the OER in alkaline medium, showing activity comparable to the literature and much higher support stability towards oxidation. Further research is required to decrease the size of Co3O4 spinel nanoparticles and improve their distribution over the BDD support and hence increase the mass-specific OER activity of the BDD-based ISAC composites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000804546600006

First, we investigated the heterogeneous CO2 evolution induced as a secondary reaction caused by the CO readsorption on an oxidized surface, which produces a carbonatelike surface complex. This functional group was found to decompose as CO2 with an activation energy of 60 kcal/mol. Another possibility for heterogeneous CO2 formation during char combustion or gasification is through the molecular O-2 chemisorption on a carbon active site of an oxidized graphene layer. The peroxy complex thus formed undergoes rearrangement into a dioxiranyl complex, C(20). This complex can evolve as CO2 with an activation energy of 48 kcal/mol. The CO2 desorption is facilitated by the presence of an epoxy complex near the edge of the graphene layer. The epoxy complex undergoes transformation into a cyclic ether complex during the dioxiranyl decomposition. Transition states and energetic profiles of these decomposition reactions were determined. Variations of selected C-C, O-O, and C-O bonds were analyzed through the change in the bond orders calculated by natural bond orbital analysis. Overall, carbon oxidation reactions in the presence of epoxy functionalities are very important in the formation of heterogeneous CO2 and of cyclic ether complexes.									36	0	0	0	2	1	37			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000245005300019

However, to overcome the remaining limitations of their catalytic performance, it is imperative to develop catalysts with more efficient structure and sufficient intrinsic activity. Herein, we report a creative strategy for preparing efficient OER catalysts based on the Co/Mo MOFs with a two-dimensional (2D) hydrangea-type structure by employing molecular binders. In addition, these MOFs were successfully converted into hydrangea-type 2D Co/Mo2C heterostructure nanoparticles embedded in a N-doped carbon composite (H-2D Co/Mo2C@NC). Remarkably, H-2D Co/Mo2C@NC exhibited excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 256 mV@eta(10) and a low Tafel slope of 48 mVdec(-1). This can be attributed to the large accessible surface area of the nanoparticles owing to their hydrangea-type structure with open active sites and the modulation of the electronic structure of Co by Mo2C. This strategy will provide useful insights into the design of MOF-derived bimetal catalyst and heterojunction catalysts.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000799942500003

In this work, first-principles calculations were carried out to prove that oxygen-terminated Nb2CO2 MXene played an active role in enhancing the sluggish reaction of oxygen intermediates. Nb2CO2 MXene could also stimulate the spatial accumulation of discharge products, which was beneficial to improve the stability of secondary ZABs. Molecular dynamics simulation was used to show that the confinement effect of COF could effectively regulate the concentration of O-2 on the surface of Nb2CO2@COF, which was conducive to an efficient and durable reaction. COF-LZU1 was self-assembled on the interface of Nb2CO2 MXene (Nb2CO2@COF) for the first time. The Nb2CO2@COF electrode had excellent OER/ORR overpotentials with the potential difference (AE) of 0.79 V. When applied to the configuration of ZABs, Nb2CO2@COF showed a power density of 75 mW cm(-2) and favorable long-term charge/discharge stability, so it could be used as a potential candidate cathode for noble-metal-based catalysts. This idea of combining MXenes and COFs sheds some light on the design of ZABs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000758056700001	35170933

The developed coated anodes were examined in terms of their electrochemical and physical stability over several days of polarisation for the evolution of oxygen under typical copper electrowinning conditions. Results from scanning electron microscopy have shown that fresh Pb-Co and Pb-Co3O4 composite coated anodes have rougher surface than conventional (uncoated) PbCaSn anodes but the apparent differences in surface area become insignificant after several days of polarisation under typical copper electrowinning conditions. The Tafel slope on the Pb-Co anode was 92 mV dec(-1) and on the Pb-Co3O4 it was 90 mV dec(-1), which is significantly less than the 122 mV dec(-1) measured on the conventional PbCaSn anodes. The composite anodes exhibited consistently lower oxygen evolution potentials than the conventional type and the potential remained relatively stable throughout the polarisation period. The reduction in the operating anode potential can be attributed to the presence of cobalt in the surface layer while the decrease in the Tafel slope shows that this reduction can be related to a change in the mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction. Corrosion rates estimated from 16 h tests showed that the composite coated anodes are more stable than the conventional type during short periods of operation. It was also observed that for the Pb-Co coated anode, both the rate of corrosion and the overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction can be further reduced by the addition of organic additives such as thiourea.

Since transition metal doping usually introduces of oxygen vacancy defect in oxide compounds, the first-principles calculations were performed to investigate the HER activity of transition metal-doped lepidocrocite-type TiO2 nanosheets with oxygen vacancies. Different hydrogen adsorption sites are taken into account here. When adsorbed hydrogen occupies the oxygen vacancy, an optimal HER activity, similar to ideal Pt metal, was obtained in Fe-doped nanosheets. The tunable HER performance was correlated with the d-band center level of dopants. On the other hand, O-p(z) band center level is responsible for the hydrogen adsorption free energy in the case of hydrogen adsorbed with the surface oxygen atom. Unexpectedly, for Mn doping cases, the pre-adsorbed hydrogen could activate surface O atom with additional hydrogen adsorption free energy being close to zero. In addition, the strain engineering also could effectively adjust HER activity in defected nanosheets. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The series of bimetallic CoxM3-x(HITP)(2) MOFs exhibit ultrathin graphene-like nanostructure, highly d-pi conjugated network, large specific surface areas, and diverse metal coordination modes. Density functional theory calculations reveal the unique synergism between M (M = Mn, Ni, and Zn) and Co nodes, in which adjacent layers of M atoms can efficiently modulate the electron densities of Co atoms in Co-3(HITP)(2).

Developing efficient, durable, and low-cost OER electrocatalysts comprising Earth-abundant elements has been in the focus of electrocatalysis research. Herein, we report a cost-effective, scalable, and template-free approach to the fabrication of hollow iron phosphide phosphate (FeP-FePxOy) composite nanotubes (NTs), which is realized by hydrothermal growth of iron oxy-hydroxide nanorods (NRs) and a subsequent postphosphorization treatment. The hollow interior of NTs results from the Kirkendall effect occurring upon phosphorization. When used to catalyze the OER in basic medium, the as-synthesized FeP-FePxOy composite NTs exhibit excellent catalytic activity, delivering the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 280 mV and showing a small Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1) and a high turnover frequency of 0.10 s(-1) at the overpotential of 350 mV. Moreover, the composite NTs demonstrate outstanding long-term stability, capable of catalyzing the OER at 10 mA cm(-2) for 42 h without increasing the overpotential, holding substantial potential for use as active and inexpensive anode catalysts in water electrolyzers.									53	2	0	0	3	0	53			2574-0970			WOS:000461400300017

The relation between the preparation method and behaviour of mixed oxides of these elements is of interest in order to obtain active and stable catalysts. An interaction between the elements has been demonstrated to vary with preparation method. In this work Ir1-xRuxO2 was prepared by Pechini method and characterised by cyclic voltammetry, steady state measurement and X-ray diffraction. Metallic iridium was observed in compositions with high content of iridium. However, by potential cycling these catalysts demonstrated growing oxides peaks and the surface is believed to consist of oxide after cycling. The activity of the mixed oxides was very close to the activity calculated from a linear combination of the activities of the pure oxides for any given ruthenium fraction. This indicates that the degree of interaction between Ir and Ru is very small or absent in these oxides.

Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of bimetallic nickel manganese phosphide porous nanosheet arrays (PNAs) grown on 3D Ni foam (Ni-Mn-P PNAs). Benefiting from the typical 3D PNAs structure and electronic interaction between Ni and Mn, the optimal Ni2Mn1P PNAs shows small overpotentials of 80 and 120 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. The Ni-Mn-P PNAs also shows a high activity toward oxygen evolution reaction in the alkaline media with a low overpotential of 250 mV to drive 20 mA cm(-2). The Ni-Mn-P PNAs-based overall water splitting can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.6 V and excellent durability in alkaline solution, outperforming the benchmark Ir/C||Pt/C electrolyzer.

On the basis of the recent experimental progresses, we proposed from first-principles a family of two-dimensional (2D) MOFs, consisting of transition metal (TM) atoms (TM = Fe-Zn) and 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene (C18H12N6) functional group (HITP), namely TM3(HITP)(2), with versatile multifunctional catalytic activity, which can be ascribed to synergistic effects of TM and organic ligands. Cu-3(HITP)(2) can serve as a bifunctional catalyst for HER and OER, while Fe-3(HITP)(2), Co-3(HITP)(2), and Zn-3(HITP)(2) are promising for both OER and ORR. The overpotentials of these TM3(HITP)(2) monolayers are comparable or even superior to those of the well-developed noble catalysts.

Recently, significant progress has been made in the preparation of effective carbon-based OER catalysts. The active sites increase after the defects are introduced, but the structure of the carbon nanotubes would be destroyed and its electrical conductivity become worse. Double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs) have a coaxial structure that the inner tube can provide a continuous conductive path and the functionalized outer wall can interact with the external environment, which has potential catalytic capacity. However, there is little research focus on DWNTs for OER catalysis. Herein, we develop the plasma etching strategy as an effective method for obtaining carboxyl functionalized DWNTs (denoted as P-DWNTs-x). PDWNTs-3 exhibits a small overpotential of 279 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, superior enough to be compared with RuO2. Moreover, the catalytic mechanism of OER procedure is elucidated by involving carboxyl groups in this process as the active site. This work highlights the coaxial structure of DWNTs, and the mechanism of organic functional groups participating in the OER process, which is expected to open a new possibility for the development of carbon-based for electrocatalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000806498000001

In this communication, we report the development of a Zn-doped Ni3S2 nanosheet array on Ni foam (Zn-Ni3S2/NF) as a high-performance and durable electrocatalyst for the OER. Such Zn-Ni3S2/NF drives a catalytic current density of 100mA cm(-2) with the requirement of an OER overpotential of 330mV, 90 mV less than that for Ni3S2/NF. Furthermore, Zn-Ni3S2/NF demonstrates excellent long-term electrochemical durability maintaining its activity at an overpotential of 300 mV for 20 h.									272	8	0	0	5	0	272			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000415661300015	29099530

The present study focuses on the synthesis of mesoporous molybdenum disulfide nanosheets using a facile and cost-effective hydrothermal technique. The influence of acidic, alkaline, and neutral pH conditions on structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties of MoS2 has been studied in detail. The intense (0 0 2) diffraction peak evidence the growth of MoS2 along the c axis of hexagonal crystal structure. The MoS2 prepared in acidic pH condition exhibit less stacking of MoS2 layers. The pH 3 MoS2 sample possesses high specific surface area and hence affords abundant electroactive sites. The electrochemical measurements were carried out using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, linear sweep voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the high specific capacitance of 857 F/g at 5 mV/s scan rate was achieved for the MoS2 prepared under acidic pH conditions. Further, the electrode exhibits cyclic stability of 78% even after 1000 cycles. Also, in oxygen evolution reaction, MoS2 electrocatalyst requires an overpotential of 299 mV to deliver a current of 25 mA/cm(2). These results suggest that MoS2 nanosheets can serve as a potential candidate as an electrode for OER and supercapacitors.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000834855800001

Herein, CoFe@CoNi hydroxides composite supported on nickel foam (NF) as electrocatalyst for OER was prepared via a two-step electrodeposition method. The CoFe@CoNi hydroxides composite has an amorphous structure with a hierarchical nanostructure where small nanosheets of CoNi hydroxide were decorated on the large nanosheet of CoFe hydroxide. The architecture provides abundant electrochemically active surface area with more exposed active sites as well as the small electron-transfer resistance at the interface to promote the catalytic activity for OER. In addition, the core-shell hierarchical nanostructure may further improve the catalytic activity by regulating the electronic structure due to the synergetic interaction of CoFe and CoNi hydroxides. It is noted that the deposition sequence is important to form hierarchical heterostructure, and no hierarchical structure can be obtained by depositing CoFe hydroxide on CoNi hydroxide due to the reconfiguration of the metal ions during the synthesis. CoFe@CoNi hydroxides composite shows efficient electrocatalytic activity toward OER with an overpotential of 0.227 V at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and a long-term durability in 1.0 M KOH.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000801227000001

The structural, thermal, morphological, and surface features of samples prepared by the ball-milling method were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and surface measurements. The electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances of the samples were tested and compared with the bare cryptomelane to reveal the effect of boron doping into manganese oxide. It was found that boron particles transformed to trigonal BO3 units in the cryptomelane structure via mechanical activation, and accordingly, the oxidation state of manganese in this structure relatively changed. The 0.25% B-doped cryptomelane sample prepared at 12 h grinding time exhibited the overpotential of 425 mV at a current density of 1 mAcm(-2) with a Tafel slope of similar to 95 mV dec(-1). It showed a remarkable catalytic performance among the other electrocatalysts under neutral pH compared to bare cryptomelane. When the elemental boron doping exceeded 1%, the electrochemical performance dramatically decreased depending on the blocking of the Mn3+ active sites. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Thus, recent studies have mainly focused on designing highly active electrocatalysts to enhance OER. Here, a porous microsphere-like copper molybdate (CuMoO4) is synthesized via a simple hydrothermal route. Further, the crystalline nature of CuMoO4 is confirmed via X-ray diffraction (XRD). The chemical states of the designed sample are determined via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The morphology and elemental composition of CuMoO4 are determined via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques, as well as energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses. The CuMoO4 microspheres exhibit interconnected nanoflake-like structures, which can improve the active surface area and efficiency of CuMoO4. Furthermore, the active surface area of the CuMoO4 microspheres is calculated via the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The obtained catalytic performance of CuMoO4 is compared with those of its basic metal oxides, such as MoO3 and CuO. The obtained overpotentials (eta) for CuO, MoO3 , IrO2, and CuMoO4 were 286, 294, 267, and 247 mV with Tafel slope values of 65, 84, 58, and 53 mV/dec, respectively. The study for long-term stability of the CuMoO4 electrode reveals that it can sustain the electrochemical activity for 12h.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2468-0230			WOS:000702507000001

Herein, this work applies a novel and simple spontaneous redox reaction to fabricate a heterogeneous structure by depositing silver nanoparticles on MoO42- intercalating alpha-Co(OH)(2) support in a quite quick manner (5 min). The as-constructed heterostructural interface endows the hybrid alpha-Co(OH)(2)/Ag with electronic interaction between Ag and alpha-Co(OH)(2), modulated electronic structure, and synergistic effect. Furthermore, the spontaneously engineering interface also promotes the water adsorption and the valence state regulation and enhances the intrinsic activity of the catalytically active site. Benefitting from the above collective merits, the optimal heterostructural electrocatalyst (alpha-Co(OH)(2)/Ag-0.01) can drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of only 270 mV, outperforming the bare alpha-Co(OH)(2) and even commercial benchmark RuO2. This work opens up a new avenue towards advanced OER electrocatalysts by cheap metal nanoparticles engaged interface engineering, also showing significant potential for other energy-related electrocatalysis.

In this study, we have developed an electrospinning, in situ polymerization and carbonization process to fabricate Fe doped CoO/C (Fe-CoO/C) nanofibers as efficient OER electrocatalysts. In the synthesized Fe-CoO/C nanofibers, ultrathin carbon layer can be used as conducive network to promote electron transfer and thus improve the electrocatalytic activity. At the same time, additional active sites, like bridged site, formed by Fe doping, also provides the catalyst excellent electrochemical activity in OER. The as-prepared Fe-CoO/C nanofibers exhibit an excellent OER activity with an overpotential of 362 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline medium, which is comparable with the commercial RuO2 catalyst. After 2500 cyclic voltammograms (CVs) cycles test, the catalyst still maintains the initial electrocatalytic activity, demonstrating a great durability. This strategy introduces both carbon layer and Fe doping to increase the conductivity and the density of active sites of CoO nanofibers, thus enhancing the electrocatalytic activity and stability. This work offers an efficient route to develop low-cost and highly active transitional metal oxide-based OER electrocatalyst for potential renewable electrochemical energy conversion and storage.									31	4	0	0	3	0	33			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000512983600109

Herein, we report the preparation of a freestanding cactuslike structural (Ni,Co)Se-2 support shelled with NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs), as a highly active and durable OER catalyst with low cost. This cactuslike selenide support provides an interconnected conductive and robust framework, which can ensure efficient electron transfer and prevent the aggregation of LDHs. The synergistic combination and coupling effects of active NiFe-LDH and conductive (Ni,Co)Se, raise the intrinsic catalytic activity. As expected, when serving as an OER catalyst in 1 M KOH aqueous solution, the (Ni,Co)Se-2/NiFe-LDH presents a high activity with overpotential of approximate to 205 mV at a current density of 10 mV cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of approximate to 61 mV dec(-1), as well as a high durability observed at 30 h of a chronoamperometric test. The present study shows the promise of the cactuslike structural (Ni,Co)Se-2/NiFe-LDH as an effective OER catalyst, which provides a new thought for the fabrication of non-noble-metal catalysts and desired nanostructures.									8	2	0	0	0	0	8			2574-0970			WOS:000464491500035

There is a strong demand for highly efficient and inexpensive catalysts for overall water splitting. Herein, the bimetallic CoxFey alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in a N-doped graphene shell containing molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) nanoparticles are synthesized by the pyrolysis of cobalt ferrite (CoxFe3-xO4) nanoparticles coated by melamine-formaldehyde resin cross-linked with molybdic acid. Molybdic acid not only serves as precursor for the formation of highly dispersed Mo2C nanoparticles in the N-doped graphene shell but also enhances the thermal stability of the organic shell, resulting in the formation of smaller CoxFey cores. The formation of Mo2C nanoparticles in the graphene shell is promoted by the CoxFe3-xO4 core. Interestingly, the synergistic presence of Mo2C nanoparticles not only enhances the HER activity of the material but also renders a partial breakage of the graphene shell, which increases the surface concentration of OER-active Co and therefore enhances the OER activity. The as-prepared TM-based materials serve as bifunctional catalysts for the overall water splitting and exhibit improved electrocatalytic performances compared to standard cells based on precious metals, with the potentials of 1.53 and 1.60 V at 10 and 20 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media, respectively.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000474269800028

Physicochemical and electrochemical techniques used to characterize the materials are X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), infrared (IR), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and anodic polarization (Tafel plot). Results of IR and XRD studies show the formation of spinel phase of the material along with some small impurity. All the electrochemical studies are carried out in a three electrode single compartment glass cell. For the purpose, materials have been transformed in the oxide film electrode by oxide slurry painting technique. The cyclic voltammetric curve of each oxide electrode exhibit redox peaks (anodic: 519 +/- 33mV and cathodic: 362 +/- 2 mV) prior to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrocatalytic activity of the material has been determined by recording the anodic polarization curve in 1 M KOH at 25 degrees C. Data show that the Ni-substitution in the base oxide enhance the electrocatalytic activity of the material and value is found to be greatest with 0.5 mol Ni.

In this study, we report a highly active nanostructured electrode, NanoCOT, which contains carbon, oxygen, and titanium, for efficient OER in alkaline solution. The NanoCOT electrode is synthesized from carbon transformation of TiO2 in an atmosphere of methane, hydrogen, and nitrogen at a high temperature. The NanoCOT exhibits enhanced OER catalytic activity in alkaline solution, providing a current density of 1.33 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 0.42 V. This OER current density of a NanoCOT electrode is about 4 times higher than an oxidized Jr electrode and 15 times higher than a Pt electrode because of its nanostructured high surface area and favorable OER kinetics. The enhanced catalytic activity of NanoCOT is attributed to the presence of a continuous energy band of the titanium oxide electrode with predominantly reduced defect states of Ti (e.g., Ti1+, Ti2+, and Ti3+) formed by chemical reduction with hydrogen and carbon.

Li-O-2 cells using Fe/N/C as the cathode catalyst showed lower overpotentials than alpha-MnO2/carbon catalyst and carbon-only material. Gases evolved during the charge step contained only oxygen for Fe/N/C cathode catalyst, whereas CO2 was also detected in the case of alpha-MnO2/C or carbon-only material; this CO2 was presumably generated from electrolyte decomposition. Our results reiterate the catalytic effect in reducing overpotentials, which not only enhances battery efficiency but also improves its lifespan by reducing or eliminating electrolyte decomposition. The structure of the Fe/N/C catalyst was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Iron was found to be uniformly distributed within the carbon matrix, and on average, Fe was coordinated by 3.3 +/- 0.6 and 2.2 +/- 0.3 low Z elements (C/N/O) at bond distances of similar to 1.92 and similar to 2.09 angstrom, respectively.									235	18	0	0	15	0	242			0002-7863			WOS:000309566400040	22998563

The formation of such a unique 2D core@shell structure together with unusual sulfur doping effect increased the electrochemically active surface area and provided excellent electric conductivity, thereby boosting the activities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a result, only low overpotentials of 73 and 274 mV were required to achieve a current response of 10 mA cm(-2) toward HER and OER, respectively. Using the 2D Co@S-VMoOx NSs on nickel foam as both cathode and anode electrode, the fabricated electrolyzer showed superior performance with a small cell voltage of 1.55 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability. These results suggested that the 2D Co@S-VMoOx NSs material might be a potential bifunctional catalyst for green hydrogen production via electrochemical water splitting.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000697282300058	34473465

In this work, Ca-doped La2NiO4+delta samples are prepared and their structure and defect evolution are investigated as Ca content. Electrical conductivity and electron conduction relaxation (ECR) investigations suggest that La1.9Ca0.1NiO4+delta has the great electronic conductivity and the highest oxygen surface exchange coefficient and oxygen bulk diffusion coefficient at intermediate temperatures. These results may imply that more gas oxygen has inserted into La1.9Ca0.1NiO4+delta sample, suggesting the native interstitial oxygen defects in it. X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) results confirm that La1.9Ca0.1NiO4+delta have more active oxygen species when compared with La2NiO4+delta and La1.8Ca0.2NiO4+delta. The great oxygen exchange and bulk diffusion properties along with its great stability in steam involved atmosphere enables it a promising for cathode for H-SOFCs. Compared with that using La2NiO4+delta cathode, peak powder density of H-SOFC using La1.9Ca0.1NiO4+delta single phase cathode improves about 30.5% at 700 degrees C, suggesting that accelerating oxygen reduction reaction can effectively improve cathode performance of H-SOFCs.

The proposed approach is promising for explorations of the selectivity of both the oxygen reduction (evolution) reaction (ORR/OER) and the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) via the low-index (100) and (110) facets on the CuAu grain boundary (GB) surface, leading to a high selectivity toward CH4 on CuAu (110) and indicating that the CuAu is a highly efficient catalyst that can improve the catalytic performance of CO2 reduction to generate hydrocarbon fuels. The CO2 reduction reaction refers to the transfer of a series of successive protons/electrons (H+/e- ) from the CuAu surface by different reaction mechanism pathways. We found that CuAu exhibits a promising catalytic activity for CO2 reduction that can be used for CH4 selective conversion energy storage. The results predicted that intermediate species form during the hydrogenation steps by spontaneous reactions. The atomic level can be used to gain insight into the high-performance catalysts and electrochemical mechanisms involved in the reduction of CO2 to different hydrocarbon fuels, which is an important method of revealing the reaction mechanism of the elementary steps for CO2RR and should be examined in future studies.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0927-0256	1879-0801		WOS:000634120300001

However, the synthesis of efficient and robust high entropy catalysts remains a challenge. Here a facile and scalable approach is reported to synthesize advanced HEA (CoNiCuMnAl)/ C nanoparticles from the polymetallic Metal-organic framework (MOF). The novel core-shell nanoarchitectures feature face-centered cubic HEA wrapped in ultra-thin carbon shell. The optimized catalyst (deposited upon Ni foam) boosted alkaline Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (in 1.0 M KOH) with an ultralow overpotential of 215 mV at 10 mA/cm2 (also by a low Tafel slope of 35.6 mV dec 1). The enhanced performance is closely tied to surface reconstruction (i.e., formation of oxyhydroxide catalytic active species) and the high entropy effect, revealed by Fourier-transformed alternating current voltammetry (FTACV) and in-situ Raman spectrum analysis, in conjunction with Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations. Furthermore, the new design showed excellent long-term OER stability with negligible decay through 30 h testing (under 200 mA cm-2). The present work demonstrates the feasibility and advantage of utilizing highly efficient and durable high entropy alloys for catalyzing electrochemical water splitting process.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000728516800004

A large number of studies have shown that the conversion properties of coal are closely related to its functional group structure. However, there are few studies on the relationship between the evolution of functional group and the characteristics of chemical looping reaction, especially the comparative studies on different types of oxygen carriers have not been reported so far. In order to explore the relationship between the functional group structure in coal and the characteristics of chemical looping combustion, the chemical looping combustion experiments of bituminous coal were carried out by means of the small fixed-bed reactor and Fourier infrared analyzer. The results showed that after adding iron-based oxygen carrier (Fe4Al6) or copper-based oxygen carrier (Cu4Al6), the CO_2 concentration of Juye (JY) coal increased by 52.25% and 59.16%, respectively. The maximum carbon conversion rate increased by 8.93% and 30.36%, respectively. The reaction effect of Cu4Al6 was better. When Cu4Al6 was used as bed material, the evolution of surface functional groups in JY coal was accelerated, the reaction rates of aliphatic hydrocarbon structure, aromatic carbon skeleton and aromatic CH were significantly improved. Aliphatic -CH_3 and -CH_2 in coal were active, and reaction rate was quite fast, which were the main sources of gas phase products in the initial stage of chemical looping combustion. Aromatic carbon skeleton and aromatic CH were stable and inactive, and reaction rate was relatively slow, which were the main sources of gas phase products in the middle and late stages of chemical looping combustion.			在固定床反应器中添加铁基载氧体Fe4Al6和铜基载氧体Cu4Al6,进行巨野(JY)烟煤化学链燃烧实验,通过气相色谱(GC)、红外光谱(FT-IR)等分析了JY煤化学链反应特性及表面官能团演变规律。结果表明,相对于Al_2O_3,Fe4Al6或Cu4Al6为床料时,JY煤中CO_2含量分别提高了52.25%和59.16%,最大碳转化速率分别提高了8.93%和30.36%,Cu4Al6反应效果更好。添加Cu4Al6后,JY煤表面官能团演变进程加快,Cu4Al6对脂肪烃结构、芳香碳骨架和芳香族CH的转化均有明显促进作用。煤中脂肪烃-CH_3和-CH_2稳定性低、反应速率快,是化学链燃烧初期气相产物主要来源;芳香碳骨架和芳香族-CH稳定性高、反应活性低,反应速率较缓慢,是化学链燃烧中后期气相产物主要来源。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1009-606X			CSCD:6627945

Although enormous efforts have been devoted to preparing noble metal MNNs with different compositions, the composition optimization and the formation mechanism of Ir-based MNNs have not been thoroughly investigated. This work presents a facile method for synthesizing robust Ir-based bimetallic MNNs by chemical reduction. As unveiled by our characterization, the network structure is constructed by ultrafine nanowires evolved from aggregated nanoparticles. The element analysis confirms the even distribution of Pb and Ir elements. The introduction of Pb is found to be beneficial to the stable formation of IrxPb MNNs in the sol-gel process. By tuning the precursor ratio of Ir and Pb, the optimized IrxPb catalyst delivers an enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in acid media (307 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), which is superior to that of the commercial IrO2 catalyst. Besides, due to the robust structure of the IrxPb MNNs, excellent OER durability is observed in the accelerated durability test (ADT) (2000 cycles).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000790429100001

Doping with either cations or non-metallic anions is a typical strategy used to improve the electrocatalytic activity for OER catalysts. In this study, an anion doped bimetallic selenide Co0.75Fe0.25(S0.2Se0.8)(2) solid solution is prepared via the simultaneous sulfuration and selenylation of a scalably produced CoFe-layered double hydroxide (CoFe-LDH) precursor, using commercially available sulfur and selenium powders as S and Se sources, respectively. Electrocatalytic test shows that the anion doped bimetallic selenide Co0.75Fe0.25(S0.2Se0.8)(2) electrode requires an overpotential of 293 mV and a low Tafel slope of 77 mV dec(-1) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline media, and it exhibits the significantly enhanced electrocatalytic performance for the OER compared with its counterparts of Co0.75Fe0.25S2 and Co0.75Fe0.25Se2. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance is supported experimentally by the results of charge-transfer resistance and electrochemically active surface area.

They are able to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction in acidic solutions but with only modest activity when prepared by constant anodic potential deposition. We now show that the performance of these catalysts is improved when they are "activated" by potential cycling protocols, as measured by Tafel analysis (where lower slope is better): upon activation the Tafel slope decreases from similar to 120 to similar to 70 mV/decade in neutral conditions and from similar to 650 to similar to 90 mV/decade in acidic solutions. Electrochemical, spectroscopic, and structural methods were employed to study the activation process and support a mechanism where the original bimessite-like MnOx (delta-MnO2) undergoes a phase change, induced by comproportionation with cathodically generated Mn(OH)2, to a hausmannite-like intermediate (alpha-Mn3O4). Subsequent anodic conditioning from voltage cycling or water oxidation produces a disordered birnessite-like phase, which is highly active for oxygen evolution. At pH 2.5, the current density of activated MnOx (at an overpotential of 600 mV) is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the original MnOx and begins to approach that of Ru and Ir oxides in acid.									296	4	0	0	29	0	297			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000365930600014	26574923

The phenomena involved in the corrosion mechanism of Al-alloys may be explained by formation of galvanic cells between the metal matrix and heterogeneities, such as precipitates, intermetallic phases leading to potential differences and electrochemical reactions. In the cathodic sites, the main reactions are oxygen reduction reaction, in aerated neutral environments, and hydrogen evolution in acid media. This last type of reaction might also occur in neutral solutions inside pits (anodic region). In this study, the mechanism of hydrogen evolution during corrosion of the 2198-T8 Al-Cu-Li alloy exposed in a chloride solution was investigated. The mechanism was related to the presence of T1 phase (Al2CuLi), which is the main strengthening phase in this material. This phase is highly active and, when exposed to corrosive media, leads to severe localized corrosion (SLC). One of the main characteristics related to SIC is hydrogen gas evolution which was confirmed by gel visualization. In this study. the hydrogen evolution mechanism inside the SLC sites was studied by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM).									4	0	0	0	0	3	4			0100-4042	1678-7064		WOS:000581672800007

A water electrolysis process can be used to produce hydrogen, in which hydrogen is produced at one electrode of the electrochemical cell, and oxygen is produced at the other electrode. On the other hand, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires multiple reaction steps and precious-metal-based catalysts (e.g., Ru/C, Ir/C, RuO2, and IrO2) as electrocatalysts to improve the reaction rate. Their high cost and limited supply, however, limit their applications to the mass production of hydrogen. In this study, boron, nitrogen-doped carbon incorporated with molybdenum carbide (MoC-BN/C) was synthesized to replace the precious-metal-based catalysts in the OER. B, N-doped carbon with nanosized molybdenum nanoparticles was fabricated by plasma engineering. The synthesized catalysts were heat-treated at 600, 700, and 800 degrees C in nitrogen for one hour to enhance the conductivity. The best MoC-BN/C electrocatalysts (heated at 800 degrees C) exhibited superior OER catalytic activity: 1.498 V (vs. RHE) and 1.550 V at a current density of 10 and 100 mA/cm(2), respectively. The hybrid electrocatalysts even outperformed the noble electrocatalyst (5 wt.% Ru/C) with higher stability. Therefore, the hybrid electrocatalyst can replace expensive precious-metal-based catalysts for the upcoming hydrogen economy.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2073-4344		WOS:000593504200001

Nickel-based materials are sought after in part for their lower cost relative to precious metal catalysts (e.g., Pt, Ru, Ir). To develop more durable materials and to better understand the mechanisms involved in electrochemical transformations on nickelbased materials, it is essential to understand how these materials evolve and age as a result of electrocatalytic processes. In this study, we preserve and analyze the hydrated form of nickel electrocatalysts prepared by electrochemical aging under alkaline conditions relevant to the OER. A series of electrocatalysts were prepared to also evaluate differences in the aging of electrocatalysts with nanoscale grains versus those with microscale grains. These materials were each prepared with similar nanoscale roughness. The series of Ni electrocatalysts were aged by potential cycling and their hydrated forms subsequently preserved by immersion in liquid nitrogen. After freeze-drying, the preserved state of these samples was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy techniques while held at cryogenic temperatures. The surfaces of aged Ni electrocatalysts were all observed to contain an electrochemically active layer with a gel-like form. Through the use of transmission electron microscopy analyses, it was determined that these gel-like layers contained predominantly nanocrystalline beta nickel hydroxide (beta-Ni(OH)(2)). The formation of the gel-like layer covering these electrocatalysts has implications for dynamic processes taking place at their interface with the electrolyte. Processes influenced by the form of this active layer include rates of diffusion of electrolyte, the mechanism of O-2 bubble nucleation, and the mechanics of bubble release. The results of these studies also have implications for the electrocatalytic activity and stability of other types of electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000711236300027

The optimized RuCu NSs/C-350 degrees C and RuCu NSs/C-250 degrees C show attractive activities of OER and HER with low overpotentials and small Tafel slopes, respectively. When applied to overall water splitting, the optimized RuCu NSs/C can reach 10 mA cm(-2) at cell voltages of only 1.49, 1.55, 1.49 and 1.50 V in 1 m KOH, 0.1 m KOH, 0.5 m H2SO4 and 0.05 m H2SO4, respectively, much lower than those of commercial Ir/C parallel to Pt/C.

Different valence states and morphologies of MnxOy catalysts were synthetized via thermal treatment of EMD (generating Mn2O3 and Mn3O4) and acid digestion of synthetized Mn2O3 (producing alpha-MnO2) in order to develop an efficient Bifunctional Air Electrode (BAE). Change in the ratio H+ to Mn2O3 during the acid digestion affects the sample microporosity, the crystallographic plane distribution, as well as the physical and chemical adsorbed water which was related to defects, i.e. cation vacancies (Mn4+) and Mn3+. These characteristics were discussed and linked to the electrocatalytic activity. The best ORR performing catalyst was that with the higher surface water content (associated to material BET surface area) and a (310) surface as the 2nd more contributing plane (after 211). On the other hand, the catalyst with the higher structural water and with (110) and (200) crystallographic planes being the most intensity contributors (after 211) was the most OER active material. In this work, it was able to find a relationship between catalyst structure and air-efficiency through a volcano-like relationship between air-efficiency and surface water content. Air-efficiency (also take as round-efficiency discharge/charge in battery context) can be taken as a good descriptor of potentially good materials for Zn-Air secondary batteries technology. In this term, we were able to prepare a Bifunctional Air Electrode based on the selected alpha-MnO2 sample which demonstrated a round-efficiency of 53%, a Delta V around 1 V and a neglected loss of the charge potential (about 2.1 V) over the entire lifecycle test (more 200 cycles over 30 hours) with a capacity retention superior to 95%.

To increase the content of the dispersed phase in the composite, it is appropriate to add water to the electrolyte. With inclusion of the titanium dioxide particles into a nickel matrix, the microhardness of the coating increases. The obtained coatings show electrocatalytic activity in the reactions of hydrogen and oxygen evolution in an alkaline aqueous solution, which can be used in electrolytic decomposition of water.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1070-4272	1608-3296		WOS:000594797500006

In this report, Au/NiCo2O4 nanorod arrays with high activity for OER have been fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method followed by a reduction process. The Au/NiCo2O4 nanoarrays exhibited OER activity that was almost four times higher than that of Ir/C (at 1.75V vs. RHE), and a small Tafel slope (63mVdecade(-1)). Moreover, this Au/NiCo2O4 hybrid-array electrode showed good stability in alkaline solution, which is required of an active anode for water electrolysis.									57	3	0	0	3	0	58			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000342740300008

However, the involved six-electron transfer process makes it formidable and seems critical. Hence, exploring high-efficient and low-cost bifunctional catalysts toward urea electrolysis is highly desirable. Herein, hierarchical cuprous sulfide@nickel selenide nanowire arrays were grown on copper foam (termed as Cu2S@Ni3Se2) via a developed method composed of in situ chemical deposition, ion exchange and electrodeposition. The as-prepared bifunctional Cu2S@Ni3Se2 not only shows remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity but also affords excellent urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activity. A subsequently configured Cu2S@Ni3Se2//Cu2S@Ni3Se2 full-cell (Cu2S@Ni3Se2 working as both anode and cathode) only requires a low voltage of 1.48 V to launch a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), not only surpassing the routine water electrolysis (1.70 V), but also outperforming the state-of-the-art Pt/C//IrO2 for urea electrolysis (1.65 V). Moreover, the performance is superior to most recently reported ones that configured with other catalysts. This work presents a solid step for hydrogen-generation from water with low-energy consumption. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

A partial phase transition from NiS2 to NiS induced the amorphous interface in NiS/NiS2 and was expected to separate the H* and H- intermediates onto different interface sites, and to reduce the interfacial energy and charge-transfer resistance as well. When NiS/NiS2 was applied as an electrocatalyst for overall water splitting (OWS), it achieved a geometrical current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 248 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 416 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), obviously superior to those of the single-phase catalysts. In addition, it was also employed as an efficient bifunctional catalyst for OWS, yielding a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.62 V.									114	8	0	0	9	0	115			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000434624800009

The OER was assumed to be the only reaction that takes place at the electrode. The model accounts for effects of the kinetics, ohmic, hydrodynamics, and structural parameters and bubble formation on the potential and current distributions within the electrode and on the overall performance of the electrode. The latter was evaluated via interpretation of the polarization curves of the OER at the porous anode. The model results were discussed in the light of some controlling dimensionless groups. The conductivities of both the electrolyte and the solid matrix have dramatic effects on the general behavior of the porous anode, and lower performance of the electrode was observed when both and/or one of them have limited conductivity values. The electrode potential, and hence the power required to attain a specific current (rate), is highly dependent on the degree of bubble formation within the bed matrix. The model predictions were compared with collected experimental data of OER from flowing sulfuric acid solution at Pt-loaded reticulated vitreous carbon. Good agreements were obtained at the employed experimental conditions. The present work helped to understand the anode performance for further application for simultaneous gas evolution, e.g., O-2 and O-3 gases.									16	0	0	0	4	0	16			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000245535300018

Here, highly crystalline MMMoB4 (M = Fe, Co) compounds with controllable compositions of multiple active metal atoms and polyacene-type boron networks were synthesized delicately by a one-step high-pressure technique to explore electrocatalytic selectivity and activity. CoFeMoB4 and Co2MoB4 are revealed to be highly active and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under alkaline conditions. The mutually promotive activation of metals with amorphous clusters and ultra-small grains on the surface are responsible for the enhanced activity of CoFeMoB4. More specifically, Co and Fe coupling in CoFeMoB4 facilitates surface reconstruction into active Co hydroxide and Fe oxyhydroxide, in contrast to Co oxyhydroxide in Co2MoB4 and Fe oxides in Fe2MoB4. Dissolving Mo may provide potential space for adsorbing hydroxyl, and the optimized electronic structure with boron is mainly responsible for the long-term durability. In contrast, Mo atoms are responsible for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) properties, and the optimized d-band center and density of states at the Fermi level make Co2MoB4 a superior HER catalyst. Our findings provide insight into distinguishing the catalytic pathway of multi-metal borides with improved OER activity and different roles of Mo and Co/Fe in the HER and OER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000738135900001

Here we demonstrate that, through an analogy to photosystem II, the nature of this reactive species is not solely a property of the metal but is intimately tied to the electronic structure of oxygen. We use a combination of synchrotron-based X-ray photoemission and absorption spectroscopies, ab initio calculations, and microcalorimetry to show that holes in the O 2p states in amorphous IrOx give rise to a weakly bound oxygen that is extremely susceptible to nucleophilic attack, reacting stoichiometrically with CO already at room temperature. As such, we expect this species to play the critical role of the electrophilic oxygen involved in O-O bond formation in the electrocatalytic OER on IrOx. We propose that the dynamic nature of the Ir framework in amorphous IrOx imparts the flexibility in Ir oxidation state required for the formation of this active electrophilic oxygen.									108	3	0	0	7	0	108			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000386228900025	28042464

The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) have been investigated on single crystal Pt electrodes modified with hydrophobic/hydrophilic cations and anion-exchange copolymers in alkaline solutions. In alkali metal hydroxide solutions, Pt (110) exhibits the highest HER/HOR activity in the low index planes of Pt. On the low-index planes of Pt, the hydrophilicity of the alkali metal cation in the supporting electrolyte activates the HER/HOR depending on its hydration energy. Hydrophilic cations at the interface facilitate the extraction of hydrogen from the hydrated water. The modification of anion-exchange copolymers with a hydrophobic skeleton on Pt (110) further enhanced the HER/HOR activity. The hydrogen bonding network formed around the hydrophobic species facilitated the mobility of water molecules and the OH- as the reactant/product of the HER/HOR. Appropriately forming hydrophilic and hydrophobic reaction fields at the interface improved the HER/HOR activity. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, it remains challenging for Ir-based catalysts to simultaneously achieve high catalytic activity and good stability in a strongly acidic environment. Herein, we report the fabrication of self-supported nanoporous ultrafine-grained IrO2 electrodes (np-IrO2) through the electrochemical activation of melt-spun Ir12Al88 ribbons under the OER conditions in 0.5 M H2SO4, The as-obtained np-IrO2 needs only 240 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) and can sustain continuous OER electrolysis in strong acid at an unusually high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for 30 h without substantial degradation. Moreover, we find that the electrochemical activation of Ir12Al88 ribbons under the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) conditions results in the formation of nanoporous IrAl alloy electrodes (np-IrAl), which show outstanding catalytic performance for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4. We further demonstrate that by using np-IrO2 as an anode and np-IrAl as a cathode, we can accomplish overall acidic water splitting at 10 mA cm(-2) with a low voltage of 1.52 V. Remarkably, the np-IrO2 vertical bar vertical bar np-IrAl electrode pair is able to split water stably in 0.5 M H2SO4 at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for up to 40 h, showing substantial promise for use in PEM water electrolysis.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2574-0962			WOS:000529190300070

However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode of the water electrolysis limits its efficiency. Moreover, high current density (>= 500 mA/cm2) hydrogen production that meets industrial requirements and remains relatively stability is the trend currently. Herein, we reported a three-dimensional porous nanosheets array electrocatalyst FeVO4/NF-a synthesized by electrochemical activation and hydrothermal method. The developed FeVO4/NF-a electrode represents excellent OER performance at high current den-sities, which allows a low overpotential of 376 mV to achieve 1000 mA/cm2 and keeps its durability for 50 h. Structural characterizations and electrochemical analyses show that the NF surface was converted to the active phase NiOOH for OER during electrochemical activation. The introduction of Fe3+ and V3+ changes the electron distribution of elements on the catalyst surface and optimizes its intrinsic activity. Additionally, the three-dimensional network structure of FeVO4/NF-a facilitates the gas diffusion and the contact between the catalyst with the electrolyte.

Herein, a novel strategy based on the theory of molecular crystallization and atomic diffusion is described to construct the FeOOH@Ni-3(NO3)(2)(OH)(4)/NF. It requires an overpotential of 248 mV at the current density of 100 mA cm(-2 )for OER. The in-situ Raman spectroscopy test exploring the catalytic actives unravels that NiOOH is one of the real active species and a small amount of NiFe2O4 is generated during OER process. The analysis of the mechanism shows that NiOOH converted from the intermediate product of Ni(OH)(2) derived from Ni-3(NO3)(2)(OH)(4 )in the process of OER. NiOOH and FeOOH mainly work together contributing to boosting intrinsic catalytic activity. This work may provide a new insight into fabricating strategy for other nano -catalysts. The in-situ Raman measurement provides a valid and reliable means to probe into the catalytic active site and catalytic mechanism in the catalytic process.(C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Polyoxometalates and layered double hydroxide materials are suggested to be potential catalyst materials; however, those electrocatalytic behaviors are greatly inferior to the state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts (RuO2 and IrO2). In this work, we employ a self-assembly approach in which polyoxometalate anions are successfully intercalated into NiFe layered double hydroxide. Upon analysis of the composition, the elemental valence state and the infrared spectrum, it confirms that the intercalated polyoxometalate anions in the layers of NiFe layered double hydroxide are in the format of PW12O403-. Even though the partial anions in the as-prepared intercalation NiFe layered double hydroxide are only polyoxometalate anions, its electrochemical performance surpasses the counterpart precursor NiFe layered double hydroxide (NO3-) in many aspects, such as turnover frequencies, overpotentials, kinetics, and stability. The introduction of polyoxometalate anions can optimize the local electronic structure which enhances the charge transport capacity of NiFe layered double hydroxide as well as alter the adsorption/desorption nature of the intermediates during the catalysis process. This work provides a new strategy to boost the OER activity of layered double hydroxide-based electrocatalysts. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, oxygen deficient vanadium oxide (V2O3) has been synthesized in an autoclave at 500 degrees C for 4 h. The reaction temperature, time and atmosphere affect the pure phase formation of V2O3. The structural, morphological and surface characteristics of pure phase V2O3 has been analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The phase transition with respect to temperature has been confirmed by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity has been studied in an acidic medium. The synthesized sample shows higher cyclic stability for 1000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles. It also exhibits a lower Tafel slope of 81.2 mVdec(-1). The electrochemical double layer capacitance (EDLC) measurements was done via CV measurements performed at various scan rates. The observed EDLC value of synthesized sample is 242.6 mu Fcm(-2). The study predicts potential applications of V2O3 nano structures for electrochemical applications like HER and supercapacitors.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000498748300084

However, the cell voltage of currently available electrolyzers using bifunctional electrodes is still high because maintaining high intrinsic OER and HER activity simultaneously while keeping good charge and mass transport is a challenging task. Herein, the dense ternary NiMoFe alloy nanoparticles are in situ precipitated on the highly conductive hierarchical MoO2 nano-pillar arrays (NiMoFe NPs@MoO2 NPAs) to form an ultra-hydrophilic and super-aerophobic structure by the reductive annealing process-induced phase separation method. Benefiting from the intrinsically high OER and HER activity, abundant active sites and excellent charge and mass transport, the as-obtained NiMoFe NPs@MoO2 NPAs exhibit ultra-low overpotentials of 79 mV for hydrogen evolution and 246 mV for oxygen evolution at 100 mA cm(-2). The assembled two-electrode cell delivers the industrially relevant current densities of 100 and 1000 mA cm(-2) at record low cell voltages of 1.52 and 1.66 V while maintaining an almost unchanged potential over 1000 h water splitting. The present method of in situ constructing multielement alloy nanoparticles on hierarchical structure also shows great simplicity and broad applicability potential for preparing high-performance electrocatalysts beyond water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000746661200001

InSe/g-C3N4 possesses a direct band gap of 2.04 eV with type-II band alignment, which is beneficial to the separation of electrons and holes and exhibits proper valence and conduction-band positions for the redox reactions of H2O. In addition, the adsorption of multiple water molecules and the changes of free energy on InSe/g-C3N4 have been calculated to understand the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process of water splitting. The free energies of reaction on three sides are all downhill, and the values of Delta G reduce to about -0.406 eV, indicating that the OER of water splitting is a thermodynamically permissible reaction without the aid of any other substance. Therefore, the water-splitting reaction could be thermodynamically continued using InSe/g-C3N4 as a photocatalyst, which indicates that InSe/g-C3N4 is an excellent candidate for photocatalyst or photoelectronic applications.									114	5	0	0	4	0	114			1948-7185			WOS:000471079400072	31117679

Herein, a series of Fe-doped Ni0.85Se (FexNi0.85-xSe, x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4) catalysts are synthesized successfully by one-step hydrothermal method and studied as high active bifunctional catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reac-tion (HER) in electrolysis water splitting. The results indicates that a suitable doping can make different metal ions have a synergistic effect and improve catalytic performance. The optimal Fe0.08Ni0.77Se sam-ple shows excellent OER and HER activities. Subsequently, the introduction of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) forming Fe0.08Ni0.77Se/CNT composite further enhances the electrocatalytic activity due to high electric conductivity of carbon nanotubes network. The resulted Fe0.08Ni0.77Se/CNT3 composite exhibits smaller overpotential of 204 mV and 108 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1) and 59 mV dec(-1) than that of other composites for OER and HER, respectively. The results demon-strate that Fe0.08Ni0.77Se/CNT3 is an excellent bifunctional catalyst, providing a promising candidate for electrocatalytic water splitting. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, designing advanced OER electrocatalysts with abundant active sites, robust stability, and low cost remains a huge challenge. Herein, a facile and versatile multiscale manipulating strategy was proposed to construct a novel V-NiFe2O4@Ni2P heterostructure self-supported on Ni foam (V-NiFe2O4@Ni2P/NF). In such unique architecture, the intrinsic OER catalytic activity was greatly boosted by the in-situ generated heterogeneous Ni2P phase induced by precisely selective phosphorylation of the NiFe-precursor, while the synchronous metal V doping stimulated the activity via modulating the electronic configuration, thus synergistically promoting its OER kinetics. In addition, the binder-free catalyst built from three-dimensional (3D) nanosheet arrays (NSs) can offer a large active surface for efficient charge/mass transfer and a robust scaffold for the integrated structure. The as-prepared flexible electrode exhibited superior OER activity with an ultra-low overpotential of 230 mV at 50 mA.cm(-2) and outstanding long-term stability for 40 h. This discovery is expected to provide an opportunity to explore efficient and stable commercial materials for scalable, efficient, and robust electrochemical hydrogen (H-2) production.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000771906800001

Although FeNi layered dihydroxide (FeNiLDH) is a promising candidate material for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis, its catalytic performance can be further improved by the increased amounts of active sites, and the enhancement of electrical conductivity and durability. In this case, FeNiCo-LDH with the introduction of cobalt ions to FeNi-LDH can obtain a large active specific surface area by adjusting the electronic structure, and act as the main active substance in the reconstruction process to promote the catalytic performance of OER. Taking advantage of the low cost and easy availability of 304 stainless steel plates, the FeNiCo-LDH nanoplates were uniformly loaded onto the treated 304 plates by a simple two-step method. The as-prepared electrodes show superior OER in 1 M KOH, with 221 and 252 mV overpotentials to attain 10 and 350 mA cm(-2) current densities, respectively with an ultra-low Tafel slope of 30.9 mV dec(-1). Besides, the electrode also showed good stability in a chronopotential electrolysis at 10 mA cm(-2) for 100 h.

A comparative research of electron transfer from bimetallic Co/Ni and monometallic Co active sites to a large amount of pyridine-N in the potential g-C3N4 to promote oxygen evolution reactions. The CoNiSSe-g-C3N4 hybrid electrocatalysts exhibited nanosheet morphology and have an average thickness of 0.92 nm. XPS indicated that metal Ni-N bonds were formed between CoNiSSe and g-C3N4, which compared with no Ni-N covalent bonds between CoSSe and g-C3N4. Meanwhile, the integration of g-C3N4 provides a 2D g-C3N4 matrix for high-efficient interfacial charge transfer. The bimetallic CoNiSSe-g-C3N4 electrocatalysts demonstrated distinguished performance toward OER accompanied by an over -potential of 282 mV (1.512 V vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm-2, Tafel slope 59 mV dec-1, which exhibited excellent current densities, small overpotentials, and good stabilities. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the DOS intensity of the Fermi level is closely related to the conductivity of the electrocatalysts, which indicates rapid charge transfer kinetics, electron transfer process.

Platinum nanoparticles decorated IrO2@MWCNT-400 degrees C are prepared by chemical reduction method. The influence of MWCNTs and Pt on physicochemical properties and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of IrO2@MWCNT composites were studied via transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectra, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) and electrochemical methods. Among the samples, Pt/IrO2@MWCNT-400 degrees C exhibits better catalytic activity with an overpotential of 270 mV at the current density of 10 mAcm(-2) with a low Tafel slope of 85.1 mVdec(-1). The outstanding OER performance of Pt/IrO2@MWCNT-400 degrees C is ascribed to the introduction of the MWCNTs, which can not only act as a support to prevent agglomeration of IrO2 nanoparticles that produces high surface area of catalytic sites, but also facilitates electron transfer between IrO2 nanoparticles and MWCNTs. On the other hand, the Pt optimizes electronic structure for excellent electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, the Pt/IrO2@MWCNT-400 degrees C catalyst is a good choice for application in OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2365-6549			WOS:000765993600014

Herein, we have prepared novel Mn2P-Mn2O3 heterogeneous nanoparticles hosted in a P, N-doped three-dimensional porous carbon framework. Of these, Mn2P-Mn2O3/PNCF displayed ultrahigh stability as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) and oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in alkaline electrolytes. These properties are a result of the abundant heterogeneous interfaces, optimized electronic configurations and hierarchical pore structure of the Mn2P-Mn2O3/PNCF catalyst. This material has a closed zero calculated Gibbs free energy for adsorbed H of -0.013 eV, and can achieve current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2) for HERs and OERs, respectively, whilst requiring only low overpotentials of 98 mV and 330 mV, respectively. In addition, an alkaline electrolyzer with Mn2P-Mn2O3/PNCF as both the anode and cathode demonstrates a nearly comparable activity and higher stability than the present state-of-the-art, Pt/C parallel to RuO2/C, for full water splitting.

The NiFe-based catalyst showed excellent catalytic properties. Herein, nickel-iron selenide (m-NiFeSe) with a two-dimensional nanosheet structure was prepared by using the nickel foam as the substrate and the electrodeposition-microwave rapid hydrolysis method. The presence of microwave not only changes the microscopic morphology, forms a new catalytic interface, increases the active area, but also appears mixed valence states of nickel (Ni2+/Ni3+) and high valence states of selenium, which makes the catalyst possess excellent basic OER electrocatalytic performance. In addition, the synergistic effect between nickel metal and iron metal is also one of the reasons for the improved property. Finally, the microwaveassisted catalysts reached electric current densities of 10 and 100 mA.cm(2) at overpotentials of 128 and 291 mV, separately, and had good durability in the chronopotentiometry test at a current density of 100 mA.cm(2) for 18 h.

Herein, novel hybrid Ni(OH)(2)/FeOOH@NixFey (x:y = 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) nanosheet catalysts were rationally designed and synthesized for improving OER performance via a scalable sputtering-alloying-dealloying-activation strategy. The hybrid nanosheets directly grown on the stainless steel mesh possess flexible, composition-adjustable, and binder-free characteristics. Especially, the Ni(OH)(2)/FeOOH@Ni2Fe1 nanosheet catalyst displays incredible OER activity, with an extraordinarily low overpotential of 216 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in a 1 M KOH electrolyte, superior to that of the state-of-the-art NiFe-based electrocatalysts. Significantly, the electrode went through an ultralong durability test over 1000 h (>40 days) without obvious attenuation, exceeding most of the advanced electrocatalysts. Through a series of characterizations (microstructural, spectroscopic, and electrochemical), the improved OER performance of the hybrid electrode can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of hybridization between Ni(OH)(2) and FeOOH, the optimal Ni:Fe ratio, the ultrathin nanosheet structure, large electrochemical surface area, and low activation energy.									20	2	0	0	0	0	20			2168-0485			WOS:000484071600032

This is especially true under more demanding conditions like high potentials and high temperatures. Rotating disk electrode measurements show a gradual increase of OER current when increasing the temperature up to 80 degrees C. However, strong bubble formation at elevated temperatures makes in-situ characterization of the catalyst challenging. Here we utilize an in-situ electrochemical and heated flow cell, which aims at an efficient removal of bubbles from the catalyst surface and enables structural studies by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at temperatures up to 80 degrees C. Changes in the Ir L-3-edge X-ray absorption near edge spectra (XANES) were observed with respect to the white line position and principal components related to structural changes were extracted. At temperatures of 60 degrees C and above, the white line position of XANES spectra reaches a steady state, which is possibly caused by an equilibrium of different Ir oxidation states. These findings provide first spectroscopic insights in the behavior of OER catalysts at elevated temperatures which are typical for industrial applications and rarely addressed until now.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000855117100001

Herein, a bifunctional electrocatalyst consisting of MoO2 and CeOx heterostructure is synthesized via interfacial engineering. Particularly, due to its unique hetero-interface with abundant oxygen vacancies, the MoO2-CeOx/NF is able to exhibit outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with an overpotential of 26 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and a preferable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 272 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. The recorded HER and OER overpotentials of MoO2-CeOx/NF are clearly smaller than those of Pt/C (HER overpotential of 27 mV) and RuO2 (OER overpotential of 393 mV) at the same current density. More importantly, MoO2-CeOx/NF can also exhibit good HER activity with an overpotential of 50 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic media. Thus, it is expected that this work can offer a new approach in the realization of high-catalytic alkaline overall water splitting and acidic HER performance through the rational design of rare-earth metal and non-noble metal heterostructure.

Herein, we report an interface engineering strategy to fabricate 3D hierarchical CuCo2O4@CuCo2S4 heterostructure catalysts with efficient synergistic effects for water splitting. Owing to the special nano-architectures with abundant active interfaces, the as-prepared CuCo2O4@CuCo2S4 catalysts exhibit superior electrochemical activity and prominent electrochemical stability, with a small overpotential of 240 and 101 mV for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Remarkably, the CuCo2O4@CuCo2S4 materials directly applied as both anode and cathode electrode demonstrate excellent water splitting performance, achieving 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of only 1.53 V, outperforming the integrated state-of-the-art RuO2 parallel to Pt/C couple (1.56 V). Moreover, density functional theory calculations suggest that the excellent overall water splitting property of CuCo2O4@CuCo2S4 is attributed to a large amount of hierarchical hetero-interfaces, giving rise to effective adsorption and cleavage of H2O molecules on the catalyst surface. This work represents a general strategy to exploit efficient and stable hybrid electrocatalysts for renewable energy applications by rational catalyst interface engineering.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000551128800028

A 3-D porous coordination network (PCN) with 3-D nanochannels was synthesized using ultrastable Zr-6 clusters and tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin cobalt(II). Located in the backbone of MOF, cobalt porphyrins as the active centers are easily accessible to the reactants. The composite exhibits smaller overpotentials and higher current for OR and OE reactions compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. A proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism has been suggested due to the pH dependence of water oxidation on the electrocatalyst. Furthermore, the stability of the catalyst has been verified by various techniques. Our designed heterogeneous, inexpensive, and stable electrocatalyst is a proper candidate for acidic fuel cells and water splitting devices under near neutral condition without requirement of pyrolysis process.									51	3	0	0	1	0	52			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000417731300043

We have developed a facile method for synthesizing CoSe2 nanoparticles uniformly anchored on carbon fiber paper (CoSe2/CF) via pyrolysis and selenization of in situ grown zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67). CoSe2/CF shows high and stable catalytic activity in both the HER and OER in alkaline solution. At a low cell potential, i.e., 1.63 V, a water electrolyzer equipped with two CoSe2/CF electrodes gave a water-splitting current of 10 mA center dot cm(-2). At a current of 20 mA center dot cm(-2), it can operate without degradation for 30 h. This study not only offers a cost-effective solution for water splitting but also provides a new strategy for developing various catalytic nanostructures by changing the metal-organic framework precursors.									182	14	0	0	8	0	182			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000380726200003

A composite material comprising of tiny particles of nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) embedded into cobalt oxide (Co3O4) flakes is prepared by sodium borohydride reduction method and followed by annealing at 600 degrees C under inert atmosphere. Structutal, morphological and crystalline featured are analyzed using FESEM, TEM, HRTEM, XRD and XPS studied. More-over, optical and fluorescence properties of N-GQDs are studied using UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques. These studies clearly reveal and confirm the formation of a composite material. Further electrochemical characteristics toward OER and ORR are investigated by using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques. Compared to the individual entities of pure Co3O4 and N-GQDs alone, the electrocatalytic activity of N-GQDs/Co3O4 composite material is significantly higher towards ORR. Similarly, the same composite material is also used as an electrocatalyst for OER in 0.1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte and it exhibits a lower overpotential of 330 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) along with higher electrocatalytic activity and the reason is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between N-GQDs and Co3O4. Thus, NGQDs/Co3O4 composite material is demonstrated to be a high performance bi-functional electrocatalyst for ORR and OER. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Tremendous efforts have been devoted to finding high-performance electrocatalysts consisting of nonprecious metals. The search is spent, not only on the designing of new materials, but also on the invention of new fabrication techniques. Recently, laser processing has emerged as a promising route to obtain micron-thick films of highly graphitic carbons. The laser approach enables a fast one-step synthesis of highly-dispersed nanoparticles under ambient temperature and pressure conditions. In this work, a laser is used to fabricate magnetite/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite electrodes as electrocatalysts. The graphitization level can be controlled by tuning different laser parameters. The detailed chemical, structural and morphology characterization, and electrochemical measurements are investigated. With only five atomic percentage metal, the designed magnetite-rGO electrocatalyst lowers the overpotential by 40 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a smaller Tafel value (63 mV dec(-1)). Moreover, these studies demonstrate that magnetite-rGO nanocomposites are stable OER electro- catalysts with only 13.5% activity reduction after 10 h of chronoamperometric operation. This work combines an efficient nanocomposites fabrication method with important implications for energy-related applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2366-7486			WOS:000793928700001

Herein, hollow fluffy cages (HFC) of Co3O4, constructed of ultrathin nanosheets, were synthesized by the formation of Co(OH)(2) hollow cages and subsequent calcination at 250 degrees C. The large surface area (245.5 m(2) g(-1)) of HFC Co3O4 annealed at 250 degrees C ensures the efficient interaction between electrolytes and electroactive components and provides more active sites for the surface redox reactions. The hierarchical structures minimize amount of the grain boundaries and facilitate the charge transfer process. Thin thickness of nanosheets CO, (2-3 nm) ensures the highly active sites for the surface redox reactions. As a consequence, HFC Co3O4 as the supercapacitor electrode exhibits a superior rate capability, shows an excellent cydiability of 10 000 cycles at 10 A g(-1), and delivers large specific capacitances of 948.9 and 536.8 F g(-1) at 1 and 40 A g(-1), respectively. Catalytic studies of HFC Co3O4 for oxygen evolution reaction display a much higher turnover frequency of 1.67 x 10(-2) s(-1) in pH 14.0 KOH electrolyte at 400 mV overpotential and a lower Tafel slope of 70 mV dec(-1). HFC Co3O4 with the efficient electrochemical activity and good stability can remain a promising candidate for the electrochemical energy conversion and storage.									136	5	1	0	4	0	137			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000361501700054	26315725

At low current densities (cd), the Tafel slope is close to 60 mV, whereas at high cd, it is close to 120 mV. The rates at high cd are strongly affected by the presence of an anodic oxide film over electrodes. They decrease exponentially with the film thickness. In contrast, the rates at low cd are unaffected by the film thickness. The reaction order with respect to OH- is 3/2 at high, and 2 at low cd. The mechanism of the reaction involves electron tunneling through the oxide film. The first electron transfer step is rate determining (rd) at high cd. The major factor affecting the rates is the probability for successful transfer of electrons through the potential energy barrier. The dependence of the rates on electrode potential is, however, controlled principally by the distribution of the occupied electron energy levels in solution. At low cd, a chemical step following the first electron transfer step is rd. The observed pH dependences cannot be accounted for in terms of any customary approach to electrode kinetics. They are accounted for in terms of the quasi-equilibrium that exists across the outer Helmholtz layer.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0013-4686			WOS:A1992JN63200023

These findings were considered as a significant breakthrough in this field because there had been a long belief that the four-electron process (i.e., 2H(2)O -> O-2 + 4H(+) + 4e(-)) is much more effectively accelerated by dinuclear or tetranuclear metal complexes. The kinetics of O-2 evolution is investigated as a function of either the catalyst concentration or the oxidant concentration, revealing that these catalysts can be classified into two groups exhibiting different rate laws for O-2 evolution. Moreover, the singlet biradical character of the hydroxocerium (IV) ion is realized, indicating that the radical coupling of the oxygen atoms of a Ru-V = O species and a hydroxocerium (IV) ion is the key step for the catalysis. Several important insights into the mechanism of oxygen evolution from water catalyzed by the mononuclear aquaruthenium complexes will also be discussed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0037-9980			WOS:000289590300003

Black phosphorus (BP), as a new kind of two-dimensional (2D) layer material, has recently shown excellent OER electrocatalytic activity. However, atomistic understanding of the catalytic mechanism is lacking. Here, on the basis of ab initio calculations, we find that pristine phosphorene shows poor ORR/OER performances. However, oxidation can effectively tune the adsorption strength of reactive intermediates and thus change its OER/ORR electrocatalytic performance. For OER, the higher the local oxidation degree (D-local(O)) of phosphorene, the better the OER activity. Therefore, the oxidized phosphorene site with highest D-local(O) shows the best OER catalytic property. In contrast, there exists an optimum D-local(O) for ORR. These findings provide new insights for better understanding and improving the catalytic performances of BP-based electrocatalysts and could stimulate more theoretical and experimental studies in this area.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			1948-7185			WOS:000472804700039	31181929

We report a rapid and facile synthetic route to obtain IrxNi clusters via polyol reduction. The IrxNi clusters show excellent activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic electrolytes. The optimized Ir2Ni/C clusters exhibit an electrochemical active area of 18.27 mF cm(-2), with the overpotential of OER being 292 mV and HER being 30 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. In addition, the Ir2Ni/C used as the cathode and anode for the H-type hydrolysis tank only needs 1.597 V cell voltages. The excellent electrocatalytic performance is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between the metals and the ultra-fine particle size. This study provides a novel strategy that has a broad application for water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2046-2069		WOS:000704927300001	35497523	
P	OWEJAN J E; ZHANG J; JASON Z								Fuel cell for automobiles comprises ion conducting polymer membrane between two electrodes, and first oxygen evolution reduction catalyst-containing ionic layer having ion conducting polymer and carbon, between first electrode and membrane					US2010178582-A1; CN101794895-A; DE102010004054-A1; US9337494-B2	GM GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS INC; GM GLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES OPERATIONS INC																			NOVELTY - A fuel cell (10) comprises: first electrode (32); second electrode (36); ion conducting polymer membrane (40) positioned between first and second electrodes; and a first oxygen evolution reduction (OER) catalyst-containing ionic layer (50) positioned between first electrode and polymer electrolyte membrane, where the layer comprises OER catalyst, ion conducting polymer and carbon, in which weight ratio of ion conducting polymer to carbon is 10-100. USE - As fuel cell (claimed), useful as electrical power source in e.g. automobiles. ADVANTAGE - The fuel cell comprises first and second oxygen evolution reduction (OER) catalyst-containing ionic layers positioned between first electrode and polymer electrolyte membrane, and second electrode and polymer electrolyte membrane, and provides electrodes that are resistant to oxidation; as compared to the prior art fuel cells which have configurations that although work reasonably well, significant problems arise during global or local fuel starvation and during start/stop conditions, due to oxidation of electrode carbon support that results in damages to the electrode structure, decreased fuel cell performance, and decreased service lifetime of the cell. When the fuel cell is tested by subjecting to accelerated corrosion test to evaluate effectiveness of OER catalyst-containing ionic layer comprising a layer present as iridium oxide containing ionic layer on anode side, in mitigating carbon corrosion during cell reversal due to global fuel (H2) starvation in anode, voltage rises are seen as for reaction to support oxidation current flow from anode side; so that iridium in ionic layer is found to be as effective as in electrode layer in protecting anode carbon support from severe corrosion. Thus for a given carbon support, it is observed that the OER-containing catalyst layer i.e. iridium oxide containing ionic layer provides same level of electrode protection as when iridium oxide is embedded into first catalyst platinum-containing electrode. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A fuel cell (10) comprises: first electrode (32); second electrode (36); ion conducting polymer membrane (40) positioned between first and second electrodes; and a first oxygen evolution reduction (OER) catalyst-containing ionic layer (50) positioned between first electrode and polymer electrolyte membrane, where the layer comprises OER catalyst, ion conducting polymer and carbon, in which weight ratio of ion conducting polymer to carbon is 10-100. The OER catalyst comprises an iridium-containing compound (preferably a compound of formula IrxOy) (where x is 0.8-1.2 (preferably 1), and y is 1.8-2.4 (preferably 2)); and/or a component selected from ruthenium oxides, ruthenium oxide-titanium oxide, and/or indium oxides. The fuel cell further comprises a second OER catalyst-containing layer (52) positioned between ion conducting polymer membrane and second electrode. The OER catalyst loading is 0.0005-0.005 mg/cm2.

Here, its surface configurations in environmental or electrochemical conditions are assessed via density functional theory (DFT) calculations conducted at the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE)+U level. The most energetically favorable surface domains of alpha-Fe2O3 (0001) and (1 (1) over bar 02) are predicted by constructing the surface phase diagrams in the framework of first-principle thermodynamics. The relative surface stabilities are investigated as a function of partial pressures of oxygen and water, temperature, solution pH, and electrode potential not only for perfect bulk terminations but also for defect-containing surfaces having various degrees of hydroxylation and hydration. In order to assess the impact on the redox reactions of the surface planes as well as of the extent of surface hydration/hydroxylation, the thermodynamics of the four-step oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism are examined in detail for different models of the alpha-Fe2O3 (0001) and (1 (1) over bar 02) surfaces. Importantly, the results underline that the nature of the surface termination and the degree of near-surface hydroxylation give rise to significant variations in the OER overpotentials.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000445666000026

A LDH with a Co/Mn ratio of 4, CoMn4, was the reference electrocatalyst of the set, presenting the typical hydrotalcite structure with a trace of MnCo2O4, with a surface area of 76 m(2) g(-1). HNO3 oxidized carbon nanotubes (CNT_HNO3) and CNT_HNO3 with a low content of carboxylic acids (CNT_HNO(3)tt350), were incorporated into the CoMn4 synthesis, obtaining CoMn4@CNT_HNO3 and CoMn4@CNT_HNO(3)tt350 with surface areas of 111 and 167 m(2) g(-1), respectively. According to X-ray diffraction (XRD), the oxide phase of CoMn4@CNT_HNO3 is composed by a mixture of LDH with MnCo2O4, while the low% COOH on the carbon surface promoted the synthesis of LDHs as the only oxide structure at CoMn4@ CNT_HNO(3)tt350. Moreover, after a thermal treatment of the latter electrocatalyst, the LDHs were totally converted into MnCo2O4.All electrocatalysts showed to have activity over both oxygen reactions when the KOH solution was saturated with O-2. A detailed ORR study showed that the LDH structures mixed with CoMn oxides, present at CoMn4@CNT_HNO3, play a relevant role in ORR, exhibiting an onset potential, E-ORR, of -0.274 V. On the other hand, CoMn4@CNT_HNO(3)tt350 led to a four-electron mechanism for ORR, similar to the Pt/C standard. The best OER potential (0.636 V) was also obtained for CoMn4@CNT_HNO(3)tt350. Regarding the oxygen electrode bifunctionality, a good balance between ORR and OER was observed for the CoMn4@CNT_HNO(3)tt350_N-2 composite.					7th International Symposium on Carbon for Catalysis (CarboCat)7th International Symposium on Carbon for Catalysis (CarboCat)	20162016		Strasbourg, FRANCEStrasbourg, FRANCE	39	3	0	0	0	0	41			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000417054300004

Both pristine hematite and hematite containing oxygen vacancies were considered. The onset potential was determined to be 1.79 V and 2.09 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for the pristine hydroxyl- and oxygen-terminated hematite, respectively. The presence of oxygen vacancies in the hematite surface resulted in pronounced shifts of the onset potential to 3.09 V and 1.83 V. respectively. Electrochemical oxidation measurements conducted on thin-film hematite anodes, resulted in a measured onset potential of 1.66 V vs. RHE. Furthermore, the threshold potential between the hydroxyl- and oxygen-terminated hematite was determined as a function of pH. The results indicate that electrochemical water oxidation on hematite occurs on the oxygen-terminated hematite, containing oxygen vacancies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Developing gas diffusion electrodes with high catalytic activity for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is considered as one of the most promising strategies to promote the practical application of this novel system. Herein, a honeycomb-like Ni2P/Ni12P5 heterostructure with abundant phosphorus vacancies in situ growing on Ni foam (Ni2P/Ni12P5@NF) is developed as an effective and stable electrode for LOBs. Phosphorus vacancies are capable of inducing delocalization of constrained electrons near the Ni-P bonds, thereby regulating the band gap to enhance both the conductivity and the catalytic activity for oxygen electrode reactions. In addition, the modulation of electronic structure along the heterogeneous interface between Ni12P5 and Ni2P optimizes the adsorption of oxygenated intermediates, which is beneficial to accelerate the interface reaction kinetics of oxygen electrode reactions. Impressively, the LOBs with Ni2P/Ni12P5@NF containing abundant phosphorus vacancies exhibit low overpotential of 0.89 V, ultra-high discharge specific capacity of 13254.1 mA h g(-1), and remarkable durability of over 500 h. This work concerning engineering heterostructure with rich vacancies can provide new guidance for the development of high performance electrocatalysts.									21	1	0	0	0	0	22			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000638244900004

However, their stability is seriously compromised during the reaction. In this work we show that it is possible to enhance both OER activity and durability of SrRuO3 mixed oxide by the partial doping with K+ in Sr2+ sites. Sr1xKxRuO3 perovskites (x = 0.00, 0.05, 0.10 and 0.20) have been synthesized by wet chemistry. The partial doping with K+ cations led to oxides with Ru atoms in a higher oxidation state. In addition, K-doping resulted in perovskites with slightly higher symmetry. The performance of the K-doped perovskites for the OER was assessed in acid electrolyte. Clearly, the K-doped materials, especially Sr0.80K0.20RuO3, display higher activity (lower E-10) and significantly higher durability than the undoped sample SrRuO3. The results indicate that chemical modifications on Ru perovskites can be a suitable strategy to improve the stability of Ru phases during the OER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000763508800004

As two main reactions, oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR) require highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts. Herein, by first-principles calculations, we have systematically investigated the OER and ORR performance for a new class of two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) M-3(C6S6)(2), with M including Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir, and Pt. It is demonstrated that Rh-3(C6S6)(2) possesses promising bifunctional OER/ORR activity, with calculated overpotentials of 0.43 and 0.42 V for the OER and ORR, respectively. Moreover, the volcano plots and contour maps regarding activity vs. intermediate adsorption strength are established to describe the activity trends of the OER and ORR for M-3(C6S6)(2). A combination of the d-band center and crystal orbital Hamilton populations (COHPs) is employed to correlate the activity and electronic structure of the catalyst. The catalytic origin of OER and ORR activities can be ascribed to the simple d-electron number of the central metal of M-3(C6S6)(2). Our findings not only provide cost-effective bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts but also offer important insights into advancing clean energy technology.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000806850700001

The hybrid oxide electrocatalyst was found to display an excellent oxygen/hydrogen evolution reaction (OER/HER activity) in alkaline condition. The realization of random heterojunction configuration across the hybrid nanostructures was found to offer an improved conductivity and enhanced charge transfer capability to promote the gas evolution kinetics. Overpotential value of 203 and 378 mV was registered from the respective OER and HER polarization curves (for current density of +/- 10 mA cm(-2)). Tafel slope of 87 mV/dec for OER and 90 mV/dec for HER along with the long-term stability results authenticated the anodic/cathodic characteristics of hybrid oxides for overall water splitting applications.

As the active electrode material in super-capacitors, it exhibited a large specific capacitance (1628.1 C g(-1) at a current density of 2 mA cm(-2)), a high rate capability (874.8 C g(-1) at 50 mA cm(-2)), and superior cycling stability (90.54% capability retention after 5000 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2)). Moreover, as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the CoMoO4 nanoneedle exhibited an early onset potential of 1.37 V, a small Tafel slope of 66 mV Dec(-1), and a low overpotential of 235 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The excellent electrochemical performance of the hierarchical CoMoO4 structure was attributed to its porosity and the characteristics of the 2D nanosheet subunits that possess many active reaction sites, rapid electron/ion transport, and high stability. The synthetic strategy used in the present study is simple, cost-effective, and generalizable. It can be used to develop effective electrode materials for large-scale energy storage and conversion applications. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Buddie								In Situ Growth of Fe(Ni) OOH Catalyst on Stainless Steel for Water Oxidation								CHEMISTRYSELECT				2	7			2230	2234		10.1002/slct.201700081				MAR 2017	2017	Stainless steel contains the elements Fe, Ni, Cr and Mn, which are known as active centers of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. The high conductivity of stainless steel also makes it an ideal substrate for OER. These facts imply that stainless steel should be a suitable candidate as an OER electrode. Here, we report a simple solution treatment approach that enables stainless steel to be an efficient and stable OER electrode. It was found that a uniform brown film with highly rippled sheet structure could be in situ grown on stainless steel at room temperature by immersing it in an alkaline oxidant solution containing NaOH and (NH4) 2S2O8. The composition of the brown film was found to include Fe(Ni) OOH by Raman and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. In 1 M KOH electrolyte, the prepared OER electrode exhibited good electrocatalytic performance with a relatively low overpotential of 300 mV at a benchmark current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and a small Tafel slope of 34 mV/decade. Moreover, this OER electrode showed excellent long-term stability. This work highlights the possibility of potentially converting accessible materials into useful catalysts through simple chemical treatments.									35	3	0	0	1	0	37			2365-6549			WOS:000395534900004

In this work, IrNiTa (INT) MG ribbon with mesoporous surface is prepared by using a new synthesis procedure. It shows an over potential of 48 mV for HER and 266 mV for OER to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under alkaline conditions. By combining experimental characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the outstanding catalytic performance is attributed to: i) the large surface area of the mesoporous structure, ii) the good charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface, iii) the super hydrophilicity/aerophobicity of the MG ribbon and iv) the promotion of Ni and Ta atoms towards the intrinsic activity of Ir atoms in the INT (HER) and of surface IrO2 layer (OER). By using these self-standing INT MG ribbons as both the cathode and anode for overall water splitting, a stable cell voltage of 1.58 V is required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is 60 mV smaller than the value for Pt/C||IrO2 couple. This work demonstrates the potential use of MGs as integrated bifunctional electrodes for scalable water electrolysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000774904700004

The Ni-Co-CNT composite coatings were electrodeposited on copper substrate from a sulphate bath, using glycerol as the additive. Electrocatalytic efficiency of the coatings, used as electrodes were tested for both Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1M KOH using cyclic voltametry and chronopotentiometric techniques. The experimental conditions were optimized to maximize the electrocatalytic activity of both Ni-Co and Ni-Co-CNT coatings for HER and OER. The experimental results revealed that Ni-Co-CNT coatings deposited at high current densities are more favorable for OER and HER, compared to bare Ni-Co coatings deposited from same bath, under same condition. The substantial improvement in the electrocatalytic activity of Ni-Co-CNT composite coatings was attributed to increased porosity due to addition of CNT. The structure-property relationship of both Ni-Co and Ni-Co-CNT alloy coatings for HER and OER were used to explain the role of CNT in enhancing electrocatalytic activity, with the support of XRD, SEM and EDX analyses.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2297-3400			WOS:000409365000021

Herein, ultrasmall core-shellstructured FeNi encapsulated within tungsten carbide (WC) stabilized in a thin N-doped graphitized carbon layer (NCL) was proposed through a unique one-step encapsulation strategy combined with a high temperature carbonization procedure and tested as an OER catalyst. Physicochemical characterizations of the newly prepared material demonstrate that metal nanoparticles are embedded in the carbon layers of FeNi@WC-NCL, which possess a highly porous structure and large specific surface area. By modulating the electronic effects of both the FeNi alloy and WC, the optimal NiFe@WC-NCL catalyst presents excellent performance with an onset potential of 1.38 V (vs. RHE) and an overpotential of only 279 mV (vs. RHE) at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 towards OER. Moreover, NiFe@WC-NCL exhibits excellent durability after 2000 cycles with a slight overpotential decrease of only 11 mV. Both the property and stability of the proposed catalyst surpass the benchmark RuO2 catalyst, providing great potential as an alternative to precious metal catalysts for the OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000806493400002

Herein, surfactant-free cuboidal MnCo2O4 (C-MCO) was synthesized in situ over FTO by a green and simple synthetic protocol. Stable and good ohmic contact between C-MCO and the substrate ensures efficient transfer of the charge carrier at their interface. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets coupled with C-MCO provides a surface for easy deposition of the co-catalyst, making active sites easily available and accessible for enhanced OER activity. The surface-modified C-MCO/h-BN electrode shows a Tafel slope value of 66 mV/dec with an overpotential of 240 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). C-MCO/h-BN displays similar to 2.8-fold enhancement in turnover frequency compared to its pristine counterpart, with a faradaic yield of 97%. This study can be used for large-scale clean energy production owing to its low-cost, efficient, eco-friendly, and long-term stability of the C-MCO/h-BN electrocatalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000745110100001

However, the main drawback of NF is that its ligaments are very smooth, and thus the surface area is relatively low. In this work, we propose a novel strategy, oxidization and reduction process, in situ to construct micron/nano pores on the ligaments of commercial NF to fabricate a typical hierarchical porous architecture. This process is simple and green, avoiding the use of sacrificial materials. Furthermore, MnO2 is coated on the micron/nano-porous Ni foam (MPNF) to construct an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrode through pulse electrodeposition. The designed MPNF-MnO2 electrode presents enhanced OER electrocatalysis activity with a low overpotential of 363.5 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline solution, which is 66.4 mV lower than that of the NF-MnO2 electrode in the same operating conditions. Furthermore, the porous and wrinkled structures of the MPNF also improve the mechanical integrity of the electrode, resulting in super-long stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2296-8016			WOS:000710936300001

By CV measurements with graphite and platinum (anodic polarization) and tungsten (cathodic polarization) working electrodes, the decomposition potential of LiCland electrochemical potential of the reaction Pt+ 2LiCl -> PtCl2 + 2Li were determined as 3.46V and 3.14V respectively. Three anodic reactions viz. (i) formation of Li2PtO3, (ii) oxygen evolution and (iii) platinum dissolution were found to occur on the platinum electrode in Li2O containing LiCl melts. The Li2PtO3 formation was found to be a fast reaction with diffusion coefficient of O2- ions in the melt as 4.53 x 10-7cm(2)/s. Oxygen evolution showed very high current densities when compared to that of the surface area limiting Li2PtO3 formation. The platinum electrode surface was corroded by formation of Li2PtO3 when the electrode was polarized for a longer period of time in the melt. The results of the study indicated that LiCl-2 wt.% Li2O melt could be the optimum electrolyte composition in the electro-reduction of uranium oxide with platinum anode. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The prediction results indicates that the stoichiometric Ag/SnO2 interface dominates in internal oxidation of Ag-3at.%Sn alloy in air atmosphere at 973 K, while a gradient structures with both O-rich and stoichiometric interface were formed at the condition of 3 atm pure oxygen atmosphere at 873 K.

J	Hu, Mian; Ye, Zhiheng; Zhang, Qi; Xue, Qiping; Li, Zhibin; Wang, Junliang; Pan, Zhiyan								Towards understanding the chemical reactions between KOH and oxygen-containing groups during KOH-catalyzed pyrolysis of biomass								ENERGY				245						123286	10.1016/j.energy.2022.123286				APR 15 2022	2022	In this study, the effect of KOH/biomass ratios and pyrolysis temperatures on products distribution, the evolution of oxygen-containing groups in pyrolytic tri-state products and the possible chemical reactions between oxygen-containing groups and KOH were investigated. The results indicated that KOH can react with oxygen-containing groups in biomass to facilitate gas generation at lower ratios (<= 1:2) or higher temperature (similar to 800 degrees C). When at higher ratios (>1:2) and 600 degrees C, KOH has an inhibitory effect on gas production. With a significant decreased in the oxygen-containing species and acids, the phenols and hydrocarbons became the main species in bio-oil. Moreover, KOH facilitates methoxyphenol conversion and has high selectivity for alkyl phenol generation. For biochar, at lower ratios (< 1:2), K can attack the oxygen sites of phenolic hydroxyl groups, forming dangling bonds and promoting the formation of aromatic rings with anhydride groups. However, at higher ratios (>1:2), the oxygen-containing groups on the surface of biochar gradually changed from anhydride groups to quinone groups, and finally form a biochar with large aromatic ring and rich in quinone groups. As analyzed above, a possible chemical reaction between KOH and oxygen-containing groups during KOH-catalyzed pyrolysis of biomass was proposed. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

In this research, a cobalt borophosphate crystalline compound consisting of phosphate and borate anions was synthesized with a solid-state reaction. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray Photoelectron (XPS) was employed to investigate the structure, composition, and morphology of Co3BPO7. Electmcatalytic performances of the catalyst towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have been investigated on nickel foam (NF) electrode in 1.0 M KOH (pH 13.6) by linear sweep voltammetry, chmnopotentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. For OER, the catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 130 mV dec(-1), which is comparable to that of the benchmark RuO2 electrocatalyst, and 220 mV overpotential for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 147 mV dec(-1) for HER process. Long-term chronoamperometry and multiple cyclic voltammetric experiments indicate the catalyst is stable throughout both HER and OER processes. Electrochemical experiments and characterization studies performed on the pristine and post-catalytic electrode indicate that the catalyst is robust under alkaline electrocatalytic conditions (pH 13.6).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000861684400004

Herein, a facile "MOF-in situ-leaching and confined-growth-MOF" strategy is developed to construct a breathable trifunctional electrocatalyst based on N-doped graphitic carbon with Co nanoparticles spatially confined in an inherited honeycomb-like macroporous structure (denoted as Co@HMNC). The unique orderly arranged macroporous channels and the "ships in a bottle" confinement effect jointly expedite the triple transport, endowing the catalysts with fast reaction kinetics.

However, most photocatalysts that have been investigated fulfil some but not all of these requirements, resulting in bottle necks in the process and a low overall solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. Here, we carry out a comprehensive investigation of the photocatalytic water-splitting performance of monolayer Janus platinum dichalcogenide materials, i.e., PtSSe, PtSTe and PtSeTe, using first-principles and GW calculations. It is found that the narrow-band gap PtSTe and PtSeTe materials exhibit excellent solar light absorption, covering a wide range of the solar spectrum, down to the near-infrared region. The unique feature of a strong internal vertical electric field in the Janus platinum dichalcogenides polarizes the electrons and holes in opposite chalcogen layers, leading to a reduced electron-hole recombination rate. These, combined with the large difference in the electron and hole mobilities, allow efficient carrier generation and transfer. The overpotential of PtSTe is 0.75 and 0.22 eV for the oxygen-evolution reaction and the hydrogen-evolution reaction, respectively, and its solar-to-hydrogen efficiency can reach up to 24.7%, breaking the conventional theoretical limit. Overall, our computations not only predict the promising photocatalytic application potential for water splitting of Janus platinum dichalcogenides but also suggest a valuable strategy for optimizing and improving the photocatalytic performance by utilizing the intrinsic polarizations of 2D polar materials.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000700546900001

Herein, carbon nanotube interconnected NiCo layered double hydroxide rhombic dodecahedral nanocages (NiCo-LDH RDC@CNTs) were developed here with the assistance of a feasible zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) self-sacrificing template strategy as a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst. Profited by the well-fined rhombic dodecahedral nanocage architecture, CNTs' interconnected characteristic and structural feature of the vertically aligned nanosheets, the as-synthesized NiCo-LDH RDC@CNTs integrated large exposed active surface areas, enhanced electron transfer capacity and multidimensional mass diffusion channels, and thereby collaboratively afforded the remarkable electrocatalytic performance of the OER. Specifically, the designed NiCo-LDH RDC@CNTs exhibited a distinguished OER activity, which only required a low overpotential of 255 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER. For the stability, no obvious current attenuation was detected, even after continuous operation for more than 27 h. We certainly believe that the current extraordinary OER activity combined with the robust stability of NiCo-LDH RDC@CNTs enables it to be a great candidate electrocatalyst for economical and sustainable energy-related devices.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2079-4991		WOS:000774440000001	35335828

Moreover, the O,Mo-CoP/NFs-2 nanoflowers exhibited efficient overall water splitting as low as 1.66 V for 100 mA cm(-2) with outstanding long-term stability, even superior to the commercial Pt-C/NF and RuO2/NF system. The superior activity of self-supported O,Mo-CoP/NFs-2 nanoflowers was attributed to the synergistic effect of O and Mo dual doping, which promoted its intrinsic catalytic activity, and its particular morphology of self-supported 3D hierarchical nanoflowers, which could expose more catalytic sites and enable facile gas escape. Moreover, the device of overall water splitting can be powered by a single AA battery or a 1.5 V solar cell, showing its great potential for practical applications.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2196-0216			WOS:000588053800001

The results demonstrated that the fabricated electrocatalysts by PPE show more desirable electrocatalytic performance than constant potential electrodeposition method (CPE). The electrodeposited NiSe nanostructures with large electrochemically active surface area of 2965 on the nickel foam (NF) at the frequency of 0.01 Hz exhibited high electrocatalytic activity for HER and OER. It delivers the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at the overpotential of 65 mV for HER and 100 mA/cm(2) at 306 mV for OER in 1 M KOH. In addition, the Tafel slope for HER and OER was 89 and 61 mV/dec respectively. Morphological stability of NiSe nanostructure catalyst leads to an increase the electrocatalytic stability during long-term electrolysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Developing efficient non-noble-metal catalysts for ORR has attracted extended interests, but still remains a great challenge. Herein, an efficient catalysts consisting of Co3O4@Co nanoparticles embedded in N-rich mesoporous carbon matrix is developed by the carbonization of Co-containing zeolitic imidazolate framework precursor. The derived matrix exhibits outstanding catalytic activity with onset potential of 0.97 V vs. RHE, half-wave potential of 0.88 V vs. RHE, and good catalytic durability when tested with the rotation speed of 1600 rpm. Carbinization under NH3 introduces extra elemental N, which subsequently enhances the limiting current densities. This study provides insight into the rational design of highly active ORR catalysts.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000403919900003

The exploration for a non-noble metal catalyst for energy conversion to replace rare and expensive noble metals is fully necessary. Herein, a novel hierarchical Cu and Co-decorated CuO@Co3O4 nanorod-thorns structure is generated on the Cu foam (denoted as Cu/CuO@Co/Co3O4) and utilized as an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The Cu/CuO@Co/Co3O4-300 electrode displays low overpotentials for HER (82 mV) electrocatalytic performance at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 and low Tafel slopes of 48 mV dec-1 are also achieved. Impressively, Cu/CuO@Co/Co3O4-30 0 can consecutively generate H2 with of its initial performance after 35 h in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Meanwhile, the electrochemical performance of Cu/CuO@Co/Co3O4-300 is superior or considerable to most of reported on Cubased water splitting electrocatalysts. As evidenced, reduction of oxides to metal for electrocatalysts can remarkably raise the catalytic activities for hydrogen evolution reaction.

Herein, two types of -MnO2 nanorods were prepared under hydrothermal treatment at 150 degrees C for 0.5 h (MnO2-150-0.5) or 120 degrees C for 12 h (MnO2-120-12), then supported on N-doped ketjenblack carbon (N-KB) as bi-functional ORR/OER catalysts. Their electrocatalytic activities toward ORR and OER were investigated systematically. As a result, MnO2-150-0.5/N-KB displays superior ORR catalytic activity, with much more positive half-wave potential and much larger limiting current density (0.76 V and 6.0 mA cm(-2)), comparable to those of 20 wt. % Pt/C (0.82 V and 5.10 mA cm(-2)). MnO2-150-0.5/N-KB also shows high electron transfer number (3.863.97) and low yield of peroxides (1-7%) during ORR process in the whole potential range of 0-1.0 V (vs. RHE). Meanwhile, the MnO2-150-0.5/N-KB also exhibits better OER activity with low overpotential, comparable to IrO2/N-KB. The excellent electrocatalytic activity of MnO2-150-0.5/N-KB can be attributed to the synergistic effect, relatively smaller size, higher amount of Mn3+, and low charge transfer resistance. This work offers a new strategy for scalable preparation of more efficient and cost-effective -MnO2 bi-functional oxygen catalysts.									34	0	0	0	1	0	34			2073-4344			WOS:000435186400015

Screening energy-saving, low-cost, and highly active catalysts efficiently, however, is still a grand challenge due to the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrolyzing water. Herein, we present a single atomic Mn site anchored on a boron nitrogen co-doped carbon nanotube array (Mn-SA/BNC), which is perfectly combined with the hydrazine electrooxidation reaction (HzOR) boosted water electrolysis concept. The obtained catalyst achieves 51 mV overpotential at the current density of -10 mA cm(-2) for the cathodic HER and 132 mV versus the reversible hydrogen electrode for HzOR, respectively. Besides, in a two-electrode overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) system, the Mn-SA/BNC catalyst only needs a cell voltage of only 0.41 V to output 10 mA cm(-1), with strong durability and nearly 100% faradaic efficiency for H-2 production. This work highlights a low-cost and high-efficiency energy-saving H-2 production pathway.									14	1	0	0	1	0	14			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000628024200004	33650623

It is known that a hierarchical structure can effectively increase the catalytic area and improve the charge transfer of the OER electrocatalyst, while Ni foam is known to be an advantageous substrate. Therefore, in this work a hierarchical Mn-CoO@Fe(OH)(3) nanofiber array was prepared by the hydrothermal reaction and immersion at room temperature, and X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy measurements were carried out to characterize the microstructure of the nanofiber array. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to analyze the valence states of the array, demonstrating the successful synthesis of the Mn-CoO@Fe(OH)(3) nanofiber. As the catalyst for OER, the Mn-CoO@Fe(OH)(3) nanofiber array showed a low overpotential of 195 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) as well as high stability (80 h) in the durability test. This work demonstrates the feasibility of the design of hierarchical nanostructure electrodes with high electrochemical performance for catalytic reactions and various battery applications.

In this work, we report the electrocatalytic activity of Pd nanoparticles dispersed on CeO2/N, S-rGO (where N, S-rGO represents nitrogen and sulfur-doped reduced graphene oxide). The CeO2/N, S-rGO and Pd nanoparticles were synthesized by hydrothermal and chemical reduction methods, respectively. Electrochemical measurements towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) show a high electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst. Among the synthesized electrocatalysts Pd/CeO2/N, S-rGO exhibits lower overpotential (75 mV and 240 mV) at 10 mA/cm(2) and lower Tafel slope value (44 mV/dec and 42 mV/dec) for HER and OER, respectively. The chronoamperometric and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of the electrocatalyst shows a negligible decrease in the current density for twelve hours and a minor change in the polarization curve after 10,000 cycles, respectively. The high electrocatalytic activity and superior stability of the synthesized electrocatalyst could be attributed to the synergetic effect between Pd nanoparticles and CeO2/N, S-rGO support. This work demonstrates a facile way to develop effective and stable electrocatalysts by exploiting the Pd/Metal oxide interface.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000640745600002

Nevertheless, in terms of single use of BP as a catalyst, the inherent instability and poor conductivity of BP often limit further improvement of OER catalytic performance. Herein, we report a method using mechanical shear force to fully mix the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and red phosphorus powder (RP) to obtain a hybrid dimensional (RP-BP/CNTs) heterostructured metal-free electrocatalyst with excellent OER performance in alkaline media. During the ball milling process, some RP is transformed into BP due to shear stress and high-temperature in-situ phase transformation. Meantime, a large number of defects in CNTs cut by ball milling combine with the lone pair of BP to form a P-C bond, resulting in a heterojunction structure. By rational interface engineering, the hybridisation of RP-BP and CNTs improves the electroconductivity and has excellent durability. The results demonstrate that RPBP/CNTs heterostructure shows good OER performance with a low overpotential of 263 mV vs. RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), lower than that of commercial RuO2 (310 mV vs. RHE, 10 mA cm(-2)). The small Tafel slope indicates that the catalyst has higher catalytic performance, while the stable structure ensures its long-term durability.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2452-2139			WOS:000630872800001

The inherited excellent electrocatalytic activity of the CuGeO3/graphene composites leads to lower overpotentials and more stable cycling performance of Li-O-2 cells than CuGeO3 nanowires and graphene. The relationships between CuGeO3 nanowires and graphene are studied for the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution activity in both aqueous and nonaqueous solutions, and the electrocatalytic activity is improved by manipulating the redox pair and sp3/sp2 via surface chemical modification.									32	1	0	0	3	0	32			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000454397200001

This work reports a rationally designed and innovatively fabricated 3D core-shell dendritically porous OER catalyst that exhibits outstanding and highly reproducible performance. The porous superstructure provides not only substantially enhanced loading capacity of electrochemical catalysts, but also easy access of electrolyte to active catalysts. With a facile and designed sulfurization process followed by anodization, core-shell (FeCoNi)OOH@dendritic foam can be obtained and exhibits a remarkably low overpotential of 204.4 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which are among the best of the reported FeCoNi OER catalysts. Such value is also highly reproducible and stable with over 18 h operation time. This excellent performance could be attributed to the synergism of trimetal chemistry, the unique structure with metal/metal sulfide as the conductive core and (oxy)hydroxide catalysts as the active shell, and the enhanced superstructural surface area. This work points toward a synergistic way based on rational design and innovative fabrication for creating scalable, stable, low-cost, and high-performance OER catalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2196-7350			WOS:000541702600001

Electrolysis technology can provide flexibility to grid management by converting electricity to hydrogen. Alkaline electrolysis has been recognized as established technology and utilized in industry for over 100 years. However, high overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline water electrolysis reduces the overall efficiency and therefore requires the development of anode catalyst. In this study, Raney Ni-Zn-Fe electrode was prepared by electroplating and the electrode characteristics was studied by varying electroplating parameters like electrodeposition time, current density and substrate. The prepared Raney Ni-Zn-Fe electrode was electrochemically evaluated using linear sweep voltammetry. Physical and chemical analysis were conducted by scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive spectrometer, and X-ray diffraction. The plating time did not changed the morphology and composition of the electrode surface and showed a little effect on overpotential reduction. As the plating current density increased, Fe content on the surface increased and cauliflower-like structure appeared on the electrode surface. In particular, the overpotential of the electrode, which was prepared at the plating current density of 320 mA/cm2, has showed the lowest value of 268 mV at 50 mA/cm2. There was no distinguishable overpotential difference between the type of substrate for the electrodes prepared at 80 mA/cm2.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1738-7264			KJD:ART002559229

In this work, a highly active and stable, meso-macro hierarchical porous Ni3S4 architecture, enriched in Ni3+ is designed as an advanced electrocatalyst for OER. The obtained Ni3S4 architectures exhibit a relatively low overpotential of 257 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 300 mV at 50 mA cm(-2). Additionally, this Ni3S4 catalyst has excellent long-term stability (no degradation after 300 h at 50 mA cm(-2)). The outstanding OER performance is due to the high concentration of Ni3+ and the meso-macro hierarchical porous structure. The presence of Ni3+ enhances the chemisorption of OH-, which facilitates electron transfer to the surface during OER. The hierarchical porosity increases the number of exposed active sites, and facilitates mass transport. A water-splitting electrolyzer using the prepared Ni3S4 as the anode catalyst and Pt/C as the cathode catalyst achieves a low cell voltage of 1.51 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Therefore, this work provides a new strategy for the rational design of highly active OER electrocatalysts with high valence Ni3+ and hierarchical porous architectures.									196	12	0	0	8	0	196			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000471330500022

Here, an atomically thin low-crystallinity Fe-Mn-O hybrid nanosheet grown on carbon cloth (Fe-Mn-O NS/CC) is successfully synthetized as an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst. The synthesis strategy involves a facile reflux reaction and subsequent low-temperature calcination process, and the morphology and composition of hybrid nanosheets can be tailored conveniently. The defect-rich Fe-Mn-O ultrathin nanosheet with uniform element distribution enables exposure of more catalytic active sites; moreover, the atomic-scale synergistic action of Mn and Fe oxide contributes to an enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity. Therefore, the optimized Fe-Mn-O hybrid nanosheets, with lateral sizes of about 100-600 nm and approximate to 1.4 nm in thickness, enable a low onset potential of 1.46 V, low overpotential of 273 mV for current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 63.9 mV dec(-1), and superior durability, which are superior to that of individual MnO2 and FeOOH electrode, and even outperforming most reported MnO2-based electrocatalysts.									128	6	0	0	4	0	128			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000442205200016

The challenges of preparation of the metal compound include the complexity of the synthesis process and difficulty of precise control of the reaction conditions. Herein, we report an in situ synthesis of nanoparticles via a high-temperature pulse method where the bulk material acts as the precursor. During the process of rapid heating and cooling, swift melting, anchoring, and recrystallization occur, resulting in the generation of high-purity nanoparticles. In our work, the cobalt boride. (Co2B) nanoparticles with a diameter of 10-20 nm uniformly anchored on the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets were successfully prepared using the high temperature pulse method. The as-prepared Co2B/rGO composite displayed remarkable electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We also prepared molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanoparticles, thereby demonstrating that the high-temperature pulse is a universal method to synthesize ultrafine metal compound nanoparticles.									19	2	0	0	0	0	19			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000411043500094	28771364

However, the local electronic/chemical environment on graphene surface is significantly influenced and can be controlled by doping with foreign atoms, which will contribute to its improved catalytic performance. Henceforth, different N-doping formats, diverse N distributions and concentrations, as well as the edge effect are investigated on the basis of density functional theory, to discover the ideal N-doping condition for high OER behavior. By analyzing the free-energy-change diagrams, adsorbed interactions of reactant intermediates, electrostatic potential surfaces, and other obtained data, it is suggested that graphitic N with low doping concentration and N atoms distributed near edge sites is the ideal candidate for high OER activity, which is efficient as a carbon-based electrocatalyst for water splitting and metal-air batteries applications.									36	1	0	0	1	0	36			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000395799000017

The results obtained in this work suggest a correlation of crystal structure with ORR and OER activity. for LaNiO3-delta. LaNiO3-delta perovskites with different crystal structure were obtained by heating at different temperatures, e g, 400, 600, and 800 degrees C followed by quenching into room temperature. Cubic structure (relative to rhombohedral) leads to higher ORR and OER activity as well as enhanced bi-functional electrocatalytic activity e.g, lower difference in potential between the ORR at -3 mA cm(-2) and OER at 5 mA cm(-2) (Delta E). Therefore, this work shows the possibility to adjust bi-functional activity through a simple process. this correlation may also extend to other perovskite oxide systems.									148	3	0	0	3	0	149			1948-7185			WOS:000326127300035

However, the fundamental principles and mechanisms are not fully understood. This research aims to systematically investigate the effects of cation substitution in spinel cobaltites derived from mixed-metal-organic frameworks on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Among the obtained ACo(2)O(4) catalysts, FeCo2O4 showed excellent OER performance with a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) at an overpotential of 164 mV in alkaline media. Both theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that the Fe substitution in the crystal lattice of ACo(2)O(4) can significantly accelerate charge transfer, thereby achieving enhanced electrochemical properties. The crystal field of spinel ACo(2)O(4), which determines the valence states of cations A, is identified as the key factor to dictate the OER performance of these spinel cobaltites.

Electrocatalytic decarboxylation of carboxylic acids over RuO2 and Pt nanoparticles								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				305						121060	10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.121060				MAY 15 2022	2022	We report electrocatalytic decarboxylation (ECDX) of valeric acid into paraffins, olefins, and alcohols via (non-) Kolbe electrolysis on electrodes with RuO2 and Pt nanoparticles (NPs) as a greener alternative to thermocatalytic decarboxylation. The turnover frequency of ECDX increases, while the specific activity peaks as RuO2 NP size increases. These opposing trends make the particle size of similar to 12 nm the optimum size for ECDX on RuO2. Bulk Pt was active for ECDX, while Pt NPs were only active for the oxygen evolution reaction under our conditions. ECDX current efficiency remained constant in the studied potential range on RuO2 NPs. Esterification was the favored reaction at 2.5 V vs. RHE; however, Kolbe electrolysis was the favored reaction at the expense of the esterification at 4.5 V vs. RHE. This work highlights the performance of nanostructured materials as an alternative to bulk materials as anodes for oxidative upgrading of carboxylic acids.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000783031100002

The parameters of electrode preparation, including the heat treatment temperature and CeO(2) doping content, were optimized. The morphology and composition of the anode surface were characterized by SEM and XRD, respectively. Electrocatalytic activity of these electrodes in 1.0 mol.L(-1) KOH solution were studied by means of open-circuit potential (E(oc)), cyclic voltammetry (CV), voltammetric charge (q*) and polarization curve. The results show that the preparation temperature influenced electrode surface morphology greatly, and the optimal temperature was 400 degrees C. The CeO(2) of appropriate content could increase the active surface area, reduce the grain size and enhance the electrical conductivity of the electrodes, which was in favor of catalytic reactions and redox transition from Ru(III) to Ru(IV). The anodic overpotential for oxygen evolution was decreased by 60 mV and thus the activity of oxygen evolution was improved.

However, since AEM water electrolysis technology is in the early stages of development, it is necessary to develop research on AEM, ionomers, electrode supports and catalysts, which are key elements of AEM water electrolysis. Among them, current research in the field of catalysts is being studied to apply a previously developed half-cell catalyst for alkali to the AEM system, and the applied catalyst has disadvantages of low activity and durability. Therefore, this review presented a catalyst synthesis technique that promoted oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using a non-noble metal-based catalyst in an alkaline medium.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1229-1935			WOS:000811854300002

In this work, two new donor-acceptor-based redox-active conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) (TAPA-OPE-mix and TAPA-OPE-gly) are synthesized through Schiff base condensation reaction using a microwave synthesizer. Notably, the asymmetric and symmetric bola-amphiphilic nature of the OPE struts results in distinct nanostructuring and morphologies in the CMPs. Interestingly, both CMPs show impressive heterogeneous catalytic activity toward electrochemical O-2 reduction and photocatalytic H-2 evolution reactions, and therefore, act as bimodal electro- and photocatalytic porous organic materials. Furthermore, the redox-active property of the CMPs is exploited for in situ generation and stabilization of platinum nanoparticles (Pt), and these Pt@CMPs exhibit significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000521630700021	31868270

Transition metal oxides and phosphides have recently been demonstrated to be promising and cost-effective electrocatalysts due to their distinct surface properties and good conductivity. Herein, we have synthesized a new microporous organic-inorganic hybrid nickel phosphonate (NiPPA) material under hydrothermal reaction condition without the use of structure directing agent. The microporous NiPPA material can be converted to N, P-codoped nickel oxide (NP/NiO) and N, O-codoped nickel phosphide (NO/NiP) following pyrolysis under air and nitrogen atmospheres, respectively. These high surface area materials are subsequently explored as electrocatalysts towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Among the three catalysts, NP/NiO exhibits the highest electrocatalytic activity for OER with an overpotential of 332 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 65.6 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH solution. Furthermore, the as-prepared NP/NiO catalyst displays an outstanding stability over a period of 15 h, suggesting the high durability of this catalyst for OER.									40	1	0	0	3	0	40			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000626512400003

The as-prepared Ni-MoCx/C supported Pt (10 wt%) electrocatalyst (10Pt/Ni-MoCx/C) was synthesized through a microwave-assisted reduction method and 10Pt/Ni-Moc(x)/C exhibited high electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation, oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions. Results showed that 10Pt/Ni-MoCx/C electrocatalyst had better electrocatalytic activity and stability performance than 20 wt% Pt/C (20Pt/C) electrocatalyst. Among them, the electrochemical surface area of 10Pt/Ni-MoCx/C reached 68.4 m(2) g(-1), which was higher than that of 20Pt/C (63.2 m(2) g(-1)). The enhanced stability and activity of 10Pt/Ni-MoCx/C electrocatalyst were attributed to: (1) an anchoring effect of Ni and MoCx formed during carbonthermal reduction process; (2) a synergistic effect among Pt, Ni, MoOx and MoCx. These findings indicated that 10Pt/Ni-MoCx/C was a promising electrocatalyst for direct methanol fuel cells. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The alkaline HER is particularly challenging as it involves a two-step reaction of water dissociation and hydrogen recombination, for which platinum-based binary catalysts have shown promising activity. In this work, we synthesized high performance platinum-nickel-cobalt alloy nanocatalysts for the alkaline HER through a simple synthetic route. This ternary nanostructure with a Cartesian-coordinate-like hexapod shape could be prepared by a one-step formation of core-dual shell Pt@Ni@Co nanostructures followed by a selective removal of the Ni@Co shell. The cobalt precursor brings about a significant impact on the control of size and shape of the nanostructure. The PtNiCo nanohexapods showed a superior alkaline HER activity to Pt/C and binary PtNi hexapods, with 10 times greater specific activity than Pt/C. In addition, the PtNiCo nanohexapods demonstrated excellent activity and durability for the oxygen reduction reaction in acidic media.									100	7	0	0	3	0	100			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000384531600032	27714051

Here we report a facile one-step collaborative growth method to directly construct NiS-MoS2 hetero-nanosheet arrays on carbon cloth (NiS-MoS2 HNSAs/CC) by introducing sodium dodecyl sulfate as a surfactant together with Ni, Mo and S sources. Benefiting from the well-exposed electroactive sites, fast transport of catalysis-relevant species and strong synergistic catalytic effect between NiS and MoS2, the as-prepared NiS-MoS2 HNSAs/CC exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for water splitting in 1 mol L-1 KOH, presenting an overpotential of 106 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction and 203 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction at 10 mA cm(-2), and superior kinetics for them with a Tafel slope of 56.7 and 77.4 mV dec(-1), respectively. Moreover, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.54 V for overall water splitting could be achieved along with an excellent stability for at least 24 h. This simple strategy might also be applied to assemble other kinds of active species on different inert substrates, providing new insight into the design and development of high-performance electrocatalysts and other electrochemical devices.									44	1	0	0	2	0	44			2398-4902			WOS:000476912900015

Herein, a unique trifunctional amorphous iron-borate electrode is developed, which is capable of boosting hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, and oxygen reduction reactions simultaneously. The amorphous iron borate can self-assemble into well-defined nanolattices on electrode surface through a facile hydrothermal process, which possess more active sites and charge transfer pathways. As a result, the asymmetry overall water-splitting cell that adopts the amorphous electrodes as anode and cathode can be driven at 1.56 V with the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is lowest in state-of-the-art catalysts. Moreover, the water-splitting devices can be powered by a two-series-connected amorphous electrode-based zinc-air battery with high stability and Faradic efficiency (96.3%). The result can offer a potential and promising alternative way to develop metal-borate electrode for multifunctional applications.									34	0	0	0	2	0	35			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000451566800008	30264423

Herein, a new strategy, metal-organic framework template-directed fabrication of hierarchically structured Co3O4@X (X = Co3O4, CoS, C, and CoP) electrocatalysts for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is developed, where Co3O4@X are derived from cobalt carbonatehydroxide@zeolitic-imidazolate-framework-67 (CCH@ZIF-67). Unique hierarchical structure and synergistic effect of resulting catalysts endow abundant exposed active sites, facile ion diffusion path, and improved conductivity, being favorable for improving catalytic activity of them. Consequently, these derivatives Co3O4@X reveal highly efficient electrocatalytic performance with long-term durability for the OER, much superior to previously reported cobalt-based catalysts as well as the Ir/C catalyst. Particularly, Co3O4@CoP exhibits the highest electrocatalytic capability with the lower overpotential of 238 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, Co3O4@X can also efficiently catalyze other small molecules through electro-oxidation reaction (e.g., glycerol, methanol, or ethanol). It is expected that the strategy presented here can be extended to the fabrication of other composite electrode materials with hierarchical structures for more efficient water splitting.									195	17	0	0	11	0	197			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000403913400010

Realizing the selective generation of hydrogen and oxygen via water splitting in a single photocatalyst is significant but still a challenge. Herein a layered ferroelectric material Bi3TiNbO9 was synthesized by a modified molten-salt method and solid state method. The exposed facets of the nanosheets synthesized with the modified molten-salt method were {001} and {110}, and the ratio of which can be well-tuned by adjusting the synthesis temperature. Bi3TiNbO9 nanosheets present both hydrogen and oxygen evolution via water splitting under illumination, and the hydrogen generation or oxygen generation can be selectively optimized by simply adjusting the ratio value of {001}/{110} exposed facets. The as-prepared samples with the highest {001} exposed facet displayed the highest hydrogen evolution activity (342.6 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)), while the samples with the highest {110} exposed facet showed the highest oxygen evolution activity (275.2 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)), indicating that the {001} and {110} facets of the Bi3TiNbO9 were the active hydrogen generating facet and the active oxygen generating facet respectively. This research is very instructive in the rational design of highly efficient hydrogen generation or oxygen generation respectively in the similar photocatalyst.									47	3	0	0	6	0	47			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000434829500056

Here we report a novel in situ strategy to embed Co9S8 nanoparticles (NPs) into nitrogen and sulfur codoped hollow porous carbon (Co9S8@N-S-HPC). In this strategy, the ZIF-8 surface is firstly decorated by cobalt thiourea, and then coated with a shell of polymeric resorcinol-formaldehyde, followed by a high temperature pyrolysis treatment. The resulting Co9S8@N-S-HPC shows comparable catalytic activity for ORR compared with commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst and superior long-term stability under alkaline conditions. Simultaneously, Co9S8@N-S-HPC also exhibits an excellent HER activity with low onset overpotential of 68 mV, a small Tafel slope of 78 mV per decade and a long-term durability in alkaline medium. First-principles calculations reveal that Co9S8 particle can anchor in NS-HPC via a Co-S bond and enhance the binding of Co9S8 and N-S-HPC. The N-S-HPC can affect the electronic structure of supported Co9S8 strongly. The combined experimental and theoretical investigation show the outstanding ORR and HER performances of Co9S8@N-S-HPC are attributed to its unique nanostructure and synergistic interactions between Co9S8 NPs and N-S-HPC.									95	8	0	0	5	0	97			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000472697500019

The oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) is activated at voltages as low as 3-4 V with respect to bottom electrode. The degree of bias-induced transformation as quantified by ESM hysteresis loop area increases with applied bias. The variability of electrochemical activity is explored using correlation analysis and the ORR/OER is shown to be activated in grains at relatively low biases, but the final reaction rate is relatively small. At the same time, at grain boundaries, the onset of reaction process corresponds to larger voltages, but limiting reactivity is much higher. The reaction mechanism in ESM of mixed electronic-ionic conductor is further analyzed. These studies both establish the framework for probing bias-dependent electrochemical processes in solids and demonstrate rich spectrum of electrochemical transformations underpinning catalytic activity in cobaltites.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000327479600004

The results show that this strategy assists in generating a 3D interconnected carbon nanosheets network with hierarchical pores and a larger specific surface area through a stencil effect. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results show that the Fe 2p(3/2) and Co 2p(3/2) core-level binding energy (BE) of the FeCo/NPC catalyst exhibits a positive shift compared to monometallic catalysts, which is associated with downshifts of the d-band position of the metal by alloying and weakening of the interaction between oxygenic species and metal surfaces, thereby improving the catalytic activity. The FeCo/NPC catalyst shows excellent electrocatalytic activity for bothoxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution: a high onset potential of 0.92V (vs. RHE), only 10mV difference of half-wave potential comparable with commercial Pt/C (20wt%), a high current retention of 95.7% after stability test of 20000s for ORR and a potential of 1.68V (vs. RHE) for OER at 10mAcm(-2). The high catalytic performance of the FeCo/NPC catalyst and the simplicity of the synthesis method provide a possibility for its practical application in metal-air batteries.									25	1	0	0	0	0	25			2196-0216			WOS:000463752300027

However, to date, there is a lack of effective methods to synthesize bimetallic nanoalloys with controllable metal proportions in the active species of the catalysts prepared by a high-temperature annealing method, leading to inferior catalytic activity and difficulty in identifying the active sites. Here, we synthesize iron (Fe)-cobalt (Co)-based nanoparticles coated with a few layers of amorphous carbon shell (<1 nm) and with Co7Fe3 alloy as the core by facile pyrolysis of a bimetallic Fe-Co-based tartrate, which exhibits excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with a low overpotential of 272 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and good durability in alkaline media. Compared with single-metal Fe/Co tartrate-derived catalysts, a bimetallic Fe-Co tartrate-derived catalyst with Co7Fe3Ox active sites shows higher charge-transfer ability and a lower OER barrier (approximately 285 kJ mol(-)(1)). For the first time, this work demonstrates that Fe-Co-based tartrate complexes can be used as precursors to construct high-performance bimetallic Fe-Co-based nanocomposite catalysts with controllable active sites for electrocatalytic OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2574-0970		WOS:000752894100128

In this research, we fabricate Fe-NiCoP/NiCoP/NF electrocatalyst for OER via the interfacial scaffolding strategy with Prussian-blue-analogue (PBA) followed by low temperature phosphating. The cube-on-sheet multimetallic-TMPs-based nano architecture of Fe-NiCoP/NiCoP/NF exhibits outstanding OER performance, which only requires the overpotential of 201 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and possesses good durability up to 50 h in 1.0 M KOH solution. The superior OER property of Fe-NiCoP/NiCoP/NF is mainly characteristic to the rich composition that optimizes the electronic structure and the cube-on-sheet multimetallic-TMPs-based nanoarchitecture which can facilitate more effective active sites exposure and ultimately promote charge transfer at the same time. This research provides a new strategy for the construction of advanced nanoarrays structure and the improvement of the electrocatalytic performance of polymetallic phosphides, which offers its promising applications especially in energy storage and conversion technology.

Herein, we present our recent endeavor in the engineering of a high-efficiency OER electrocatalyst based on nanoscale nickel phosphide particles compositing with reduced graphene oxide (rGO/Ni2P), derived from a supported metal-organic complex, through self-assembly, followed by low-temperature phosphidation. The desirable architectural and physicochemical properties, featuring a sandwich-like nanosheet morphology, nanoscale Ni2P subunit building blocks, and conductive substrate incorporation, endow the as-synthesized rGO/Ni2P with abundant active sites, facile mass/charge transfer, and good stability against agglomeration. As a result, the rGO/Ni2P nanocomposite manifests advanced OER performance with low overpotential, fast reaction kinetics, and strong durability. Additionally, detailed structural and compositional analysis further reveals that an overlayer of NiOOH is in situ generated on the surface of Ni2P nanoparticles upon anodic polarization, and the derived rGO/Ni2P/NiOOH performs as an actual catalyst to boost the OER process. This work elucidates that fine control over structural architecture and chemistry of the material promises high-performance electrocatalysis and would inspire to develop efficient noble-metal-free OER electrocatalysts derived from transition-metal phosphides.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			2168-0485			WOS:000469304900054

Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) was employed to reveal the strain evolution during the voltammetric cycling in Pt-Ni alloy nanoparticles composed of Pt2Ni3, Pt1Ni1, and Pt3Ni2. Analysis of the 3D strain images using a core-shell model shows that the strain as large as 5% is induced on Pt-rich shells due to Ni dissolution. The composition dependency of the strain on the shells is in excellent agreement with that of the catalytic activity. The present study demonstrates that BCDI enables quantitative determination of the strain on alloy nanoparticles during electrochemical reactions, which provides a means to exploit surface strain to design a wide range of electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000679930400006	34251215

Hindering formation of oxygen vacancies by tuning the electronic structure of catalysts to improve the durability and activity in acidic electrolyte was theoretically effective but rarely reported. Herein we demonstrated rationally tuning electronic structure of RuO2 with introducing W and Er, which significantly increased oxygen vacancy formation energy. The representative W0.2Er0.1Ru0.7O2-delta required a super-low overpotential of 168mV (10mA cm(-)(2)) accompanied with a record stability of 500h in acidic electrolyte. More remarkably, it could operate steadily for 120h (100mA cm(-)(2)) in PEM device. Density functional theory calculations revealed co-doping of W and Er tuned electronic structure of RuO2 by charge redistribution, which significantly prohibited formation of soluble Ru-x>4 and lowered adsorption energies for oxygen intermediates. There is an increasing interest in understanding how defect chemistry can alter material reactivity. Here, authors tune the electronic structure of RuO2 by introducing W and Er dopants that boost acidic oxygen evolution performances by limiting oxygen vacancy formation during catalysis.									73	0	0	0	3	0	73				2041-1723		WOS:000586507600007	33097730

Herein, we proposed a new heterostructure of nanosheets electron depletion|interfacial reaction center|hydroxyl captor, demonstrated as nickel nitride (Ni3N)|nickel phosphide (Ni2P)|black phosphorus (BP). Compared with other catalysts reported for the OER, the Ni3N|Ni2P|BP heterostructure shows superior electrocatalytic performance with an ultralow overpotential of 247 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and high durability in alkaline electrolytes. The high performance of the catalyst results from (i) the superior capability of the hydroxyl groups captured by ultrathin oxide layers on the catalyst surface; (ii) the stable connection between Ni3N and BP via the formation of the Ni2P interface; and (iii) the excellent electron transfer rate due to the metallic nature of Ni3N.									44	3	0	0	1	0	44			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000490235800047

Herein, Ag-decorated vertically aligned MoS2 nanoflakes are developed via magnetron co-sputtering and investigated as electrocatalyst towards OER and ORR. Due to the presence of silver, the catalyst shows more than 1.5 times an increase in the roughness-normalized rate of OER, featuring a very low Tafel slope (58.6 mv dec(-1)), thus suggesting that the catalyst surface favors the thermodynamics of hydroxyl radical (OH center dot) adsorption with the deprotonation steps being the rate-determining steps. The improved performance is attributed to the strong interactions between OOH intermediates and the Ag surface which reduces the activation energy. Rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) analysis shows that the net disk currents on the Ag-MoS2 sample are two times higher at 0.65 V compared to MoS2, demonstrating the co-catalysis effect of silver doping. Based on the rate constant values, Ag-MoS2 proceeds through a mixed 4 electron and a 2 + 2 serial route reduction mechanism, in which the ionized hydrogen peroxide is formed as a mobile intermediate. The presence of silver decreases the electron transfer number and increases the peroxide yield due to the interplay of a 2 + 2 electron reduction pathway. A 2.5-6 times faster conversion rate of peroxide to OH- observed due to the presence of silver, indicating its effective cocatalyst nature. This strategy can help in designing a highly active bifunctional catalyst that has great potential as a viable alternative to precious-metal-based catalysts.									23	2	0	0	0	0	23			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000620327900002

This catalyst consists of cadmium sulfide as the core and nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide as the shell, thus CdS@NiCo-LDH. The advantages of this catalyst are high specific surface area, rapid transfer of electrons, and open channels for the release of gaseous products, which lead to better oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline environments. The use of this catalyst in water decomposition for OER allows current density values of 10, 100, 500, and 1000 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 132, 198, 306, and 309 mV, respectively.

However, OER suffers sluggish kinetics and high overpotential, leading to the increase of overall energy consumption and decrease of the energy efficiency. In this work, high-quality cobalt oxide porous nanotubes (Co3O4-PNTs) are easily obtained by simple self-template approach. One-dimensional (1D) porous structure provides the large specific surface area, enough abundant active atoms and effective mass transfer. In addition, Co3O4-PNTs also own self-stability of 1D architecture, benefitting the their durability for electrocatalytic reaction. Thus, Co3O4-PNTs with optimal annealing temperature and time reveal the attractive alkaline OER performance (Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1) and 323 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2)), which outperform the Co3O4 nanoparticles and benchmark commercial RuO2 nanoparticles. Furthermore, Co3O4-PNTs also exhibit excellent OER durability for least 10 h at the 10 mA cm(-2). Overall, Co3O4-PNTs with low cost can be serve as a highly reactive and economical catalyst for OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000722394900001	34740207

Herein, micropores dominated nitrogen and sulfur codoped carbon (NSC) film is directly growing on conducive carbon fiber paper (CFP) as self-standing air electrode through the electropolymerization of 2-amino-5-mercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole and followed pyrolysis process. NSC film provides abundant active sites, while conducive CFP with 3D macro-networks offers affluent channels for electron and mass transfer. Benefit from the strong interaction between NSC and CFP, the resultant CFP@NSC displays highly catalytic activity for both oxygen reduction (comparable half-wave potential to commercial Pt/C) and oxygen evolution (lower overpotential than commercial IrO2), along with robust stability. As a proof of practical usage, zinc air flow battery with CFP@NSC displays lower charge voltage and higher discharge voltage, compared with commercial Pt/C and IrO2 coated CFP electrode. Importantly, zinc air flow battery also exhibits excellent cycling stability including nearly 100% retention of coulombic efficiency and energy efficiency over 3400 min, representing the most efficient bifunctional oxygen electrode reported so far.									18	2	0	0	1	0	18			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000480422400069

Large-scale ReaxFF MD simulations were performed using the GMD-Reax code and analyzed with the VARxMD code. The breaking of C-alpha/C-beta-O bonds in alpha/beta-O-4 linkages is the dominant pathway to convert the source lignin molecules into smaller fragments. Differences in pyrolyzate evolution and linkage behavior among hardwood, softwood, and kraft lignin can be attributed to different reactions of linkages and their linked monomers induced by their varied oxygen-containing substituents. The consumption evolution of beta-O-4 linkages can be promoted by their active substituents (C-alpha=O and C-alpha-O-4). The conversion of beta-beta_gamma-O-alpha linkages and their linked monomer rings can be accelerated by the C-alpha=O substituent on the beta-beta_gamma-O-alpha linkages and by the substituents of C-alpha-O-4 and OCH3 on the monomer ring. The different evolution profiles of the softwood, hardwood, and kraft lignin models are caused by the differences in the inherent structures (mainly linkage and oxygen-containing functional groups) of lignin from different tree species or isolation methods. Despite distinct differences in the pyrolyzate evolutions and linkage behaviors, the ring substructure evolutions of five- to seven-membered rings are similar for the four lignin models. This work demonstrates a useful alternative approach for investigating the pyrolysis reaction mechanism of lignin from varied sources.									20	2	0	0	1	0	21			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000499741900079

To improve the accessibility of H-2 production, it is necessary to develop an efficient OER catalyst with large surface area, abundant active sites, and good stability, through a low-cost fabrication route. Herein, a facile solution reduction method using NaBH4 as a reductant is developed to prepare iron-cobalt oxide nanosheets (FexCoy-ONSs) with a large specific surface area (up to 261.1 m(2) g(-1)), ultrathin thickness (1.2 nm), and, importantly, abundant oxygen vacancies. The mass activity of Fe1Co1-ONS measured at an overpotential of 350 mV reaches up to 54.9 A g(-1), while its Tafel slope is 36.8 mV dec(-1); both of which are superior to those of commercial RuO2, crystalline Fe1Co1-ONP, and most reported OER catalysts. The excellent OER catalytic activity of Fe1Co1-ONS can be attributed to its specific structure, e.g., ultrathin nanosheets that could facilitate mass diffusion/transport of OH-ions and provide more active sites for OER catalysis, and oxygen vacancies that could improve electronic conductivity and facilitate adsorption of H2O onto nearby Co3+ sites.									890	44	0	0	62	0	893			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000400344800027	28240388

Currently, transition metals-based nanomaterials are promising Ir/Ru-alternative OER electrocatalysts in alkaline media. In this work, we report that in-situ direct growth of atomically thick Fe doped Co3O4 holey nanosheets on nickel foam (Fe-Co3O4 H-NSs/NF) using a simple cyanogel-NaBH4 route, which effectively avoids the tedious post-etch process of nanosheets using plasma, acid, alkali, and so on. Benefiting from ultrathin thickness (1.5 nm), numerous holes, and synergistic effect between Co and Fe atoms, Fe-Co3O4 H-NSs/NF provide a large specific surface area (199.12m(2) g(-1)) and highly active catalytic sites for the OER. Meanwhile, nickel foam substrate with three-dimensionally porous structure and high conductivity accelerates molecules/ions/gases transportation and electron transfer. Consequently, Fe-Co3O4 H-NSs/NF with optimal Co/Fe composition show super electrocatalytic performance for the OER, including an overpotential as small as similar to 204 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density and a small Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1), which is much better than commercial RuO2 nanoparticles.									87	5	0	0	2	0	87			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000450974700027

It is shown, that modification of the CNT surface by oxygen- and nitrogen-containing groups enhances the polarization capacity of the material that characterizes the value of the electrochemically active surface area and lowers the overpotential of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Synthesis of platinum or its alloy (PtCo) on modified CNT allowed establishing the relationship between the activity of these catalysts in the oxygen reaction in aprotic electrolyte and the synthesis conditions and CNT pretreatment. The catalytic effect of modification by platinum consists in a decrease in the ORR overpotential with formation of Li2O2 and its further anodic decomposition and in an increase in the reversibility degree. It is shown that the sites on which Pt nanoparticles are fixed on the CNT surface are oxygen-containing groups. The most probable result of synthesis of PtCo alloy on CNT is the binding of cobalt to nitrogen in nitrogen-containing groups and then to platinum (N-Co-Pt).									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000596277900002

Herein, we report a facile solution-reaction method for preparing an ultrathin (thickness < 2 nm) non precious CoFe-based LDH. Co1Fe0.2 LDH delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a high turnover frequency of 0.082 s(-1) per total 3d metal atoms at a low overpotential of 256 mV. Its mass activity is 277.9 A g(-1) at an overpotential of 300 mV for the OER. Kinetic studies reveal the Co site as the main active center for the OER. The doped Fe lowers the reaction barrier by accelerating the charge-transfer process. Theoretical calculations reveal that the surface Co sites adjacent to Fe atoms are the active centers for the OER and the subsurface Fe dopants excessively weaken the OH* adsorption, thus increasing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. This study can guide the rational design of high-performance CoFe-based LDHs for water splitting. (C) 2022, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

ALKALINE WATER ELECTROLYSIS								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				138	5			1216	1222		10.1149/1.2085762				MAY 1991	1991	The electrochemical activity of reactively deposited cobalt electrodes for H-2 and O2 evolution in 7N KOH solutions at room temperature has been studied. For a reactively deposited Co electrode (Co loading: 93 mg/cm2), the measured over-potentials were 0.34 V for H-2 evolution and 0.39 V for O2 evolution reactions at 1 A/cm2, room temperature. For the same electrodes operating at 1 A/cm2, 80-degrees-C, the overpotentials were found to be 0.264 V for H-2 evolution and 0.285 V for O2 evolution reactions, respectively. More significantly, the effectiveness factor was as high as 70% for H-2 evolution at room temperature. The electrochemical efficiency of the electrodes for both H-2 and O2 evolution reactions in alkaline solutions is proportional to the Co loading in the range studied (23-132 mg/cm2). The high performance of the electrodes is due to the unique porous structure produced by reactive deposition, characterized by high surface area and an interlaced network of fine and coarse pores, and to the very high electrical conductivity of the electrodes. Preliminary attempts to further reduce the activation polarization of the electrodes by the use of nickel cobalt sulfide have shown promise.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0013-4651			WOS:A1991FL28600007

Its practical use, however, is hindered by low power density, unsatisfactory energy efficiency, poor durability, and unstable voltage output. Here, we demonstrate a bifunctional catalyst for oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions based on 3D MXene coupled with nitrogen-doped cobalt selenide nanocrystals (N-CoSe2/3D Ti3C2Tx). Combining experimental characterizations and density functional theory (DFT), the excellent performance is ascribed to enhanced intrinsic activity of CoSe2 due to electron transfer from MXene, N doping which lowers the reaction energy barriers, and 3D MXene architecture which provides large specific surface area, high porosity, and good conductivity. Moreover, Zn-air battery equipped with the developed N-CoSe2/3D MXene as the air cathode exhibits better power/energy densities and long-lasting cycling life (over 500 cycles) compared with that of mixed Pt/C and RuO2.									54	5	0	0	0	0	56				2639-4979		WOS:000519825400007

Today, Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) electrode materials are largely based on rare earth elements RuO2 and IrO2, which are increasingly scarce. Here, we report the discovery of an inexpensive new material based on oxides of cobalt and vanadium that exhibits excellent stability under alkaline water electrolysis conditions and one of the lowest overpotentials reported to date for OER in both neutral and alkaline conditions. This material outperforms IrO2 and a recently discovered cobalt phosphate catalyst in terms of both OER catalytic activity and long-term materials stability, associated with a low overpotential.

While a lot of the attention has been given to improving the performance of one single catalyst material for one specific application, there is still a need to find ways to develop catalysts that can simultaneously be utilized for several chemo- and electrocatalytic processes. In this work, we have surveyed a series of novel, cobalt-based catalyst materials derived from an amorphous MOF in an array of diverged applications. Specifically, we have focused on organic transformations such as oxidative of alkylarenes and benzylic homocoupling reactions as well as several electrocatalytic processes, which directly relate to energy conversion and storage devices, such as oxygen reduction (ORR), oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution (HER) reactions. We have observed that only one material, TAL-2-900, delivered the optimal solution.

Here, this challenge is addressed by the new approach to grow extra-stable nickel cobalt sulfur-selenide (NiCoSxSey) nanosheet catalysts on nickel-cobalt foam (NCF), and the obtained NiCoSxSey affords the low overpotentials of 345 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 427 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 1000 mA cm(-2) (j(1000)). Meanwhile, the NiCoSxSey/NCF also shows the excellent long-term stability for both HER and OER processes driven with j(100) for 100 h and j(500) for 24 h. In addition, the cell voltage assembled with NiCoSxSey/NCF is only 1.84 V at j(500) in 1 M KOH, and the I-t characteristic shows a low decay (< 3 %) after 50 h operation at j(100). The ab-initio simulations reveal that the CoS2-CoSe2, Ni3S2-Ni3Se2 and CoS2-Ni3Se2 interfaces are the active sites for HER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773616600003

Herein, we report on the development of efficient (photo)electrocatalysts based on functionalized MnO(2)systems. Specifically,beta-MnO(2)nanostructures grown by plasma enhanced-chemical vapor deposition on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) or Ni foams were decorated with Co(3)O(4)or Fe(2)O(3)nanoparticles by radio frequency sputtering. Upon functionalization, FTO-supported materials yielded a performance increase with respect to bare MnO2, with current densities at 1.65 Vvs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) up to 3.0 and 3.5 mA/cm(2)in the dark and under simulated sunlight, respectively. On the other hand, the use of highly porous and conductive Ni foam substrates enabled to maximize cooperative interfacial effects between catalyst components. The best performing Fe2O3/MnO(2)system provided a current density of 17.9 mA/cm(2)at 1.65 Vvs. RHE, an overpotential as low as 390 mV, and a Tafel slope of 69 mV/decade under dark conditions, comparing favorably with IrO(2)and RuO(2)benchmarks. Overall, the control of beta-MnO2/substrate interactions and the simultaneous surface property engineering pave the way to an efficient energy generation from abundant natural resources.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000571229000001

In addition, insufficient understanding of the key obstacle of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an obstruction to perceptive design of efficient OER electrocatalysts. In this research, we present synthesis, characterization, and electrochemical evaluation of nickel oxide/nickel sulfide (NiO/NiS) heterostructures and its counterparts nickel oxide (NiO) and nickel sulfide (NiS) as low-cost electrocatalysts for electrochemical water splitting. These electrocatalysts have been characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The NiO/NiS is found to be highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst, which initiates the OER at an amazingly low potential of 1.42 V (vs RHE). The NiO/NiS electrocatalyst provides a current density of 40 mA cm(-2) at 209 mV overpotential for OER in 1.0 M KOH with a Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1), outperforming its counterparts (NiO and NiS) under same electrochemical conditions. These results are better than those of benchmark Ni-based and even noble metal-based electrocatalysts. The continued oxygen generation for several hours with an applied potential of 1.65 V (vs RHE) reveals the long-term stability and activity of NiO/NiS electrocatalyst toward OER. This development provides an attractive non-noble metal, highly efficient, and stable electrocatalyst toward OER.									41	2	0	0	1	0	41			2574-0962			WOS:000469885300067

Herein, we show that the hybridization between multiple HER- and OER-active components is effective for the design and realization of bifunctional electrocatalysts for universal water splitting, i.e., in both acidic and alkaline media. Our strategy relies on the production and characterization of MoSe2 holey flake:Mo2C ball hybrids supported by single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) electrocatalysts. Flakes of MoSe2 are produced through hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-aided liquid phase exfoliation (LPE), which promotes both the exfoliation of the materials and the formation of nanopores in the flakes via chemical etching. The amount of H2O2 in the solvent used for the exfoliation process is optimized to obtain ideal high ratio between edge and basal sites ratio, i.e., high-number of electrocatalytic sites. The hybridization of MoSe2 flakes with commercial ball-like shaped Mo2C crystals facilitates the Volmer reaction, which works in both acidic and alkaline media. In addition, the electrochemical coupling between SWCNTs (as support) and MoSe2:Mo2C hybrids synergistically enhances both HER- and OER-activity of the native components, reaching high eta(10) in acidic and alkaline media (0.049 and 0.089 V for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH, respectively; 0.197 and 0.241 V for OER in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH, respectively). The exploitation of the synergistic effects occurring between multicomponent electrocatalysts, coupled with the production of the electrocatalysts themselves through scalable and cost-effective solution-processed manufacturing techniques, is promising to scale-up the production of H-2 via efficient water splitting for the future energy portfolio.									94	6	0	0	3	0	95			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000462950500044	30835996

The principal reaction occurring at these films is the oxidation/reduction of Ni/Co sites between oxidation states. The sweep rate dependence of this reaction for thin oxide films has demonstrated that if is reversible, while for thicker films, the reaction is diffusion-controlled, with the oxidation process being significantly more inhibited, at least initially, than the reduction reaction. The pH dependence of the principal electrochemical reaction is ca. 75-85 mV per pH unit, indicative of alkali metal involvement in the reaction, which occurs in order to preserve electroneutrality within the film. Tafel plots for the oxygen evolution reaction, at both oxide-free and oxidized electrodes, have slopes of ca. 45 mV, similar to those observed at spinel and Ni oxide electrodes. At an oxide-free electrode, the hydrogen evolution reaction displays a 120-mV Tafel slope, while in the presence of an oxide film, the reaction is completely inhibited at overpotentials up to ca. 300 mV. At more negative potentials, the oxide film appears to be reducible, producing an active high-area electrode.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:A1991GJ14400012

The design of high-efficiency anode materials largely relies on the accurate identification of active species. Here, we transform cheap graphite flake (GP) into phenanthrenequinone (PQ)-like moiety functionalized graphite (MEO-GP) via a mild electrochemical oxidation (MEO) treatment. MEO-GP exhibits superior acidic OER performance with an overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming other oxygen-containing groups of functionalized graphite. The combined results from multiple characterizations reveal that PQ-like moiety is the most active species for acidic OER. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that PQ-like moiety can significantly reduce reaction energy of the rate-determining step (O* to OOH*) of OER by decreasing the adsorption energy of O*, leading to the smallest theoretical overpotential of PQ-like moiety. This work provides molecular insight into the structural transformation of carbon materials under electrooxidation conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2451-9294			WOS:000805846100004

Herein, it is proposed, for the first time, to bond single-atom Co on the surface of single-layered nickel thiophosphate (SA Co NiPS3) forming a uniform unsaturated coordination mode of isolated Co. Theoretical studies indicate that the SA Co NiPS3 electrode possesses a higher intrinsic activity than that of traditional Co alternative-doped NiPS(3)via the enhancement of conductivity and the reduction of energy barriers for bifunctional hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions (HERs/OERs). Notably, a water splitting electrolyzer assembled using SA Co NiPS3 nanosheets as both the cathode and the anode achieves 50 mA cm(-2) at 1.60 V, which outperforms the Pt/C//RuO2 benchmark (1.74 V@50 mA cm(-2)). Besides, this electrocatalyst exhibits an outstanding durability up to 6 days with negligible decay. This work shines fresh light on igniting 2D metal thiophosphate electrocatalytic activity that even surpasses noble-metal-based electrocatalysts via the single-atom engineering.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000729514100001

The influence of the redox mediator species and the concentration of the redox mediator was investigated. The results showed that overall water splitting (H-2/O-2 volume ratio: 2:1) was achieved using Fe2+/Fe3+ as the redox mediator, where the hydrogen and oxygen evolution rates reached 66.8 and 31.8 mu mol.h(-1) (H-2/O(2)volume ratio: 2.1:1), respectively. Avery high concentration of the redox mediator is unable to improve the photocatalytic activity because it is blocked by the carrier mediator redox rate based on the activity of the photocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1000-6818			WOS:000344839800016

Also, the electrolytic decomposition mechanism of ammonia was suggested. The ammonia in the basic solution was oxidized mainly to nitrogen gas through a direct electrolytic reaction accompanying an adsorption at the electrode where the oxygen evolution rarely occurred. The ammonium ion in the neutral and acid solution could be partly decomposed to nitrogen by the CH radicals generated in the condition of oxygen evolution, not by a direct electrode reaction. However, the decomposition rate was much lower than that in the basic condition. The hypochlorite ion generated from the chloride ion by the electrode was very effective for the decomposition of the ammonia and ammonium ion to nitrogen. The ammonium ion by hypochlorite in the neutral condition was changed to NO, as well as to nitrogen. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

NiFe (oxy)hydroxides are presented as strategic materials. Herein, a facile and industrially compatible electrochemical chlorine corrosion strategy for streamlined preparation of high-performance NiFe (oxy)hydroxide nanosheet arrays on commercial Ni/Fe foam not beyond 20 s with NaCl-based metal-free solutions is fathered firstly. An appealing anion competition-adsorption effect in anode-electrolyte interface boundaries is revealed that assumes strong dependence upon anion category and greatly influences chlorine corrosion behavior. We pioneeringly "counterplot" this mechanism to ingeniously convert into treasure a catastrophic chlorine-induced electrode erosion in electrochemical marine/saline water technology. Due to generating a self-consistent chlorine-phobic or -philic interface layer around anode surfaces assembled by anions, this anion-mediated mechanism enables rooting the morphologically/compositionally modulated NiFe hydroxide electrocatalysts onto substrates for the superior industrial current density-level oxygen evolution (over 800 hat 1 A cm(-2) and 216 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) or formulating the chlorine corrosion-immune electrolytes for the stable highly concentrated marine/saline water electrolysis (over 100 h at 0.3 A cm(-2) in the 1 M NaCl + 1 KOH electrolyte). Given the rich anion chemistry, our trailblazing studies set a fresh stage towards the advanced oxygen evolution electrode or stable saline electrolysis for hydrogen production.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000830802900001

Herein, we developed a facile strategy to fabricate a CoNx/NiFeOx/nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-RGO) nanocomposite derived from ternary CoNiFe-layered double hydroxides (LDHs)/polypyrrole (PPy)/RGO precursor for both ORR and OER. Based on the synergistic effect among different components, the resulting CoNx/NiFeOx/N-RGO nanocomposite exhibits not only superior ORR activities (a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.78 V vs. RHE and a J(1600 rpm) of - 4.80 mA cm(-2) at 0.5 V vs. RHE) but also moderate OER activities (an overpotential eta(10 mA cm-2) of 372 mV) in alkaline media. The overall oxygen electrode performance of CoNx/NiFeOx/N-RGO demonstrates the smallest Delta E (E-OER,E- 10 mA cm-2-E-ORR,E- - 3 mA cm-2) value of 0.82 V compared with the benchmark (commercial 20 wt% Pt/C and RuO2/C). Furthermore, CoNx/NiFeOx/N-RGO shows good durability in ORR and OER, making it promising applications for oxygen electrocatalysis.Graphical abstract									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000509152100001

It is a promising strategy to couple highly active precious metals with transition metals as efficient electrocatalysts, which can not only effectively reduce the cost of the preparation procedure, but also greatly improve the performance of catalysts through a synergistic effect. Herein, Ru and Ni nanoparticles embedded within nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (RuNi-NCNFs) are synthesized via a simple electrospinning technology with a subsequent carbonization process. The as-formed RuNi-NCNFs represent excellent Pt-like electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both alkaline and acidic conditions. Furthermore, the RuNi-NCNFs also exhibit an outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an overpotential of 290 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte. Strikingly, owing to both the HER and OER performance, an electrolyzer with RuNi-NCNFs as both the anode and cathode catalysts requires only a cell voltage of 1.564 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline medium, which is lower than the benchmark of Pt/C||RuO2 electrodes. This study opens a novel avenue toward the exploration of high efficient but low-cost electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									105	7	0	0	11	0	106				2198-3844		WOS:000496829800001	31993285

However, a large current density leads to the decline of the reaction kinetics that result from the decrease of local pH, the irreversible redox states of active metal sites, and the structure and composition collapse. Currently, the transition metal layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are proven as efficient alkaline oxygen evolution catalysts and demonstrate promising current density, generally at the scale of 10 mA cm-2 for the potential solar-driven catalysis concerning 10% solar-to-fuels efficiency. However, there is very limited progress in understanding the activity and stability degradation mechanism of LDHs at high current density, for instance above 100 mA cm-2. Here we introduce the current advances in achieving activity enhancement by tuning the composition, structure, and morphology of LDHs and present the degradation mechanism during the electrolysis under oxidative alkaline environments, long-term operation, and voltage fluctuations. Finally, we present the state-of-the-art approaches to stabilize the overall performance of LDHs for water oxidation and provide an outlook in this field.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2574-0962			WOS:000734172700002

To enhance the efficacy of hydrogen production, it is a need to regulate oxygen evolution reaction. An efficient strategy is to construct a competent electrocatalyst with an immense open, active site, highly stable, porous structure, and large surface area. This study employs an inexpensive, facile, and eco-friendly single-step route to fabricate reduced graphene oxide (rGO) layers wrapped in polyaniline (PANI) sheets to achieve the controlled blades morphology. All the synthesized materials are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), BET to examine their structural, morphological, and textural properties. Interestingly, when all the synthesized materials are employed for electrochemical measurements, rGO/PANI nanocomposite exhibits exceptional performance with a low overpotential of 221 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), lower Tafel slope of 37 mV/dec, and also high stability of 20 h. Overall, this work could lead up to the fabrication of innovative blade structured nanocomposite as an efficient electrocatalyst and make it applicable for multiple applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1658-3655			WOS:000729651300001

In recent years, cathode materials for Li-ion batteries have been successfully utilized as OER electrocatalysts, and among them are the lithiated transition-metal phosphates possessing an olivine crystallographic phase. The LiMPO4 (M = Ni, Fe, Co) olivine materials display a potentially suitable overpotential for OER, which can be further enhanced by delithiation. Herein, we report the synthesis of olivine phases with both Li and Na as alkaline ions. The combination of alkaline ions stabilizes the olivine structure with low alkaline ion content, which is instrumental to reach low OER overpotential. The dual alkaline ion approach has been demonstrated for a single transition metal (Co) as well as different combinations of Co-Fe-Ni to form olivine solid solutions of the chemical formula Li(Na)Co(Fe,Ni)PO4. This screening of eight olivine materials revealed a trend in OER activity, and the Li0.6Na0.2Ni0.7Fe0.1PO4 solid solution displays an overpotential as low as 0.28 V versus RHE at 10 mA cm(-2), with a low Tafel slope of 30 mV dec(-1) and a stability tested over 20 h.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000485090400072

However, among current research, either the products are confined to zeolitic imidazolate frameworks or the conversion technologies are limited to complex processes such as chemical vapor deposition. Here, a well-designed sublimation-vapor phase pseudomorphic transformation method is reported to fabricate vertically aligned nanosheet arrays of NiFe-based MOFs with a uniform and controlled thickness, derived from NiFe-layered double hydroxides. Benefiting from the optimized morphology and the high intrinsic activity originating from the synergistic coupling effect of NiFe metal clusters, the as-prepared MOF electrocatalyst displays a superior oxygen evolution reaction performance, requiring an overpotential of 318 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of only 47 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, a string of metal oxide-MOFs are obtained, demonstrating the universality of this strategy. By observing the different stages of transformation, the transformation and growth mechanism of MOF crystals is unveiled for the first time. These findings may inspire the exploration and preparation of more species of MOFs, further broadening their application areas.									38	3	0	0	2	0	38			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000476275800001

However, the active sites and mechanism of OER on Fe-doped nickel (oxy)hydroxide catalysts remain unclear. To gain deeper insights into the role of metal dopants in enhancing OER activity, we explored here the role of Ir-doping in the OER performance of nickel (oxy)hydroxide catalysts, placing particular emphasis on the nature of the active site. Density functional theory calculations with Hubbard U correction revealed that Ir-doping of a beta-NiOOH(001) surface enhanced the electric conductivity while also activating an oxygen site involving three Ni atoms (Ni-3 site) to realize a remarkably low OER overpotential of only eta = 0.46 V, much lower than the overpotential on the oxygen site involving Ir + two Ni atoms (IrNi2 site, eta = 0.77 V) or the oxygen site involving three Ni atoms in pristine beta-NiOOH (eta = 0.66 V). Guided by the computational results, ultrathin Ir-doped Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets were then fabricated through a combination of hydrothermal assembly and liquid exfoliation, with the nanosheets transforming to Ir-doped NiOOH during OER and offering superior activity relative to pristine Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets or a commercial IrO2 catalyst, thereby validating the theoretical predictions. The computational and experimental results thus conclusively demonstrate that Ir-doping and nanosheet engineering are synergistic strategies for tuning the electronic and structural properties of nickel (oxy)hydroxides for improved oxygen evolution electrocatalysis.									34	2	0	0	3	0	34			2155-5435			WOS:000649106200040

Research towards non-noble metals and highly efficient catalysts for the OER has garnered wide attention. Here, we report a series of macrocyclic transition metal phthalocyanines (TMPc) and transition metal phthalocyanine absorbed oxygen or sulfur atoms (TMOPc and TMSPc), natural photocatalytic and electrocatalytic OER single-atom catalysts (SACs). The results demonstrate that they are all semiconductors and extremely stable. Several Pc SACs such as FeOPc and PtPc show excellent high catalytic activity compared with traditional noble metal catalysts and an OER descriptor of the Pc SACs is developed to establish a volcano plot. In particular, FeOPc features a low overpotential of only 0.48 V. Moreover, single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) are employed as the substrate of TMPc to improve the stability of active sites and prevent aggregation. The result indicates that the TMPc single-atom catalysts deposited on SWNTs feature far superior OER catalytic performance. Further studies suggest that the enhancement originates from the change of interaction between the central TM atom and OER intermediates and the variation of charge transfer caused by the SWNT substrates.

Herein, we employed a simple pH-modulated method for in situ growth of FeNi oxyhydroxide ultrathin layers on BiVO(4)photoanodes, resulting in one of the highest currently known PEC activities of 5.8 mA cm(-2)(1.23 V-RHE, AM 1.5 G) accompanied with an excellent stability. More importantly, both comparative experiments and density functional theory (DFT) studies clearly reveal that the selective formation of Bi-O-Fe interfacial bonds mainly contributes the enhanced OER activities, while the construction of V-O-Ni interfacial bonds effectively restrains the dissolution of V(5+)ions and promotes the OER stability. Thereby, the synergy between iron and nickel of FeNi oxyhydroxides significantly improved the PEC water oxidation properties of BiVO(4)photoanodes.									69	2	0	0	7	0	69			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000562780000001	32666681

Properties of these materials depend on the composition, and the method of synthesis, wherein one can traverse from the insulating-end (BN) to the conducting end(graphene). In this article, we present an up-to-date review of the various aspects of borocarbonitrides including synthesis, characterization and properties. Some of the properties have potential applications, typical of them being in gas adsorption and energy devices such as supercapacitors, fuel cells and batteries: Performance of borocarbonitrides as catalysts in the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction is impressive. It is noteworthy that with certain compositions on borocarbonitrides, field-effect transistors can be fabricated.									67	2	0	0	7	0	68			1944-8244			WOS:000403631300014	27797466

Herein, a novel dual-crosslinked hydrogel strategy is proposed to synthesize a new type of carbon aerogel that anchors the iron-cobalt (FeCo) particles as a bifunctional oxygen catalyst. The proposed hydrogel composed of an organic/inorganic network can be easily obtained by initiating sol-gel polymerization of cyanometalates, chitosan and graphene oxide. After pyrolysis, FeCo nanocrystals can be in situ uniformly immobilized within the N-doped "dual-network" carbon aerogels (FeCo/N-DNC) with a robust 3D porous framework. When used as an electrocatalyst, the newly developed FeCo/N-DNC aerogels exhibit a positive onset potential (0.89 V) and half-wave potential (0.81 V) for the ORR and a low overpotential (0.39 V) at 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER, while presenting excellent electrochemical stability after being tested for 10000 s. More importantly, the FeCo/N-DNC driven Zn-air battery reveals a smaller charge/discharge voltage gap, higher power/energy density and better cycling stability than the costlier Pt/C + RuO2 mixture catalyst. Our findings provide a facile and feasible synthetic strategy for obtaining highly active and stable electrocatalysts.									115	8	0	0	8	0	114			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000449699400029	30346015

In this work, we report an edge-enriched (EE) NiFelayer double hydroxide (LDH) nanoarray with abundant coordinatively unsaturated sites, which was synthesized by a structure inheritance strategy using metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheet array as a structuredirecting template. Impressively, the obtained EE-NiFe-LDH nanosheet array offers high electrocatalytic activity in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of only 205 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm-2, outperforming all reported NiFe-LDH nanostructures. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the exposed edges in EE-NiFe-LDH contain abundant iron and oxygen vacancies, which optimized the electronic state of the NiFe-LDH and enhanced the adsorption of oxygenated intermediates, resulting in the high catalytic activity for OER.									30	0	0	0	3	0	30			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000696923100008

The ultra-small FeCoNiIrRu HEA nanoparticles were in situ synthesized in electrospun carbon nano -fibers (CNFs), and it exhibited thermodynamic induced phase evolution, as revealed by in situ characterization. The FeCoNiIrRu/CNFs exhibit exciting oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with low overpotential of 241 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and high mass activity of 205 mA mg(Ir+Ru)(-1). The hysteretic diffusion effect of HEA strongly inhibits the metal leaching and dissolution, leading to the excellent durability. The OER performance can be optimized by changing the metal compositions and calcination temperatures. In situ Raman spectra reveal the formation of OH and superoxo (OO) intermediates on HEA NP surfaces. Theoretically calculation indicate that the electron density redistribution in FeCoNiIrRu NPs occurs from low electronegative elements (Fe, Co, and Ni) to high electronegative ones (Ir, Ru) and it make the Ir more active to simultaneously promote the conversion of *OOH and generation of O-2.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000772829100005

A single-atom catalyst (SAC) may exhibit additional advantages over its nanoparticle counterpart, and already there have been significant advances in the development of bifunctional and trifunctional SACs for HER, ORR, and OER, but great challenges remain for their rational design. Herein, we propose a strategy to realize multifunctional SACs, i.e., modifying unifunctional materials to introduce new active sites on the surface. Specifically, by virtue of the intrinsic excellent HER performance of 1T '-MoS2, we theoretically design multifunctional SACs by anchoring appropriate transition-metal single atoms. Intriguingly, 1T '-MoS2 with supported Co single atoms (Co@MoS2) are demonstrated to be highly active for both OER and ORR with ultralow overpotentials of less than 0.3 V, ascribed to the moderate chemical activity and unique electronic structure of the Co atomic center. Consequently, combining the intrinsic HER activity of 1T '-MoS2, Co@MoS2 is proposed to be promising efficient trifunctional SACs. Further, the phase engineering on SACs is unrevealed and elucidated by comparing the properties of the Co atomic center-supported on 1T '-MoS2 and 1H-MoS2. This work provides a feasible strategy for the design of multifunctional SACs for the renewable and sustainable energy technology and provides an insight into the phase engineering on SACs.									32	1	0	0	1	0	32			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000678735900001	34477744

For oxygen to be produced, two different light reactions must operate simultaneously and in series. Known anaerobic, photosynthetic bacteria contain one or other of these photosystems, but never both. Here, I propose that the two photosystems diverged, in structure and function, from a common ancestor, within a single, continuous, anaerobic lineage. In such cells, living examples of which are predicted, the two photosystems are isoenzymes encoded by orthologous genes under co-ordinated, redox regulatory control. A redox switch responds to defined environmental conditions and selects which set of genes is expressed. In these cells, the two photosystems are thus synthesised at different times. It is further proposed that the origin of oxygen-evolving photosynthesis was a simple mutation that disabled the redox switch, permitting simultaneous expression of the two sets of genes. The two, newly co-existing photosystems became connected by shared electron carriers, allowing generation of electrochemical potential high enough to oxidise water; an inexhaustible supply of reductant; and the selective advantages and pressures of an aerobic world.

The as deposited sample exhibited the best performance, requiring only 171 mV to reach a cathodic current density of 10 mA/cm(2). While the modified films exhibited worse HER performance compared to the as deposited sample, by utilizing extensive X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies, we highlighted the importance of the Mo5+ oxidation state while identifying a previously unreported state within MoOxSy catalysts between Mo4+ and Mo5+.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000731592600001

Herein, we develop a convenient strategy for excavating Prussian blue analogues (PBA) by using sodium sulfide (Na2S) as a delicate digger to modulate the pore size and metal ratio while maintaining the MOFs feature. A subsequent anneal at 300 degrees C removes cyanide groups and induces a collapse of the PBA structure that leads to an increase in the Fe valence and conductivity. These delicate excavated PBA catalysts exhibited high activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a low overpotential of 261mV at 10mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1), which exceeded that obtained for commercial IrO2 in alkaline solution.

In this work, the dense crystalline Fe2O3/amorphous Cu interface was created simultaneously by the combination of solverthermal and annealing processes. The results showed that the ultra-dispersed Cu nanoparticles attributed to the formation of crystalline-amorphous (c-a) interface sites, which facilitated the electron transfer with the tuned electronic structures as well as the favorable adsorption of surface oxygen species.

Multimetallic molecular catalysts, inspired by the natural photosynthetic enzyme, can provide important guidance for catalyst design, but the necessary mechanistic understanding has been elusive. In particular, fundamental transformations for reactive intermediates are difficult to observe, and well-defined molecular models of such species are highly prone to decomposition by intermolecular aggregation. Here, we present a general strategy for stabilization of the molecular cobalt-oxo cubane core (Co4O4) by immobilizing it as part of metal-organic frameworks, thus preventing intermolecular pathways of catalyst decomposition. These materials retain the OER activity and mechanism of the molecular Co4O4 analog yet demonstrate unprecedented long-term stability at pH 14. The organic linkers of the framework allow for chemical fine-tuning of activity and stability and, perhaps most importantly, provide "matrix isolation" that allows for observation and stabilization of intermediates in the water-splitting pathway.									28	1	0	0	2	0	28			0027-8424			WOS:000471039700017	31142656

Through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies, the relative amounts of the various oxidation states of the constituent W are probed with respect to the observed response. It is concluded that an intermediate/optimal number of vacancies, yielding a W6+/(W5+ + W4+) ratio of around 2, would be beneficial for increasing the photocurrent. It is posited that defect engineering combined with optimized band structure modulation could be used for enhanced photocurrent density as well as electrode stability.

Transition metal selenides (TMSes) are potential electrocatalysts for both HER and OER due to the special layered structure, relatively narrow bandgap, unique morphology, and low cost. However, their electrocatalytic HER and OER properties are still far from satisfactory from the standpoint of commercial implementation, especially the catalytic activity and durability for large charge densities in alkaline media. These drawbacks arise from the sluggish water dissociation kinetics, surface oxidization, and structure degradation. In this review, recent advance of TMSes is reviewed comprehensively from the perspectives of HER, OER, and overall water splitting. The electrochemical characteristics of TMSes are discussed and organized according to the metal cation species in single-metal TMSes and multi-metal TMSes.

Herein, we report unique heterostructures comprising cobalt-doped molybdenum-carbide (Co-Mo2C) nanorods encapsulated in nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon shell (NGCS) through one-step pyrolysis of a Co-adenine-MoO3 hybrid. The as-synthesized Co-Mo2C@NGCS heterostructures could be directly used as a catalyst for overall water splitting. Low overpotentials of 161 and 360 mV are needed for the HER and OER to reach 10 mA cm(-2), and the corresponding Tafel slopes are just 60 and 54 mV dec(-1), respectively. Theoretical simulations implied that the synergistic effects between the cobalt heteroatoms, NGCS and Mo2C resulted in the enhanced catalytic performance. Our work not only provides a facile method to construct hybrid electrocatalysts with inexpensive metals, but also gives new insights into the mechanism of the HER and OER in alkaline media.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13				2052-1537		WOS:000513242900015

Spinel transition metal oxides represent a promising catalyst for this reaction, but to data, their catalytic performance is still further improved to satisfy the practical application. Being different from previous nanostructure engineering and hybridization strategy, herein, we reported an anion-cation co-substitution activation of CoMoO4 for OER through a facile solvothermal treatment of FeCo-Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocube in the presence of thiourea and ammonium molybdate. The combination of experimental results with theoretical analysis uncovered that anion-cation cosubstitution allowed the formation of ultrathin porous nanosheet structure with more accessible active sites, enhanced charge and mass transfer ability and optimized adsorption free energy towards oxygen-containing intermediates. As a result, the Fe and S co-substituted CoMoO4 (Fe0.5Co0.5MoO4-xSx) nanoflowers assembled by nanosheets exhibited a drastically improved OER catalytic activity with an overpotential as low as 263 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 87 mV dec(-1), superior to the state-of-the-art IrO2/C and most reported binary transition metal oxide-based electrocatalysts.									35	1	0	0	10	0	35			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000551901000036

Co-based nanomaterials with high catalytic activity, rich abundance and low-cost, are deemed as one of the most promising electrocatalysts for OER. In this review, we present an overview of the recent developed optimization strategies on the advanced engineering and controllable synthesis of Co-based nanomaterials for OER. The mechanism and performance merits for the OER are introduced first, and then the different material optimization concepts and strategies including elemental doping, defect engineering, morphology regulation and control, heterostructure engineering, and single-atom catalyst design, are reviewed to provide a deep insight into the relationship between composition, structure and performance.

An efficient catalyst to electrochemically split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen is of scientific, economic and societal relevance, especially due to the abundance of the starting material, water, and due to the product hydrogen, which is an ideal fuel, due to its highest mass density and clean combustion in air. In this review we focus on the hydrogen evolution reaction, HER, and the oxygen evolution reaction, OER, activity of the electrocatalysts produced by hydrothermal or microemulsion methods. The variation in electrochemical response resulting from the unique shape, composition and nano-architecture is discussed. Broadly, the catalysts were categorized as binary and ternary metal alloys as well as metal chalcogenides and oxides. This compilation would aid in the design of more effective water splitting electrocatalysts as well as in the selection of appropriate candidates for advanced mechanistic studies.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11				2046-2069		WOS:000438939300044	35542152

In this work, an advanced integrated electrode for high-performance electrochemical water oxidation has been designed and fabricated by directly growing binary nickel cobalt layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) nanosheet arrays on nickel foam. Such economical, earth abundant NiCo-LDH nanosheets show excellent OER activity in alkaline medium with an onset overpotential as low as 290 mV, large anodic current density and excellent durability, which makes them comparable to the most active RuO2 catalyst and better than the Pt/C catalyst. The outstanding OER activity of the NiCo-LDH nanosheets can be attributed to their intrinsic layered structure, interconnected nanoarray configuration and unique redox characteristics.

While the development of efficiently stable bifunctional electrocatalysts for the simultaneous production of hydrogen and oxygen remains challenge. Herein, we show a simple multi-step process to prepare porous CuCo2S4/NiCo2S4 core-shell materials directly as bifunctional electrocatalyst electrodes for water splitting. The porous NiCo2S4-sheets combined with CuCo2S4-rods on nickel foam not only can provide for more active sites and higher specific surface area, but also maintain their structural integrity. At a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the CuCo2S4/NiCo2S4 core-shell electrodes deliver lower overpotentials of 271 mV and 206 mV for the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively. The CuCo2S4/NiCo2S4 core-shell electrodes are successfully used as bifunctional electrocatalyst towards overall water splitting and showed overpotential of 1.66 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). A approximate to 97% current density retention for 50 h is represented which illustrates the superior stability of this electrode material and water splitting device. Subsequently, a water splitting process is demonstrated using electrochemical cell based on CuCo2S4/NiCo2S4 core-shell electrodes driven by a perovskite solar cell module. H-2 and O-2 are generated. Our work here demonstrates the possibility of wide application of catalytic material to produce clean energy driven by perovskite solar cell. The work also illustrates the potential applications of CuCo2S4/NiCo2S4 core-shell nanometer materials for clean energy generation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A wide variety of stoichiometric perovskite oxides ABO(3) (A = Ca, Sr, Y, La; B = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) were examined as OER catalysts. The simplest descriptor, e(g), electron number of transition-metal ions at the B-site, was not applicable for OER overpotentials (eta) of the compounds tested in this study. Another descriptor, oxygen 2p band center relative to Fermi energy (epsilon(2p)), was not necessarily adequate for the most part of perovskite oxides. Eventually, a recently proposed descriptor, charge-transfer energy (Delta), displayed a linear relationship with eta most reasonably. Because Delta values were obtained from theoretical calculations, not only by spectroscopic experiments, systematic exploration for a wide range of compounds including hypothetical ones could be allowed. This finding proposes the charge-transfer energy as the most helpful descriptor for the design of perovskite oxide catalysts for the OER.									61	1	0	0	3	0	59			1932-7447			WOS:000453488300011		
J	SHINKAREV, VP; WRAIGHT, CA								KINETIC FACTORS IN THE BICYCLE MODEL OF OXYGEN EVOLUTION BY PHOTOSYSTEM-II								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				38	3			315	321		10.1007/BF00046756				DEC 1993	1993	Flash-induced oxygen evolution and many related processes in thylakoids of oxygenic organisms are modulated with period four by the S-state transitions associated with the oxygen evolving system of Photosystem II (PS II). To analyze these phenomena, we have interpreted the S-state model on the basis of the charge accumulating activities on both sides of PS II - 4 charges on the donor side and 2 charges on the acceptor side. This results in the recognition of two parallel reaction center cycles V and W of PS II function (V.P. Shinkarev and C.A. Wraight (1993) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90: 1834-1838). The description of damping of the period four oscillations is here extended to include kinetic sources of misses in both cycles. Such misses arise in reaction centers (RCs) in which back reaction between P+ and Q(A)(-) occurs before the electron transfer equilibria on the donor and acceptor sides of the RC are reached. These are in addition to misses which are determined by reaction centers (RCs) that are inactive at the time of the flash due to the presence of either P+ or Q(A)(-) according to the electron transfer equilibria on the donor and acceptor sides of the RC. Using known or estimated values of the equilibrium and rate constants for donor and acceptor side reactions of the RC, this provides a natural and quantitatively reasonable description of the flash number dependence of oxygen evolution and other period four modulated processes of PS II. The estimated miss factors are different for both cycles V and W and are dependent on flash number and pH. Estimates based on existing data show that miss factors of the first type (kinetic) are dominant at low pH, while those of the second type (equilibrium) are dominant at high pH.									19	0	0	0	16	0	20			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1993MX41700011	24317985

Here, we propose a facile synthesis of FeNiOOH nanosheets grown on FeNi foam (FNF) by in-situ chemical oxidation as a novel 3D electrode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This FeNiOOH/FNF electrode shows outstanding electrocatalytic performance in alkaline electrolyte, including high OER activity that requires a small overpotential of 252 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), favourable OER kinetics with a low Tafel slope of 36.8 mV dec(-1), and excellent operation stability for at least 50 h. The superior OER properties are resulted from the highly active FeNi-oxyhydroxide species and advantageous nanosheet array structure. This work presents an effective strategy to rationalize self-supporting electrodes consisting of nanostructured arrays on conductive substrates, creating new opportunities to search for more advanced materials towards a sustainable energy future.									87	0	0	0	6	0	87			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000537393800003

Development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for low-cost hydrogen production from water splitting is vital for the real-world practical applications. Herein, a three dimensional hierarchical graphdiyne (GDY)@NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) heterostructured catalyst toward overall water splitting is developed by coupling NiFe LDH and GDY growth on copper foam (CF). The catalyst exhibits high electrocatalytic activities in both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction with overpotentials of 220 mV and 163mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. The Tafel slope for OER is 39.33mV dec(-1), which is much lower than that of the only NiFe LDH/CF with a value of 112mV dec(-1). Thus, the GDY@NiFe LDH/CF heterostructure electrocatalyst leads to an improvement in the overall water splitting activity, with a current density of 20 mAcm(-2) at the voltage of 1.512 V. Density functional theory calculation indicates that the synergetic effects of 3d orbit of transition metal atoms and carbon-carbon triple bonds in GDY are responsible for the bifunctional excellent electrocatalytic activity for overall water splitting.

This framework facilitates efficient exposure of the catalytically active sites and fast diffusion of the electrolyte. Additionally, the well-defined metal/semiconductor heterointerfaces result in an overall electrical conductivity enhancement and promote the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics by lowering the activation energy. Owing to the synergistic effect of Co and CoTe, the Co/CoTe heterostructure displays high electrocatalytic activity for OER, attaining an overpotential of 400 mV to deliver a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 94.1 mV dec(-1), which is superior to pure CoTe and Co counterparts. Furthermore, the Co/CoTe exhibits outstanding durability over 50 h without obvious change in alkaline media. The synthetic strategy reported in this paper provides new insights into the design and preparation of high-performance heterostructured materials of interest in energy-related applications.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000799074500007

However, the slow kinetic process involving four-electron transfer severely limits its reaction efficiency, which in turn limits the overall electrocatalytic hydrolysis efficiency. In order to improve the activity of the electrocatalytic OER, researchers mainly update the catalyst from three aspects, that is, increase the conductivity of the electrocatalyst, and the quantity and quality of active sites. Two-dimensional (2D) engineering can effectively reduce the resistance of the materials and greatly increase the number of electrochemically active sites, while heterometal doping, or the bimetal strategy, can improve the quality of active sites via changing the electronic structure of the material. Thus, the combination of the two can enhance the activity of electrocatalytic OER in all three aspects: conductivity, number and quality of active sites. However, there is currently no review on this topic. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the application of bimetallic 2D materials in electrocatalytic OER from four aspects: the structure, synthesis strategy, catalytic efficiency, and reaction mechanism.

Herein a significantly improved OER catalytic performance was found by selective phosphating of NiFe/NiFe2O4 embedded into porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanosphere (FeNi-FeNiO/CNS), that resulted in structure evolution by transferring the low active sites of FeNi alloy to more active amorphous metal phosphate/NiFe2O4 in the hybrid catalyst (P-FeNiO/CNS). The spectroscopic probing and microscopic observation clearly showed the structure evolution from the hybrid NiFe/NiFe2O4 to metal phosphate/NiFe2O4, and a greatly improved catalytic performance for oxygen evolution was thus obtained even a very low amount of metal was present in the system. Specifically, a quite low overpotential of 220 mV was required on P-FeNiO/CNS loaded on an inert glassy carbon electrode to drive 10 mA cm(-2), about 70 mV less than that of pristine FeNiFeNiO/CNS and 92 mV less than that of the commercial benchmark IrO2 catalyst. The catalytic activity and efficiency also outperformed most of the analogous Fe-Ni based catalysts. The theory analysis demonstrated FeNi alloy had the lowest activity, NiFe2O4 was inferior and metal phosphate/NiFe2O4 had the superior performance for OER. The highly improved catalytic performance on P-FeNiO/CNS could be attributed to the phosphating process resulting in electronic structure modulation, more active sites exposure on the surface and multi-components synergistic effect for the catalytic process. This finding has important implications for OER performance improvement of NiFe2O4 catalysts system and opens a novel way to boost the performance of other NiFe based catalysts for water oxidation.									83	2	0	0	12	0	84			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000537152400007

In this work, cobalt-molybdenum nitride nanosheet arrays grown on Ni foam (CoMoNx NSAs/NF) were prepared via a facile hydrothermal and nitridation process. The resulting CoMoNx NSAs/NF not only has a specific large surface area and provides more active sites but also possesses good electrical conductivity, contributing to the fast reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the synergistic effect between Co2N and Mo2N cooperatively enhance the charge transfer, thus further improving the electrocatalytic activity. Benefiting from these merits, the optimal CoMoNx-500 NSAs/NF exhibits excellent activities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with overpotentials of 91 and 231 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm-2, respectively. Moreover, the CoMoNx-500 NSAs/NF||CoMoNx-500 NSAs/NF couple requires a low cell voltage of 1.55 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is much superior to many other reported transition metal nitrides catalysts. This present work provides a reference for the design of bimetallic nitrides with superior electrocatalytic performance for overall water splitting.									67	1	0	0	1	0	67			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000624506000005

At first, this review discusses about the mechanism for OER, where an oxygen molecule is produced with the involvement of four electrons and OER intermediates but the reaction pathway is influenced by the pH. Then, this review summarizes the brief discussion on theoretical calculations, and those suggest the suitability of NiFe based catalysts for achieving optimal adsorption for OER intermediates by tuning the electronic structure to enhance the OER activity. Later, we review the recent advancement in terms of synthetic methodologies, chemical properties, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and catalytic performances of several nanostructured NiFe-based OER electrocatalysts, and those include layered double hydroxide (LDH), cation/anion/formamide intercalated LDH, teranary LDH/LTH (LTH: Layered-triple-hydroxide), LDH with defects/vacancies, LDH integrated with carbon, hetero atom doped/core-shell structured/heterostructured LDH, oxide/(oxy)hydroxide, alloy/mineral/boride, phosphide/phosphate, chalcogenide (sulfide and selenide), nitride, graphene/graphite/carbon-nano-tube containing NiFe based electrocatalysts, NiFe based carbonaceous materials, and NiFe-metal-organic-framework (MOP) based electrocatalysts. Finally, this review summarizes the various promising strategies to enhance the OER performance of electrocatalysts, and those include the electrocatalysts to achieve similar to 1000 mA cm(-2) at relatively low overpotential with significantly high stability.									132	9	0	0	6	0	133			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000509632300039

However, the atom coordination environments of SACs are difficult to accurately regulate due to the high complexity of coordination site and local environment of support. Herein, we develop an in-situ electrochemical cation-exchange method to fill the cation vacancies in MnO2 with Ru single atoms (SAs). This obtained catalyst exhibits high mass activity, which is similar to 44 times higher than commercial RuO2 catalyst and excellent stability, superior to the most state-of-the-art oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. The experimental and theoretical results confirm that the doped Ru can induce charge density redistribution, resulting in the optimized binding of oxygen species, and the strong covalent interaction between Ru and MnO2 for resisting oxidation and corrosion. This work will provide a new concept in the synthesis of well-defined local environments of supported SAs.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000770746300001

Here, we report a cationic oxidation method which can adjust the leaching of the in-situ catalyst and promote the reconstruction of dynamic surface for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The chlorine doping can reduce the possibility of triggering in-situ cobalt oxidation and chlorine leaching, leading to a transformation of the surface chlorine doped LaCoO_3 (Cl-LaCoO_3) into an intricate amorphous (oxygen) hydroxide phase. And thus, Cl-LaCoO_3 nanocrystals shows an ultralow overpotential of 342 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm~(-2) and Tafel slope of 76.2 mV dec~(-1). Surface reconstructed Cl-LaCoO_3 is better than many of the most advanced OER catalysts and has proven significant stability. This work provides a new prospect for designing a high-efficiency electrocatalyst with optimized perovskite-structure in renewable energy system.			随着化石燃料的快速消耗和由此产生的环境问题,研究人员正在努力寻找可持续的替代能源和能源储存转换方法.电解水所制备的氢气是一种最佳的能量载体.然而,阳极析氧反应(OER)的缓慢动力学是限制电催化水分解转化效率和阻碍其广泛应用的瓶颈之一.贵金属氧化物IrO_2/RuO_2和贵金属铂基材料被认为是较好的OER和氢析出反应(HER)电催化剂,但资源稀缺和高成本限制了其广泛应用.与其他催化材料相比,钙钛矿型氧化物具有成本低廉、易于大规模制备等特点.钙钛矿结构通过将缺陷引入A、B或氧位点而表现出可调节和可变的特性.但人们对氯掺杂钙钛矿作为有效的OER催化剂关注较少.在氧位点掺杂一些非氧阴离子有时会产生特殊性质,从而提高催化剂催化性能.卤素相对于氧的电负性较低,掺杂后可使金属-氧共价性质增强,这有利于电催化过程中的电荷转移.氯取代可以降低电化学活性电位从而触发原位形成氯掺杂金属(氧化物)氢氧化物相.与此相反,无氯催化材料需要更高的电化学活性电位来引发或者更多的循环才能完成表面重构,从而导致OER催化性能较差.因此,对于实现高效电催化水分解,合理控制原位形成催化剂的催化活性表面仍然是一个挑战.本文提出了一种阳离子氧化方法,可以调节原位催化剂的浸出并产生自驱动表面重构的La-OH用于OER反应.通过甘氨酸螯合的合成策略,利用甘氨酸经过水热反应螯合金属离子形成前驱体,之后高温合成空心立方体型的氯掺杂的LaCoO_3 (Cl-LaCoO_3)纳米晶体,并采用X射线粉末衍射和Cs校正扫描透射电子显微镜来表征. Cl-LaCoO_3纳米晶体在10 mA cm~(-2)的电流密度下表现出342 mV的超低过电位和76.2 mV dec~(-1)的Tafel斜率. OER过程中形成的La-OH结构有利于提高材料的结构稳定性和电催化活性,氯的掺杂也有助于提高材料的电催化活性.此外,原位拉曼光谱、X射线光电子能谱等进一步表明了由于稀土镧和氧之间的强相互作用,氯溶解并产生自驱动的La-OH结构可以显著提高材料的催化稳定性.综上,本文为设计掺杂型钙钛矿纳米晶体的高效电催化剂提供了新策略,并为可再生能源系统的应用提出了更多可能性.						1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0253-9837			CSCD:7190527

Chiral CuO films are electrodeposited on a polycrystalline Au substrate, and their spin filtering effect on electrons is demonstrated using Mott polarimetry analysis of photoelectrons. CuO is known to act as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction; however, it also generates side products such as H2O2. We show that chiral CuO is selective for O-2; H2O2 generation is strongly suppressed on chiral CuO but is present with achiral CuO. The selectivity is rationalized in terms of the electron spin-filtering properties of the chiral CuO and the spin constraints for the generation of triplet oxygen. These findings represent an important step toward the development of all-inorganic chiral materials for electron spin filtering and the creation of efficient, spin-selective (photo)electrocatalysts for water splitting.									47	0	0	0	4	0	47			1932-7447			WOS:000458348600036

Herein, a series of operando measurements, including in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, liquidphase transmission electron microscopy, and in situ Raman spectroscopy, were conducted to unravel in real time the structural and chemical stability of P-substituted CoSe2 electrocatalysts under both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER, respectively) in an alkaline electrolyte. It can be conclusively revealed that, in an alkaline electrolyte, the P-substituted CoSe2 electrocatalyst was acting as the "pre-catalyst" rather than the real reactive species. The introduction of phosphorus is speculated to generate more vacancies or defects around Co cations in the initial CoSe2 and considerably facilitates the structural transformation into the "real reactive species", such as metallic cobalt (for HER) and cobalt oxyhydroxide (for OER).									221	7	0	0	10	0	221			2380-8195			WOS:000464889300027

The activity of Pt/C catalyst decreases in the presence of a few ppm concentrations of impurities (vinyl acetate (VA) > propionic acid (PA) > toluene (Tol) > triethyl amine (TEA)) in 0.1 M HClO4 solution, as revealed by a negative shift in the half-wave potential of the ORR together with the formation of H2O2. Tafel plots for the ORR with similar slopes were obtained at the unpoisoned and the poisoned Pt/C catalysts indicating that the ORR proceeds via a similar rate-determining step (albeit with a lower kinetic current). The increase of %H2O2 at the poisoned Pt/C catalyst indicates that the hydrocarbon impurities act as site-blocking species which decreases the number of active sites necessary for the favorable parallel adsorption of O-2 molecules to affect a 4-electron ORR. The order of activity loss by the hydrocarbon impurities is in line with the dipole moment of each molecule. The recovery of the catalytic activity of the poisoned Pt/C catalysts is achieved by employing a few potential cycles between the onset potentials of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions.

Developing efficient approaches for the synthesis of well-defined 2D nanostructured materials with controllable composition and morphology is critical. The emerging concept, confined synthesis, has been regarded as a promising strategy to design and synthesize novel 2D nanostructured materials. This review mainly summarizes the recent advances in confined synthesis of 2D nanostructured materials by using layered materials as host matrices (also denoted as "nanoreactors"). By virtue of the space- and surface-confinement effects of these layered hosts, various well-organized 2D nanostructured materials, including 2D metals, 2D metal compounds, 2D carbon materials, 2D polymers, 2D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent-organic frameworks (COFs), as well as 2D carbon nitrides are successfully synthesized. The wide employment of these 2D materials in electrocatalytic applications (e.g., electrochemical oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions, small molecule oxidation, and oxygen reduction reaction) is presented and discussed. In the final section, challenges and prospects in 2D confined synthesis from the viewpoint of designing new materials and exploring practical applications are commented, which would push this fast-evolving field a step further toward greater success in both fundamental studies and ultimate industrialization.									85	4	0	0	3	0	85			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000521114800009

Herein, a new electrocatalyst of nickel phosphate microprism (VSB/NiPO) is developed via a simple solvothermal reaction. The microprism is mainly composed of Versailles-Santa Barbara-5 (VSB-5, molecular sieve) with unique nanochannels, which contribute to accelerating mass transfer and exposing more active sites, thus displaying excellent HER activity. Subsequently, the crystallinity and electronic structure of the framework are modulated by incorporating Fe with the combination of calcination and impregnation. The nanochannels are converted to the amorphous arrangement, and the Ni centers are regulated to the higher valence. The resultant Fe-VSB/NiPO-500 exhibits a low OER overpotential of 227 mV at 50 mA cm(-2). Interestingly, an integrated electrolyzer assembled by VSB/NiPO(-) and Fe-VSB/NiPO-500(+) performs well for overall water splitting, which requires only 1.487 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), and remains stable at 100 mA cm(-2) over 100 h. This finding opens a new avenue for developing VSB-5 in the field of electrocatalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000794291600001	35561047

Ir-based double perovskite oxides (A(2)BIrO(6); A = alkaline, alkaline-earth, or rare-earth elements; B' = transition metal or rare-earth elements) represent a class of oxides with great potential to replace the commercial catalyst IrO2. However, the structural evolution of Ir-based double perovskite oxides in electrolytes is incompletely understood, and foundational knowledge of the design principle of the "ideal" material is lacking. In this work, we report the unexpected phenomenon of instant Ir leaching from Ir-based double perovskite oxides in acid under non-catalytic conditions and discuss the implications of this phenomenon for mechanism investigation and material identification. Some well-known Ir-based double perovskite oxides, such as Ba2PrIrO6 and Sr2YIrO6, undergo instantaneous Ir leaching when they come into contact with acidic electrolytes. The Ir-leaching process is found to be non-persistent and non-thermodynamically determined, and its extent is correlated with the leaching of other B'-site elements in the perovskite oxides. Based on this observation, we revisit the Ir dissolution-precipitation process for surface IrOx formation during the perovskite-electrolyzed oxygen evolution reaction, emphasizing the non-negligible role of Ir species owing to acid corrosion in the electrolyte. Finally, we modify a screening protocol for low-Ir oxygen evolution electrocatalysts and propose an instant acid corrosion test as an indispensable process to evaluate the structural stability of potential catalysts.

Partial elemental substitutions are effective ways to increase catalytic performance and such electronic interactions between multiple elements are known as synergistic effects. However, serious issues such as random atomic arrangement and ambiguous roles of constituent elements humper theoretical investigations for rational materials design. Herein, we describe systematic study on OER activity of AA'3B4O12-type quadruple perovskite cc oxides, in which multiple transition metal ions are located at distinct crystallographic sites. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that OER catalytic activities of quadruple perovskite oxide series, CaCu3B4O12 (B = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co), are all superior to those of simple perovskite counterparts CaBO3. The order of activity of B-site transition metal ions for CaBO3 (Fe4+ > Co4+ >> Ti4+, V4+, Cr4+, Mn4+) is retained in CaCu3B4O12, indicating that B-site ions play a primary role whereas A'-site Cu ions secondarily contribute to OER activity for CaCu3B4O12. Charge-transfer energies, energy differences between oxygen 2p band center and unoccupied 3d band center of B-site transition metal obtained from first-principles electronic-state calculations, illustrate that OER overpotentials of quadruple perovskite oxides are lower than simple perovskite oxides by similar to 150 mV. These findings propose a simple avenue to realize enhanced OER activity for multiple transition-metal ions.									36	3	0	0	1	0	36			2574-0962			WOS:000458706400025

FeOOH@NiCo2S4/NF pre-catalyst showed a good electrocatalytic activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction in a 1 M KOH solution, with an overpotential of 228 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 44.03 mV dec(-1) and a durability of more than 50 h. The overpotential of the hydrogen evolution reaction was 112 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The OWS performance was very good because it only required a voltage of 1.56 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The 3D core-shell structure with a large electrolyte contact interface, the good electronic conductivity, the large surface exposure of active sites by the NiCo2S4 nanotube arrays, and the strong electron interaction at the heterogeneous interface between FeOOH and NiCo2S4 are the key factors for the excellent performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000775555300001

In this study, a bimetallic phosphide electrocatalyst with nanowire morphology was prepared using a simple and controllable etch-doping strategy with nickel foam (NF) as the carrier of the integrated electrode. The morphology of the catalyst nanowires offers a relatively high specific surface area, thereby providing more active sites and promoting the contact between the electrolyte and the catalyst. Electrochemical tests show that Co1Fe0.1P/NF exhibits excellent performance and stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). For the HER, the catalyst needs an overpotential of only 73 mV in 1 M KOH to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and an overpotential of only 257 mV for the OER. It is worth noting that when using Co1Fe0.1P/NF as the cathode and anode for electrolyzing water in the electrolyzer system, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) can be reached with only 1.60 V. This research provides an effective synthesis route for transition metal phosphides as bifunctional catalysts for water electrolysis.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000643915600001

The result indicates that the selenides are oxidized upon OER and the surface generated oxides are the real OER active species. The MnCo selenides exhibit a significantly enhanced performance as compared to the oxide and hydroxide though the real active OER species of these three catalysts are essentially the same. The superior activity of MnCo selenides could be attributed to the high intrinsic conductivity and the high surface active area. Further, the synergy between Mn and Co lowers the energy barrier for catalysis and helps to stabilize the material. The bimetallic MnCo selenides with yolk shell structures possess the optimal electrochemical performance with a low cell voltage of 1.66 V at the current density of 50 mA cm(-2), outperforming most of the earth-abundant electrocatalysts. Our work provides a better understanding of the active species of metal selenides and the origin of the performance disparity between selenides (-derived oxides) and oxides electrocatalysts.

The replacement of the essential and expensive components in such systems can reduce the capital cost and improve the effectiveness of those systems. In this study, Co3O4 nanofibres were fabricated from sol-gel assisted electrospun poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile)/cobalt acetate tetrahydrate precursor composite fibres. The morphological and compositional features of the Co3O4 nanofibres obtained after calcination of the precursor nanofibers were studied using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results of X-ray diffraction study and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the average grain size of the fibres increased with the calcination temperature. Clear evidence of defects in the fibres was observed in ultraviolet-visible-near infrared and energy dispersive spectroscopic measurements. The electrocatalytic behaviour of Co3O4 nanofibres obtained at different calcination temperatures was studied using them for the water splitting reaction in an alkaline medium. The maximum efficiency in the hydrogen evolution reaction was achieved using the Co3O4 nanofibres obtained at the lowest calcination temperature, which had the highest surface area and the smallest grain size.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2046-2069			WOS:000354212300057

Various spinel MCo2O4 electrocatalysts were synthesized by a facile microwave-assisted synthesis and low-temperature annealing. The overpotential of these MCo2O4 electrocatalysts for the OER is comparable to the reported overpotentials of catalysts based on cobalt oxides. From the findings, the catalytic activity of OER decreases in the order of ZnCo2O4 > NiCo2O4 > FeCo2O4 > Co3O4 > MnCo2O4. It was revealed that the active sites are controlled by the balance of M3+/M2+ cation distribution in octahedral and tetrahedral sites and by the bond strength between M and oxygen atoms at the catalyst surface from the direct combination of in situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy with the electrochemical experiments to track the oxidation state and the structural changes of electrocatalysts before and after the exposure to the OER conditions. This study provides insights into the effects of cation distributions on the OER activity and demonstrates a promising method for determining the fundamental mechanism of cationsubstituted cobalt oxides for OER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2574-0962			WOS:000740500700001

A novel highly efficient and stable for many cycles heterogeneous Cu-contained catalysts supported on MFI-type zeolite (1% Cu-ZSM-5) for water oxidation were prepared. Oxo/hydroxo complexes of copper (II) were stabilized in the zeolite channels via polycondensation. The analysis of the electron states of copper in the Cu-containing zeolite-based catalysts using EPR and UV-vis DR techniques revealed that the catalytic efficiency of Cu(II) state in zeolite grew up in the series: [Cu (NH3)4]2+ < isolated [Cu(H2O)6]2+ << Cu(OH)x-like and CuOx-like nanoclusters in mesopores << CuOx-like and Cu(OH)x-like complexes in channels < [Cu2(OH)2]2+ complexes in channels. The catalyst containing [Cu2(OH)2]2+ complexes in channels provided the yields of oxygen as high as 60 and 64 % of the stoichiometric quantity at pH 9.2-10.0 in the dark reaction with one-electron oxidant Ru(bpy)33+. Nevertheless, Cu(OH)x-like and [Cu2(OH)2]2+ complexes stabilized in the ZSM-5 channels decomposed easily under the conditions of the photocatalytic reaction. At the same time, the oxygen yield reached 92 % in photocatalytic system Ru(bpy)32+/ S2O82- in the presence of 1%Cu-ZSM-5 containing CuOx-like complexes stabilized in the channels. The adsorption of Ru(bpy)32+ on the surface of 1%Cu-ZSM-5 containing CuOx-like complexes provided the increase of the reaction rate in 1.6 times and achieved the oxygen yield up to 98 % to stoichiometry. This indicated the strong effect of concurrent processes of Ru(bpy)32+ and Ru(bpy)33+ adsorption/desorption at the catalyst active site on the rate of oxygen evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000668217200004

To balance the adsorption of the two active species, here, a way to regulate the local spin state and band structure simultaneously in Ni3S2 nanosheets is reported. The adequate doping of W heteroatoms causes the electron depletion from the Ni active site, which modulates the spin state of e(g) electrons, weakening the adsorption of *O. Additionally, the introduction of S vacancies contributes to the upshift of the d band center, which strengthens the adsorption of *OOH. In this manner, the adsorption of Ni3S2 for the active intermediates is optimized, resulting in a considerably improved overpotential of 246 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 66 mV dec(-1). This work provides insights into the exploration of OER catalysts through synergistic modulation of the spin state and the band structure.									39	0	0	0	5	0	39			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000745995000001

Rather than noble metal catalysts with scarcity and expense, first raw 3d dual transition metal non-oxides are promising candidates to achieve superior OER activity and durability in alkaline solution due to their tunable electron structure, high conductivity, and cost-off advantages. Herein, a concise review of recent advances in designing 3d dual transition metal non-oxides electrocatalysts for OER under alkaline condition is provided with particular emphasis on structure-performance relationships. The diverse effects of 3d dual transition metals, especially for Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn, are highlighted in discussion regarding synthesis strategies and OER performances of corresponding electrocatalysts, in different categories of transition metal sulfides, selenides, phosphides, nitrides, and other non-oxides. Finally, existent challenges and directional perspectives for developing first raw 3d dual transition metal non-oxides electrocatalysts with outstanding OER performance are outlined.									76	6	0	0	5	0	77			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000581738300055

During the past, nickel-based cathode-supported thin-film electrolyte configuration was widely adopted. However, such cells suffer from the serious challenge of anode delamination at high electrolysis currents due to enormous gaseous oxygen formation at the anode-electrolyte interface with insufficient adhesion caused by low sintering temperatures for ensuring high anode porosity and cathode pulverization because of potential nickel redox reaction. Here, the authors propose, fabricate, and test asymmetric thick anode-supported SOECs with firm anode-electrolyte interface and graded anode gas diffusion channel for realizing efficient and stable electrolysis at ultrahigh currents. Such a specially structured anode allows the co-sintering of anode support and electrolyte at high temperatures to form strong interface adhesion while suppressing anode sintering. The mixed oxygen-ion and electron conducting anode with graded channel structure provides a fast oxygen release pathway, large anode surface for oxygen evolution reaction, and excellent support for depositing nanocatalysts, to further improve oxygen evolution activity. As a result, the as-prepared cells demonstrate both high performance, comparable or even higher than state-of-the-art cathode-supported SOECs, and outstanding stability at a record current density of 2.5 A cm(-2).									5	1	0	0	1	0	6			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000608844600001	33470519

The surface reconstruction is the key to improve the OER activity of catalysts. Herein, a simple and scalable pyrolysis approach is applied to prepare a novel self-supported electrode. This electrode is consisted of cobalt molybdate (CoMo1O4) nanoparticles in-situ grow on carbon fiber paper (CP), termed as CoMo1O4@CP. And Mo-doped cobalt oxyhydroxide (Mo-1-CoOOH) is generated from structural evolution occurring on the surface of CoMo1O4@CP. The Mo-1-CoOOH@CP exhibits highly OER activity, which is verified by a low current over-potential of 274 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope (66 mV dec(-1)) and long-term stability (100 h) in 1 M KOH solution. In-situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations jointly reveal that etching of Moat enable the surface structure of CoMo1O4@CP electrode transformation to Mo-1-CoOOH@CP, and thereby bring dramatically enhanced OER activity. This study presents an effective approach on surface self-reconstruction of catalysts, with the characteristic of favorable OER activity, simple process and low cost. Accordingly, this sort of electrocatalyst demonstrates feasible applications in the fields of energy storage and conversion.									34	5	0	0	0	0	34			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000498330600015

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop highly efficient electrocatalysts. Here, NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDH) with tunable Ni/Fe composition exhibit corresponding dependent morphology, layered structure, and chemical states, leading to higher activity and better stability than that of conventional NiFe LDH-based catalysts. The characterization data show that the low overpotentials (249 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), ultrasmall Tafel slopes (24 mV dec(-1)), and high current densities of Ni3Fe LDH result from the larger fraction of trivalent Fe3+ and the optimized local chemical environment with more oxygen coordination and ordered atomic structure for the metal site. Owing to the active intermediate species, Ni(Fe)OOH, under OER conditions and a reversible dynamic phase transition during the cycling process, the Ni3Fe LDH achieves a high current density of over 2 A cm(-2) at 2.0 V, and durability of 400 h at 1 A cm(-2) in a single cell test. This work provides insights into the relationship between the composition, electronic structure of the layer, and electrocatalytic performance, and offers a scalable and efficient strategy for developing promising catalysts to support the development of the future hydrogen economy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000823996200001

Herein, we report that bimetal-glycerate hollow spheres organized by nanosheets (CoFeG-HS) can be first produced by the one-pot template-free method as an efficient OER electrocatalyst. According to the time-dependent experiments, the growing mechanism gets revealed, assigned to the Ostwald ripening process. Compared with the samples after they are annealed, the catalyst of CoFeG-HS shows greatly lower overpotential and enhanced kinetics for OER, with an overpotential of 242 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2), and a Tafel slope of 49.4 mV.dec(-1) because of the richness of oxyhydroxide-containing species on the surface of catalysts is helpful to the high performance of the OER. Based on the comparison with the Co-glycerate and Fe-glycerate, the CoFeG-HS with more highly active performance and cycled stability profits from the specific hollow structure, optimized composition on the surface, and interaction of Co2+ and Fe3+. The experiment of the catalyst with/without black carbon shows that the important role of black carbon is in reducing the electron transfer resistance to improve the activity. Thus, the currently developed CoFeG-HS with superior OER performance may potentially serve as a material for use in industrial alkaline water electrolyzers.									18	3	0	0	0	0	18			2168-0485			WOS:000526375000007

However, oxygen evolution of aqueous electrolytes and poor reversibility exclude high-potential redox reactions, resulting in an unsatisfying plateau voltage and a limited energy density. To address this issue, this study arms aqueous ECs with regulated anionic hydration structure and intensified interfacial affinity for realizing the high-potential Cl-/Cl-0 redox reaction, which has rarely been utilized before. Experiments and simulations show that the hetero-ion invaded solvation structure can put chlorine redox potential below oxygen evolution potential, and negatively charged functional groups on the wall of two-dimensional nanochannels increase the energy barrier of the Heyrovsky step and decrease the tendency for Cl-2 desorption. Furthermore, we demonstrate the advantage of chlorine redox in the bi-redox activity of a chloride ion-containing electrolyte, methyl viologen dichloride, which delivers a sustained discharging voltage plateau of 1.8 V and a high energy density.									10	0	0	0	0	0	9			2380-8195			WOS:000629230800033

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling combined with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Tip Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) deduced the composition and depth of the Ni-Fe (oxy)hydroxide layer. The composition of the resulting electrocatalytic surfaces are tailored through altering the concentrations of nickel and iron within the electrodeposited solutions, which give rise to optimised AMEs OER performance (within 0.1 M KOH). The optimal OER performance was observed from a Ni-Fe (oxy)hydroxide with a 10 % content of Fe, which displayed an OER onset potential and overpotential of+1.47 V (vs. RHE) and 519 mV, respectively. These values arecomparable to that of polycrystalline Iridium (+ 1.43 V (vs. RHE) and ca. 413 mV), as well as being significantly less electropositive than a bare/unmodified AME. This work is essential for those designing, fabricating and modulating additive manufactured electrodes.									16	1	0	0	3	1	16			2196-0216			WOS:000501286600012

We propose a general strategy to further boost their electrocatalytic activities by introducing organic ligands into the framework, considering that most 3d-metal (hydro)oxides usually exhibit quite strong binding with reaction intermediates and thus compromised activity due to the scaling relations. Involving weakly bonded ligands downshifts the d-band center, which narrows the band gap, and optimizes the adsorption of these intermediates. For example, the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be greatly promoted by approximate to 5.7 times over a NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) after a terephthalic acid (TPA)-induced conversion process, arising from the reduced energy barrier of the deprotonation of OH* to O*. Impressively, the proposed ligand-induced conversion strategy is applicable to a series of 3d-block metal (hydro)oxides, including NiFe2O4, NiCo2O4, and NiZn LDH, providing a general structural upgrading scheme for existing high-performance electrocatalytic systems.									45	1	0	0	0	0	45			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000634850000001	33635599

In this report, hierarchical cobalt nitride micros balls with heterostructure are prepared through nitridation of Co(OH)(CO3)(0.5)center dot 0.11H(2)O counterparts. The microballs are composed of nanowires, which enchase nanoparticles with heterostructure in terms of Co5.47N/Co3N. The catalyst presented here exhibits a high power conversion efficiency of 7.3% for reduction of I-3(-), comparable to that of 7.6% for platinum-based catalysts. In alkaline electrolyte (1 mol L-1 KOH), only 55 and 290 mV of overpotentials are required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively. The superior electrochemical performance of the catalyst is attributed to the synergistic effect resulting from Co5.47N/Co(3)Nheterostructure. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, searching for facile and effective method to prepare composition and morphology tunable catalyst, as well as understanding its reactivity are urgent tasks. Here, we report a hydrothermal etching strategy for the synthesis of Fe doped Co oxides/hydroxide hybrid catalyst with hierarchical nanosheet array architecture. The as-obtained catalyst shows an overpotential of 219 mV without iR compensation at 10 mA/cm(2) and a low Tafel slope of 46.4 mV/dec, surpassing the other control catalysts in this work and most similar catalysts in literature. Comprehensive studies confirm that both composition and morphology can be rationally tuned by adjusting the hydrothermal etching parameters, and the improvement of activity is attributed to the highly active Fe doped Co oxides/hydroxide species together with the unique 3D hierarchical structure.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000784480900001

To this end, electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a crucial role in advanced energy conversion and storage technologies such as water splitting and rechargeable metal-air batteries. Considerable efforts have been devoted to exploit non-precious metal catalysts for replacing the catalysts based on precious metals such as iridium (Ir) and ruthenium (Ru). However, a clear understanding of the OER mechanism of electrocatalysts is vital for the directional synthesis of high-performance electrocatalysts. In this review, the recent perspectives on OER mechanisms of non-precious metal-based catalysts are presented, which includes electron transfer, defect/vacancy, and electronic-configuration regulation structures. The construction strategies of electrocatalysts and fundamental mechanisms for enhancing the catalytic activity are discussed. Furthermore, the catalysts that can be beneficial for water splitting and metal-air batteries are introduced. Besides, an overview of past developments and future challenges is presented.									22	1	0	0	2	0	22			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000607099300003

In particular, an interesting and not fully understood observation is that the efficiency of NaTaO3 increases dramatically in the presence of cation doping. To obtain better insight into the origin of this effect, we use first-principles calculations to investigate the fundamental structural, electronical, and chemical properties of pristine and Sr-doped NaTaO3, a system for which several experimental studies have recently become available. Our results show that Sr donor-acceptor codoping at Na and Ta sites significantly reduces the formation energy of the Sr dopants. Further study of the energetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) shows a substantial reduction of the OER overpotential for the codoped material, consistent with recent suggestions that codoping is crucial for increasing NaTaO3's efficiency. The detailed insights provided by our work could benefit the design and preparation of new efficient catalysts based on NaTaO3.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000494549700079

In this work, with rationally designed sandwich-type metal-organic framework/graphene oxide as a template and precursor, a layered CoP/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite has been successfully prepared via pyrolysis and a subsequent phosphating process. The resultant CoP/rGO-400 exhibits excellent HER activity in acid solution. More importantly, the catalyst manifests excellent catalytic performances for both the HER and OER in basic solution. Therefore, it can be utilized as a bifunctional catalyst on both the anode and cathode for overall water splitting in basic media, even displaying superior activity to that of the integrated Pt/C and IrO2 catalyst couple.									600	26	0	0	20	0	604			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000371021900004	29899902

Herein, a one-pot strategy is reported to synthesize nitrate-intercalated nickel-iron LDHs (NiFe LDHs_NO3-) by using hexamethylenetetramine as a hydrolysis reagent. The NiFe LDHs monolayers can be facilely dispersed in water within 10 s by hand shaking because the NiFe LDHs_NO3- bulk owns an enlarged interlayer spacing up to 8.2 angstrom. Critical information on the structure, prerequisite, and universality of this strategy is obtained by advanced characterization methods, for example, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction pattern, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. As a proof of concept application, the NiFe LDHs monolayer is employed as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction and displays much superior performance to the bulk LDHs and RuO2. This facile strategy paves the way for designing other LDHs monolayers for highly active electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-7350			WOS:000827805500001

However, it is still ambiguous which configuration of nitrogen dopants, either pyridinic or pyrrolic N, when bonded to the TM in oxides, predominately contributes to the synergistic effect. Herein, an innovative strategy based on laser irradiation is described to controllably tune the relative concentrations of pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen dopants in the hybrid catalyst, i.e., NiCo2O4 NPs/N-doped mesoporous graphene. Comparative studies reveal the dominant role of pyridinic-NCo bonding, instead of pyrrolic-N bonding, in synergistically promoting reversible oxygen electrocatalysis. Moreover, density functional theory calculations provide deep insights into the corresponding synergistic mechanism. The optimized hybrid, NiCo/NLG-270, manifests outstanding reversible oxygen electrocatalytic activities, leading to an overpotential different E among the lowest value for highly efficient bifunctional catalysts. In a practical reversible Zn-air battery, NiCo/NLG-270 exhibits superior charge/discharge performance and long-term durability compared to the noble metal electrocatalysts.									463	33	0	0	19	0	471			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000434036000021	29675934

Herein, we reported a surface modulation strategy, via doping oxygen atoms to tune the surface state of ZnIn2S4 nanosheets with cocatalyst MoS2 modification, to enhance water adsorption and surface catalytic reaction for boosting the photocatalytic activity. Consequently, MoS2/O-ZnIn2S4 photocatalysts showed a remarkably superior photocatalytic H-2 production performance of 4.002 mmol g(-1) h(-1) and an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of similar to 2.53%, 5.4 folds higher than ZnIn2S4. Using operando infrared spectroscopy and DFT calculatdion, we revealed the dynamic structural evolution, as well as the active sites for water adsorption and the catalytic reaction at the MoS2/O-ZnIn2S4 interface. This work reveals the effect of surface modulation on the photocatalytic activity for MoS2/O-ZnIn2S4 and offers a feasible method to devise excellent nanomaterial photocatalysts for H-2 production.

In this work, nickel particles were loaded on the surface of two kinds of carbon-based materials (graphene and Cabot conductive carbon black Vxc-72) by using a mild chemical method. The prepared Ni/Graphene and Ni/Vxc-72 show excellent hydrogen evolution reaction performance in 1.0 M KOH media. In particular, the overpotential of Ni/ Graphene is only 29 mV (at 10 mA/cm2), and the Tafel slope is 87 mV/dec. It is also proved that Ni/Graphene has good stability by chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry. These findings suggest the loading nickel on the carbon-base catalysts can improve the hydrogen evolution performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000681658700005

This article discusses in detail the major developments in OER electrocatalysts, including recently reported metal and nonmetal based materials. Metal-based catalysts, although having the advantages of high catalytic activity, have disadvantages such as poor stability and low selectivity, which hinder the further application of such materials. Non-metallic based materials avoid such disadvantages and exhibit very substantial performance in overall water decomposition.

However, the electrocatalytic HER/OER activities can be restricted by the inert basal plane due to the poor conductivity, deficient active sites and inferior durability despite there being efficient active sites in the material edge. Thus, capturing many more exposed reactive sites to facilitate the rapid reaction kinetics is a crucial strategy. In this paper, both oxygen and unsaturated metal vacancies with FeCoNi LDH materials are generated through a surface activation approach by pre-covering of fluoride and a post-boronizing process. Such a material is grown on Ni foam to form an F-FeCoNi-Ov LDH/NF electrocatalyst. The activated surface of the electrocatalyst with oxygen vacancies and unsaturated metal sites shows enhanced electroconductivity for regulating the surface electronic structure and optimizing the surface adsorption energy for intermediates during HER/OER processes. As a result, this electrocatalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for both the HER and OER with low overpotentials, small Tafel slopes and long durability. The enhancement mechanism is also studied deeply for fundamental understanding. For performance validation, an F-FeCoNi-Ov LDH/NF parallel to F-FeCoNi-Ov LDH/NF water splitting cell is fabricated and needs only 1.54 V and 1.81 V to reach current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. This work provides a practicable strategy to develop 2D LDH nanomaterials with boosted electrocatalytic activity for sustainable and clean energy storage systems.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000762399900001	35229091

Here, the sheet-on-sheet strategy is proposed to effectively increase the density of active sites of NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) catalyst in terms of structural engineering. As a non-precious electrocatalyst for the OER, NiFe LDH is grown directly on CuO nanosheets. As a result, the received NiFe LDH/CuO nanosheet catalyst with sheet-on-sheet structure shows an ultralow overpotential of 270 mV at 20 mA cm(-2), much lower than that of RuO(2)as a benchmark.

The metal oxides have been dispersed onto functionalized CNTs by an improved impregnation method. This novel, synthetic approach allows for both the preparation of functionalized nitrogen-doped CNTs as well as the even dispersion of metal oxides onto the walls of the CNTs. The catalysts have been characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transition electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) methods. Catalytic activity has been measured using a Rotating Disc Electrode (RDE) experiment. The resulting catalysts are stable in alkaline media under experimental conditions and have high hi-functional electrocatalytic activity-both for the oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER), From this series of catalysts, the most active catalyst for ORR is the 50 wt% MnO2/CNT catalyst with a half-wave potential of 0.84V at the current density of -2.1 mA cm(-2) and an onset at 0.98V versus RHE. The most active for OER is the 50 wt% NiO/CNT catalyst with an onset potential at 1.45 V versus RHE. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The lead anodes used in zinc electrowinning today are not dimensionally stable and have a high overvoltage for oxygen evolution. By replacing the oxygen evolution in sulfate-based electrolytes with methanol oxidation, the anode potential could be significantly lowered. This would reduce the energy consumption and also enable the use of new and more stable types of electrodes. The activities of the electrodes studied were found sufficient for electrowinning. The highest activity was obtained with porous PtRu, while platinized titanium was the most stable electrode. All electrodes were deactivated with time, and the deactivation rate of PtRu was influenced by mass transport. The dominating reaction mechanism seemed to be different on Pt and on PtRu. Due to deactivation of the electrodes with time, a reactivation method was needed. The best method tested in this study was to periodically reverse the current. After assessing the electrodes with respect to important properties, the platinized titanium electrode was considered to be most suitable for use in electrowinning processes.

In the past decades, the dimensionally stable anode (DSA) made of RuO2 is the benchmark catalyst for the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) with high activity. However, the drawbacks of the DSA, such as high cost and inferior selectivity, demand the development of low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts for CER. Herein, three low-dimensional Fe/Co/Ni-dithiolene metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) were systematically investigated using the density functional theory. Our calculation results predict that Ni-based dithiolene MOF can efficiently catalyze the CER with a low thermodynamic overpotential of 0.049 V via the Cl* intermediate. The electronic resonance structure of [Ni2+(L center dot-)(L2-)](-) in the Ni-based dithiolene MOF leads to the electron transfer first from S atoms in ligands to Ni cations to achieve a stable electronic configuration, which leads to the most desirable Ni-Cl interaction strength for CER. Moreover, the selectivity to Cl-2 generation is due to its high thermodynamic overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction. Our findings may, therefore, accelerate CER catalyst discoveries beyond DSAs with the optimized electronic structures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000797817500016

With spin-dependent kinetics in OER, to manipulate the spin ordering of ferromagnetic OER catalysts (e.g., by magnetization) can reduce the kinetic barrier. However, most active OER catalysts are not ferromagnetic, which makes the spin manipulation challenging. In this work, we report a strategy with spin pinning effect to make the spins in paramagnetic oxyhydroxides more aligned for higher intrinsic OER activity. The spin pinning effect is established in oxide(FM)/oxyhydroxide interface which is realized by a controlled surface reconstruction of ferromagnetic oxides. Under spin pinning, simple magnetization further increases the spin alignment and thus the OER activity, which validates the spin effect in rate-limiting OER step. The spin polarization in OER highly relies on oxyl radicals (O.) created by 1(st) dehydrogenation to reduce the barrier for subsequent O-O coupling. Water oxidation to triplet oxygen requires a spin polarization process for faster kinetics. Here, the authors show an interface spin pinning effect between ferromagnetic oxides and reconstructed oxyhydroxide surface layer, where the spin ordering in paramagnetic oxyhydroxide catalyst layer can be tuned to improve the intrinsic activity.									60	2	0	0	3	0	59			2041-1723			WOS:000665021800016	34131143

A comprehensive description of gas transport in liquid and following reactions at the solid-liquid-gas interface, which is substantial in regard to achieving enhanced triple-phase reactions, remains unavailable. Here, we report a real-time observation of the accelerated etching of gold nanorods with oxygen nanobubbles in aqueous hydrobromic acid using liquid-cell transmission electron microscopy. Our observations reveal that when an oxygen nanobubble is close to a nanorod below the critical distance (similar to 1nm), the local etching rate is significantly enhanced by over one order of magnitude. Molecular dynamics simulation results show that the strong attractive van der Waals interaction between the gold nanorod and oxygen molecules facilitates the transport of oxygen through the thin liquid layer to the gold surface and thus plays a crucial role in increasing the etching rate. This result sheds light on the rational design of solid-liquid-gas reactions for enhanced activities.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000805540400004	35618827

Here, by means of surface-science experiments and density functional theory, we assess its suitability for catalysis by studying the chemical reactivity of the (0 1 0)-oriented PtSn4 surface toward CO, H2O, O-2 molecules at room temperature and, moreover, its stability in air. We demonstrate that the catalytic activity of PtSn4 is determined by the composition of the outermost atomic layer. Specifically, we find that the surface termination for PtSn4 crystals cleaved in vacuum is an atomic Sn layer, which is totally free from any CO poisoning. In oxygen-rich environment, as well as in ambient atmosphere, the surface termination is a SnOx skin including SnO and SnO2 in comparable amount. However, valence-band states, including those forming Dirac node arcs, are only slightly affected by surface modifications. The astonishingly beneficial influence of surface oxidation on catalytic activity has been demonstrated by electrocatalytic tests evidencing a reduction of the Tafel slope, from 442 down to 86 mV dec(-1), whose origin has been explained by our theoretical model. The use of surface-science tools to tune the chemical reactivity of PtSn4 opens the way toward its effective use in catalysis, especially for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000523185200015

Herein, for the first time, a new strategy is established to fabricate hierarchical 3D nickel manganese oxyphosphide nanosheets (NiMnOP NSs) with high electroactive sites, numerous nanoporous networks, and plentiful oxygen vacancies for highly reversible water splitting application. When serving as the catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the hierarchical 3D NiMnOP catalyst entails the low overpotentials of about 195 and 290 mV, respectively, at a current density of 500 mA cm(-2) with long-term durability. Impressively, HER and OER performances of NiMnOP catalyst are highly reversible because of their interconversion characteristics of both catalytic active sites. The assembled NiMnOP parallel to NiMnOP water splitting cell delivers a current density of 10 and 500 mA cm(-2) at cell voltages of 1.51 and 1.72 V, respectively, which is superior to state-of-art Pt-C parallel to RuO2 (similar to 1.53 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)). Most importantly, the water splitting cell reveals excellent reversibility of both half-reactions in water splitting process at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2). This process can successfully overcome the electrochemical stability problems initiated by electrode depolarization throughout repeated power disconnection, where frequency fetching is expected to occur by the utilization of irregular renewable energy distributions.									45	3	0	0	4	0	46			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000513814400032

The effects of the metal composition of SS electrode on the OER overpotentials and nanostructure of the resulting electrodes were discussed. Scanning transmission electron microscopic observations with energy dispersive spectroscopy showed that the fiber-like nanostructured surface catalyst layers and the Fe/Ni atomic ratios of the catalyst layers after ET were correlated with that of the starting SS electrode. The electrochemical double layer capacitance (C-dl) estimated after ET followed the order: 303 > 316 > 310S, and the C-dl-normalized OER overpotentials were almost the same for 310S and 316, whereas that of 303 was ca. 25 mV larger. The results suggest that the metal element composition, especially the Fe/Ni ratio of the bulk SS, is one of the key parameters determining the OER performance of SS-based anodes for alkaline water electrolyzers.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000741248600001

CuCo2O4 particles in a chestnut-burr-like shape (CCO*, where* = chestnut burr) were hydrothermally synthesized around fibers of Ni foam substrates as current collectors. Chestnut burrs 4 mu m on average had thorns consisting of less than five threads. Each thread was made of a consecutive array of nanobeads less than 10 nm. Nanovoids or nanopores were found between nanobeads. The chestnut-burr structure of CCO* allowed IrO2-overwhelming OER activity. By using the hierarchically nanostructured electrocatalyst directly grown on current collectors without binders and conducting agents, high performances of anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysis was demonstrated. Three merits of the electrode architecture were emphasized. First, mass transfer pathways for reactants and products were secured in a microscale between thorns and in a nanoscale between nanobeads. Second, more active sites were exposed to electrolytes in the hierarchical structure. Third, direct growth of active materials on conductive substrates improved adhesion and electrical conduction.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			2168-0485			WOS:000514488600002

Conversion of the as-synthesized LDH nanoplatelet dispersion into inkjet printing inks results in high precision patterning and complete substrate coverage with low LDH loadings in the range of mu g cm(-2). The Ni-Fe LDHs' anisotropy induces a preferential inplane alignment to a glassy carbon substrate producing low-porosity films. Thin Ni-Fe LDH films in the submicrometer range exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with an overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 32 mV dec(-1). The particle alignment creates a compact film and induces a loading-independent electrochemical performance of the Ni-Fe LDH electrodes for loadings above 50 mu g cm(-2). The combination of CHFS and inkjet printing represents a promising hyphenation of large-scale synthesis and electrode production.									13	2	0	0	1	0	13			2574-0962			WOS:000510104700110

Herein, a series of crystalline CoMP-decorated (M = Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn) amorphous CoM LDH nanomaterials in-situ grown on nickel foam (denoted as c-CoMP/a-CoM LDH/NF) is developed as highly efficient and stable alkaline water splitting electrocatalysts. Crystalline CoMP encountered amorphous CoM LDH structure brings the increased catalytic active sites without sacrificing charge transfer rates, more optimal intermediate adsorption/dissociation capability, and the synergistic effects between binary transition metals, leading to more favorable reaction kinetics, thus enhancing catalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction. As a result, the optimized cell assembled by the as-proposed electrocatalysts only requires ultralow cell voltages of 1.655 and 1.722 V to drive current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH and exhibits excellent durability over 85 h (under 100 mA cm-2), which is originated from the well-retentive hybrid crystalline/ amorphous nanostructure even after undergoing surface reconstruction. The presented work deepens the insights of crystalline/amorphous heterostructure catalysts and provides a new inspiration in the design of bifunctional electrocatalysts for high-rate alkaline water splitting.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000795081200003

Owing to the strong electronic interactions between the heterostructure interfaces and the introduction of oxygen vacancies, such an electrode displays outstanding oxygen evolution reaction performance with an overpotential of 188 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and the electrolyzer using the electrode as both cathode and anode exhibits a cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2166-3831			WOS:000867437400001

Herein, the interface engineering of the FeNi2Se4-FeNi LDH composite is achieved by the in situ growth of FeNi LDH nanosheets and the subsequent partial selenization treatment. Enhanced mass transfer and accelerated gas release are achieved in such a unique self-supported hierarchical heterostructure during overall water splitting. Moreover, the strong electronic interaction between FeNi2Se4 and FeNi LDH optimizes the electron redistribution of Fe and Ni sites, which significantly improves the interfacial reactivity of reactants and/or intermediates with the hybrid catalyst. Benefiting from increased active sites and enhanced intrinsic activity, the hybrid electrocatalyst requires only a potential of 205 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and a potential of 106 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to realize 10 mA cm(-2). Specifically, the optimized FeNi2Se4-FeNi LDH as a bifunctional electrode in overall water splitting delivers 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.56 V driven by a solar cell. This strategy by rational design of heterostructures thus paves an efficient pathway to fabricate active and non-precious bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2052-1553			WOS:000721866800001

Indeed, such materials were addressed in numerous previous studies. The application of a scanning flow cell connected to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer allowed us now to examine the stability and activity toward oxygen evolution reaction of such mixed oxides in parallel. The whole composition range of Ir-Ru mixtures has been covered in a thin film material library. In the whole composition range the rate of Ru dissolution is observed to be much higher than that of Ir. Eventually, due to the loss of Ru, the activity of the mixed oxides approaches the value corresponding to pure IrO2. Interestingly, the loss of only a few percent of a monolayer in Ru surface concentration results in a significant drop in activity. Several explanations of this phenomenon are discussed. It is concluded that the herein observed stability of mixed Ir-Ru oxide systems is most likely a result of high corrosion resistance of the iridium component, but not due to an alteration of the material's electronic structure.

However, the approaches to modulating the electronic structure of surface metal ions are rare and far behind the demands. Here, we report a surface single atom decoration for adjusting the surface electronic structure of Co3O4, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity for OER, in which the isolated Ru single atoms were uniformly deposited on the surface of Co3O4 by an atomic layer deposition technology. As the OER catalyst, the as-made catalysts have exhibited a significantly enhanced catalytic activity (with increasing to 95.5 times) and a dramatically decreased overpotential. The density functional theory calculations reveal that the single-atom Ru acts as a promotor to adjust the 3d electronic structure of adjacent Co atoms and to tune the binding energy between intermediates and activity sites, finally leading to enhanced catalytic activity.

These adventures guided the researchers towards water oxidation as a source of energy. In this study, a metal-organic framework (MOF)-based material was fabricated and catalyzed the lethargic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The synthesized material is characterized with different analytical techniques to confirm structural, morphological and textural properties. Its huge surface area (87 m(2)/g) rendered it a promising material to carry the OER. It exhibited shallow onset potential that is, 1.40 V vs. RHE and displayed an exceptionally low overpotential of 1.42 V vs. RHE to reach the benchmark current density (10 mA/cm(2)) with remarkably small Tafel slope that is, 34 mV/dec. It surpassed the state of the art electrocatalyst for OER, that is, IrO2 and RuO2 in efficiency as well as in stability.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1658-3655			WOS:000713014500001

Herein, we report novel one-dimensional (1D) Fe-doped alpha-Ni(OH)(2) nanobelts as OER-active electrocatalysts. In-depth characterizations revealed that Fe atoms are incorporated into the lattice of Ni(OH)(2), resulting in the strong electron interaction with active Ni sites. Moreover, a contraction of Ni-O bond distance induced by Fe is revealed by operando X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy under OER working condition, which leads to a near-optimized adsorption of oxygen intermediates. Consequently, the Fe-doped alpha-Ni(OH)(2) nanobelts deliver significantly promoted OER activity in alkaline solutions with a low OER overpotential of 236 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) along with good stability. This work provides a strategy for developing efficiently non-noble metal catalysts, gives insights to the Fe doping effect and the dynamic evolution of disturbed atomic and electronic structure of Ni active sites.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000702017100015

Metal-organic frameworks (MOF) can serve as templates to derive various hollow nanoarchitectures while the synthesis of hollow polyhedral electrocatalysts is still challenging. Herein we demonstrate a facile MOF-derived method to prepare hollow FeOOH polyhedra using MIL-53(Fe) particles as sacrifice templates, and then anchor them with dispersive Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets. The developed hollow FeOOH@Ni(OH)(2) composite with a honeycomb surface structure exhibits obviously enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in comparison with either Ni(OH)(2) or FeOOH, owing to their synergistic effect and unique hollow structure. The composite shows efficient OER activity with an overpotential of 310 mV@10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 70 mV dec(-1). The formation mechanism of hollow FeOOH@Ni(OH)(2) composite have been proposed and their electrochemical properties are investigated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

By changing the calcination temperature, we investigated the correlation between the nanostructure and catalytic performance of mesoporous Mn1.8Fe1.2O4 catalysts. Mesoporous Mn1.8Fe1.2O4 exhibited high oxygen evolution activity in both the photochemical and cerium (IV)-driven water oxidation systems. The highest initial turnover frequency (TOF) of 4.6 x 10(-4) s(-1) per metal atom is obtained at neutral pH in photocatalytic water oxidation reaction, compared with those nonporous MnFe2O4, Fe3O4, and Mn3O4. In a cerium (IV)-driven environment, a high TOF of 1.8 x 10(-3) s(-1) per metal atom is achieved, which is at least two orders of magnitude more active than that of nonporous MnFe2O4. Multiple experimental results (e.g., XRD, FT-IR, SEM, TEM, and XPS) confirmed that mesoporous Mn1.8Fe1.2O4 materials are highly stable. Our results provide a facile method for synthesis of an inexpensive and highly active heterogeneous catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, controversy surrounding the incorporation of oxygen, a critical light element, and the rapid cooling rates needed to maintain the early dynamo have called this model into question. The predicted cooling rates imply early core temperatures that far exceed estimates of the lower mantle solidus, suggesting that early core evolution was governed by interaction with a molten lower mantle. Here we develop ab initio techniques to compute the chemical potentials of arbitrary solutes in solution and use them to calculate oxygen partitioning between liquid Fe-O metal and silicate melts at the pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions expected for the early core-mantle system. Our distribution coefficients are compatible with those obtained by extrapolating experimental data at lower P-T values and reveal that oxygen strongly partitions into metal at core conditions via an exothermic reaction. Our results suggest that the bulk of Earth's core was undersaturated in oxygen compared to the FeO content of the magma ocean during the latter stages of its formation, implying the early creation of a stably stratified oxygen-enriched layer below the core-mantle boundary (CMB). FeO partitioning is accompanied by heat release due to the exothermic reaction. If the reaction occurred at the CMB, this heat sink could have significantly reduced the heat flow driving the core convection and magnetic field generation.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2160-3308			WOS:000492373000001

The electrochemical study results showed that with the nominal composition of Ni1.5Co1.5S4, the cobalt nickel sulfide powder possesses an OER activity on a par with that of RuO2, while displaying superior cycling stability (>125 cycles) and a decent power density of 87 mW cm(-2) at 150 mA cm(-2) in zinc-air batteries. The electrochemical study of the series of cobalt nickel sulfides made herein suggests that a high electronic conductivity is responsible for the high bifunctional performance, with Ni(iii) being identified as a contributor to the OER, while Co(ii) and Ni(ii) are identified as contributors to the ORR activity. These cathode materials would be highly suitable for safe, sustainable, and long-life zinc-air secondary batteries.									16	2	0	0	0	0	16			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000524587800017

In this Letter, we investigate the tuning of thesurface electronic properties of electrocatalysts via polymermodification. We show that when a nickel oxide water oxidationcatalyst is coated with polytetrafluoroethylene, stable Ni-CFxbonds are introduced at the nickel oxide/polymer interface,resulting in shifting of the reaction selectivity away from theoxygen evolution reaction and toward hydrogen peroxideformation. It is shown that the electron-withdrawing characterof the surfacefluorocarbon molecule leaves a slight positivecharge on the water oxidation intermediates at the adjacent active nickel sites, making their bonds weaker. The concept ofmodifying the surface electronic properties of an electrocatalyst via stable polymer modification offers an additional route totune multipathway reactions in polymer/electrocatalyst environments, like with ionomer-modified catalysts or with membraneelectrode assemblies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2380-8195			WOS:000802291300002	35601628

Although many studies have employed n-type semiconductor particle systems to investigate cocatalyst effects, evaluating only the catalytic activity of H-2 and oxygen (O-2) evolution has been limited by (1) the difficulty of transferring an electron injected into the conduction band of a semiconductor to a cocatalyst due to the formation of a Schottky barrier when a metallic cocatalyst for H2 evolution contacts the n-type semiconductor and (2) the potential for a reverse water-splitting reaction, which occurs due to the promotion of the reduction of the evolved O-2 by the cocatalyst. To overcome these limitations, in the present study, we eliminated the adverse effect of the Schottky barrier by obtaining ohmic contact between the semiconductor and the metal or metal oxide cocatalysts, and we used two separate reaction chambers for H-2 and O-2 evolution to avoid reverse water-splitting reactions such as H2O2 recombination or the photoreduction of O-2. A 23 nm thick rhodium layer deposited on a platinum board exhibited relatively high performance, a 3-fold increase compared with the absence of a metal or metal oxide cocatalyst thin layer.									30	0	0	0	2	0	30			1932-7447			WOS:000353603500053

Generally, the upper limit of current density in an electrochemical reaction is determined by the mass transfer of the reactant. Here, we propose a dual bubble layer model for the reactant transfer resistance of the oxygen evolution reaction in AWE. Using simple cylindrical nickel electrodes of different diameters, we conducted electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and microscopic observations with a high-speed video camera. The relationship between the polarization curve of the oxygen evolution reaction in AWE and the mass transfer resistance of hydroxide ions was investigated. At current densities above 0.5 A cm(-2), the bubble layer completely covered the electrode surface. This bubble layer consisted of two layers: an inner one formed by numerous primary bubbles generated on the electrode, and an outer one formed by coalesced large bubbles. The outer layer induces an additional solution resistance, R-sb. Changes in R-sb under various conditions were successfully explained by the thickness and void fraction of the bubble layer, conductivity of the solution, and tortuosity through the gap between bubbles. The inner layer resists the diffusion of hydroxide ions, and the resistance to hydroxide ion transfer through it (Rd) was modeled using the Warburg impedance element with a finite-length diffusion boundary. The charge-transfer resistance at the electrode surface (R-ct) is roughly inversely proportional to the current density. This result indicates R-ct is less sensitive to bubble coverage and almost all electrode surfaces are active in electrochemical reaction. The results showed that Rd increases with current density as much as Rct when the current density exceeds 1.0 A cm(-2). Up to a high current density of 2.5 A cm(-2), the change in polarization curve (delta E/delta i) could be quantitatively explained by the sum of the bulk solution resistance, R-s0, additional solution resistance R-sb in the gaps between large bubbles, diffusion resistance Rd in the inner bubble layer, and charge-transfer resistance R-ct at the electrode surface.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000858909500005

Cyclic voltammetry on adhered Ni(OH)(2) microparticles enables rapid screening of four types of commercially available, battery-grade, nickel hydroxide samples and allows the separation of the oxidation process from the oxygen evolution reaction. With large pasted electrodes, due to their high uncompensated resistance (R-u), these processes are poorly resolved. Pasted (beta-nickel hydroxide electrodes with a specific capacity of between 190 and 210 mAh g(-1) are charged and discharged at constant currents greater than 15C (18 mA cm(-2)). With no voltage limit in the charging profile, excess oxygen evolution occurs and capacity fading is observed within the first 50 cycles. Loss of capacity is attributed to the degradation of the electrode due to excess oxygen evolution at switching potentials greater than 0.55 V versus Hg/HgO (1 M KOH). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements confirm the formation of gamma-NiOOH in these electrodes. Limiting the cell voltage to 1.5 V, and thereby minimizing oxygen evolution, results in no observed capacity loss within 100 cycles, and only (beta-Ni(OH)(2) can be detected by XRD phase analysis.

Herein, we have reported a strongly coupled 3D hybrid electrocatalyst, which consists of N-doped MoO2 with Ni3S2 grown on Ni foam (N-MoO2/Ni3S2 NF) through an annealing treatment, followed by a thermal ammonia reaction. This N-MoO2/Ni3S2 with a particle size of similar to 50 nm was evenly grown on the Ni substrate in this 3D hybrid system. Benefiting from the strong coupling effect, the N-MoO2/Ni3S2 NF exhibited a high HER performance in basic media, with a small value of the Tafel slope (76 mV dec(-1)) and a low potential of 517 mV at 1000 mA cm(-2), which was superior to that of Pt/C (631 mV at 1000 mA cm(-2)). Experimental results revealed that constructing a coupling interface between N-MoO2 and Ni3S2 facilitated the absorption and dissociation of water molecules, consequently boosting the HER activity. Additionally, the 3D N-MoO2/Ni3S2 NF hybrid could act as a bifunctional electrode for both anode (biomass upgrading) and cathode (HER), which only required a lower potential of 2.08 V at 100 mA cm(-2) as compared to the overall water splitting (2.25 V) and achieved a high biomass conversion ratio of over 90%. Moreover, substituting oxygen evolution reaction by urea oxidation reaction also can assist energy-saving hydrogen evolution for 3D N-MoO2/Ni3S2 NF.									57	3	0	0	3	0	58			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000480498600027	31305069

Here, iron and oxygen codoped cobalt phosphide nanoparticles (O-Co1-xFexPy, x = 0-0.42) are prepared by reacting metal-organic framework with phosphorus under solvothermal conditions. When electrochemically catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH, O-Co0.58Fe0.42Py supported on the nickel foam exhibits the best activity, with only 232 mV overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) OER current densities. O-Co0.58Fe0.42Py is robust toward the long-term OER, and surface phosphide layers transform to (oxy)hydroxides during the OER. O-Co1-xFexPy also shows better OER activity than Co3O4 nanoparticles and commercial IrO2. The abundant electrochemically active sites exposed by the highly porous morphology and the electron interactions between Co and Fe that accelerate the OER intermediate adsorption process could account for the observed high OER activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000850685900001

Keeping in mind the current scenario, herein, we have synthesized bimetallic transition metal chalcogenides (CoTe2@CdTe and CoSe2@CdSe) by a very easy, single step hydrothermal process. During the synthesis, two different morphologies (i.e. spherical and wire) were obtained depending on the selection of chalcogen. It was found that Te based nanocomposite i.e. CoTe2@CdTe showed a symmetrical nanowire array morphology with a high electrocatalytic surface area and good electrocatalytic activity towards both HER and OER. The structural, morphological and electrochemical features of synthesized nanocomposites were characterized by various useful techniques (like field emission scanning electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction analysis etc.) to confirm their successful synthesis. The CoTe2@CdTe nanowire array has shown a small onset potential value, high current density, low Tafel slope value along with high stability towards overall water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, their synthesis remains a challenge due to the thermodynamic immiscibility of the constituent multimetallic elements in a sulfide structure. Herein, for the first time the synthesis of high-entropy metal sulfide (HEMS, i.e., (CrMnFeCoNi)S-x) solid solution nanoparticles is reported. Computational and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis suggest that the (CrMnFeCoNi)S-x exhibits a synergistic effect among metal atoms that leads to desired electronic states to enhance OER activity. The (CrMnFeCoNi)S-x nanoparticles show one of the best activities (low overpotential 295 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH solution) and good durability (only slight polarization after 10 h by chronopotentiometry) compared with their unary, binary, ternary, and quaternary sulfide counterparts.

In this work, amorphous NiFe-LDH (A-NiFe-LDH) with abundant active sites are synthesized by using Ni(II) nitrilotriacetate complex anion ([NTANi](-)) as morphological control agent, which can expose more active sites of NiFe-LDH by controlling crystalline phase and grain size of NiFe-LDH. Structural characterization demonstrates that [NTANi](-) is adsorbed on the surface of A-NiFe-LDH and confirms A-NiFe-LDH is amorphous. The electrocatalytic activity of A-NiFe-LDH for OER is much higher than that of both RuO2 and pristine NiFe-LDH. A-NiFe-LDH has low OER overpotential of 241 mV at 10 mV cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1). The high electrocatalytic activity of A-NiFe-LDH could be attributed to its amorphous structure. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, a FeCoNi coordinated benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (FeCoNiBTC) metal-organic framework (MOF) was synthesized by one-step solvothermal method for OER. A rapid in-situ chemical and electrochemical transformation was observed on the surface of the FeCoNiBTC MOF during OER process. The formed catalytic active FeCoNiOx(OH)(y) species retained the unique structure feature of initial FeCoNiBTC, moreover, it possessed multiple transition metal active nodes that cooperate with each other to adjust the electronic structure. Owing to the above structure advantages, the in-situ transformed FeCoNiOx(OH)(y) showed excellent OER catalytic activity with a small overpotential of 230 mV to achieve the 100 mA.cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 50.2 mV dec(-1), and superior stability of almost 80 h in alkaline aqueous solution.

Then, CoG@F127 is coated by polydopamine (PDA) to form CoG@F127@PDA. After the calcination with Se powder, CoG@F127@PDA is transformed into the ball-flower hierarchical structure Co0.85Se-NC/C, in which Co0.85Se nanoparticles are coated with nitrogen doped carbon (NC).

Physical and electrochemical methods are used to elucidate the effect of the physical and chemical properties of the IFG catalysts modified by spray pyrolysis and post treatment on the OER activity and stability under harshly oxidizing conditions in 0.1 M HClO4. The IFG-AHT catalyst synthesized via ultrasonic pyrolysis followed by acid and heat treatment exhibits superior OER activity among the IFG catalysts. The mass activity was two-fold higher and the stability is superior to that of the commercially available Ir catalyst, indicating that the metal (oxide) dissolution rate and the interaction between Ir and the hybrid support affect the cost and lifetime of OER catalysts.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000470937300007

In this study, the TiO2 nanorods were strategically modified by the WO3 and TiCl4 from the aspects of the charge utilization efficiency and the active surface area for improving photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance. Comparing with that of the pristine TiO2, the photocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution was obviously enhanced after depositing the WO3 layer, attributing to the efficient separation and the restrained recombination of the photogenerated charges. The further optimization was achieved through the surface modification with TiCl4 to extend the active surface area, leading to significant enhancement of the oxidation performance with similar to 211.9 enhancement factor. These intriguing results expand the comprehensive understanding of the photoinduced charges transfer in the TiO2 heteronanostructure and give a better manipulation of their applications in the solar nanodevices of the energy conversion.

However, the operating potential is significantly larger than the thermodynamic requirements. Herein, the ternary FeCo2Mo5 layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets grown on the surface of a vulcanized Ni foam (FeCo2Mo5 LDH/Ni3S2/NF) are proposed to improve the mass and electron transport for driving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), where the integrated and a large electrode/electrolyte interface for mass transfer, and the construction of a Ni3S2/NF heterojunction can facilitate electron mobility from the surface to the inner region, leading to a high valence of FeCo2Mo5 LDH with favorable OER kinetics. Therefore, the catalyst exhibits excellent OER activity with the ultralow overpotential of 128 and 300 mV at the current density of 10 and 100 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH and activity retention over 12 h at 95 mA cm-2.

Herein, we develop a feasible electrospinning strategy for the facile fabrication of a Co3O4/CeO2 heterostructure in situ embedded in N-doped carbon nanofibers (h-Co3O4/CeO2@N-CNEs) as a high-performance electrocatalyst for the OER Unlike previously reported Co3O4/CeO2 composites, the as-prepared Co3O4/CeO2 heterostructure presents hollow and porous features. The nanopores can develop within Co3O4/CeO2 nanocrystals with an analogous mechanism to void formation in the Kirkendall effect. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that h-Co3O4/CeO2@N-CNFs can enable high OER activity with a low overpotential of 310 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density and good stability that can maintain 40 000 s without perceptible attenuation, outperforming those of the commercial RuO2 catalyst. The outstanding OER performance originates from the important synergies by combining hollow Co3O4/CeO2 heterostructures and three-dimensional porous N-CNF networks.									70	5	0	0	4	0	70			2168-0485			WOS:000494894200044

Especially, exploring nonprecious metal alternatives to replace traditional noble metal catalysts with high cost and poor durability is the paramount mission. In this paper, we utilize property-flexible ZIF-67 and sulfur-functionalized graphene oxide to obtain a cobalt, nitrogen, and sulfur codoped nanomaterial with 3D hierarchical porous structures, owing to their rich dopant species and good conductivity. The crosslinked structures of polyhedron particles throughout the whole carbon framework speeds up the mass transportation and charge-delivery processes during oxygen-evolving reactions. Also, by exploring the location and coordination type of sulfur dopants, we emphasize the effects of sulfone and sulfide functional groups anchored into the graphitic structure on enhancing the catalytic abilities for ORR and OER. To note, compared to the noble metal electrocatalysts, the best-performing CoO@Co3O4/NSG-650 (0.79 V) is 40 mV less active than the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.83 V) for ORR and merely 10 mV behind IrO2 (1.68 V) for OER. Besides, the metric between ORR and OER difference for CoO@Co3O4/NSG-650 to evaluate its overall electrocatalytic activity is 0.90 V, surpassing 290 and 430 mV over Pt/C (1.19 V) and IrO2 (1.33 V). Comprehensively, the as-prepared CoO@Co3O4/NSG-650 indicates excellent bifunctional catalytic activities for ORR and OER, which shows great potential for replacing noble metal catalysts in the application of fuel cells and metal air batteries.									36	0	0	0	0	0	36			1944-8244			WOS:000426618000044	29389106

Although nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (NCNT) arrays are now capable of catalyzing ORR efficiently, their hydrophobic surface and base-growth mode are found to limit the catalytic performance in the practical ZABs. Here, the concept of an apically dominant mechanism in improving the catalytic performance of NCNT by precisely encapsulating CoNi nanoparticles (NPs) within the apical domain of NCNT on the Ni foam (denoted as CoNi@NCNT/NF) is demonstrated. The CoNi@NCNT/NF exhibits a more excellent catalytic performance toward both ORR and OER than that of traditional NCNT derived from the base-growth method. The ZAB coin cell using CoNi@NCNT/NF as an air electrode shows a peak power density of 127 mW cm(-2) with an energy density of 845 Wh kg(Zn)(-1) and rechargeability over 90 h, which outperforms the performance of PGM catalysts. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the ORR catalytic performance of the CoNi@NCNT/NF is mainly attributed to the synergetic contributions from NCNT and the apical active sites on NCNT near to CoNi NPs.									114	9	0	0	1	0	117			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000438706700025

Pyrrhotite Fe7S8 has become a research hotspot due to its abundant reserves, high electrical conductivity and excellent catalytic activity. In general, introducing metal heteroatoms into transition metal sulfides (TMSs) can effectively enhance the activity and stability of TMSs. Herein, Co-doped pyrrhotite Fe7S8 nanosheets were obtained by a straightforward two-step method consisting of hydrothermal treatment followed by subsequent heat treatment. Results from XPS analysis and contact angle measurements showed that doping optimized the chemical environment around iron atoms and enhanced the adsorption of water molecules on the surface of Fe7S8, thereby greatly improving the electrocatalytic efficiency of water electrolysis. Compared with other counterparts, Co0.95Fe6.05S8 exhibited superior OER activity with an overpotential of 311 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and higher performance towards HER with an overpotential of 284 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution. In sum, Co0.95Fe6.05S8 is promising as a bifunctional catalyst for water splitting under alkaline conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000682370500002

The cv profiles of these alloys are quite different when tested after steady state polarization compared with potential cycling. The electrochemical behaviour of Ni-Co alloys shifted substantially from characteristics of Co to those of Ni. XPS analysis was used to identify the changes in surface oxidation species caused by electrochemical treatments. The oxides formed on amorphous alloys are different from those on crystalline alloys, in terms of their oxidation states, the amount of hydroxyl ions and solvent, film thickness, and ratio of components in the film. Furthermore, a hydrous oxide film, consisting of a micro-porous structure filled with solvent and hydroxyl ions, which is electrocatalytically active for the oxygen evolution reaction, was formed on potential cycled amorphous Ni-Co alloys.									96	5	0	0	5	0	98			0013-4686			WOS:A1992JG70700018

However, how to efficiently introduce borate has always been a challenge. Here, a facile and scalable molten salt method is developed to successfully dope borate into FeNi layered double hydroxides (FeBi@FeNi LDH) for efficient OER. The molten salt method can not only promote the formation of evenly dispersed nano-pompous FeBi precursor, thus providing the possibility to realize the direct doping of borate and the increase of mass, charge transfer and oxygen evolution active sites in FeNi LDH, but also promote the in-situ growth of FeBi@FeNi LDH on the conductive iron foam, improving conductivity and stability of the material. The results indicate that the synthesized FeBi@FeNi LDH shows enhanced OER activity by delivering current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 246 and 295 mV and showing a small Tafel slope of 56.48 mV dec(-1), benefiting from the optimization of geometric structure of active sites as well as the adjustment of electron density by borate doping especially in the case of molten salt. In addition, the sample can maintain durability at an industrial current density of 100 mA cm(-1) for 90 h. This work provides a new way for the construction of efficient catalysts using boron doping assisted by molten salt. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

It has previously been proposed(1,2) that photosynthetic reaction centres capable of splitting water arose by about 3 billion years ago on the basis of the inferred presence of manganese oxides in Archaean sedimentary rocks. However, this assumes that manganese oxides can be produced only in the presence of molecular oxygen(3), reactive oxygen species(4,5) or by high-potential photosynthetic reaction centres(6,7). Here we show that communities of anoxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms biomineralize manganese oxides in the absence of molecular oxygen and high-potential photosynthetic reaction centres. Microbial oxidation of Mn(II) under strictly anaerobic conditions during the Archaean eon would have produced geochemical signals identical to those used to date the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis before the Great Oxidation Event(1,2). This light-dependent process may also produce manganese oxides in the photic zones of modern anoxic water bodies and sediments.									53	1	0	0	24	0	54			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000502792400063	31802001

Herein, we ingeniously designed a simple one-pot hydrothermal method to construct a 3D porous "celosia-like " heterogeneous framework of FeCo-layered double hydroxide (FeCo-LDH) and P-doped molybde-num oxide (P-MoO3) grown in-situ on MXene-modified nickel foam substrate (denoted as P-MoO3 FCL MXene/ NF), with high conductivity, highly hydrophilic properties, and favorable kinetics. Density functional theory calculations (DFT) demonstrate that the electronic engineering tuning of electron dissipation and aggregation at the heterogeneous interface of P-MoO3 and FeCo-LDH optimizes the electron transfer rate of the active site and the d-band center near the Fermi level, thereby reducing the adsorption energy of H and O reaction intermediates (H*, OH*, OOH*) and improves the intrinsic catalytic activity. As expected, benefiting from the strong chemical and electron synergistic effect between heterogeneous structures, the synthesized P-MoO3 FCL MXene/NF het-erogeneous framework exhibits excellent activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a low overpotential of 179 mV and 118 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, and Faraday efficiency of up to 96 %. Significantly, the overpotential of 1.53 V is enough to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in a two-electrode configuration which is greatly superior to other bifunctional electrocatalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000777757000001

Here, we have reported an effective strategy to synthesize TMS- and TMP-assembled hierarchical anode (CuS@CoS2) and cathode (Cu3P@Co2P) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. It is found that the three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical electrodes not only provide a large number of active sites to promote the apparent catalytic activity, but also present tuned valence state of Co, which enhances the intrinsic activity of the active sites. Therefore, the CuS@CoS 2 anode possesses excellent OER activity with an overpotential of 230 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), and the Cu3P@Co2P cathode exhibits good HER performance with a low overpotential of 95 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). Impressively, the CuS@CoS2//Cu3P@Co2P electrolyzer deliver a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at a cell voltage of 1.55 V for overall water splitting, which is better than most reported TMS and TMP based catalysts.

Herein, (N, P) codoped CoS2 nanoclusters embedded inside TiO2 nanoporous films (denoted as N, P/CoS2@TiO2 NPFs) are synthesized as novel bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts for ZABs. The catalytic activity and stability are promoted by the (N, P)-dopants due to the enhanced conductivity, increased active surface area, and facilitated reaction kinetics. The N, P/CoS2@TiO2 NPFs exhibit exceptional onset potentials of 0.91 and 1.41 V for ORR and OER, respectively. When used as cathodes in ZABs, the N, P/CoS2@TiO2 NPFs exhibit a reduced charge-discharge gap of 0.8 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and a stable cycling performance over 130 h, surpassing the conventional Pt/C+IrO2 catalysts. Moreover, the assembled ZABs delivering a specific capacity of 610 mAh g(-1) can be used for flexible devices.

We herein report a methodology which uses an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) co-catalyst, such as Ru and RuO2 together with a highly active ORR catalyst. The co-catalyst is applied in the cathode layer with loadings of 0.035 - 0.04 mg(Ru)/cm(2) and is uniformly mixed with the ORR catalyst prior to electrode preparation. Oxygen evolution catalysts (OER) like Ru/C and RuO2/C mixed with ORR catalysts enhance the oxidation of water/OH- to oxygen and therefore provide significant protection of other redox active species at high cathode potentials Our measurements indicate that loss in ECSA, carbon support and activity for ORR catalyst combined with OER was significantly reduced as compared to an unprotected catalyst layer.					9th Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Symposium (PEMFC) Conducted Under the Auspices of the 216th Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society-Inc9th Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Symposium (PEMFC) Conducted Under the Auspices of the 216th Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society-Inc	OCT 04-09, 2009OCT 04-09, 2009	Electrochem Soc Inc; Electrochem Soc, Energy Technol Div; Electrochem Soc, Ind Electrochemistry & Electrochem Engn; Electrochem Soc, Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; Electrochem Soc, Battery Div; Automot Fuel Cell Cooperat Corp; Ion Power; N E Chemcat Corp; Pine Res Instrumentat Inc; Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo; Toyota Motor Engn & Mfg Amer; Tokuyama Corp; Umicore AG & Co KG; UTC Power CorpElectrochem Soc Inc; Electrochem Soc, Energy Technol Div; Electrochem Soc, Ind Electrochemistry & Electrochem Engn; Electrochem Soc, Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; Electrochem Soc, Battery Div; Automot Fuel Cell Cooperat Corp; Ion Power; N E Chemcat Corp; Pine Res Instrumentat Inc; Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo; Toyota Motor Engn & Mfg Amer; Tokuyama Corp; Umicore AG & Co KG; UTC Power Corp	Vienna, AUSTRIAVienna, AUSTRIA	13	2	0	0	0	0	14			1938-5862		978-1-60768-088-8	WOS:000329585500054

However, the research about the relationship between water-splitting activity and BO6 structure is largely lacking. Here, we report the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of LaNiO3 (LNO) by changing the NiO6 structure using compositional change and strain. The 5 atom % La deficiency in LNO resulted in an increase of the Ni-O-Ni bond angle and an expansion of bandwidth, enhancing the charge transfer ability. In-plane compressive strain derives the higher d(z)(2) orbital occupancy, leading to suitable metal-oxygen bond strength for OER. Because of the synergistic effect of A-site deficiency and compressive strain, the overpotential (eta) of compressively strained L0.95NO film is reduced to 130 mV at j = 30 mu A/cm(2) compared with nonstrained LNO (eta = 280 mV), indicating a significant enhancement in OER.									31	0	0	0	1	0	31			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000592495700032	33135899

Herein, we report a Mott-Schottky heterojunction electrocatalyst of the Co2P2O7@N, P co-doped carbon nanocages, in which the metallic N, P co-doping carbon layer as a co-catalyst can effectively modulate the overfilled Co center e(g) orbital occupation of the Co2P2O7 nanoparticles and stabilize the microstructure. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations also reveal the build-in electric field promoted local charge polarization in the heterojunction interface greatly boosts the targeted intermediate (OOH*) adsorption with a higher intrinsic activity. The asobtained electrocatalysts manifest superior OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of only 310 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and negligible current loss for 100 h in 1.0 M KOH, much lower than the benchmark RuO2 (370 mV).

The galvanostatic cycling was employed to characterize the electrochemical properties on these carbon electrodes during the ORR and OER processes. The ex situ far/mid-infrared spectroscopy and in situ UV-vis absorption spectroscopy were employed to quantitatively analyze the reaction products adsorbed on the electrode surface and dissolved in solution, respectively. Our results demonstrated that lithium peroxide (LiO2) is a major ORR product on the porous carbon electrode, while the lithium superoxide (LiO2) becomes a major ORR product on a glassy carbon electrode. On the contrary, a large amount of byproducts, such as lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), was also observed only on the porous carbon electrode surfaces at the end of the ORR Li2CO3 gradually decomposed with the increasing potential but remained on the electrode surface, depending on the upper potential limit of the OER. The accumulation of the byproducts during the ORR/OER results in electrode passivation and capacity fading. A better understanding of the ORR/OER mechanism and possible reason for poor reversibility on these electrodes has been achieved in this study.									43	1	0	0	2	0	43			1932-7447			WOS:000374811100015

Optimal cobalt doping (5%) in CuO manifests an improved OER activity with an overpotential of 120 mV, which is similar to 2.66 times lower than that obtained with pristine CuO to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), superior to the state-of-the-art OER catalysts. A Tafel slope of 118 mV dec(-1) with an electrochemical active surface area of 40 cm(2) and a charge transfer resistance of 2.58 Omega were achieved with 5% cobalt-doped CuO, which validate the role of metal doping and importance of doping in transition metal oxides to enhance the electrochemical OER activity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000703338600075

Metal-organic frameworks have attracted increased attention as a new type of electrocatalytic material. Here, a self-assembled three-dimensional FeNi-metal-organic framework electrode was synthesized in situ on a nickel foam by a solvent-thermal method, which is used directly in the oxygen-evolution reaction. The internal porous structure and synergy between the Fe and Ni metals enhance OER activity. Fe introduction enhanced the Ni electron density, increased the active sites and yielded excellent electrocatalytic performance. A low peak potential that started at 1.36 V was observed. The overpotential was only 190 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which corresponded to a small Tafel slope of 27.6 mV dec(-1). The overpotential was only 223 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). The stability of the electrode that was prepared in situ was improved significantly. No significant decrease in performance resulted during the 16-h stability test.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2365-6549			WOS:000468976000084

Here, using first principles calculations, the two-dimensional PtSe2/hBN heterojunction was first conceived. However, the rapid recombination of electrons and holes will inhibit the visible light catalytic efficiency of the heterojunction. In order to realize effective spatial separation of electrons and holes of the heterojunction, we tuned the band gap by doping two carbon atoms on the hBN monolayer to obtain the type-II PtSe2/hBNC heterojunction. Then through the comprehensive researches on structural, electronic and optical properties, it was found that the structure possesses excellent carrier mobility and exhibits a great oxygen evolution reaction performance with a low over-potential of 0.76 eV, which is an ideal photoelectrocatalyst and exhibits great light absorption performance. In this study, the possible mechanism of doped PtSe2/hBNC vdW heterojunction to promote photocatalysis and oxygen evolution ability was explained, which may pave the way for the practical design of more solar-driven high-quality water splitting photoelectrocatalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000724333500006

Thus, this study demonstrates a simple strategy for a defect-rich and porous cobalt phosphide nanowire array electrocatalyst derived from a MOF material on a nickel foam, which drives water splitting well in alkaline media. Excitingly, p-CoP/NF shows an excellent catalytic performance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction with an ultralow overpotential of 35 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2). Similarly, it is capable of the oxygen evolution reaction and reaches a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential of 253 mV. Furthermore, when the anode and cathode of a two-electrode electrolytic cell are both assembled from p-CoP/NF electrodes, this cell requires a voltage of only 1.55 V to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits satisfactory durability, which fully demonstrates the potential application of p-CoP/NF electrodes for water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000814237700001

The anodic deposition of oxide-matrix composites from electrolytes containing either OPb2+, or Tl+ ions and catalytic (nano)particles in suspension produces electrocatalytic materials especially suitable for anodic processes (oxygen evolution reaction) owing to the oxides stability towards oxidative degradation. The embedding of conducting catalytic particles may have a major effect on the nucleation and growth of the matrix, leading to very rough or porous deposits. The content in catalytic dispersed phase cannot be increased at will. However, dispersed phase volume fractions of the order of 0.1-0.2, attained without difficulty, are high enough to ensure marked electrocatalytic effects. In comparison with the pure matrices, composite anodes exhibit much lower overpotantials and lower Tafel slopes, comparable to those of electrocatalytic materials produced by other methods.

Experiments were carried out in the tip substrate voltammetric mode where the faradaic current flowing to the tip is recorded while cycling the potential of the substrate. The tip current was made pH-sensitive by holding the tip potential in a region where a pH-dependent reaction occurs. Three reactions were considered: hydrogen evolution, Pt oxide formation and oxygen evolution. The results provide direct evidence of a pH decrease close to the substrate during hydrogen desorption, oxide formation and oxygen evolution. Conversely, a pH increase is observed during oxide reduction, hydrogen adsorption and hydrogen evolution. A quantitative assessment of pH changes is proposed; variations as large as one pH unit were observed.									40	0	0	0	2	0	40			0956-5000			WOS:A1996VT01600016

In this work, a two-step corrosion engineering is proposed to construct ultrathin NiFe-LDH and high-conductivity Ni9S8 composites (denoted as NiFe-LDH/Ni9S8/NF) at room temperature. By ingeniously using the corrosion reaction between nickel foam (NF) and S2O32- under acidic condition, Ni9S8 was firstly formed on the surface of Ni foam. Then, ultrathin NiFe-LDH nanosheets were precipitated on the Ni9S8 surface through an ultrafast Fe2+ ions-assisted corrosion treatment. Featured with fast electron/mass transfer rates, sheet-stacked structure, and superior hydrophilicity, NiFe-LDH/Ni9S8/NF exhibits an enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with low overpotentials of 223 and 265 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Such feasible, economical, and scale-up synthesis method might open a new avenue for the wide-scale fabrication of materials for various electrochemical applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000715355800001

The coating was per-formed by chemical surface precipitation under different conditions, and the characterization of Y(OH)(3)-coating layer was evaluated accordingly. The electrochemical properties of three as-prepared samples with different coating surface were characterized and compared at different temperature. The results reveal that the sample with dense and porous surface retains the excellent performance at elevated temperatures, and the necessary coating amount is only 0.55 at.%. The mechanism analysis suggests that the chemical nature and morphology of the coating layer plays an important role in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The coating surface with dense and porous morphology, larger relative surface content and higher utilization ratio of yttrium is more effective on controlling OER and improving the high-temperature performance of Ni(OH)(2) electrode for nickel-metal hydride (Ni/MH) batteries.

In this paper, the pulsed laser deposition technique was first used to fabricate high quality and well-defined CoO-La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-delta(LSMO) heterostructured electrocatalysts. The current density was about 70 and 20 times larger with respect to single-phase CoO and LSMO thin film electrocatalysts, respectively. The enhancement of electrocatalytic activity was investigated in detail by using electrochemical and X-ray photoemission/absorption spectroscopies. The introduction of the LSMO intermediate layer not only promoted charge transfer kinetics but also resulted in a larger Co3+/Co2+ ratio due to the partial oxidation of the CoO layer during film growth. The design of coatings with a tunable oxygen electrocatalytic activity implementing the heterostructure engineering approach was demonstrated.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2574-0962			WOS:000563784400077

The evolution of aerobes from the earliest anaerobic prokaryotes resulted in a variety of metabolic adaptations. Many of these adaptations center on the need to sustain oxygen-sensitive reactions and cofactors to function in the new oxygen-containing atmosphere. Still other metabolic pathways that were not sensitive to oxygen also diverged. This is likely due to the physical separation of the organisms, based on their ability to live in the presence of oxygen, which allowed for the independent evolution of the pathways. Through the study of metabolic pathways in anacrobes and comparison to the more established pathways from aerobes, insight into metabolic evolution can be gained. This, in turn, can allow for extra- polation to those metabolic pathways occurring in the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA). Some of the unique and uncanonical metabolic pathways that have been identified in the archaea with emphasis on the biochemistry of an obligate anaerobic methanogen, Methanocaldococcus jannaschii are reviewed.

Herein, the precursors (cobalt-iron glycerate composites, Co(x)Fe(y)G@F127 with different Co/Fe ratios) were prepared with the influence of polymeric surfactant Pluronic F127 by a hydrothermal process. The Co(x)Fe(y)G@F127 were transformed into CoxFey alloy with a little of carbon (CoxFey-C) after calcination treatment. In these catalysts, the Co5Fe5-C nanospheres constructed with small nanoparticles can give full play to the synergistic effect of Co and Fe atoms, and significantly improve the catalytic activity. In 1.0 M KOH, the Co5Fe5-C electrocatalyst required a low overpotential of 245 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction ( OER) and 165 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Based on the excellent catalytic performance for HER/OER, the bifunctional electrocatalyst of Co5Fe5-C were assembled into an alkaline electrolyzer, which can drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.46 V and show outstanding performance for overall water splitting.

Hydrogen was introduced into the anode, participating in the anode reaction. Carbon and aluminum were used as the cathode and reference electrodes, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry was applied in the cell to investigate the electrochemical behavior of oxygen ion on platinum and SnO2-based materials. The potential for oxygen evolution on these electrode materials was determined. Then, galvanostatic electrolysis was performed on the gas anode, showing a significant depolarization effect (a decrease of similar to 0.8 V of the anode potential) after the introduction of hydrogen, compared with no gas introduction or the introduction of argon. The results indicate the involvement of hydrogen in the anode reaction (three-phase-boundary reaction including gas, electrolyte and electrode) and give the possibility for the utilization of reducing gas anodes for aluminum electrolysis.									4	2	0	0	0	0	4			1003-6326	2210-3384		WOS:000347620300024

The calculations are performed both at the semilocal level and at the hybrid functional level. Moreover, anodic conditions are modeled and their effect on the OER free energy steps is evaluated. The free energies of the reaction steps indicate that for specific combinations of catalysts, the limitations due to the linear scaling relationship can be overcome, leading to smaller overpotentials for the overall OER. At the same time, a detailed analysis of the results reveals a strong dependence on the adopted functional. For both functionals, it is shown that the energy level of the highest occupied electronic state can serve as a descriptor to guide the search for the optimal catalyst acting as a hydrogen acceptor. These results support the bifunctional mechanism as a means to break the linear scaling relationship and to further reduce the overpotential of the OER.

Most notably, transition-metal-bearing LDHs are expected to serve as highly active electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their layered structure combined with versatile compositions. Furthermore, reducing the thickness of platelet LDH crystals to nanometer or even molecular scale via cleavage or delamination provides an important clue to enhance the activity. In this review, recent progresses on rational design of LDH nanosheets are reviewed, including direct synthesis via traditional coprecipitation, homogeneous precipitation, and newly developed topochemical oxidation as well as chemical exfoliation of parent LDH crystals. In addition, diverse strategies are introduced to modulate their electrochemical activity by tuning the composition of host metal cations and intercalated counter-anions, and incorporating dopants, cavities, and single atoms. In particular, hybridizing LDHs with conductive components or in situ growing them on conductive substrates to produce freestanding electrodes can further enhance their intrinsic catalytic activity. A brief discussion on future research directions and prospects is also summarized.									69	5	0	0	4	0	69			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000524664700001	34138111

And the research on reaction mechanism is particularly important in design and developing new catalysts. In this work, the special electrochemical tool of interdigitated array (IDA) electrodes was utilized in investigating the photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution reaction process and detecting the reaction product in situ with the generation-collection mode. TiO2 was taken as a model catalyst and was decorated onto the IDA generator electrode through an electrophoresis method, so that the photoelectrochemical water splitting can take place on the IDA generator and the reaction product can be detected directly with the IDA collector in real time. It is found that TiO2 can be successfully decorated onto the surface of IDA electrode with the expected photoelectrochemical activity, and the generation-collection mode reveals and distinguishes the production of O-2 from the overall photoelectrochemical current on TiO2 generator. The mass transfer process of O-2 from the TiO2 generator to the collector could be observed as well.

Prussian blue (PB) analogues with the structure of transition metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are viewed as attractive candidates for high-performance electrocatalysts, while how to achieve the decoration of metal sites without damage for improved reactivity is still challenging. Herein, a nanocomposite catalyst based on PB analogues on cobalt-nitrogen-doped porous hollow carbon microspheres (PB-Co/Co-N-PHCS) was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. Benefiting from multiple active sites, hierarchical porous structure, and high conductive hollow carbon shell, the catalyst showed outstanding electrocatalytic activity and durability for an oxygen evolution reaction (OER). More importantly, PB-Co/Co-N-PHCS also can serve as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting with high durability. This pioneering work provides a clue for the preparation of a new class of high-performance Prussian blue analogue-based hybrid electrocatalysts.									17	1	0	0	3	0	18			2168-0485			WOS:000541445800024

Although Fe-based catalysts, such as unary FeOOH compounds, suffer from insufficient activity, they are promising catalysts due to their low cost, rich redox properties and low toxicity. In this work, a unique defect-rich nanorod FeOOH catalyst (D-FeOOH) is rationally constructed by simple electron beam irradiation, which enhances the mass activity by 8 times compared with that for pristine FeOOH and achieves the highest rank among unary Fe catalysts reported to date. In situ Raman and hard X-ray absorption spectroscopic studies reveal that defects during the OER activation process can speed up the dynamic reconstruction from single beta-FeOOH to a mixed alpha/beta-FeOOH phase and modulate the ultimate atomic ratio of the mixed phase, which enhances the electrochemical performance. This work provides insight into the defect mechanism in FeOOH by accelerating the dynamic structural evolution during the OER process.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000729522000001

Fibrous materials are having peculiar interest owing to their fascinating properties. For efficient hydrogen fuel generation, electrocatalytic water splitting is one of the finest way of producing hydrogen in a pure form. But it is encountered by the counter oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in more often. As of now, noble metal based catalysts are utilized in the commercial sector. Some of the disadvantages associated with the noble materials are restrict their usage commercially. To address this issue, herein, we have synthesized One dimensional (1D), hydrated porous cobalt phosphate fibrous network by an ES method and act as an electrocatalyst for OER in both alkaline and neutral media for the first time, which exhibits an overpotential of 245 and 457 mV respectively at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) with astonishing stability.

It is found that Ir species in the as-obtained Ir(20)/Fe@NCNT-900 composite exist in two forms, Ir nanoclusters (1-2 nm) dotted on the wall of NCNT and the Ir atomically scattered on the Fe nanoparticles wrapped in the NCNT. Although the Ir content of Ir(20)/Fe@NCNT-900 is extremely low (-4 wt% Ir), the composite catalyst delivers excellent activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an exceptionally low overpotential of 4.7 mV/11 mV for HER and 300 mV/270 mV for OER to drive 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4/1.0 M KOH electrolyte respectively, which exceeds the commercial Pt/C (20 wt% Pt) and IrO2 benchmarks. In addition, it has much higher mass activity for OER at 1.55 V (1.78 A mg(Ir)(-1)) than those of the referenced catalysts in acid. The cell voltage of the two-electrode system assembled by Ir(20)/Fe@NCNT-900 for total water splitting in acidic and alkaline media are only 1.520 V and 1.510 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2) separately, lower than that of Pt/C||IrO2 and with a good stability.

Here, a novel double emulsion template method is proposed to design and prepare hierarchically multichambered, carbon-coated Ni0.4Fe2.6O4 nanoparticle superlattice microspheres (M-NFO@C-NSMs) for the highly efficient oxygen evolution. The high-temperature calcination under inert gas enables an improved electrochemical property by rationally transforming the long-chain organic capping ligands into partially graphitized uniform carbon coatings. More importantly, benefiting from the unique hierarchical superstructure with macro-/meso-/microporosities and three-dimensional continuous conductive carbon frameworks, M-NFO@C-NSMs exhibit comprehensively enhanced OER activity in a dilute alkaline electrolyte as compared to their solid counterparts and most spinel-based electrocatalysts reported to date. Notably, the collective property of supraparticles endowed M-NFO@C-NSMs with superior long-term cyclic stability. This work sheds light on the sophisticated design of functionalized supraparticles for efficient water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2692-4560		WOS:000692127400001

The FeCo-NSCC has a higher degree of graphitization and a high specific surface area of 359m2 g-1. The FeCo-NSCC exhibits a promising bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (OER/ORR) electrocatalytic activity with onset potential and half-wave potentials of 0.980 and 0.853V vs reversible hydrogen electrode for ORR, and a low overpotential of 351mV at 10mAcm-2 for OER, superior to that of state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C and RuO2. The FeCo-NSCC presents a vigorous bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalytic activities with the low DeltaE(E1/2 - Ej=10) of 0.727V, superior to most of the reported non-noble metal-based catalysts.

Manganese oxide, tungsten oxide and manganese-tungsten oxides were coated on the IrO2-coated titanium (IrO2/Ti electrode) by thermal decomposition. The oxygen evolution efficiencies at 200 A.m(-2) of the manganese oxide and tungsten oxide electrodes in 0.5 M NaCl solution at pH 8 and 30 degrees C were 70 and 68%, respectively. The efficiency for oxygen evolution is enhanced by small amounts of mutual additions into manganese oxide or tungsten oxide. In particular, the efficiencies of alpha-Mn2O3-type oxide with 15 mol% W6+ and WO3-type oxide with 10 mol% Mn2+ go up to over 92 and 86%, respectively Further increase in additives leads to the formation of MnWO4 and to a significant decrease in the oxygen evolution efficiency.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0916-1821			WOS:000073121800012

The irreversible release of lattice oxygen may lead to surface reconstruction and cathode-electrolyte interfacial reactions, transition metal (TM) dissolution, as well as microcrack evolution, etc. during cycling that limit the commercial application of LLO cathodes. Herein, we propose the design of a heteroepitaxial Fluorite(CeO2)@Rocksalt@Layered interface with oxygen buffering effects in Cobalt-free Li1.2Mn0.53Ni0.27O2 through the incorporation of ceria. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the fluorite CeO2 nanolayer with oxygen vacancies suppresses the irreversible lattice oxygen loss and cathodeelectrolyte interfacial reactions in LLOs. Moreover, the synergy involving the formed rocksalt interphase and Ce3+ doping in the bulk not only stabilizes the structural integrity, resulting in substantial enhancement of capacity/voltage retention, but also accelerates the electrochemical kinetics upon cycling. This finding may pave the path for utilizing the reversible oxygen redox process and designing new high capacity TM-oxide cathode materials.									42	2	0	0	1	0	44			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000561847400003

The development of a highly active and stable catalyst for OER is a challenging task. Electrochemically prepared amorphous metal-based catalysts have gained wide attention after the recent discovery of a cnbalt-phosphate (Co-Pi) catalyst: Herein, an amorphous iridium-phosphate (Ir-Pi) is investigated as an oxygen evolution catalyst. The catalyst is prepared by the anodic polarization of carbon paper electrodes in neutral phosphate buffer solutions containing IrCl3. The Ir-Pi film deposited on the substrate has significant amounts of phosphate and It centers in an oxidation state higher than +4. Phosphate plays a significant role in the deposition of the catalyst and also in its activity toward OER. The onset potential of OER on the Ir-Pi is about 150 mV lower in comparison with the Co-Pi under identical experimental conditions. Thus, Ir-Pi is a promising catalyst for electrochemical oxidation of water.									46	4	0	0	1	0	46			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000358897200011	26132593

Heteroatoms-doped carbon nanomaterials as cathodes for LOBs with improved electrochemical performance have attracted great attentions. Herein, we report an approach to synthesize holey graphene and a boron doped holey graphene (B-hG) with plenty of holey structure and high B doping level of 6 at. %. Benefiting from plenty of holey structures and B related active sites to accelerate the ORR and OER kinetics, the B-hGs (e.g., B-hG-700) cathode displays an extremely high capacity of 19698 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) and long cycling stability over 120 cycles. Both experimental results and density functional theory calculations indicate that the discharge products (e.g., Li2O2) prefer to nucleate and vertically grow near holes/edges sites, which facilitates the formation of relatively isolated and uniformly distributed Li2O2. Such formation process significantly reduces the agglomeration of Li2O2 and effectively provides many spaces to accommodate Li2O2, thus leading to the enhanced ORR and OER kinetic.

Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with layered structure has great potential in utilization as OER catalyst. However, lower OER activity of MoS2-based catalysts compared with commercial IrO2 catalysts limited their practical applications. Here, we report the synthesis of monodispersed and uniform yolk-shell structured MoS2 nanoreactors (O-MoS2@Pt) with size distribution of 563 +/- 14.8 nm through an oil-water microemulsion method. Interestingly, sulfur vacancy caused by oxygen doping could guide the Pt anchoring to generate uniform nanoparticles (ca. 10.9 nm) onto outer shell. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), and Xray absorption fine structure (XAFS) are employed to synergistically investigate the anchor mechanism. The O-MoS2@Pt nanoreactor with highly activated basal plane and interface presented an overpotential of 244 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), and a low Tafel slope of 53 mV/dec, which was much better than commercial IrO2 and most MoS2-based catalysts. Due to the prevention of agglomeration, enhanced mechanical stability, and regulation of gas release, all the developed yolk-shell structured nanoreactors exhibited negligible change of nanostructures and overpotentials after continuous cycling measurements for 24 h. In-situ XRD measurements indicated the endurability of the overall nanoreactor during the OER process. Density functional theory calculations revealed electron structures and thermodynamic reaction barriers can be efficiently modulated through introducing vacancy and Pt nanoparticles decorating, leading to highly improved OER activity. Our findings shed a light on the design of highly active catalyst for electrocatalytic water splitting through modulating electron structures and thermodynamic reaction barriers.									62	3	0	0	2	0	61			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000596609200001

On this basis, local electrical and electrochemical properties of a composite electrode were investigated with conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). It could be shown by CAFM measurement that the boundary between matrix and catalyst particles seemed to have special advantageous electrical properties. The SECM measurements showed the presence of mass transport phenomena with increased surface concentrations, whilst the thickness of the Nernst diffusion layer was very small. An intermediate was detected and assigned to be hydrogen peroxide. From all species involved in the oxygen evolution reaction (H2O2, H+ and O2), it was concluded that local active spots exist on the electrode on which hydrogen peroxide reacts to oxygen and protons. A two-step two-material process was suggested to explain the whole oxygen evolution mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2411-9717			SCIELO:S2225-62532008000500004

In the cyclic voltammograms, a couple of anodic and cathodic peaks have been observed. These peaks appeared for the electrochemical transformation of M(II) oxide reversible arrow M(III) oxide. With increasing cycling time, peak potentials continuously shifted to the cathodic direction and the peak currents increased remarkably. No steady-state voltammogram was appeared even after cycling up to 110 min. Increase in anodic peak current showed a gradual increase of current for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Compared with Ni electrode, remarkably low cathodic potentials for M(II) oxide reversible arrow M(III) oxide transformation and OER have been observed. Increase in temperature showed positive effects oil peak currents and peak potentials for the OER, and oxygen evolution potential shifted to the cathodic direction. The Tafel plots showed two well-defined Tafel regions. The exchange current density (i(o)) value increased remarkably and Tafel slope (b) value increased a little with increasing temperature.

An oxygen evolution catalyst is necessary to increase the photocurrent and reduce the onset potential. Most molecular water-oxidation catalysts studied thus far are transition-metal complexes. Herein we report the light-driven electrochemical water oxidation by the porphyrin J-aggregate. Oxygen generated from water was detected at the presence of Ag+ severing as the electron sacrificial agent. The catalytic activity of the metal-free porphyrin J-aggregate is deduced to be originated from the long-standing charge separation upon visible-light illumination. The Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer (PCET) mechanism involving H-bonding of water molecules to the free porphyrin base is suggested for the water oxidation reaction. These findings offer a new sight in photocatalytic activity of the porphyrin assembly as well as its functionalization in light energy conversion.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2365-6549			WOS:000403886100045

State-of-the-art zinc-air batteries (ZABs) are potential candidates for flexible energy supply; however, their development is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)/oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of an air cathode. Herein, we demonstrate a 3D integrated bifunctional oxygen electrode of NiCo2O4@NiCoFe-hydroxide nanoarrays for flexible all-solid-state ZABs. Owing to the intact mesoporous nanoarrays synergized with the amorphous trimetallic hydroxide sheath, the free-standing NiCo2O4@NiCoFe-hydroxide electrode exhibited excellent bifunctional activities with an ultralow potential difference of 695 mV between OER and ORR. The NiCo2O4@NiCoFe-hydroxide-based planar aqueous ZAB achieved high discharge capacity (723 mA h g(zinc)(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2)), high energy density (864.2 W h kg(zinc)(-1) at 5 mA cm(-2)) and long cycle life of up to 250 h. More significantly, cable-type all-solid-state ZABs fabricated with the 3D oxygen electrode demonstrated an impressive volumetric energy density of 38.1 mW h cm(-3) and high mechanical flexibility even after 2000 bending cycles, highlighting their enormous potential for flexible/wearable energy applications.									34	2	0	0	3	0	35			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521109000018

Herein, we report the phase-controlled synthesis of tungsten oxide (WO3) nanoplates via a wet-chemical approach. By adjusting the ratio of trioctylphosphine and trioctylphosphine oxide, oxygen vacancies are induced in WO3 at a relatively low temperature, accompanying the crystal structure transition from monoclinic to orthorhombic or pseudocubic phase. The experimental results and DFT calculations reveal that the increased oxygen vacant sites in WO3 lead to the upshift in both conduction band minimum and valence band maximum. The reformed band structure of reduced WO3 samples (WO3-x) enables the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution without cocatalyst at a maximum steady rate of 340 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) under simulated sunlight. Our work demonstrates a simple and effective strategy of introducing oxygen vacancy to WO3 for band structure tuning, which may be further extended to other metal oxide systems.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2574-0962			WOS:000504953500050		
J	Huo, Guanping; Guo, Xueyan					Huo, Guanping/0000-0002-2262-5357			Numerical Analyses of Heterogeneous CLC Reaction and Transport Processes in Large Oxygen Carrier Particles								PROCESSES				9	1					125	10.3390/pr9010125				JAN 2021	2021	Heterogeneous chemical looping combustion (CLC) reactions and conjugate transports in large oxygen carrier particles were numerically investigated with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches, in which a simplified noncatalytic reaction model was implemented for reducing intraparticle modelling computation. Volumic gas-solid reactions were treated as surface reactions based on the equivalent internal surface in the particle model. In large porous particles such as fixed bed CLC reactors, the heterogeneous reactions are often limited by intraparticle diffusion. Comprehensive analyses were conducted on transports across the particle surface and their influences on reactions inside the single particles. A threshold Reynolds number of external convections was found for the enhancement of intraparticle reactions. The heterogeneous reactions, intraparticle diffusions and interstitial transports in a fixed bed CLC reactor randomly packed with 597 spheres were thoroughly analysed with the same numerical approaches. Comprehensive insights of the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of scalars in the packed bed reactor were presented.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2227-9717		WOS:000611842700001

Local process investigations on composite electrodes: On the way to understanding design criteria for spray coated anodes in Zn electrowinning								Journal of the Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy				108	5			273	283						2008-05	2008	Several possible physico-chemical properties of composite electrodes for oxygen evolution are presented to describe experimental data for which a mathematical model had been developed. On this basis, local electrical and electrochemical properties of a composite electrode were investigated with conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). It could be shown by CAFM measurement that the boundary between matrix and catalyst particles seemed to have special advantageous electrical properties. The SECM measurements showed the presence of mass transport phenomena with increased surface concentrations, whilst the thickness of the Nernst diffusion layer was very small. An intermediate was detected and assigned to be hydrogen peroxide. From all species involved in the oxygen evolution reaction (H2O2, H+ and O2), it was concluded that local active spots exist on the electrode on which hydrogen peroxide reacts to oxygen and protons. A two-step two-material process was suggested to explain the whole oxygen evolution mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0038-223X			SCIELO:S0038-223X2008000500004

Transition metal nitrides (TMNs) show excellent OER performance mainly because of their unique electronic structure and high electrical conductivity. In this paper, we report a systematic study in order to explore the relationship between nitrogen deficiency and the OER activity of well-defined Co4N(1-x) (x > 0) thin film electrodes prepared by magnetron sputtering. The nitrogen deficiency is regulated by changing the Ar-N-2 flow ratio and annealing at high temperatures. We find that by decreasing nitrogen content, the surface of Co4N(1-x) film is more prone to be oxidized with forming a surface Co-N-O layer. The electrochemical measurements imply that the OER activity can be improved by introducing nitrogen deficiency. The above results could be ascribed to better bulk electrical conductivity and a higher surface ratio of Co3+ in more nitrogen-deficient electrocatalysts. These results possibly provide a new and facile route to promote the OER activity by tuning the nitrogen deficiency in TMNs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000818526500008

NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) is acknowledged as one of the most promising OER electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolytes. Herein, we report a novel stepwise approach to synthesize NiFe LDHs materials merging with carbon black (CB) via trisodium citrate (TC), modifying toward OER. Benefiting from the inimitable wrapped structure, the decreased size of porous nanosheets and the superconductivity of CB substrate, NiFe LDHs/CB-TC presents excellent catalytic features with a comparative overpotential (236 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and an ultralow Tafel slope (31 mV dec(-1)), which are almost lower than those of advanced catalysts associated with expensive carbonaceous materials. Therefore, it is expected that such a high-activity and low-cost material can be a promising catalyst employed for the electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2073-4344		WOS:000537227400090

Herein, we report a multilayered and facet-manipulated Ni-Co hydroxide with controllable flake and acicular-like morphologies, which was grown on self-supported substrates made of in situ grown carbon chainlike nanofibers on carbon cloth (CCNs@CC). The exposed crystal facets were controlled by the synthesis of electrocatalysts with different morphologies. The flake and acicular-like Ni-Co hydroxide on CCNs@CC exhibit the overpotential of 235 and 248 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and Tafel slope of 69 and 73 mV dec(-1), respectively. The high activity is contributed by the sufficient number of active sites provided by the multidimensional structures, as well as the rapid electron transportation due to the high conductivity of the CCNs. In addition, long-term stability without evident degeneration in 24 h was demonstrated during the OER process.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2574-0962			WOS:000557375200029

The structural and electronic properties of non-precious metals significantly affect electrocatalytic performance, which depends on the physicochemical structure of carbon substrates and the types of metal components. Herein, binary FeNi phosphide nanoparticles coupled with N,P-modified carbon nanosheets were fabricated through an universal carbonization-phosphorization approach. Besides the structural advantage of 2D nanosheets, the electronic structure change of bimetallic FeNi phosphides via modulating Fe/Ni ratio is another reason responded for the exceptional activities with reduced overpotentials of this hybridized catalyst for both hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions. Furthermore, by employing the fabricated materials as electrode catalysts for overall water splitting and rechargeable Zn-air batteries with liquid and solid-state electrolytes, excellent performances are achieved in these energy conversion and storage devices, revealing the significant feasibility for practical applications.									70	7	0	0	8	0	71			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000519528800013

However, the synergy between these two components is still controversial. Herein, we report a facile immersion method for the synthesis of binder-free nickel-iron hydroxide loaded on Ni foam (NiFe-OH/NF) with superior hydrophilic property and high OER catalytic activity. The strong hydrophilic property of the binder-free NiFe-OH/NF electrode significantly enhances an effective contact between electrocatalyst and aqueous electrolyte and favors the bubble detachment from the electrode, facilitating the electron transfer and improving the OER activity. The hydrophilic NiFe-OH/NF can achieve a geometrical current density of 100 mA cm(-1) at an extremely low overpotential (219 mV), along with a Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1) and superior long-term stability at high current density in alkaline media, strongly indicating that the hydrophilicity plays an important role in improving the OER performance in the NiFe-OH/NF.									19	2	0	0	0	0	18			2574-0962			WOS:000510104700090

Upon varying the electrodeposition conditions, Ni films with a macroporous primary structure and highly porous cauliflowerlike secondary structure were formed. These films are able to develop an extended electrochemically active surface area, up to 270-fold increase compared to a Ni plate. They exhibit stable overpotential (eta(250) = 540 mV) at j = 250 mA cm(geometric)(-2) in 1 M KOH electrolyte, which is 300 mV less positive than at the Ni plate. Fe incorporation onto these NiDHBT structures can further lower OER overpotentials to eta(250) = 310 mV. Ni-DHBT films are remarkably stable over prolonged polarization and are characterized by a low Tafel slope (29 mV/decade) that extends up to j = 100 mA cm(geometric)(-2), attributed to both superaerophobic characteristics with a contact angle of ca. 160 degrees between the surface and an air bubble and superhydrophilic characteristics with less than 25 degrees between the surface and a water droplet.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			2574-0962			WOS:000483434700046

During this process, oxygen has a significant influence on the formation of cyclization structure and crosslinking structure of PAN matrix. Here, graphene oxide (GO) was used as filler in PAN matrix, the structure evolution of GO/PAN composite was studied during oxidative stabilization. Solubility measurement revealed that the crosslinking degree increased, while the cyclization degree of stabilized films decreased after GO incorporation. The effect of GO on the structure of PAN film was characterized by XRD, DSC, DMA, FTIR, and XPS. These results verified that GO could initiate the cyclization reaction of PAN at a lower temperature. The carboxylic groups on GO sheets might take part in the cyclization reactions during the heat treatment. Moreover, the oxygen-containing molecules released from GO decomposition during the heat treatment were beneficial to the formation of crosslinking structure. The possible mechanism of the structure evaluation was proposed in this article. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

In this work, a simple compound-assisted pyrolyzing strategy is reported to synthesize Co-N-C (CoNC-xcompound-800) materials by high-temperature annealing of ZIF-12. Results show that the physicochemical properties of the obtained CoNC-xcompound-800 are dependent on the type of the assistant compound. With the introduction of organic compound (i.e., C3H6N6, C6H14O6, C16H32O2, CH3(CH2)(16)COOH, C6H5NO3), the specific surface area, the carbon defect content, the content of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N, and the Co-N-x concentration of the obtained CoNC-0.5compound(organic)-800 are greatly increased, which result in the improved activities of the 0.5compound(organic)-800 samples. Differently, with the addition of inorganic compound (i.e., Na3PO4, KCl, K2CO3), the carbon defect content, the content of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N, and the Co-N-x concentration of the obtained CoNC-0.5compound(inorganic)-800 are greatly decreased, which lead to reduced activities of the 0.5compound(inorganic)-800 samples. Among these materials, the CoNC-0.5C(6)H(14)O(6)- 800 shows satisfactory ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.89 V. Meanwhile, CoNC-0.5C(6)H(14)O(6)- 800 exhibits an optimal OER performance with an overpotential being only 425 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Our work provides a simple and universal method to adjust the physicochemical properties of the ZIF-12-derived Co-N-C materials. Besides, the results demonstrate that optimal pore structure, higher carbon defect content, higher content of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N, and higher Co-N-x concentration are of great importance for the improvement of the electrochemical performances of the Co-N-C catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000849775600001

Tafel slopes estimated from anodic polarization curves for all catalysts are located above 100 mV dec(-1), suggesting that the rate-controlling step is similar for these materials at determined overpotentials. In agreement with the literature, it could be associated with the (OH)-O-center dot generation since "active catalysts" displays slopes below 80 mV dec-1. A transfer function model is derived to account for the kinetic parameters of the OER mechanism for each anode, throughout its fitting to experimental electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra. The model considers the kinetics of each elementary reaction and the material balances for the rates of formation of the adsorbates (H2Oads, (OHads)-O-center dot, O-center dot(ads), (OOHads)-O-center dot, and O-2ads) involved in the OER. It is found that the rate-controlling step on SnO2-Sb (<= 2.14 V), PbO2 (<= 1.74 V) and BDD (2.54-2.71 V) is associated with the (OH)-O-center dot formation, while this control is only modified when the potential becomes more positive for the oxide catalysts, thus, being determined by the production of adsorbed oxygen O-2ads which on its turn promotes the O-2 evolution. On the other hand, the rate-control step remains similar for BDD over the entire analyzed potential range, standing out its unique properties as inactive catalyst of the OER. (C) The Author(s) 2017.

Herein, heterojunction hybrid of ultrathin molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nano-sheets and non-stoichiometric nickel sulfide (Ni0.96S) is in situ prepared via a facile one-step hydrothermal strategy, followed by annealing at 400 degrees C for 1 h. Microstructural analysis shows that the hybrid is composed of intimate heterojunction interfaces between Ni0.96S and MoS2 with exposed active edges provided by ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets and rich defects provided by non-stoichiometric Ni0.96S nanocrystals. As expected, it is evaluated as bifunctional electrocatalysts to produce both hydrogen and oxygen via water electrolysis with a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) overpotential of 104 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 266 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) under alkaline conditions, outperforming most current noble-metal-free electrocatalysts. This work provides a simple strategy toward the rational design of novel heterojunction electrocatalysts which would be a promising candidate for electrochemical overall water splitting.

The NiMoO4@MoSe2/NixSey on NF showed a core-shell structure in which one dimensional (1D) nanorods (NRs) are covered with hierarchical MoSe2 and NixSey nanosheets. This hierarchical structure is featured with high electrochemically active surface area and easy electron transportation, thus leading to low overpotentials for HER with 0.069 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2)(eta(10)) and for OER with 0.290 V vs. RHE at 200 mA cm(-2)(eta(200)), respectively. More importantly, NiMoO4@MoSe2/NixSey-6/NF, as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both HER and OER, affords excellent electrocatalytic activity for water splitting with a quite low cell voltage of 1.50 V and good stability for more than 12 h. Its superior performance over water splitting will provide a promising perspective for industrial water electrolyzers.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000561644200033

The interaction of chlorine radicals (Cl(P-2)) with polyethylene (PE) under vacuum conditions produces a partially chlorinated layer containing both CCl and CCl2 groups whose concentration was maximized at the surface. Compared to higher-pressure photochlorination experiments where the flux of chlorine atoms is higher, the maximum extent of PE chlorination as measured by the C:Cl XPS ratio and the evolution of the C(1s) region was reduced in the present study while the surface selectivity of the reaction was enhanced. This influence of chlorine atom flux on the extent of chlorination and surface selectivity can be rationalized by a simple stochastic model of the PE chlorination process that incorporates steric effects associated with the production of mono and dichlorinated carbon atoms as well as cross-linking reactions between carbon-containing radicals. During the reaction of PE with atomic oxygen (O(P-3)), a concentration gradient of oxygen-containing carbon functionality is also observed in the near surface region. Experiments carried out on hydrocarbon thin films based on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) reveal that chlorination proceeds without erosion. in contrast, the incorporation of new carbon containing-oxygen functionalities during reactions of hydrocarbon films with atomic oxygen occurs in competition with carbon erosion.

The most important electrocatalytic reactions using electrolyzers and fuel cell technologies are the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The development of electrocatalysts without noble metals of high economic value for HER and ORR in alkali environments continues to be a significant challenge. Here we report a new strategy for the straightforward microwave approach of synthesizing the FeWO4/Fe3O4 embedded in the electrically nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (FeWO4/Fe3O4@NrGO) acting as a useful electrocatalytic converter for HER and ORR in an alkaline environment. FeWO4/Fe3O4@NrGO nanocomposite displays more significant electrocatalytic activity and stability, for HER enabling a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a low overpotential (292 mV), and also ORR enabling a limiting current density of 5.1 mA cm-2 at a low onset potential (0.93 V). The electrocatalytic activity of FeWO4/Fe3O4@NrGO was much higher than that of NrGO, FeWO4, Fe3O4, FeWO4/Fe3O4, and very close to that of 20 wt% Pt/C. Such outstanding catalytic properties may be attributed to the abundant active sites and the synergy provided by the combination of FeWO4, Fe3O4, and NrGO for the improved electrocatalytic performance of FeWO4/Fe3O4@NrGO nanocomposite towards HER and ORR. These findings pave the way for novel graphene-metal tungstate-based nanocomposites as heavy electrode materials in electrically conductive for future energy-related applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000701843700004

Herein, taking Mo-in-corporated nickel hydroxide (Mo-Ni(OH)(2)) as an example, a facile, time-efficient, and low-temperature H-2/N-2 plasma activation strategy is developed to activate the HER performance by constructing heterostructure. This kind of heterostructure is composed of metal, metal alloy, metal nitride, and oxygen vacancy-rithed metal hydroxide with more exposed catalytically active sites, enhanced mass activity, and accelerated electron transport. The optimized plasma-activated Mo-Ni(OH)(2) (P-Mo-Ni(OH)(2)) manifests superior HER performance to pristine Mo-Ni(OH)(2) and even comparable to the benchmark Pt/C catalyst in alkaline solution. Moreover, when assembling a two-electrode urea-assisted water electrolysis system by using P-Mo-Ni(OH)(2) as both cathode and anode, the assembled cell only need a small voltage of 1.36 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits extremely stable catalytic performance up to 1000 h.									34	0	0	0	3	0	34			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000496894300019

Abundance, inexpensiveness and facile preparation for novel active materials and performant electrodes facilitate scale-up and costs lowering upon their further integration into already existing manufacturing processes. Herein, we demonstrate the relevance of a low-cost approach and a design strategy for the preparation of an efficient material for bifunctional O-2 electrocatalysis, and detail its further embedding into a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) architecture tested under relevant load conditions for rechargeable zinc-air battery application. A plain preparation of the active material combines alpha-MnO2, obtained from a simplified synthesis procedure, commercially available carbon black and Ni/NiO nanoparticles. A systematic optimization of the surface concentration of the most active catalytic ensemble and synergetic effects for both oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions, taken separately, shapes the design of a bifunctional electrocatalyst. Performances of GDEs surpass the vast majority of the previous concepts, with stable overpotentials (ca. 0.35 V for each reaction, 55 % energy efficiency) over 400 h at 20 mAh.cm(-2) load cycles (for both charge and discharge), bridging the gap between promising electrocatalyst material and realistic functional electrode.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000597272900005

However, the nickel-rich layered cathode materials suffer from the severe capacity fade during high-voltage cycling, which is related to the phase transformation and the surface sides reactions caused by the lattice oxygen evolution. Here, the simultaneous construction of a Mg, Ti-based surface integrated layer and bulk doping through Mg, Ti surface treatment could suppress the lattice oxygen evolution of Nirich material at deep charging. More importantly, Mg and Ti are co-doped into the particles surface to form an Mg2TiO4 and Mg0.5-xTi2-y(PO4)3 outer layer with Mg and Ti vacancies. In the constructed surface integrated layer, the reverse electric field in the Mg2TiO4 effectively suppressed the outward migration of the lattice oxygen anions, while Mg0.5-xTi2-y(PO4)3 outer layer with high electronic conductivity and good lithium ion conductor could effectively maintained the stability of the reaction interface during highvoltage cycling. Meanwhile, bulk Mg and Ti co-doping can mitigate the migration of Ni ions in the bulk to keep the stability of transition metal-oxygen (M-O) bond at deep charging. As a result, the NCM@MTP cathode shows excellent long cycle stability at high-voltage charging, which keep high capacity retention of 89.3% and 84.3% at 1C after 200 and 100 cycles under room and elevated temperature of 25 and 55 degrees C, respectively. This work provides new insights for manipulating the surface chemistry of electrode materials to suppress the lattice oxygen evolution at high charging voltage.

Electrocatalytic water splitting for H-2 generation is a clean and sustainable approach due to the use of widely existed water as resource. The searching for efficient and low-cost non-precious metal based electrocatalysts for water splitting, including both cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), still remains a great challenge. In this work we report a simple method that utilizes the one-pot in-situ synthesized POMs@ZIFs (POMs = Polyoxometallates, ZIFs = Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks) as precursor for the production of WS2/Ca1-xS/N, S co-doped porous carbon nanocomposite as efficient electrocatalysts. These precursors POMs@ZIFs can effectively prevent the agglomeration of metal compound particles during heat treatment and lead to homogeneous dispersion of metal active sites within carbon matrix. The resulting bimetallic Co-W sulfide/heteroatom doped porous carbon composites show significant improvement in electrocatalytic activity towards both OER (Tafel slop of 53 mV dec(-1) with overpotential of 0.365 V @10 mA cm(-2) current density in 1 M KOH solution) and HER (Tafel slop of 64 mV dec(-1) with overpotential of -0.250 V @-10 mA cm(-2) current density in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution). This work opens up a new way to obtain low cost bifunctional electrocatalysts towards both OER and HER in water splitting. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Silicon, which is the second most earth-abundant element and a small band-gap material, is an applicable candidate for an efficient solar water splitting photoelectrode. However, the stability of Si-based photo electrode hampers efficient water splitting, especially for the Si-based photoanodes because of its thermodynamic instability and etching of silicon surface. Until now, much research has been conducted to deal with the challenges of using Si to fabricate efficient and stable photoanodes. Over the decades, to expedite the oxygen evolution reaction, a complicated 4-electron transfer process and requires large overpotential, cheap and earth-abundant transition metal-based electrocatalysts have been investigated. In this Review, we briefly introduce the photoelectrochemistry and important parameters for evaluating the performance of the Si photoanodes. We summarize transition metal-based catalysts, focusing on Ni-, Co-, and Fe-based oxygen evolving catalysts. Then, we present various strategies to overcome the challenges of silicon by combining the advantages of transition metal-based oxygen evolving catalysts, which are cost-effective, stable, and highly active for oxygen evolution reaction. Finally, to realize spontaneous water splitting, we introduce Si-based tandem cells combined with transition metal-based materials.									24	1	0	0	0	1	24				2639-4979		WOS:000519825900015

Herein, we develop a series of ternary metal-based inverse spinel oxide (ISO) compound, NiCrxFe2-xO4 (x: 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 1.0) support with carbon for an efficient OER catalyst. Systematic studies are performed to understand the extrinsic and intrinsic properties of the developed ISO compounds via tuning the physical properties and varying the compound composition. The optimized ternary ISO compound (x = 1; NiCrFeO4) delivers the superior OER kinetics with a remarkable low overpotential value of 264 mV at a 10 mA cm-2 current density and a low Tafel value of 45 mV dec- 1 under 1 M KOH. In addition, the full cell water electrolysis at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 shows an exceptional long-term stability of 40 h in comparison with commercial catalyst support electrolysis cell.

In this regard, finding high-performance electrocatalysts for OER remains amongst the key challenges in water splitting. Here, for the first time, an aerosol-assisted spray pyrolysis method was applied to synthesize hollow spherical powder possessing nano-thick walls of sodium-cobalt pyrophosphate (Na2CoP2O7) electrocatalyst for OER application. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were carried out for investigating the structure, composition, and morphology of the electrocatalyst powder. The electrocatalytic performances of the as-synthesized Na2CoP2O7 powder along with its composites with Vulcan XC-72 (conductive carbon black), reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and N-doped rGO (N-rGO) were studied by the linear sweep and cyclic voltammetry (LSV and CV). The best sample synthesized was Na2CoP2O7/rGO (50/50 wt%), which required only 240 mV overpotential to produce a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000561567300009

Herein, a flower branch-leaf shaped phosphide/oxide heterogeneous electrocatalyst located on Ni foam (CoP/P-NiO/NF) was developed through hydrothermal and phosphorization strategy. Benefiting from the strong ability to dissociate H2O molecules on P-NiO and the suitable adsorption of intermediate H species on CoP, the optimal CoP/P-NiO/ NF exhibited outstanding performance with low overpotentials of 52 mV at current density of 10 mA cm2, smaller Tafel slopes of 73.6 mV dec-1 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Meanwhile, CoP/P-NiO/NF indicated 265 mV at 100 mA cm-2 with Tafel slope of 101.8 mV dec-1 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the optimal redistribution of electrons among Ni2+, Co2+ and Co3+ for favorable adsorption/desorption of oxygen-intermediates. Both HER and OER shown robust stability during 32 h without decline. The corresponding two-electrode system for overall alkaline water splitting required a low voltage of 1.6 Vat 100 mA cm-2 with long stability (20 h) which is far lower than that on RuO2-Pt/C and many other reported non-noble metal electrocatalysts. This work demonstrates that the synergistic effect and morphology engineering play vital roles in the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

One of the most challenging research directions for the practical application of the OER is the elevation of the activity of noble-metal-free electrocatalysts.

The as-obtained self-standing CuP2/Ni electrodes delivered a current density of 220 mA cm(-2) at 370 mV overpotential, which is approximately 5.5 times higher than the benchmarked IrO2 on nickel foam.

While crystalline metal oxides are promising as OER catalysts, their amorphous phases also show high activities. Efforts to produce amorphous metal oxides have progressed slowly, and how an amorphous structure benefits the catalytic performances remains elusive. Now the first scalable synthesis of amorphous NiFeMo oxide (up to 515 g in one batch) is presented with homogeneous elemental distribution via a facile supersaturated co-precipitation method. In contrast to its crystalline counterpart, amorphous NiFeMo oxide undergoes a faster surface self-reconstruction process during OER, forming a metal oxy(hydroxide) active layer with rich oxygen vacancies, leading to superior OER activity (280 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 m KOH). This opens up the potential of fast, facile, and scale-up production of amorphous metal oxides for high-performance OER catalysts.									229	14	0	0	12	0	228			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000486823200001	31419007

However, the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) result in high overpotential (similar to 1.5 V), poor rate capability, and even a short cycle life, which critically hinder their practical applications. Herein, we propose a synergistic strategy to boost the electrocatalytic activity of Co3O4 nanosheets for Li-O-2 batteries by tuning the inner oxygen vacancies and the exterior Co3+/Co2+ ratios, which have been identified by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy. Operando Xray diffraction and ex situ scanning electron microscopy are used to probe the evolution of the discharge product. In comparison with bulk Co3O4, the cells catalyzed by Co3O4 nanosheets show a much higher initial capacity (similar to 24051.2 mAh g(-1)), better rate capability (8683.3 mAh g(-1)@400 mA g(-1)) and cycling stability (150 cycles@400 mA g(-1)), and lower overpotential. The large enhancement in the electrochemical performances can be mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of the architectured 2D nanosheets, the oxygen vacancies, and Co3+/Co2+ difference between the surface and the interior. Moreover, the addition of LiI to the electrolyte can further reduce the overpotential, making the battery more practical. This study offers some insights into designing high-performance electrocatalysts for Li-O-2 batteries through a combination of the 2D nanosheet architecture, oxygen vacancies, and surface electronic structure regulation.									181	10	0	0	9	0	184			2155-5435			WOS:000412795700016

Here, we reveal the critical role of redox mediator in suppressing the charging instability of LiO2 batteries. Using high temporal resolution online electrochemical mass spectrometry, we show that charging with redox mediators (using lithium bromide as a model system) significantly reduces parasitic gas evolution and improves oxygen recovery efficiency. Using redox mediator transforms the charge reactions from electrochemical pathways to chemical pathways, which unexpectedly bypasses the formation of highly reactive intermediates upon electro-oxidation of lithium peroxide (Li2O2). Such transformation reduces self-amplifying degradation reactions of electrode and electrolyte in Li-O-2 cells. We further show that the improved stability associated with the redox mediator is much more pronounced at higher charging rates, owing to fast charge-transfer kinetics of the redox mediator. Together, we show that employing redox mediator not only reduces the charge overpotential but also suppresses side reactions of Li-O-2 cells with improved charging rate. Our work demonstrates that transforming electro-oxidation of Li2O2 to chemical oxidation of Li2O2 is a promising strategy to simultaneously mitigate charging side reactions and achieve low overpotential for the Li-O-2 batteries.									198	8	0	0	7	0	199			0002-7863			WOS:000378584600029	27228413

The use of environmentally friendly carbon material constitutes a promising option for the DCFC future. In this context, this paper focuses on the use of biomass-derived charcoal renewable fuel. A practical investigation of Tunisian olive wood charcoal (OW-C) in planar DCFCs is conducted and good power density (105 mW cm(-2)) and higher current density (550 mA cm(-2)) are obtained at 700 degrees C. Analytical and predictive techniques are performed to explore the relationships between fuel properties and DCFC chemical and electrochemical mechanisms. High carbon content, carbon oxygen groups and disordered structure, are the key parameters allowing the achieved good performance. Relatively complex chain reactions are predicted to explain the gas evolution within the anode. CO, H-2 and CH4 participation in the anodic reaction is proved. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	POPOV, NA								MODELING OF PLASMA-CHEMICAL PROCESSES INITIATED BY A HIGH-POWER MICROWAVE-DISCHARGE IN AIR								PLASMA PHYSICS REPORTS				20	3			303	310						MAR 1994	1994	A model of kinetic processes in nitrogen-oxygen mixtures excited by a high-power gas discharge was developed. The processes, quenching metastable O(D-1) atoms by nitrogen molecules, are included in the model to describe gas heating. A description of processes forming excited O(S-1) atoms in the postdischarge period and of associative ionization reactions involving these atoms is presented. Taking these reactions into consideration enables one to explain the increase in lifetime of the created plasma. The results of the performed calculations adequately describe the available experimental data on the dynamics of air heating in the discharge, the evolution of the concentration of electrons, and oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the postdischarge period.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1063-780X			WOS:A1994QY58400011

To date, rational design and engineering of heterostructures based on 2D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has been rather limited. Herein, we report an efficient strategy to construct noble metal/2D MOF heterostructures, featuring the utilization of surface oxygen sites from uncoordinated MOF ligands. The incorporation of highly dispersed noble metal nanoparticles (e.g., Pt and Pd) with modulated electronic structure is enabled on a surfactant-free MOF surface. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, the 2D Ni-MOF@Pt hybrid with well-defined interfaces is applied to boost the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and delivers decent electrocatalytic activity under both acidic and alkaline conditions. The present results are expected to provide new insights into furnishing MOFs with extended functionalities and applications.									91	9	0	0	11	0	92			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000502687500013	31693378

Herein, we report active electrocatalysts based on cobalt oxide (Co3O4) hierarchical nanostructures derived from four different precursors of cobalt (acetate, nitrate, chloride, and sulfate salts) using the low-temperature aqueous chemical growth method. It has been found that the effect of precursor on the morphology of nanostructured material depends on the synthetic method. The Co3O4 nanostructures exhibited cubic phase derived from these four precursors. The Co3O4 nanostructures obtained from chloride precursor have demonstrated improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) compared to other precursors due relatively higher content of Co3O4 nanostructures at the surface of material. An overpotential of 400 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) was observed for HER. The Co3O4 nanostructures derived from the chloride precursor have shown favorable reaction kinetics via 34 mV dec(-1) value of the Tafel slope for HER reaction. The Co3O4 nanostructures derived from chloride precursor have also shown an excellent HER durability for 15 hr in alkaline media. Furthermore, the OER functional characterization was carried out onto Co3O4 nanostructures derived from chloride precursor exhibited 220 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1). Importantly, the reason behind the favorable catalytic activity of Co3O4 nanostructures derived from chloride precursor was linked to one order of magnitude smaller charge transfer resistance and higher amount of Co3O4 content at the surface of nanostructures than the Co3O4 nanostructures derived from other precursors. The performance of Co3O4 nanostructures derived from chloride precursor via the wet chemical method suggests that cobalt chloride precursor could be of great interest for the development of efficient, stable, nonprecious, and environmentally friendly electrocatalysts for the chemical energy conversion and storage devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0009-4536	2192-6549		WOS:000779361600001		
J	Jain, Priya; Jha, Shwetambara; Ingole, Pravin P.								Strong metal-support interaction in copper hexacyanoferrate nanocube decorated functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes for enhanced bi-functional oxygen electrocatalytic activity and stability								SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS				6	4			1094	1107		10.1039/d1se01635k		DEC 2021		FEB 15 2022	2022	The development of an efficient non-precious metal-based bi-functional oxygen electro-catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for various electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices. Prussian blue and its analogues (PBAs) have attracted attention as potential electrocatalyst materials due to their suitable properties including abundant metal centres, a porous 3D framework, a tuneable morphology, ease of synthesis and cost effectiveness. However, poor conductivity and low chemical stability under harsh conditions hinder their practical application as their activity is lower than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. To address these limitations, we have developed 1D/3D hybrid nano-heterostructures of copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) decorated functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (f-MWCNTs) by a simple hydrothermal approach. The crafted electrocatalyst exhibits enhanced ORR and OER activity compared to its parent materials. The improved performance is assigned to the synergistic effect between CuHCF and f-MWCNTs, where the catalytic centre of Cu assists the adsorption and mass diffusion of oxygen species, and the interlinked structure of 3D CuHCF with 1D f-MWCNTs helps in effective electron transport to the catalytic centres. It was observed that the formation of a Cu(OH)(2) thin layer on the surface of CuHCF is also a main factor for enhanced electrocatalytic activity. To support the claims, activity comparison with CuHCF/unf. CNT (unfunctionalized CNTs) and Cu(OH)(2)/CNT is performed. This work provides a new insight towards improving the efficiency of non-precious CuHCF based metal-organic framework electrocatalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis, an important class of reactions in fuel cell applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000744563300001

The synthesized tungsten trioxide nanorods have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). Electrochemical activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on WO3 nanorods / carbon nanotube (WO3/CNT) composite electrocatalyst was first studied in acid solution (0.1 M H2SO4) at room temperature. The overall experimental results revealed that the electrocatalytic activity for HER on WO3/CNT is two order magnitude higher than those obtained with WO3 nanorods and is four times than in the case of commercial WO3 in 0.1 M H2SO4. On the other hand, the kinetic reaction mechanisms were discussed on WO3/CNT electrocatalysts in acid solution for HER. However, the rate-determining step carries through Tafel reaction on commercial WO3, CNT, WO3 nanorods and WO3/CNT electrocatalysts in acidic solution was introduced.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0009-4536	2192-6549		WOS:000317029600015
