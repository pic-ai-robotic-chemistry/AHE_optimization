Moreover, it has deepened understanding of the role of oxygen in the reaction mechanisms and the evolution of chemical oxygen demand (COD) fractions and their components during hydrothermal treatments (180 degrees C, 80 bar). This information is necessary before separating specific compounds or using the hydrolysates directly as fertiliser or fermentation media. Results revealed the existence of an initial stage of sludge solubilisation (30 - 60 min), mainly produced by hydrolysis reactions and without mineralisation, followed by a second stage where oxygen promoted the conversion of solubilised compounds, mineralisation and the minimisation of the solid fraction. Total COD and total suspended solids (TSS) were reduced by 48% and 75% after 210 min of wet oxidation, compared to 28% and 50% after thermal hydrolysis. Oxygen led to a final liquid hydrolysate with fewer easily assimilable compounds (38% of the initial total COD converted into readily biodegradable), inorganic elements (17 g/kg TSSo) and refractory, inhibitory and less assimilable compounds (1.1 g O-2/L of slowly and non-biodegradable COD) compared to that obtained in its absence (61%, 24 g/kg TSSo and 2.3 g O-2/L, respectively). Oxidation mechanisms favoured the conversion of non-volatile hydroxy acids (NVHA) and inter-mediate compounds to volatile fatty acids (VFA), with VFA concentration being almost 3 times higher under an oxidising atmosphere, but with NHVFA 57% lower.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000727862700002

Herein, we have successfully designed a Type-II heterostructured photocatalyst system based on CeO2 nanocubes anchored one dimensional CdS nanomds (1D CdS NRs) for visible photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction. Systematical characterizations including morphological, structural, optical and electrochemical measurements, firmly divulge the correlation between structures and photocatalytic activity of samples. The heterojunctions between nanorods and nanocubes result in the formation of CdS-CeO2 heteronanostructures (CdS-CeO2 HNSs) with unique band structures that lead to a Type-II heterojunction with efficient charge carriers' separation. The optimized CdS-CeO2 HNS photocatalyst displays an excellent H-2 evolution activity of 10.5 mmol/g/h and high stability. This superior performance is attributed to the efficient photoexcited charge carriers separation, suppressed recombination rate and strong hybridization between CdS and CeO2 components.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000734409800001

Constraints on the 12C(alpha,gamma)16O nuclear reaction rate from Hubble Space Telescope observations of C/O in low-abundance galaxies								Nuclear Physics A				A621	1-2			27	30		10.1016/S0375-9474(97)00206-6				4 Aug. 1997	1997	The C/O abundance ratio in the ionized interstellar gas of galaxies with very low heavy element abundances is used to constrain the 12C(alpha,gamma)16O nuclear reaction rate, based on spectroscopic measurements using the Hubble Space Telescope (Garnett et al. 1995). We observe that C/O is only about one-third the solar system value in galaxies with the lowest abundances (O/H less than one-tenth of the solar system value), implying significant evolution of the abundance ratio. If intermediate mass stars have not contributed significant amounts of carbon to the interstellar gas in these galaxies, then the C/O ratio reflects nucleosynthetic yields of C and O in massive stars, which are sensitive to the 12C(alpha,gamma)16O rate. Based on stellar nucleosynthesis calculations of Weaver and Woosley (1993), the average observed C/O ratio in the four galaxies with the lowest abundances implies a reaction rate of 1.7 times the Caughlan and Fowler 1988 (CF88) ldquobaselinerdquo rate for 12C(alpha,gamma)16O, with a lower limit of 1.2 times the CF88 rate (95% confidence level). This compares well with Weaver and Woosley's best estimate of 1.7+or-0.5 times the CF88 rate.					Nuclei in the Cosmos. Fourth International SymposiumNuclei in the Cosmos.

J	Li, Tongfei; Luo, Gan; Liu, Qianyu; Li, Sulin; Zhang, Yiwei; Xu, Lin; Tang, Yawen; Yang, Jun; Pang, Huan								Encapsulation of NiCo nanoparticles into foam-like porous N,P-codoped carbon nanosheets: Electronic and architectural dual regulations toward high-efficiency water electrolysis								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				410						128325	10.1016/j.cej.2020.128325		JAN 2021		APR 15 2021	2021	The rational design of earth-abundant and high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts for expediting the sluggish kinetics of both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is imperative to fulfill the sustainable hydrogen-based energy electrochemical devices. The design rationale for advanced catalyst requires to simultaneously take into account both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects. Herein, a feasible and scalable hydrogel-bridged pyrolysis strategy is developed to directly immobilize uniform NiCo nanoparticles into 2D foam-like porous N,P-codoped carbon nanosheets (abbreviated as NiCo@N,P-CNSs hereafter). The bimetallic alloy synergy, well confined active sites and highly porous nanosheet architecture collaboratively afford modulated electronic structure, abundant active sites, and multidimensional mass diffusion pathways, which are thermodynamically and kinetically favorable for catalytic performance. Consequently, the as-fabricated NiCo@N,P-CNSs exhibit distinguished bifunctional performance in alkaline medium, requiring overpotentials of only 99 and 226 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively. Furthermore, when equipped in a two-electrode electrolyzer, the NiCo@N,P-CNS electrode couple displays a low cell voltage of 1.57 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and outstanding stability, outperforming a majority of the recently reported non-precious electrocatalysts and representing a competitive candidate for practical water electrolysis. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations further corroborate that the bimetallic NiCo alloy possesses favorable Gibbs free energies of water and hydrogen adsorption, which are beneficial for enhancing its intrinsic activity. More importantly, the developed methodology for the simultaneous realization of electronic modulation, nanostructure engineering and nanocarbon hybridization may provide new perspectives for future exploration of high-efficiency electrocatalysts for a range of energy conversion applications and beyond.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000705560800004		
J	Cai, Jian; Jiang, Feng; Liu, Xiaohao								Exploring pretreatment effects in Co/SiO2 Fischer-Tropsch catalysts: Different oxidizing gases applied to oxidation-reduction process								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				210				1	13		10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.03.036				AUG 5 2017	2017	The influence of reduction-oxidation-reduction (ROR) pretreatment on 20% Co/SiO2 has been investigated using different oxidizing gases including water vapor and oxygen in the oxidation step. In this study, the evolution concerning the SiO2 structure and the cobalt phase and morphology is clearly elucidated at each step of reduction, oxidation and subsequent re-reduction. It is demonstrated that ROR treatment using both oxygen and water vapor decreases the average cobalt particle size. However, the catalytic performance affected in FTS is considerably different. ROR treatment in oxygen results in an increase in catalytic activity. In contrast, the water vapor applied in oxidation step obviously deactivates cobalt catalyst and enhances selectivity of methane. The resulting deactivation is ascribed to the promoted formation of irreducible cobalt silicate through the reaction between water vapor caused surface Si OH groups and oxidized cobalt (CoO) in spite of unchanged surface area and pore structure on SiO2. The characterization data reveals that the re-dispersion of cobalt particles occurs at oxidation step rather than the re-reduction step. In addition, the results indicate that the ROR treatment reducing the cobalt particle size depends on its initial size as no re-dispersion can be observed in the case of particles smaller than about 11 nm. Furthermore, the water vapor shows more effective re-dispersion in cobalt particles compared with the use of oxygen. This study provides fundamental insights into the control of catalytic activity, product selectivity, and catalyst stability over supported cobalt catalysts by understanding the evolution of catalyst structure through ROR treatment in different chemical environment.

The GNP-PbO2 electrode had a much rougher surface than the typical PbO2 electrode, with smaller crystal size and lower charge-transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Notably, the GNP inter-layer increased the oxygen evolution potential of PbO2 electrode (2.05 V vs. SCE), which was very beneficial to inhibit oxygen evolution and promote .OH production. The relatively best operating parameters for ENO removal and energy efficiency were current density of 20 mA cm(-2), initial pH of 7, initial ENO concentration of 100 mg L-1 and electrode distance of 4 cm. Furthermore, indirect radical oxidation was found to be the main way during electrolysis process. Based on the observed analysis of intermediate products, the main reaction pathways of ENO included hydroxylation, defluorination and piperazine ring-opening. Finally, combinating with the electro-oxidation capability, stability and safety evaluation, we can conclude that GNP-PbO2 is a promising anode for treatment of various organic pollutants in wastewater.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0045-6535	1879-1298		WOS:000853586000001	35948101

On the basis of the literature, the operating results of the air injection systems used in field sites were summarized, and the key design parameters were addressed. The operation and assessment of aeration systems were presented. First, the behavior of oxygen transport was caused by the characteristics of the pore media in the waste body. A mathematical model was needed to address the spatial- temporal evolutions of oxygen concentration in landfill. The optimum design method of gas injection well should be developed to elevate the oxygen content at maximum level across the field site, applying to most landfills. Second, an effective leachate exchange and recirculation plan should be developed to ensure sustained aerobic reaction in full scale. Some experiences of leachate discharge in field sites were presented. Third, the relationship between oxygen consumption and stability indicators should be determined to create an effective aeration plan. This function will help evaluate the reliability of aeration systems. This study provides evidence for the design, construction, operation, and effectiveness assessment of air injection well in repair engineering of landfills.

On a Possible Way to Increase the Efficiency of Photosynthesis								DOKLADY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS				491	1			98	100		10.1134/S1607672920020131				MAR 2020	2020	The paper briefly describes the evolution of the key enzyme of photosynthesis, RuBisCO. Before the emergence of the reaction of carbon dioxide assimilation via photosynthesis, this protein was involved in the methionine metabolism chain. Possibly, for this reason, the carboxylation reaction catalyzed by enzyme proceeds very slowly. In addition to carboxylation, RuBisCO can simultaneously oxidize ribulose bisphosphate, a substrate to which the fixed CO(2)is attached. This, in turn, also reduces the effectiveness of photosynthesis. In this regard, the literature discusses various options for increasing plant productivity by creating new forms of RuBisCO or fundamentally different pathways of carbon dioxide assimilation. In this work, we propose a modification of the carboxylation reaction that makes it possible to avoid photorespiration and thus increase the efficiency of photosynthesis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1607-6729	1608-3091		WOS:000540874900011	32483761

In this work, by merging bimetallic Co-Mo oxides with metallic Co on the graphite felt (GF), we effectively manufacture a 3D bifunctional and highly efficient electrocatalyst (CoMoO@Co/GF) with multi-site functionality for the simultaneous reduction of water and the oxidation of urea in an alkaline medium. The presence of metallic Co causes Co-Mo oxides to evolve from amorphous to crystalline structures. The coupling interface produced between metallic Co and Co-Mo oxides is proven to facilitate electron transport in addition to extensively accessible and highly electroactive Co-Mo oxide nanoflower architecture. The experimental results reveal that the over-potentials for OER and UOR in the CoMoO@Co/GF electrode require only 269 and 115 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, with the aid of urea, the over-potential for HER at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is lowered to 155 mV. Most notably, the constructed CoMoO@Co/GF-based electrolytic cell only requires a 1.5 V dry battery to achieve effective H-2 evolution and noteworthy stability, outperforming the commercial catalyst-based device and many previous results. The combination of experiments and theoretical calculations further clarifies the active sites in the catalyst. What's more, the pathway of electron transfer in the catalytic process is defined.

However, it still suffers from an inferior cycling stability and rate properties. Benefitting from the unique traits of rare earth metal La, La-doping was introduced to V-sites, leading to an expansion of the lattice volume and reduced particle size, and bringing about more oxygen defects for fast ion redox reactions. The considerable discharge capacity of optimized La-doped LiV3O8 could reach up to 308 mA h g(-1), and the capacity could be kept at 252 mA h g(-1) after numerous loops. Supported by a detailed analysis of the capacity curves, an improved redox activity of V5+ was strongly demonstrated. Moreover, compared to the basic materials, an increasing rate capacity located in the low potential range was detected, ascribed to the existence of an oxygen vacancy, enabling a reduction in the energy barrier and a broadening of the energy distribution. Interestingly, La-doping could ultimately improve the capacity and is thus worth further exploration, particularly for the design of advanced cathodic materials.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000612470000048

In this paper, we introduce for the first time an environmentally friendly and exceptional energy-saving carbohydrazide oxidization reaction (COR) catalysis system as an anode. In this system, a robust, low-cost and valence-rich copper-iron-sulfur-oxygen porous nanocluster (Cu-Fe-S-O PN) catalyst was fabricated using a one-step mild wet chemical bath synthesis (CBS) method. Combining this catalyst and the carbohydrazide-containing electrolyte, we obtained the lowest anodic oxidization potentials ever obtained, of 0.45 V (vs. RHE) and 1.01 V (vs. RHE) for driving 10 mA cm(-2) current density in alkali or near-neutral electrolyte, respectively. These values surpass all those of previously reported environmentally friendly alkali energy-saving electrolysis systems, even neutral or near-neutral electrolysis systems, to the best of our knowledge.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000597647100012

The cooperative effect of Ni and Co metal, as well as the interfacial properties of the integrated semiconducting phosphide/metallic alloy and electronic conductivity of the MOF-derived carbon regulate the performance of the catalyst. Moreover, the bimetallic CoNiP/CoNi alloy catalyst is interspersed with N-doped graphene, forming a triad catalyst that demonstrates superior activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (eta(10)=150 mV) and excellent durability, owing to interfacial effects of the triad catalyst, large electrochemical active surface area, and enhanced conductivity from N-doped graphene. The stability of the carbon-containing catalyst during OER (oxidation) is altered by the high reactivity of heteroatom dopant. The assembled CoNiP/CoNi/N-RGO||CoNiP/CoNi water electrolyzer delivers a reasonable cell potential of 1.76 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The synthesized bimetallic CoNiP/CoNi alloy-based triad catalyst thus demonstrates excellent electrocatalytic activity and high durability suitable for efficient alkaline water splitting.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000617210500001	33474804

Herein, a new dual-confinement strategy for the fabrication of cobalt-base phosphide in the carbon nanofibers (CNFs) was proposed via electrospinning, followed by the corresponding pyrolysis. The ultrafine phosphides derived from the pore confinement of ZIF and space confinement of the polymer revealed abundant active sites and P defects. More importantly, by introducing a second metal element Ni or Cu, the electronic structure and synergistic effect were further enhanced, and the obtained bimetallic CoNiPx-CNF electrocatalyst exhibited the remarkable performance for HER and OER, featuring the low eta(10) values of 154 and 269 mV in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, respectively. CoNiPx-CNFs as a catalyst for both anode and cathode showed a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.56 V, exceeding better stability, which is superior to most non-noble metal electrocatalysts reported in a previous research. The dual-confinement strategy is believed to provide an effective and simple approach for the synthesis of high-performance and cost-efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000767318200001	35274640

However, it remains tremendously challenging to distinguish the role of electronic and ensemble effects in bimetallic core-shell electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For this purpose, we demonstrate an efficient approach to local epitaxial growth of Rh atoms on Au decahedra to investigate the above-mentioned two effects. Among them, Au75Rh25 core-shell star-shaped decahedra exhibited the best activity for HER with an overpotential of 64.1 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is about 39.4 mV less than that of commercial Rh/C. Density function theory (DFT) calculations revealed that ensemble effect is the dominant factor to accelerate the reaction kinetics of HER by exposing Au atoms on the surface and thus weakening the strong adsorption of the intermediates on Rh surface.									29	3	0	0	1	0	29			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000510526000004

FTIR, X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, ultramicrotomy and optical microscopy were used to study the slow evolution of stabilization indices and structure changes with increasing the temperature in the rearmost zone. The results show that cross linking reaction happens above 240 degrees C in the rearmost stabilization zone, leading to a quick increase of oxygen content and aromatization index and the formation of cross-linking rigid structure. Especially for the sample treated at 275 degrees C, the cross-linking structure induces a compact sheath layer in the fiber which impedes the oxygen atoms diffusion inward. By changing the temperature in the rearmost stabilization zone, the oxygen content, chemical structure and aromatization index can be accurately controlled.									28	3	0	0	0	0	31			0170-0839			WOS:000243691500007

It has been shown that increasing the temperature and reduction time increases the extent of oxygen and sulfur removal. Decreasing the hydrogen partial pressure tenfold lowers the extent of oxygen removal and results in the formation of residual NiO (incomplete reduction). The microstructure characteristics of industrial plant samples are correlated with the results obtained from the laboratory studies to identify the underlying elementary reactions and phenomena occurring and to understand the mechanisms of formation of the residual NiO in the final nickel product during industrial processing. As a result of these studies, it is recommended that the actual process is carried out at temperatures below 600 degrees C to avoid the formation of this residual NiO.									8	0	0	0	1	0	10			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000255879400008

In sulfuric acid solution, the cyclic voltammogram of the (100) surface exhibits a reduction signature near the hydrogen evolution potential. The reduction feature was found to be associated with an expansion of the top ruthenium layer approximately along the (110) direction. The same reduction feature was seen much less clearly at the (110) surface. However, the associated displacement of ruthenium atoms is very similar to that of the (100) surface, leading to the conclusion that the oxygen bonds on the surface are elongated by a chemical reaction of the oxygen atoms with hydronium molecules in solution. In NaOH solution, the cyclic voltammogram of the (110) surface indicates two clearly identifiable oxidation features near the oxygen evolution potential. We find that the oxidation features are associated with the clearly identifiable surface-structure changes and these structure models are presented. The structure models and corresponding charge-transfer amounts were consistent with the pH-dependent cyclic voltammograms and the super-nernstian behavior measured by adding phosphoric acid to the solution.

The as-formed nanoporous PdCuNi-S catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media, which is very close to commercial Pt/C catalyst. The overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope are 48 mV and 35 mV dec(-1), respectively. In addition, the catalyst shows good electrochemical stability in HER. The outstanding property of PdCuNi-S catalyst for hydrogen generation is attributed to the bicontinuous nanoporous structure, improved charge transfer, more bridging S-2(2-) and/or apical S2- in amorphous state and synergetic interactions of Pd, Cu, Ni and S.									55	11	0	0	1	0	55			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000460495400017

The flash lamp annealing (FLA) of the IGZO TFT for 16s helps achieve a mobility of approximately 7cm(2) V-1 s(-1). However, further extension of the annealing time results only in drastic increases in carrier concentration and off-current. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the N 1s peak unravels the presence of oxygen-vacancy-associated nitrogen defects and their evolution with annealing time, which is possibly responsible for the increase in carrier concentration.

Much of the recent progress is due to improvements in materials chemistry, MEA designs, and optimized operation conditions. Research on anion-exchange polymers (AEPs) has focused on the cationic head/backbone/side-chain structures and key properties such as ionic conductivity and alkaline stability. Several approaches, such as cross-linking, miaophase, and organic/inorganic composites, have been proposed to improve the anion-exchange performance and the chemical and mechanical stability of AEMs. Numerous AEMs now exceed values of 0.1 S/cm (at 60-80 degrees C), although the stability specifically at temperatures exceeding 60 degrees C needs further enhancement. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is still a limiting factor. An analysis of thin-layer OER data suggests that NiFe-type catalysts have the highest activity. There is debate on the active-site mechanism of the NiFe catalysts, and their long-term stability needs to be understood. Addition of Co to NiFe increases the conductivity of these catalysts. The same analysis for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) shows carbon-supported Pt to be dominating, although PtNi alloys and clusters of Ni(OH)(2) on Pt show competitive activities. Recent advances in forming and embedding well-dispersed Ru nanoparticles on functionalized high-surface-area carbon supports show promising HER activities. However, the stability of these catalysts under actual AEMWE operating conditions needs to be proven. The field is advancing rapidly but could benefit through the adaptation of new in situ techniques, standardized evaluation protocols for AEMWE conditions, and innovative catalyst-structure designs. Nevertheless, single AEM water electrolyzer cells have been operated for several thousand hours at temperatures and current densities as high as 60 degrees C and 1 A/cm(2), respectively.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000819831600001	35442645

In this study, Er, Nd, Ce, La and Gd doped CoP materials have been prepared to study the effects of rare earth (RE) element doping on both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), among which Er-doped CoP is found to be the best bifunctional catalyst. The Er doped CoP ultrathin nanomeshes (NMs) can be synthesized with a larger surface area (123.4 m(2) g(-1)) and double-layer capacitance (143.1 mF cm(-2)) than pure CoP nanoplates, and therefore with more active sites. Benefiting from the ultrathin nanomesh morphology and electronic structure modification, the as-prepared Er-doped CoP NMs show superior electrocatalytic activity in alkaline medium, which require an overpotential of only 256 mV for the OER to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), obviously smaller than that of most reported non-noble metal catalysts. Additionally, the Er-doped CoP NMs also display a favorable catalytic performance for the HER in both acidic and alkaline media with an overpotential of 52 mV and 66 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. The excellent bifunctional nature of Er-doped CoP NMs will make the electrolysis device more operational and cost-effective. The corresponding two-electrode electrolysis system needs a cell voltage of merely 1.58 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline medium, and maintains stable electrolysis for 25 h, which compares favorably with previously reported bifunctional catalysts. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the superior performance of such a catalyst resulted from the smaller overpotential and hydrogen adsorption energy This study provides an appealing method to improve performance which can be extended to other transition metal catalysts.									82	4	0	0	3	0	82			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463824300069

Here, we report a direct synthesis of monolayer Ni(OH)(2) on electrodes by in situ electrochemical conversion and a fundamental investigation of their catalytic activity. The monolayer structure greatly promotes hydrogen and oxygen release processes to produce dynamic active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a lower potential. Lattice doping with cobalt further tunes the electronic structure to reduce the overpotential. In situ experiments revealed Ni and Co valence state oscillation in NiCo hydroxides, which has been attributed to sequential dehydrogenation and deoxygenation processes, and fundamentally contributes to the dynamic generation of OER active sites. This study defines an in situ conversion process to yield monolayer layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and establishes a critical fundamental understanding of the origin of the active sites in monolayer LDHs for the OER.									44	0	0	0	1	0	44			2520-1158			WOS:000727158900001

Herein, we report a carbon-based nanocomposite (denoted as CCW-x, x stands for the calcination temperature) derived from watermelon peels and CoCl2, and the as-synthesized CCW-x is used as the electrocatalyst. The overpotential and the Tafel slope of CCW-700 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is 237 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 69.8 mV dec(-1), respectively, both of which are lower than those of commercial RuO2. For hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the overpotential of CCW-700 (111 mV) is higher than that of the widely studied Pt/C (73 mV) but still lower than those of lots of carbon-based nanomaterials (122-177 mV). In the light of CCW-700 is highly active for both OER and HER, we assembled a water-splitting electrocatalyst by employing nickel foam loaded with CCW-700 as the anode and cathode in 1 M KOH. The water-splitting voltage is only 1.54 V for the CCW-700//CCW-700 electrodes and 1.62 V for the RuO2//Pt/C ones. Therefore, the so-denoted CCW-x powder possesses good electrocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			2470-1343			WOS:000613926400031	33521446

The phases of evolution of the LOE are similar to the phases, observed in cell experiments, of the photodynamic effect (PDE) the mechanism of which is the basis of the familiar method of photodynamic cancer therapy. The reported proofs of the occurrence of the LOE are in the form of detailed spectra of the biological action of optical radiation on cells recorded in four spectral intervals with the aid of tunable lasers. Allowances are made for the relationships governing a new type of cell excitation, associated with reversible structural transitions in the biomembrane, A demonstration is reported of the same efficiency of cw and pulsed irradiation. An analysis is made of the reasons why the optical doses initiating the PDE and the LOE are comparable. The results are given of the first experimental applications of the LOE in tumour therapy. Identification of the primary photoacceptor (O-2) in cell biostimulation and photodestruction provides a scientific basis for the development of low-intensity laser light-oxygen cancer therapy methods.									51	0	8	0	13	0	57			1063-7818	1468-4799		WOS:000085886600003		
J	PETER, GF; THORNBER, JP								BIOCHEMICAL-EVIDENCE THAT THE HIGHER-PLANT PHOTOSYSTEM-II CORE COMPLEX IS ORGANIZED AS A DIMER								PLANT AND CELL PHYSIOLOGY				32	8			1237	1250						DEC 1991	1991	The organization of the pigmented multiprotein core complex of higher plant PS II has been examined. Oxygen-evolving PS II particles or thylakoid membranes of wild-type and Chl b-less barley were extracted with various glycosidic surfactants and electrophoretically fractionated. The predominant multiprotein core complex II (CC II) fractions had sizes on gel electrophoresis of M(r) = 230,000 and M(r) = 140,000 and were photochemically active. Both fractions had identical absorption spectra, contained the beta-carotene-chl a-proteins (Cp47 and Cp43), the PS II reaction center subunits (D1 and D2), and the two cytochrome b559 subunits in unit stoichiometry. The M(r) = 230,000 fraction could evolve oxygen in the light and contained an M(r) = 33,000 oxygen evolution enhancer (OEE 33) polypeptide, whereas the M(r) = 140,000 fraction lacked OEE 33 and could not evolve oxygen. The apparent sizes of the two fractions were also estimated by gel filtration as M(r) = 490,000 and M(r) = 220,000, respectively; the estimates by gel filtration more accurately reflect their predicted sizes. Further analyses by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis indicated that Cp47, Cp43 and the three OEE gene products probably occur as homodimers in situ. Our data suggest that phosphorylation of CC II subunits occurs when they are located in the oligomeric form. We propose that the native state of the PS II core complex in higher plants is dimeric, and that this state, which was previously observed only in thermophilic cyanobacteria, is probably the form present in all oxygenic organisms.									71	2	0	0	60	0	71			0032-0781			WOS:A1991GV84000015

Molybdenum (Mo)-coordinated polyvinyl alcohol gel is converted into a porous Mo-complex nitrogen-rich carbonous sponge (MNCS) via microwave and low-temperature-annealing processes as a positive electrode. This MNCS was further thermally treated at a higher temperature to prepare a more carbonized Mo-complex N-doped carbon sponge (cMNCS) as a negative electrode. Both sponges were lightweight and porous and exhibited excellent specific capacitances of 562 F g(-1) as a positive MNCS electrode and 937 F g(-1) as a negative cMNCS electrode. The asymmetric supercapacitor assembled using them reveals a power density of 887.5 W kg(-1) at an energy density of 36 Wh kg(-1), in addition to a retention rate of >95% after 5000 cycles.

Here, we report on a tin-based oxide perovskite combined with an overlayer that shows enhanced bifunctional hydrogen and oxygen evolution. In our first-principles study of tin-based perovskites, based upon density functional theory, we investigate how the formation of a surface affects the electronic properties of these materials. We show that the best candidate, SrSnO3, possesses hydrogen and oxygen overpotentials of 0.75 and 0.72 eV, respectively, which are reduced to 0.35 and 0.54 eV with the inclusion of a ZrO2 overlayer. Furthermore, this overlayer promotes charge extraction, stabilizes the reaction pathways, and improves the band gap such that it straddles the overpotentials between pH 0 and pH 12. This result indicates that SrSnO3 with a ZrO2 overlayer has significant potential as a highly efficient bifunctional water splitter for producing hydrogen and oxygen gas on the same surface.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1948-7185			WOS:000537432500053	32354214

Kinetic parameters, such as b(c), b(a), dE(c)/dpH, and dE(a)/dpH, are determined for various portions of the polarization curves. The influence of TTT on the electrochemical properties of carbon fibers is shown to be pronounced mainly in the regions of oxygen adsorption, oxide formation, and in particular during oxygen reduction: as TTT increases from 1000 to 2200 degrees C, activity of the carbon fiber drops by several orders of magnitude. The oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions are found to depend weakly on TTT of the carbon fiber. It is also demonstrated that carbon fibers in acid solutions are relatively resistant to destruction during cathodic and anodic polarizations. On the other hand, carbon fibers in alkaline solutions undergo intensive destruction, particularly in the course of anodic polarization.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1023-1935			WOS:A1997WM38900015

In that field, designing efficient and bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is critical for water splitting. With the increasing demands for bifunctional catalysts, a universal strategy in favor of these catalytic processes is particularly important. Herein, a variety of Zr-doped layered double hydroxide (LDH) with low crystalline grown on nickel foam (NF) is designed to promote the bifunctional activities of electrocatalysts. It is found that the doping of Zr4+ into CoFe-LDH/NF can tune the electronic structure and also expose abundant catalytic active sites to enhance the electrocatalytic activities. In 1 M KOH, the as prepared CoFeZr/NF exhibits superior OER and HER activities with low overpotentials of 233 and 159 mV at 10 mA cm(2). When tested in alkaline simulated seawater electrolyte, CoFeZr/NF also shows high catalytic activities with almost no attenuation when compared with that in 1.0 M KOH. This work will provide a new way for the development of seawater electrolysis for large-scale hydrogen production. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The determination of the evolution degree of the reaction								REVISTA DE CHIMIE				55	9			711	714						SEP 2004	2004	The chemical oxygen demand is an important parameter for determining the amount of organic pollution in water and in evaluating the efficiency of treatment processes. There are two digestion methods used in the COD test: the older macro digestion method, and the micro digestion one. The macro digestion method requires a considerable amount of space, equipment and volume of reagents for each test. Because of these inconveniences, the macro method has been virtually replaced by the micro method. In this work, COD parameter, determined by microdigestion method and UV-VIS spectrofotometry, has been used for studying of ortho-nitrophenol (ONF) oxidation process from aqueous solutions in the absence and presence of catalytic systems. COD variation allows a better appraise of the extent of ortho-nitrophenol oxidation process. It was found that the presence of catalytic systems enhance the oxidation of ortho-nitrophenol toward final oxidation products.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0034-7752			WOS:000224545700012

During electrolysis, electrical energy is converted to chemical energy through electrochemical reactions at the electrodes. The anode is preferably placed in the tumour and the cathode in a blood vessel or in fresh surrounding tissue. The main electrochemical reactions are chlorine and oxygen evolution, at the anode? if platinum is used. Hydrogen evolution takes place at the cathode. The aim of this paper is to show how mathematical modelling can be used as a tool for defining and optimising the operating conditions of electrochemical treatment (ET) of tumours. A simplified mathematical model is presented for direct current treatment of tumours, focusing on tissue surrounding a spherical platinum anode. The tissue is treated as an aqueous solution of sodium chloride and only the major electrochemical reactions are considered. The model is based on transport equations of ionic species in dilute solutions. Kinetic expressions for the electrochemical reactions, at the anode surface, are introduced.

Three types of silver-containing RhNPs, namely, nanoshells, nanoframes, and porous nanoplates, have been recently synthesized via inverse directional galvanic replacement. These RhNPs are used in this study to elucidate the relationship between the morphology of RhNPs and their performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The activity of RhNPs in HER is investigated using cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction data reveal that RhNPs contain different Rh/Ag ratios. All RhNPs show long-term stability in acidic conditions. In particular, nanoshells RhNPs exhibit better performance in the low overpotential range than those of Pt/C, a commercial Rh electrocatalyst, and other RhNPs. Thus, the morphology and composition of RhNPs can be controlled for efficient electrocatalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000782507900001		
J	Chen, AC; Miller, B								Potential oscillations during the electrocatalytic oxidation of sulfide on a microstructured Ti/Ta2O5-IrO2 electrode								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				108	7			2245	2251		10.1021/jp036639h				FEB 19 2004	2004	The electrooxidation of sulfide on a microstructured oxide electrode Ti/Ta2O5-IrO2 was studied using electrochemical methods such as cyclic voltammetry, differential capacity, galvanostatic measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Sulfide and hydrosulfide can be oxidized to sulfur, polysulfides, and sulfate depending upon the electrode potential. Our surface analysis illustrates that the Ti/Ta2O5-IrO2 electrode prepared in this study has a "cracked mud" structure with oxide particles sitting on the top of the electrode surface which have a particle size of around 100 nm. For the first time, two distinct galvanostatic potential oscillations, named as Oscillation A and Oscillation B, respectively, are observed during the electrooxidation of sulfide on an oxide electrode. The features of the potential oscillations strongly depend on the applied current densities. Oscillation A, located in the low current region, has larger amplitudes and much smaller frequencies than Oscillation B, which occurs in the high current region. Our EIS studies show that both Oscillation A and Oscillation B can be classified into HNDR (hidden negative differential resistance) oscillators with oxygen evolution involved. Oscillation A is caused by the variation of the S2-/HS- surface concentration from the diffusion-limited depletion by oxidation and from the convection-induced replenishment by periodic oxygen evolution, while Oscillation B is due to the synergic effect of sulfur formation/removal and constant oxygen evolution.									57	4	0	0	5	0	59			1520-6106			WOS:000188957900022

The delafossite CuFeO2 has been prepared by thermal decomposition from various salts. The polarity of generated voltage is positive indicating that the materials exhibit p-type conductivity whereas the electroneutrality is achieved by oxygen insertion. The plot of the logarithm (conductivity) vs. T (1) gives average activation energy of 0.12 eV. CuFeO2 is a narrow band gap semiconductor with an optical gap of 1.32 eV. The oxide was characterized photoelectrochemically; its conduction band (-1.09 V-RHE) is located below that of SnO2 (-0.86 V-RHE) at pH similar to 13.5 itself more negative than the H2O/H-2 level leading to a thermodynamically favorable H-2 evolution under visible irradiation. The sensitizer CuFeO2, working as an electron pump, is stable towards photocorrosion by hole consumption reactions involving the reducing agents X2- (=S2O32 and SO32-). The photoactivity was dependent the precursor and the best performance (0.026 ml h (1) mg(-1)) was obtained in S2O32- (pH similar to 13.5) over CuFeO2 synthesized from nitrate with a mass ratio (CuFeO2/SnO2) equal to unity. A quantum yield of 0.5% was obtained under polychromatic light. H-2 liberation S2O32- occurs concomitantly with the oxidation of S2O32- to dithionate and sulfate. The tendency towards saturation, in a closed system, is mainly ascribed to the competitive reduction of the end product S2O62-. (C) 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

To break this scaling relationship in OER, a bifunctional mechanism was proposed recently, in which the energetically demanding step of forming the *OOH intermediate, through the attack of a water molecule on the oxo unit (*O, with * representing a reactive metal center), is facilitated by proton transfer to the second catalytic site. This mechanism was supported theoretically but so far by only very few experiments with a proton-transfer agent in basic media. However, active metal-containing catalysts could be destroyed in alkaline media, raising questions on practical applications. To date, this mechanism still lacks a systematic spectroscopic support by observing the short-lived and limited amount of reactive intermediates. Here, we report an operando Raman spectroscopic observation of the OER intermediates in neutral media, for the first time, via a bifunctional mechanism using a carboxylated graphene-MnO2 (represented by Gr-C-MnO2) electrocatalyst. The formation of the Mn-OOH intermediate after the attack of a water molecule on the Mn = O complex is followed by a proton transfer from Mn-OOH to the functionalized carboxylates. The role of the functionalized carboxylates to improve the catalytic efficiency was further confirmed by both pH-dependent and isotope (H/D)-labeling experiments. Furthermore, with a unique strategy of using a hybrid aqueous/nonaqueous electrolyte, the OER was alleviated, allowing sufficient Mn-OH and Mn-OOH intermediates for in situ Raman spectroscopic observation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000746444100001	35045704

In this work, a novel carbon and nitrogen co-doped ultrafine Fe3O4 nanoparticles (CN-Fe3O4) have been synthesized by triethylamine (TEA) induction and subsequent calcination. The addition of TEA could not only regulate the size of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, but also promote the formation of amorphous carbon layer. Well-designed CN-Fe3O4 heterostructures provide a highly interconnected porous conductive network, large heterogeneous interface area, large specific surface area and a large number of active sites, which greatly improve conductivity and promote electron transfer and electrolyte diffusion. The prepared CN-Fe3O4 electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 399.3 mF cm(-2) and good cycling stability. Meanwhile, CN-Fe3O4 catalyst exhibits excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities, with overpotentials of 136 and 281 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. This work provides a promising approach for the design of high-performance anode materials for supercapacitors and provides profound implications for the development of catalysts with bifunctional catalytic activity.

Toward universal utilization of hydrogen energy, developing high-efficiency, low-cost, and sustainable energy conversion technologies, especially water-splitting electrolyzers and fuel cells, is of paramount significance. In order to enhance the energy conversion efficiency of the water-splitting electrolyzers and fuel cells, earth-abundant and stable electrocatalysts are essential for accelerating the sluggish kinetics of hydrogen and oxygen reactions. In the past decade, carbon-rich nanomaterials have emerged as a promising class of hydrogen and oxygen electrocatalysts. Here, the development and electrocatalytic activity of various carbon-rich materials, including metal-free carbon, conjugated porous polymers, graphdiyne, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), atomic-metal-doped carbon, as well as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), are demonstrated. In particular, the correlations between their porous nanostructures/electronic structures of active centers and electrocatalytic performances are emphatically discussed. Therefore, this review article guides the rational design and synthesis of high-performance, metal-free, and noble-metal-free carbon-rich electrocatalysts and eventually advances the rapid development of water-splitting electrolyzers and fuel cells toward practical applications.									102	7	0	0	4	0	102			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000446056700002	30043531

Here, a unique member of efficient OER electrocatalysts has been developed based upon structurally versatile dumbbell-shaped ternary transition-metal (Cu, Ni, Co) phosphates with a three-dimensional (3D) (Cu-2(OH)(PO4)/Ni-3(PO4)(2)center dot 8H(2)O/Co-3(PO4)(2)center dot 8H(2)O) (CNCP) structure. This structure is prepared using a simple aqueous stepwise addition of metal ion source approach. Various structural investigations demonstrate highly crystalline nature of the composite structure. Apart from the unique structural aspect, it is important that the CNCP composite structure has proved to be an excellent electrocatalyst for OER performance in comparison with its binary or constituent phosphate under alkaline and neutral conditions. Notably, the CNCP electrocatalyst displays a much lower overpotential of 224 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a lower Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1) with high stability in alkaline medium. In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis suggested that the activity and long-term durability for the OER of the ternary 3D metal phosphate are due to the presence of electrochemically dynamic constituents such as Ni and Co and their resulting synergistic effects, which was further supported by theoretical studies. Theoretical calculations also reveal that the incredible OER execution was ascribed to the electron redistribution set off in the presence of Ni and Cu and the most favorable interaction between the *OOH intermediate and the active sites of CNCP. This work may attract the attention of researchers to construct efficient 3D ternary metal phosphate catalysts for various applications in the field of electrochemistry.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000757878100001	35084167

A novel two-dimensional (2D) Co(II)-MOF {[Co-5(HL)(4)(dpp)(2)(H2O)(2)(mu-OH)(2)]center dot 21H(2)O}(n) has been designed and synthesized by adopting a mixed-ligand strategy, using 1,3-di(4-pyridyl)propane (dpp) colinker with a flexible spacer H3L (H3L: 5-(2 carboxybenzyloxy)isophthalic acid). Co(II)-MOF features a 2D network, which is further interpenetrated among the equivalent sets and therefore results in a 3D supramolecular network. Topologically, the entire network can be viewed as a (3,4,8)-connected three-nodal net with the extended point symbol of {4.5.7}4-{4(12).5(2).7(10).9(4)}{5(2).8.9(2).10}2, duly assigned to the novel topological type smm2. The functional utility of Co(II)-MOF is demonstrated by employing it toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a photoelectrochemical cell, exhibiting appreciable photocurrents of up to 5.89 mA/cm(2) when used as an anode in a photoelectrochemical cell, while also displaying encouraging electrocatalytic currents of 9.32 mA/cm(2) (at 2.01 V vs RHE) for the OER Moreover, detailed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies confirm enhanced charge-transfer kinetics and improved conductivity under illumination with minimal effect of interfacial phenomena. This work provides a reference for the expanding field of research into applications of MOF materials and establishes MOF materials as favorable candidates for sustainable and efficient design of electrodes for water splitting.									43	2	0	0	5	0	43			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000464769400028	30888790

Herein, we have decorated NiFe2O4 nanoparticles on the emerging novel two-dimensional (2D) Ti3C2 (MXene) sheets in order to achieve better electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The synthesized NiFe2O4/Ti3C2 composite showed extraordinary kinetic metrics for electrocatalytic OER, revealing a low overpotential of 266 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), and a small Tafel slope of 73.6 mV/dec. For HER, the composite exhibited an overpotential of 173 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) with a small Tafel slope of 112.2 mV/dec. The high electrocatalytic performance of NiFe2O4/Ti3C2 composite is believed to be originated from a well-constructed nanoparticle-sheet interface, synergistic effect, and the high metallic conductivity of Ti3C2 MXene sheets. These experimental results are further supported by the state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) simulations. The study providing information about the structure, electronic properties, bonding, and interaction mechanism between Ti3C2 (MXene) and NiFe2O4. Moreover, offering the values of the theoretical overpotential of Ti3C2 (MXene), NiFe2O4, and the NiFe2O4/Ti3C2 composite for both OER and HER activities. Interestingly, the theoretical overpotential follows the qualitative trend of NiFe2O4/Ti3C2 < NiFe2O4 < Ti3C2 MXene for OER and NiFe2O4/Ti3C2 < Ti3C2 MXene < NiFe2O4 for HER, agreeing with the experimental observations. There is charge transfer from NiFe2O4 to MXene leading to enhancement in electronic states near Fermi level which may be due to interactions between C 2p orbital of Ti3C2 MXene and 3d orbital of Ni and Fe. Therefore, this work provides new insights for designing new efficient non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts in the future. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The results indicated faster grain growth under greater current density. In contrast to conventionally annealed specimen, the grain boundary mobility was enhanced by almost two orders of magnitude with the applied electric current, revealing that joule heating alone was not sufficient to account for the experimental results. Instead, activation energy for grain growth decreased significantly due to electro-sintering. Systematic characterization of graded microstructure further indicated that local oxygen vacancies and specimen temperature were responsible for a grain size transition. Based on electrochemical reaction involved in flash sintering, grain size reduction at the cathode was proposed to be attributed to the local rearrangement of lattice cations and generated oxygen ions.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			0955-2219	1873-619X		WOS:000457819600085

The ITO films were deposited on glass substrates using a 20 cm target-to-substrate distance in a pure argon sputtering environment. X-ray diffraction results showed that an increase in substrate temperature resulted in ITO structure evolution from amorphous to polycrystalline. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy micrographs suggested that the ITO films were free of bombardment of energetic particles since the microstructures of the films exhibited a smaller grain size and no sub-grain boundary could be observed. The surface composition of the ITO films was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Oxygen atoms in both amorphous and crystalline ITO structures were observed from O 1 s XPS spectra. However, the peak of the oxygen atoms in amorphous ITO phase could only be found in samples prepared at low substrate temperatures. Its relative peak area decreased drastically when substrate temperatures were larger than 200 degrees C. In addition, a composition analysis from the XPS results revealed that the films deposited at low substrate temperatures contained high concentration of oxygen at the film Surfaces. The oxygen-rich surfaces can be attributed to hydrolysis reactions of indium oxides, especially when large amount of the amorphous ITO were developed near the film Surfaces. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It has been proposed that ammonia, one of water analogues, functions as an inhibitor of O-2 evolution at alkaline pH. However, the detailed mechanism of inhibition has not been understood yet. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of ammonia inhibition by examining the NH4Cl-induced inhibition of O-2 evolution in a wide pH range (pH 5.0-8.0) and by detecting the interaction site using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In addition to intact PSII membranes from spinach, PSII membranes depleted of the PsbP and PsbQ extrinsic proteins were used as samples to avoid the effect of the release of these proteins by salt treatments. In both types of samples, oxygen evolution activity decreased by approximately 40% by addition of 100 mM NH4Cl in the range of pH 5.0-8.0. The presence of inhibition at acidic pH without significant pH dependence strongly suggests that NH4+ cation functions as a major inhibitor in the acidic pH region, where neutral NH3 scarcely exists in the buffer. The NH4Cl treatment at pH 6.5 and 5.5 induced prominent changes in the COO- stretching regions in FTIR difference spectra upon the S-1 -> S-2 transition measured at 283 K. The NH4Cl concentration dependence of the amplitude of the spectral changes showed a good correlation with that of the inhibition of O-2 evolution. From this observation, it is proposed that NH4+ cation interacts with carboxylate groups coupled to the Mn cluster as direct ligands or proton transfer mediators, causing inhibition of the O-2 evolving reaction.									26	1	1	0	21	0	28			0006-2960			WOS:000288970800015	21338049

We focused on two representative GOxs, of which crystal structures have already been reported-Penicillium amagasakiense GOx (PDB ID; 1gpe) and Aspergillus niger GOx (PDB ID; 1cf3). We constructed oxygen-interacting structural models for GOxs, and predicted the residues responsible for oxidative half reaction with oxygen on the basis of the crystal structure of cholesterol oxidase as well as on the fact that both enzymes are members of the glucose/methanol/choline (GMC) oxidoreductase family. Rational amino acid substitution resulted in the construction of an engineered GOx with drastically decreased oxidase activity and increased dehydrogenase activity, which was higher than that of the wild-type enzyme. As a result, the dehydrogenase/oxidase ratio of the engineered enzyme was more than 11-fold greater than that of the wild-type enzyme. These results indicate that alteration of the dehydrogenase/oxidase activity ratio of GOxs is possible by introducing a mutation into the putative functional residues responsible for oxidative half reaction with oxygen of these enzymes, resulting in a further increased dehydrogenase activity. This is the first study reporting the alteration of GOx electron acceptor preference from oxygen to an artificial electron acceptor.									29	1	0	0	17	0	32			1422-0067			WOS:000311425000024	23203056

C3N4 was doped by phosphorus (P) to controllably reduce its oxidation performance while narrowing the band gap, so as to improve its light absorption ability and reduce the side-reactions caused by excessive oxidation capacity. Due to the much higher reducibility, C3N4 has been identified as an ideal carrier for this design philosophy, which can make up the power lack of producing O-2 induced by the reduced oxidation capacity while P being doped. Successively, via adjusting the relationship between the overall water splitting activity and energy band structure of the catalyst, it was proved that the regulation of oxidation capacity has an important effect on the photocatalytic water splitting. The photocatalytic H-2 and O-2 evolution rates were 0.67 and 0.27 mu mol h(-1), respectively. This research will provide a new idea to improve the performance of overall water splitting with energy band structure regulation in the future.

Under non-isothermal conditions it was found that Mg(ClO4)2 decomposes through a stepwise release of oxygen forming unstable intermediates which produce MgO, not MgCl2, as a final decomposition product. The kinetic parameters of the decomposition reaction were deduced employing a computer-oriented kinetic analysis of the alpha-t data obtained under isothermal conditions in the temperature range 300-500-degrees-C. This indicates that the decomposition process is governed by the Ginstling-Brounshtein equation. In order to evaluate the effect of additives on the catalytic thermal decomposition reaction, the decomposition of Mg(ClO4)2 was followed in the presence of CuV2O6 and MgV2O6 catalysts. The results show that CuV2O6 had a remarkable catalytic acceleration effect while addition of MgV2O6 retarded the decomposition of Mg(ClO4)2. These effects are discussed on the basis of the redox couple, Cu2+ + e- reversible Cu+, which promotes the decomposition reaction via a charge-transfer mechanism. In the case of MgV2O6 addition, the retarding effect seems to arise from the hindrance of gaseous oxygen evolution. Finally, the effect of additives was followed kinetically and a modified catalytic mechanism is proposed.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			0040-6031			WOS:A1991FY56300004

The ideas of Kisliuk regarding the kinetic role of weakly held adsorbed states as precursors to stronger chemisorption are shown to be important for reverse spillover, as highlighted by Boudart's concept of the 'collection zone'. STM has proved to be an important tool for the understanding of the formation and thermal evolution of nanoparticles on surfaces. Here we present direct, in situ observations of spillover for the reaction of oxygen with Pd nanoparticles on TiO2(110). In turn, this is connected to a form of SMSI, and it is proposed that this spillover may also be the mechanism of the oxygen storage phenomenon for CeO2-doped automobile catalysts.

The unique lone-pair electrons induced effect gives rise to enhancement of active sites and conductivity, which facilitates adsorption/desorption and fast charge transfer for oxygen containing intermediates. As-obtained NFBS/NF shows comparable activity with a low overpotential of 219 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 79 mV dec(-1), attributing to the active centers of Ni and Fe atoms, and increased active sites by Bi modification. In addition, NFBS/NF exhibits robust oxygen process during the i-t-test for 20 h, indicating a promising ternary metal sulfide for alkaline water splitting. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

By two steps exfoliation in a bath and tip sonicator, the g-C3N4 (NS/QD) was produced from bulk g-C3N4. To improve electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the g-C3N4 (NS/QD) were modified by the MoS2 nanostructures. Nanocomposite of the g-C3N4 (NS/QD) with MoS2 nanostructures was deposited on a flexible, conductive and three dimensional carbon cloth by a facile and binder-free electrophoretic technique. This electrode exhibited a Tafel slope of 88 mV/dec and an overpotential of 0.28 V vs RHE at -2 mA/cm(2), lower than that of the g-C3N4, and good stability after 1000 cycles and 100 days for HER. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance was attributed to the MoS2 and g-C3N4 nanostructures on three dimensional carbon cloth, leading to high surface area and more number of the exposed active sites for HER. This heterostructure improved charge transport, proton adsorption and hydrogen evolution on the electrode. This work proposes cost-effective, stable and three dimensional g-C3N4 based electrode for hydrogen evolution reaction. (c) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A molecular nitrogen (N-2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) ice mixture was irradiated at 10 K with 5 keV electrons to simulate the electronic interaction effects of Galactic cosmic-ray bombardment of extraterrestrial ice samples over a time of 5 x 10(6) yr. By monitoring the experiment with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer on line and in situ, the temporal evolution of the 2235 cm(-1) absorption band of nitrous oxide was found to follow pseudo-first-order kinetics. This indicates that the mechanism of formation is most likely a reaction between ground-state molecular nitrogen, N-2(X-1 Sigma(+)(g)), and an oxygen atom, either in the ground state (P-3) or in the first electronically excited state (D-1), within the matrix cage through an addition of the oxygen atom to a non-bonding electron pair on the nitrogen molecule. The observation of nitrous oxide together with the kinetics and dynamics studies investigated in this paper underline the role of nonequilibrium processes in low-temperature ice matrices, aid in the understanding of chemical reaction pathways that exist in extraterrestrial ices, and assist a prospective identification of nitrous oxide on the surfaces of Pluto and Triton.									42	0	1	0	1	0	42			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000228554200043

The PMS activation mechanisms, nevertheless, are still ambiguous in many cases, and, thus, controlling PMS activation pathways for efficient pollutant removal remains challenging. In this work, taking defective PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+delta (PBSCF) as a model system, we demonstrate that oxygen vacancies (V-circle(center dot center dot)) strongly promote PMS-based AOP, and PMS activation pathways are effectively tuned. Excessive V(degrees)(center dot center dot)s are found to modify the surface charge distribution, change PMS adsorption configuration, and break the S-O bond of PMS. As a result, the radical process is promoted, and the predominant nonradical activation pathway shifts from an electron transfer process to singlet oxygen formation. Our mechanistic understanding can guide the rational design of catalysts for efficient water remediation.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8				2666-3864		WOS:000702852400010

Equivalent circuit approximation to porous mixed-conducting oxygen electrodes in solid-state cells								Proceedings of the Third International Symposium on Ionic and Mixed Conducting Ceramics								453	86						1998	1998	While porous mixed ionic-electronic conductors (MIECs) have been widely used as electrodes for solid-state ionic devices, the electrochemical processes occurring in such an electrode are still not well understood. Equivalent circuit analyses indicate that there are three parallel paths for electrode reactions to occur in a cell with porous MIEC electrodes (i) the triple-phase boundary (TPB) between the electrolyte, the MIEC, and O2 gas, (ii) the TPB between the current collector, the MIEC, and O2 gas, and (iii) the interface between the MIEC and O2 gas. The relative significance of each path is determined not only by the transport and catalytic properties of the MIEC but also by the interfaces between the MIEC and other cell components. The effectiveness of the MIEC/gas interface is influenced by the rates of several sequential processes: transfer of ionic defects across the MIEC/electrolyte interface, transport of ionic and electronic defects in the MIEC, reaction at the MIEC/gas interface, and transport of O2 in the pores of the MIEC. Accordingly, oxygen diffusion in the MIEC and reaction at the MIEC/gas interface are only part, not the entirety, of the electrode kinetics. In general, the TPBs cannot be ignored without careful analysis or adequate justification. Further, as a first order approximation, it is demonstrated that the thickness of the electrochemically active layer of a porous MIEC electrode, delta, varies dramatically with the properties of the MIEC. Typically, delta decreases with increased rate of surface reaction and with decreased transport of ionic or electronic defects in the MIEC. In the absence of ionic or electronic transport in the MIEC, for instance, delta approaches zero, i.e, oxygen reduction or evolution can occur only at one of the TPBs.

J	[Anonymous]								Green and sustainable applications of energetic plasmon-activated water								Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry				111				18	34						2022	2022	This review describes the use of bulk deionized water (DIW) treatment to become plasmon-activatedwater (PAW) with reduced hydrogen bonds (HBs). PAW with special properties can be used in innovativeapplications and development of environmental protection science and sustainable energy management.PAW is a natural water solvent, but PAW subverts the public’s idea that hydrophobic solutes are difficultto dissolve in water. PAW can dissolve more-hydrophobic solutes than ordinary water, and can also interactwith water-soluble alcohol molecules to form stronger HBs. Moreover, in the application of certainreduction reactions, no chemical reducing agent is needed, and the catalytic reduction effect can beachieved using natural PAW. A characteristic application of PAW can also be extended to seawater desalination.Due to weak HBs among PAW molecules, high water evaporation rates can be produced, and ahigher chemical potential can also be applied to the innovative development of solar energy storage.In electrochemical applications, PAW itself can promote water oxidation, oxygen reduction reactions,hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, and the efficient capacitor production of H2O2. Furthermore,PAW can delay the melting of sea ice in the habitat of polar bears, so it may be applied to the issue ofsaving polar bears.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1226-086X			KJD:ART002862748

Significant improvements in NRR activity require the balance of binding strength of reaction intermediates. Herein, we have investigated the C3N-supported monometallic (M/C3N) and bimetallic (M1M2/C3N) atoms for the electrochemical NRR by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results show that this linear relation does exist for SACs because all the intermediates bind to the same site on M/C3N. But the synergistic effect of the two atoms in M1M2/C3N can create a more flexible adsorption site for intermediates, which results in the decoupling of adsorption free energies of key intermediates. Subsequently, the fundamental limitation of scaling relations on limiting potentials is broken through. Most notably, the optimal limiting potential is increased from -0.63 V for M/C3N to -0.20 V for M1M2/C3N. In addition, the presence of bimetallic atoms can also effectively inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as well as improve the stability of the catalysts. This study proposes that the introduction of bimetallic atoms into C3N is beneficial to break the linear relations and develop efficient NRR electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000803799000006

In particular, metal oxides having mixed valence states can be good candidates, as they offer readily available intermediates useful in dye degradations. Here in we have proposed, a di-manganese copper oxide (Mn2CuO4) with clustered-petal morphologies, having mixed-valence states of Mn (III/IV) and Cu (II/I) is utilized for the industrial dye degradation process. A Fenton-like reaction pathway is observed in degrading RhodamineB (k = 7.15 x 10(-2) min(-1)) following first-order reaction kinetics. The high catalytic activity of Mn2CuO4 is due to the co-existent redox cycle (Mn(III) + Cu(II) <-> Mn(IV) + Cu(I)), operating within the system. The versatility of Mn2CuO4 in dye degradation is verified using a host of textile-related dyes in the present study. Potential reusability and stability in wide pH range of the catalyst are also examined and found to be suitable for commercial purposes.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000703862300003

It has been studied extensively by surface analytic methods, such as scanning tunneling microscopy. However, it is still challenging to secure a direct observation of the structural evolution of surfaces of nanocatalysts in reaction (gas and heating) conditions at the atomic scale.

The developed electrolyte enables hydrogen-free, dendrite-free Zn plating/stripping over 1500 h cycle (3000 cycles) at 2 mA cm(-2) with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency. Meanwhile, the oxygen-induced corrosion and passivation are also effectively suppressed. These features bring Zn-ion batteries an unprecedented long lifespan over 40 000 cycles at 4 A g(-1) and high voltage of 2.05 V with a cobalt hexacyanoferrate cathode. Furthermore, a 28.6 mu m thick solid polymer electrolyte of a poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) film filled with poly(ethylene oxide)/ionic-liquid-based Zn salt is constructed to build an all-solid-state Zn-ion battery. The all-solid-state Zn-ion batteries show excellent cycling performance of 30 000 cycles at 2 A g(-1) at room temperature and withstand high temperature up to 70 degrees C, low temperature to -20 degrees C, as well as abuse test of bending deformation up to 150 degrees for 100 cycles and eight times cutting.

In this paper, the influence of exposed facets on the pyrolysis of organic modifiers and thereafter the photoactivity of photo catalysts was investigated by using the thermal pyrolysis of dicyanodiamide (DCDA) over TiO2 as an example. Experimental results revealed that {001} -faceted TiO2 was favorable for the formation of carbon dots modified TiO2 nanosheets. In contrast, the deep pyrolysis of organic precursor over {101} facets contributed to the formation of oxygen-deficient TiO2. Benefitted from the oxygen vacancy mediated mechanism, nearly order-of-magnitude improvement in hydrogen evolution rate was achieved for 101 -faceted TiO2 treated by DCDA, which was much higher than the treated 001-TiO2 and P25. This work not only provides new insights into the facet-dependent activity of TiO2 photocatalysts, but also offers a facile strategy for exploring high-efficiency photocatalysts for water splitting through facet tailoring.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000515195200045

In its practical application, an ultrahigh initial round-trip efficiency of 79.4% and long-term cycle stability (950 cycles) at 10 mA cm(-2) are achieved in Zn-air battery. This simple strategy for construction of the cost-effective unique 3D porous urchinlike structure together with the improved electrochemical catalytic activity provides a great potential for material design in oxygen catalysis and metal-air batteries.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000515196800092

Herein, N-doped hierarchical mesoporous activated carbon (N-HMACs) are synthesized from commercially available apples via pyrolysis and carbonization strategy, on this basis, a free-standing cathode of RuO2 nanoparticles (RuO2 NPs) anchored on as-prepared N-HMACs is obtained via subsequent solvothermal process (N-HMACs-RuO2), which avoids the parasitic reaction caused by binder and facilitates electron transport. The porous structure of the cathode provides sufficient transfer channels for reactants and affords space for product accommodation. While the anchored RuO2 NPs not only serve as catalytic sites to accelerate O-2 reduction/ evolution kinetics but also optimize the reaction process, making it more susceptible to form sheet-like Li2O2 by the surface-adsorption pathway, which is further confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As a result, the assembled Li-O-2 battery with N-HMACs-RuO2 cathode displays enhanced electrochemical performances, including high capacity, low over-potential, and outstanding cycling stability.									22	1	0	0	1	0	23			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000551511800006

Both sputtering and annealing in vacuum introduce lower oxidation state V species, leading to an increased intensity of V 3d derived bands close to the Fermi level. Such oxygen deficient surfaces exhibit low work function values as low as 4.40 eV. Annealing the sample under low-pressure oxygen atmosphere (few times 10(-4) mbar partial O-2 pressure) results in stoichiometric VO2 surfaces with a high work function of up to 6.70 eV. Moreover, the work function of the VO2 can be continuously tuned between the high and low limits by adjusting the atomic ratio of oxygen and vanadium at the surface. Appropriately adjusted VO2 can thus be employed as moderate electron as well as superior hole injecting electrode material in electronic and optoelectronic devices.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2196-7350			WOS:000451053200003

Unfortunately, the ORR kinetics is sluggish even at prohibitive platinum group metal catalysts. Two-dimensional materials have attracted increasing interest for energy production and storage in the last years, due to their exceptional chemical, physical, optical, and electronic properties. In this review, we briefly report the recent progress of two-dimensional catalysts for the ORR. Particularly, we approach to heteroatom-doped graphenic materials, dichalcogenides, and MXenes offering results that demonstrate outstanding properties of these materials for the construction of competitive ORR electrocatalysts without platinum group metals.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			2451-9103			WOS:000599420500022

The structural morphologies of the materials were investigated by various X-ray spectroscopic and electron microscopic analyses. The results revealed that very fine secondary core-shell nanoparticles containing Ir degrees and Ir4+ species were decorated on the surfaces of cassiterite SnO2 nanoparticles, resulting in an increase of specific surface area and a small reduction of SnO2 crystallize size. The gas-sensing performances of all fabricated sensors were evaluated towards several volatile organic acids particularly CH2O2, volatile organic compounds and hydrocarbon gases at working temperature in the range of 200-400 degrees C in dry and humid air. The data revealed that the 1 wt% Ir-loaded SnO2 provided the optimal sensor response of similar to 1.43 x 10(5) to 1000 ppm CH2O2 at an optimum working temperature of 350 degrees C. In addition, the sensors presented moderately low humidity effect on CH2O2 response and high CH2O2 selectivity against C2H5OH, CH3OH, C3H6O, C7H8, C6H6, C8H10, HCHO, CH4, H-2, C2H4O2, C3H6O2, C4H8O2, C5H10O2 and C3H6O3. The electronic and gas-sensing mechanisms could be primarily ascribed to metal-metal-semiconductor heterojunctions and catalytic effects of Ir-IrO2 via oxygen spill-over and oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms. Therefore, the loading of catalytic core-shell Ir nanoparticles on SnO2 nanostructures was a highly promising approach to achieve ultrasensitive and selective sensing of formic acid.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				0925-4005		WOS:000652628600002

Herein, an effective idea for designing bifunctional catalysts is presented by regulating the surface electronic structures of Nb2CT2 (T = O, F, and OH) using Pt/Pd single atoms. The results indicated that Pt-doped systems (Nb2CO2-V-O-Pt, Nb2CF2-V-F-Pt) were the most promising bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts. In particular, Nb2CF2-V-F-Pt was even better than landmark Pt(111) and IrO2(110) catalysts, with relatively low overpotentials of 0.40 V and 0.37 V for ORR and OER, respectively. The high catalytic nature of Nb2CF2-V-F-Pt was explained by electronic structures, volcano plots, and charge transfer mechanisms, which mainly depended on the electron donor capacity and synergistic effects from F-terminated groups and Pt noble metals. Moreover, 100% utilization of Pt was achieved for the designed bifunctional catalysts with a minimum radius between two adjacent active centers. This was the first design of a bifunctional ORR/OER catalyst based on Nb2CT2 and highlighted a new perspective on the application of MXenes.									62	3	0	0	1	0	60			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521938400014

The result shows the existence of a strong electronic coupling between CoS2 and N, S-codoped graphene. The pyrrolic and pyridinic type nitrogen and Sin the form of C-S-C in N, S-codoped graphene are found to be the anchoring sites of the CoS2 nanoparticles. As a bifunctional catalyst, the CoS2/N, S-codoped graphene exhibits an oxygen reduction onset potential of 0.963 V vs. RHE and delivers an oxygen evolution overpotential of 393 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Its oxygen reduction and evolution catalytic activities are comparable to those of the Pt/C and the state-of-art RuO2/C, respectively. Most impressively, the CoS2/N, S-codoped graphene exhibits a potential gap of 771 mV. This value is lower than those of most bifuntional catalysts reported, clearly indicating its potential use as the bifunctional catalyst to replace the noble -metal based catalysts for practical applications. Additionally, our results also suggest a great importance to prepare a single pure phase CoS2 in improving the catalytic bifunctionality of the CoS2/N, S-codoped graphene. The primary Zn-air battery with CoS2/N, S-codoped graphene shows a higher discharge peak power density than that with Pt/C.									37	1	0	0	4	0	37			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000433267100021

Electrode was prepared by first coating graphene oxide on the FTO substrate followed by layering the nickel loaded PCN and finally by applying an appropriate voltage to reduce the graphene oxide in situ electrochemical reaction. The loading of nickel cocatalyst into PCN together with the integration of ERGO layer substantially improved its HER efficiency. Effect of various concentrations of Ni and GO on the HER activity of the developed electrocatalyst were investigated. Therein, ERGO(1)/Ni-2@PCN catalyst containing 41% Ni and 50% GO (with respect to PCN) with only one layer of each component demonstrated excellent HER activity and stability with low onset and overpotentials of -20 mV, eta@10 mA cm(-2) of -360 mV, respectively, and remarkable hydrogen generation rate of 27.5 mmol h(-1) g(-1) in 1 M KOH. This noble-metal-free catalytic system is simple yet highly promising for the efficient hydrogen evolution reaction from water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0032-3861	1873-2291		WOS:000696997900003

Effect of NO2 concentration								ENERGY & FUELS				13	2			499	505		10.1021/ef980165h				MAR-APR 1999	1999	The reactions of a potassium-containing bituminous coal briquette and the corresponding catalyst-free char with different NO/O-2 mixtures have been investigated at temperatures between 300 and 325 degrees C. The isothermal reactions have been followed by two techniques: thermogravimetry and gas chromatography + chemiluminescence analysis. A NO/NO2 mixture rich in NO2 results in a high carbon loss compared to that corresponding to the mixture poor in NO2. Despite that, NOx conversion is similar for both mixtures. The extra weight loss in the presence of a high concentration of NO2 is a consequence of NO2 reduction by carbon, producing NO and CO2 evolution.

We had shown previously by biochemical methods that the domain (364)E- D-440 of CP 47 interacts with the 33 kDa extrinsic protein of photosystem II [Odom, W. R., & Bricker, T. M. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 5616-5620]. In this study, using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803, mutations at 17 conserved charged residues were introduced into the domain (364)E-(444)R Of the CP 47 protein. Only mutations introduced at positions (384)R and (385)R led to a modified PS II phenotype. We previously described a mutation at (RR384385GG) which resulted in a mutant with a defective oxygen-evolving complex [Putnam-Evans, C., & Bricker, T. M. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 11482-11488]. An additional set of mutations, (384)R to (384)G, (385)R to (385)G, and (384,385)RR to (384,385)EE has now been introduced at this site yielding the mutants R384G, R385G, and RR384385EE, respectively. Steady state oxygen evolution measurements and quantum yield measurements demonstrated that these mutants exhibited significant alterations in their ability to evolve oxygen. Total fluorescence yield measurements indicated that all of these mutants contained about 85%-90% of the PS II reaction centers found in the control strain. This decrease was insufficient to explain the oxygen evolution results. Analysis of oxygen flash yield parameters indicated that there was little change in the S-state parameters alpha, beta, gamma, or delta. Measurement of the S-2 lifetime, however, demonstrated that the S-2 lifetime of the mutants was 2-3 times longer than that of the control. Additionally, examination of the risetime of the oxygen signal indicated that there was a significant retardation (6-7-fold) in the rate of oxygen release, suggesting a retarded S-3-[S-4]-S-0 transition. These data reinforce our hypothesis that the positive charge density at positions (384)R and (385)R in the large extrinsic loop of CP 47 is necessary for its function in water oxidation. We speculate that this positive charge density may be an important factor in establishing the proper interaction between CP 47 and the 33 kDa extrinsic protein.									43	0	0	0	37	0	43			0006-2960			WOS:A1996UC97700023	8672438

In the past several years, attributed to the development of novel synthesis strategies, characterization techniques, and theoretical calculations, the rational design and realization of a variety of Co, Ni-based (hydr)oxides with exciting performances have been demonstrated. Particularly, the electrocatalytic reactivities of these Co, Ni-based (hydr)oxides are highly dependent on their surface electronic structures, which can be well tuned by their nanostructures and compositions. This Review summarizes recent research advances in regulating electronic structures toward the optimization of electrochemical reactivity in aqueous solutions. These research works mainly focus on three important clean energy reactions: i) water oxidation, ii) oxygen reduction, and iii) carbon dioxide reduction, where the developments of advanced electrocatalysts can enable the production of value-added chemicals or fuels. Furthermore, the electronic structure-property relationships behind the enhanced electrocatalytic properties of these Co, Ni-based (hydr)oxides are also discussed.									60	5	0	0	1	0	60			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000456422500008

A Mn4Ca cluster embedded in the photosystem II protein environment is responsible for the production of atmospheric oxygen. Here, time-resolved x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) is used to observe the process of oxygen formation in real time. These experiments reveal that the oxygen evolution step, initiated by three sequential laser flashes, is accompanied by rapid (within 50 mu s) changes to the Mn K beta XES spectrum. However, no oxidation of the Mn4Ca core above the all-Mn-IV state is detected to precede O-O bond formation, and the observed changes are therefore assigned to O-O bond-formation dynamics. We propose that O-O bond formation occurs prior to the transfer of the final (fourth) electron from the Mn4Ca cluster to the oxidized tyrosine Tyr(Z) residue. This model resolves the kinetic limitations associated with O-O bond formation and suggests an evolutionary adaptation to avoid releasing harmful peroxide species.									26	0	0	0	3	0	26			2160-3308			WOS:000448058400001	31231592

However, the lack of thermodynamic stability has hindered its practical uses. The insertion of transition metals and nonmetals in the interlayers and the crystal is known to improve both the thermodynamic stability and the catalytic efficacy of 1T-MoS2. In this study, for the first time we have developed an electrocatalyst for water splitting based on metallic copper molybdenum sulfide (1T-CMS). The present catalyst, P-doped and intercalated 1T-CMS ultrathin 2D nanosheets on carbon cloth (P-1T-CMS@CC), demonstrates excellent catalytic efficacy for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It required an overpotential of 95 mV for HER and of 284 mV for OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The P-1T-CMS@CC(+ -) device also shows excellent performance, requiring a cell voltage of only 1.51 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000787374700050	35302340

However, most of them involve other metal residuals, which would cause the tedious pre- and/or post-treatment, even mislead the mechanistic investigations and active-site identification. Herein, we report a precursor-dilution strategy to synthesize Fe SACs through the Schiff-based reaction via co-polycondensation of amino-metalloporphyrin, followed by pyrolysis at high temperature. Systematic characterization results provide the compelling evidence of the dominant presence of atomically dispersed Fe-N(x)species. Our catalyst shows superior ORR performance with positive half-wave potential (E-1/2=0.85 V vs. RHE) in alkaline condition and moderate activity (E-1/2=0.68 V vs. RHE) under the acidic condition, excellent methanol tolerance and good long-term stability. All the results indicate Fe SACs would be a promising candidate for replacing the precious Pt in metal-air batteries and fuel cells.									14	2	0	0	0	0	14			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000549621300011

The potassium ions in K-PHI can be exchanged with other ions to change the properties of the material and eventually to design the catalysts. We report here the electronic structures of several ion-exchanged salts of K-PHI (K, H, Au, Ru, and Mg) and their feasibility as water splitting photocatalysts, which were determined by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The DFT results are complemented by experiments where the performances in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were recorded. We show that due to its narrow band gap, Ru-PHI is not a suitable photocatalyst. The water oxidation potentials are straddled between the band edge potentials of H-PHI, Au-PHI, and Mg-PHI; thus, these are active photocatalysts for both the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, whereas K-PHI is active only for the HER. The experimental data show that these are active HER photocatalysts, in agreement with the DFT results. Furthermore, Mg-PHI has shown remarkable performance in the HER, with a rate of 539 mu mol/(h.g) and a quantum efficiency of 7.14% at 410 nm light irradiation, which could be due to activation of the water molecule upon adsorption, as predicted by our DFT calculations.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000670787500005	34239658

Omics-Inferred Partitioning and Expression of Diverse Biogeochemical Functions in a Low-O-2 Cyanobacterial Mat Community								MSYSTEMS				6	6					e01042-21	10.1128/mSystems.01042-21				NOV-DEC 2021	2021	Cyanobacterial mats profoundly influenced Earth's biological and geochemical evolution and still play important ecological roles in the modern world. However, the biogeochemical functioning of cyanobacterial mats under persistent low-O-2 conditions, which dominated their evolutionary history, is not well understood. To investigate how different metabolic and biogeochemical functions are partitioned among community members, we conducted metagenomics and metatranscriptomics on cyanobacterial mats in the low-O-2, sulfidic Middle Island sinkhole (MIS) in Lake Huron. Metagenomic assembly and binning yielded 144 draft metagenome assembled genomes, including 61 of medium quality or better, and the dominant cyanobacteria and numerous Proteobacteria involved in sulfur cycling. Strains of a Phormidium autumnale-like cyanobacterium dominated the metagenome and metatranscriptome. Transcripts for the photosynthetic reaction core genes psaA and psbA were abundant in both day and night. Multiple types of psbA genes were expressed from each cyanobacterium, and the dominant psbA transcripts were from an atypical microaerobic type of D1 protein from Phormidium. Further, cyanobacterial transcripts for photosystem I genes were more abundant than those for photo system II, and two types of Phormidium sulfide quinone reductase were recovered, consistent with anoxygenic photosynthesis via photosystem I in the presence of sulfide. Transcripts indicate active sulfur oxidation and reduction within the cyanobacterial mat, predominately by Gammaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria, respectively. Overall, these genomic and transcriptomic results link specific microbial groups to metabolic processes that underpin primary production and biogeochemical cycling in a low-O-2 cyanobacterial mat and suggest mechanisms for tightly coupled cycling of oxygen and sulfur compounds in the mat ecosystem.IMPORTANCE Cyanobacterial mats are dense communities of microorganisms that contain photosynthetic cyanobacteria along with a host of other bacterial species that play important yet still poorly understood roles in this ecosystem. Although such cyanobacterial mats were critical agents of Earth's biological and chemical evolution through geological time, little is known about how they function under the low-oxygen conditions that characterized most of their natural history. Here, we performed sequencing of the DNA and RNA of modern cyanobacterial mat communities under low-oxygen and sulfur-rich conditions from the Middle Island sinkhole in Lake Huron. The results reveal the organisms and metabolic pathways that are responsible for both oxygen-producing and non-oxygen-producing photosynthesis as well as interconversions of sulfur that likely shape how much O-2 is produced in such ecosystems. These findings indicate tight metabolic reactions between community members that help to explain the limited the amount of O-2 produced in cyanobacterial mat ecosystems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2379-5077			WOS:000734620700001	34874776

This was achieved by studying samples extracted at different intervals of time from the reaction bath. The microstructural characterization reveals that at the initial stage of synthesis, a single-phase solid solution of alloy nanoparticles of very small sizes was formed; however, as the reaction time increases, a network of chains of nanoparticles evolves containing particles rich in either Ag or Cu. Keeping the particles in the reaction bath for a longer time, the chemistry of the network changes further with the chain containing an Ag-rich core and Cu2O as the shell. In the present study, we tried to rationalize the evolution of the phases from the observed results.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000413778800012	29034384

An electrochemical activation strategy is demonstrated for the facile regeneration of carbon nanotube (CNT) film prepared via floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition strategy into a flexible, robust, and highly conductive hydrogel-like film, which is promising as electrode matrix for efficient loading of redox species and the fabrication of high-performance flexible pseudosupercapacitors. The strong and conductive CNT films can be effectively expanded and activated by electrochemical anodic oxygen evolution reaction, presenting greatly enhanced internal space and surface wettability with well-maintained strength, flexibility, and conductivity. The as-formed hydrogel-like film is quite favorable for electrochemical deposition of manganese dioxide (MnO2) with loading mass up to 93 wt% and electrode capacitance kept around 300 F g(-1) (areal capacitance of 1.2 F cm(-2)). This hybrid film was further used to assemble a flexible symmetric pseudosupercapacitor without using any other current collectors and conductive additives. The assembled flexible supercapacitors exhibited good rate performance, with the areal capacitance of more than 300 mF cm(-2), much superior to other reported MnO2 based flexible thin-film supercapacitors.									49	2	0	0	2	0	50			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000374334600007	26929042

However, it is a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction often requiring substantial electrical driving force. Second, the concurrent generation of hydrogen and oxygen in close proximity in the state-of-the-art water electrolyzer may pose potentially dangerous consequences. We offer a unique approach for fuel synthesis and report a hydrogen fuel synthesizing a Zn-ferricyanide battery by exploiting the concept of dual electrolytes, where exclusive hydrogen fuel synthesis is spontaneously coupled with electric power production. The key to our approach is short-circuited electrodes housed in dual electrolytes without ionic communication, where oxidative Zn dissolution and reductive hydrogen fuel synthesis are spontaneously driven at the two poles during electric power generation. This battery chemistry eventually amplifies the voltage output of the Zn-ferricyanide battery from similar to 1.7 to similar to 3 V and boosts the energy density from similar to 9.5 to similar to 16 W h/L while concomitantly synthesizing similar to 932 mu mol/h of clean hydrogen fuel. We believe that coupling hydrogen fuel synthesis with electric power harnessing distinctly integrates an extra dimension to battery functionality and articulates a pathway toward balancing global mean temperatures.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2168-0485			WOS:000489986400045		
J	Ressler, T.								Solid-state kinetics and catalytic behavior of selective oxidation catalysts from time-resolved XAFS investigations								CATALYSIS TODAY				145	3-4			258	266		10.1016/j.cattod.2009.02.011				JUL 30 2009	2009	Time-resolved measurements are required to elucidate time-dependencies of the electronic and geometric structure of a catalyst under changing reaction conditions. Monitoring the evolution of the bulk structure of a catalyst under changing conditions reveals the solid-state kinetics of the corresponding reaction. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) permits to reveal quantitative phase composition and average valence together with the evolution of the local structure. Hence, combining time-resolved XAS with simultaneous catalysis measurements may elucidate correlations between catalytic performance, the catalyst state under reaction conditions, and its solid-state kinetics. Here, results from time-resolved in situ XAS investigations of various molybdenum-based selective oxidation catalysts are compared and discussed. Model systems (i.e. alpha-MoO3, hexagonal MoO3 supported on SBA-15, and H-4[PVMo11O40]) suitable to distinguish structural effects and promotion by additional metal centers have been studied under changing reaction conditions. Correlations between reduction and oxidation solid-state kinetics and catalytic performance reveal the dependence of the selectivity of the catalyst on its electronic structure. In particular the re-oxidation kinetics and the average valence under reaction conditions appear to be determined by the defect structure of the underlying catalyst bulk. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

By thermal analysis (DTG) a mass loss corresponding to volatile components and water, equivalent to 27.65% of the total mass was observed. This value is in accordance with the mass loss of the compound when it was fired at 900 degreesC toward the Nd(2)O(3) oxide. With the DTG program a process of thermodecomposition in multisteps, was observed, corresponding to the loss of water (up to 250 degreesC), evolution of oxygen gas from the peroxide compound and a partial decomposition to CO,, (250 to 600 degreesC) and a second evolution of CO, (from 600 to 900 degreesC). This final evolution of CO, probably came from the intermediary compound Nd(2)O(2)CO(3). By microanalyses the carbon and hydrogen contents were 4.8 and 1.0%, respectively. In summary, the analytical data collected allowed one to conclude that the stoichiometric formula for the studied compound is Nd(2)O(2)(CO(3))(2)(.)2H(2)O. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Herein, hierarchical TiO2 nanotube with uniform carbon coatings is synthesized as the full solar spectrum photocatalytic materials for O-2 evolution by a facile solvothermal method. This unique structure consists of an interstitial hollow spaces and a functional nanotube shell assembled from two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets. By adjusting the types of solvents and reaction time, the morphologies of TiO2/C composites can be tuned to nanoparticles, nanorods, or hierarchical nanotubes. Among these morphologies, the TiO2/C hierarchical nanotube exhibits the best photocatalytic activity and favorable stability toward oxygen evolution from water oxidation under full solar spectrum light irradiation. The reason is attributed to the desirable incorporation of visible/near-infrared (NIR) light active carbon coating with UV light responsive TiO2 for promoted solar energy utilization. Besides, the solvothermal step leads to hierarchical nanotube structures which can generate multiple reflections of incident light so as to promote an efficient light harvesting due to an enhanced specific surface area (244.4 m(2) g(-1)) and light scattering ability. Moreover, the generated carbon coatings on the surface of TiO2 facilitate electron-hole separation.									95	9	0	0	6	0	95			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000453616800073

Detecting the electrochemical redox chemistry is pivotal but challenging because it requires independent probes of the cationic and anionic redox states at different electrochemical states. The synchrotron-based soft X-ray mapping of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (mRIXS) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for exploring such states in electrochemical devices, especially batteries. High-efficiency mRIXS covers the energy range of the absorption edge with the extra dimension of information on the emitted photon energies. In this frontier article, we review recent representative demonstrations of utilizing soft X-ray mRIXS for detecting the novel chemical state during electrochemical operation and for quantifying the cationic redox reactions through inverse partial fluorescence yield analysis (mRIXS-iPFY). More importantly, the non-divalent states of oxygen in electrodes involving oxygen redox reactions could be reliably captured by mRIXS, with its reversibility quantified by the intensity variation of the characteristic mRIXS feature through a super-partial fluorescence yield analysis (mRIXS-sPFY). These recent demonstrations inspire future perspectives on using mRIXS for studying the complex phenomena in energy materials, with both technical and scientific challenges in RIXS theory, in situ/operando experiments, and spatially resolved RIXS imaging.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000576736500001	32785340

While ethylene and benzene were obtained as themajor products, rapid decrease in acetylene conversion resulted from catalyst -30(poisoning with the lapse of reaction time. For afixed flow rate (space velocity 4,000 hr-1), as acetylene concentrations decreased from 50 to 25, to 12.5 vol%, benzene yieldsdecreased, whereas catalyst poisoning was atenuated. Comparison of benzene evolution signals from the variation of acety-lene concentrations showed that the rate of benzene formation is first-order in acetylene pressure. In addition, for a fixed con-centration (25 vol%) of acetylene, as space velocity increased from 4,000 to 6,000 hr-1, benzene yields also increased andcatalyst poisoning was attenuated. Optimization of acetylene concentration and flow rate may be necessary to accomplish theattenuation of catalyst poisoning as wel as enhancement of benzene yield from acetylene cyclotrimerization by flow reaction.It can be deduced from this study that oxygen anion vacancies at paladium-titania interface and reduced titania made contributionstoward catalytic activity for benzene formation at the temperature 100 K lower than those reported by previous researchers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0304-128X			KJD:ART000941722

In the current work, we obtain unique information on gold dissolution by using a setup composed of a micro-electrochemical scanning flow cell (SFC) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Thus, comprehensive online gold dissolution profiles during the initial stage of oxidation as a function of the potential, time and pH are presented. A microscopic model explaining the experimental findings is proposed. According to this model, two dissolution mechanisms take place in two different potential regions: at low anodic potentials the dissolution is driven by the place-exchange between metal and adsorbed hydroxyl/oxygen ions, while at higher potentials the oxygen evolution reaction taking place on the surface of gold oxide initiates concomitant gold loss.									110	1	0	0	7	0	111				2046-2069		WOS:000323842900045

It is vital to develop a catalyst with low overpotential, low cost and high stability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under alkaline conditions. Herein, we used a simple hydrothermal method to obtain a AgCo(CO)(4) precursor on the surface of carbon fiber paper (CFP). After thermal phosphorization, the self-supporting catalyst AgCoPO4/CFP was obtained, which greatly improved the HER catalytic performance under alkaline conditions. At 10 mA cm(-2), it showed an overpotential of 32 mV. The Tafel slope was 34.4 mV dec(-1). The high catalytic performance of AgCoPO4/CFP may be due to the hydrophilic surface promoting effective contact with the electrolyte and the synergistic effect of the two metals, which accelerated electron transfer and thus promoted hydrogen evolution reaction. In addition, it showed an outstanding urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activity. After adding 0.5 M urea, the over-potential of the AgCoPO4/CFP assembled electrolytic cell was only 1.45 V when the current density reached 10 mA cm(-2), which was much lower than that required for overall water splitting. This work provides a new method for the design and synthesis of efficient HER electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000802326400001	35685712

Bulk WS2 powder (2 mu m) is the source for WS2 nanoparticles, and dicyandiamide is the source for NxC and carbothermal reduction. Interestingly, WS2/NxC serves the purpose of innovative and robust active sites for ORR through an efficient four-electron transfer process with excellent durability. Remarkably, WS2/NxC suppresses the peroxide generation due to the dominating inner-sphere electron transfer mechanism where the direct adsorption of the desolvated O-2 molecule on the electroactive centers takes place. The mass activity (at 0.4 and 0.85 V vs RHE) of WS2/NxC outperforms the previously reported transition metal based electrocatalysts. The study further establishes a correlation between the work function and the ORR activity. We have also exploited WS2/NxC for electrochemical oxygen sensing, and there exists a direct correlation between oxygen sensing and ORR as both depend on the oxygen adsorption ability. Finally, the carbothermal reduction strategy has been extended for the synthesis of other TMDs/NxC such as MoS2/NxC, MoSe2/NxC, and WSe2/NxC.									6	0	0	0	1	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000746538100001	35049270

We herein demonstrated a Rb+-modified PCN photocatalyst (CNR-0.5) for high-efficient H2O2 production, in which the introduction of Rb+ ions creates abundant edge active sites within -C[triple bond, length as m-dash]N/-OH groups of the triazine ring. The hydrophilicity and O-2 adsorption capacity of the PCN catalyst were significantly improved. As a result, CNR-0.5 achieved a relatively high H2O2 yield (2225.05 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)), which is 37.58 times higher than that of pristine PCN under white light-emitting diode (LED) light. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrated that CNR-0.5 followed a two-step single-electron O-2 reduction reaction pathway in the H2O2 photogeneration reaction. Additionally, the AQE of CNR-0.5 was 24.52% at 385 nm in an ethanol system with O-2 injection. The excellent photocatalytic H2O2 production performance of CNR-0.5 in a real water body broadens the path for practical applications of PCN materials in photocatalytic H2O2 production.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000819514800001

Hydrogen generation from the chlorophyll water splitting reaction photochemical conversion and solar energy storage								2nd Miami International Conference on Alternative Energy Sources, Proceedings of Condensed Papers								166	7						1979	1979	Presents a detailed product analysis for the water photolysis reaction of microcrystalline chlorophyll a dihydrate. The generation of H2 and O2 was established by mass spectrometric determination. The stoichiometry of water splitting was examined by calibration against conventional electrolysis. It was found that pure (Chl a.2H2O) is capable of photocatalyzing water splitting, and that this capability is greatly assisted by Pt. These results are discussed in terms of the facilitation of gaseous oxygen evolution at the catalytically active sites on the Pt surface. The properties of (Chl a.2H2O)nges2 as photocatalyst for the water photolysis reaction are interpreted in terms of the molecular interactions across water linkages connecting the adjacent Chl a molecules in (Chl a.2H2O)n. The maximum experimentally observed photoconversion efficiency is obtained, and the inhibitive effects of the oxygen on the photolytic rate are discussed in terms of the molecular dimensions of the (Chl a.2H2O)nges2 aggregate.					2nd Miami International Conference on Alternative Energy Sources2nd Miami International Conference on Alternative Energy Sources	10-13 Dec. 197910-13 Dec. 1979		Miami Beach, FL, USAMiami Beach, FL, USA	0	0	0		0	0	0						INSPEC:1524670

Studies have been carried out in a typical three-necked batch reactor. Reaction products were identified by GC and UV spectrophotometer. Reaction rates were determined as a function of temperature, partial pressure of oxygen, amount of catalyst, volume of reactants, agitation and reaction duration. The agitation effect and activation energy revealed the absence of mass transfer resistance. Experimental results unveiled the effect of morphology of ZrO2 on catalysis. 1.0 wt.% noble metal/ZrO2(m) was found more selective for cyclohexanol production at low temperature, agitation 900 rpm and partial pressure of 101.325 KPa while at high temperature cyclohexanol was further oxidized to cyclohexanone. Comparison of Pt/ZrO2 and Pd/ZrO2 catalysts was made on the basis of reactivity and selectivity. Catalysts were characterized by using BET surface area and pore size analyzer, XRD and SEM. To conclude shortly, for the oxidation of cyclohexane, platinum or palladium supported on zirconia are selective, recyclable and could behave as truly heterogeneous catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0932-3414	2195-8564		WOS:000299602500006

The relationship between the acid-base properties and the catalytic behavior was investigated. The number and character of acidic sites of V2O5 catalysts were determined by studying the adsorption of a basic molecule using microcalorimetry. The reducibility level and the evolution of the surface state, as well as the heat evolved, were studied by using a pulse method with pure ethane only. The reaction of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation was studied by a continuous flow method and the activation energies for the formation of C2H4 and CO were calculated. The selectivity of the catalyst was interpreted in connection with the acid-base properties. The strong sites were observed to decrease rapidly with time on stream, although the catalysts were still active. Temperature-programmed reduction of V2O5 using a TG-DSC coupling was also investigated with hydrogen, ethylene, or ethane as reducers. The different heats of reduction are given. It was observed that C2H4 is a much more efficient reducing agent than H-2 and C2H6. Following each reduction, reoxidation studies by oxygen were performed in the same equipment showing clearly different steps in the reoxidation process.									48	0	0	0	2	1	49			0022-3654			WOS:A1992HG75300035

Although Pt-based nanomaterials are the most efficient catalysts for HER, their poor stability and durability strongly impede their practical application. In this study, we report a new, efficient strategy to fabricate highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles within unique nitrogen-doped hollow porous carbon polyhedrons (Pt@NHPCP) derived from polymer coated metal-organic frameworks. Pt@NHPCP displays enhanced HER activity compared to commercial Pt/C. Most importantly, Pt@NHPCP exhibits excellent stability and durability, showing no nanostructure change and negligible activity decrease after 5000 potential cycles. The outstanding HER performance of Pt@NHPCP can be attributed to its unique structural features including highly dispersed Pt, nitrogen-doping, large surface area, hollow nanostructure and hierarchical pore system.									97	4	0	0	3	0	98			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000411687800011

The authors developed various optical measurement systems by using tunable lasers, such as (two-photon-) laser-induced-fluorescence, coherent-anti- Stokes Raman scattering, time evolution of optical emission imaging and others for detecting O-3, O, OH, N, NO* and other radicals in atmospheric pressure plasma. Outline of basic measuring techniques developed by the authors for high pressure plasma diagnosis are explained and real examples of plasma diagnosis are demonstrated in this paper. For example, density distributions of single nitrogen (N) and excited nitrogen molecule (N-2(A)) below the discharge needle generated by the pulse plasma suggest that single N might be generated in the secondary streamer, while N-2(A) might be generated in the primary streamer, and single N decomposes NO more than N-2(A).					7th International Conference on Applied Electrostatics (ICAES)7th International Conference on Applied Electrostatics (ICAES)	SEP 17-19, 2012SEP 17-19, 2012	Minist Educ China; Natl Nat Sci Fdn China (NSFC); Nanjing Suman Elect Co Ltd (Suman); Shekonic (Yangzhou Shuanghong); Elect/Mech Co Ltd; Suzhou TA&A Ultra Clean Technol Co LtdMinist Educ China; Natl Nat Sci Fdn China (NSFC); Nanjing Suman Elect Co Ltd (Suman); Shekonic (Yangzhou Shuanghong); Elect/Mech Co Ltd; Suzhou TA&A Ultra Clean Technol Co Ltd	Dalian Univ Technol, Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINADalian Univ Technol, Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-6588		*****************	WOS:000317980000101

To begin with, in order to increase the reaction rate, the oxygen should be able to reach the active sites of the catalyst readily (mass transfer). Next, a moderate (i.e., not too strong or weak) interaction (kinetics) should be maintained between the oxygen molecules and the catalyst, in order to allow for better adsorption and desorption. Therefore, these two factors should be taken into consideration when designing electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction. Further, there is bound to be a demand for large-scale metal-air batteries in the future. With these goals in mind, in this study, a facile and scalable method is developed for fabricating metal-air batteries based on the fact that the Prussian blue analogue Mn-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)center dot nH(2)O and gelatin-coated Ketjenblack carbon thermally decompose at 400 degrees C in air (i.e., without requiring high-temperature pyrolysis under inert conditions) to form porous spinel oxides and N-doped carbon materials. The intrinsic kinetics characteristics and the overall performance of the resulting catalysts are evaluated using the RDE method and a Zn-air full cell, respectively.									107	12	0	0	4	0	108			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000388993100007

The present work elucidates effects of Zr substitution on soot combustion over cubic fluorite-structured nanoceria. The nanostructured CeO2, Ce0.92Zr0.08O2, and Ce0.84Zr0.16O2 composed of 5-6 nm crystallites display Tm-CO2 (the temperature at maximum CO2 yield) at 383, 355, and 375 degrees C under 10 vol.% O-2/N-2, respectively. The size of agglomerate decreases from 165.5 to 51.9-57.3 nm, which is beneficial for the soot-ceria contact. Moreover, Zr increases the amount of surface oxygen vacancies, generating more active oxygen (O2- and O-) for soot oxidation. Thus, the activities of Ce0.92Zr0.08O2 and Ce0.84Zr0.16O2 in soot combustion are better than that of CeO2. Although oxygen vacancies promote the migration of lattice O2-, the enriched surface Zr also inhibits the mobility of lattice O2-. Therefore, the Tm-CO2 of Ce0.84Zr0.16O2 is higher than that of Ce0.92Zr0.08O2. Based on reaction kinetic study, soot in direct contact with ceria preferentially decomposes with low activation energy, while the oxidation of isolated soot occurs through diffusion with high activation energy. The obtained findings provide new understanding on the soot combustion over nanoceria. (C) 2020 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The chemistry of the surface oxide was identified using auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The precursor iron-base powders were consolidated at 850 C and 1,300 C using hot isostatic pressing (HIPing). Consolidation at the lower temperature resulted in a fully dense microstructure, while preventing substantial prior-particle-boundary-oxide dissociation. Microstructural analysis of the alloys consolidated at the higher temperature confirmed a significant reduction in prior-particle-boundary-oxide volume fraction, in comparison with the lower-temperature-consolidated sample. This provided evidence that a high-temperature internal oxygen-exchange reaction occurred between the metastable prior-particle-boundary-oxide phase (chromium oxide) and the yttrium contained within each prior particle. This internal oxygen-exchange reaction is shown to result in the formation of yttrium-enriched oxide dispersoids throughout the alloy microstructure. The evolving microstructure was characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-energy X-ray diffraction (HE-XRD).									12	0	0	0	0	0	13			0888-7462			WOS:000285430100006

Herein, three-dimensional Mn and Ru oxides loaded on multiwall carbon nanotubes (RuO2-MnO2/MWCNTs) was synthesized via a one-pot hydrothermal approach and served as cathode of rechargeable lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) batteries. SEM and TEM images both illustrated that RuO2 nanoparticles and MnO2 nanoflakes are well dispersed on the surface of MWCNTs and formed a three-dimensional structure, the cyclic voltammetry studies revealed that the RuO2-MnO2/MWCNTs nanocomposite can effectively integrate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of MnO2 and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of RuO2. Electrochemical results demonstrated that the RuO2-MnO2/MWCNTs as oxygen cathode of LieO(2) batteries could maintain a reversible capacity of 1000mAh g(-1) within 94 cycles at a rate of 200 mA g(-1) and within 120 cycles at a rate as high as 1000 mA g(-1). Moreover, the cell with the catalyst RuO2-MnO2/MWCNTs presented much lower voltage polarization (about 0.68 V at a rate of 50 mA g(-1)) than that measured with MnO2/MWCNTs during charge/discharge processes. Ex-situ SEM were conducted to investigate the morphology and decomposition of Li2O2, which were formed after discharge and decomposed almost after charge process. The excellent electrochemical performance could be contributed to the three-dimensional structure which benefited the diffusion of oxygen and the storage of Li2O2 as well as the synergy effect of MWCNTs as an ideal conductive support for RuO2-MnO2 as co-catalyst in Li-O-2 battery.

Herein, we report the application of a Ru/CNT material containing a mixture of Ru single atoms and Ru nanoparticles as a multifunctional catalyst for both the catalytic reduction of nitroarenes and the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The catalytic activity of the Ru-CNT material was evaluated in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), 4-nitroaniline (4-NA) and 2-nitrophenol (2-NP) in the presence of sodium borohydride as a reducing agent at room temperature, showing high catalytic activity with normalized rate constants (k(nor)) of 19.0 x 10(3), 57.7 x 10(3)and 16.6 x 10(3)min(-1)mmol(-1)respectively. Furthermore, the catalyst could be reused in at least 10 cycles without catalytic activity loss, confirming the high stability and robustness of the material. The Ru/CNT material also showed good ORR electrocatalytic activity in alkaline medium withE(onset)of 0.76 Vvs.RHE, a diffusion-limited current density of 3.89 mA cm(-2)andn(O2)of 3.3. In addition, Ru/CNT was remarkably insensitive to methanol with a current retention of 93% (51% for Pt/C) and competitive electrochemical stability of 80% after 20 000 s. Moreover, Ru/CNT was active for the OER withj(max)= 29.5 mA cm(-2)atE= 1.86 Vvs.RHE,eta(10)= 0.50 V and good stability (eta(10)changed to 0.01 V andj(max)only decreased by approximate to 12% after 500 cycles).									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000552899900032	32672264

With the intercalation of borate ions, the interlayer spacing and specific surface area of the Ni Fe LDH are increased, meanwhile the pore size distribution shifts to a larger pore size range. The borate ion-intercalated catalyst prepared at 20% of Fe content in presence of 0.05 M sodium borate additive exhibits the highest OER electrocatalytic activity, which shows a low onset overpotential of 270 mV and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1). The high catalytic activity of intercalated OER catalyst can be attributed to the enhanced mass transport and charge transfer as well as the increased specific surface area due to the borate ion intercalation. In addition, the intercalated borate ions act as a proton-accepting agent help to promote O-O bond formation during OER. This work would open up a novel strategy for the synthesis of ion-intercalated layered materials for high-performance water splitting applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The one-pot-engineered bimetallic Ce/Zr MOF shows visible-light-active characteristics accompanied by a narrower band gap, along with enhanced exciton separation and superior ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), due to the presence of an interconvertible Ce3+/Ce4+ ions pair in comparison to its pristine MOF counterpart. The Ce ion insertion led to increase in electron density around the Zr4+ ion, along with generation of some oxygen vacancies (OV), which cumulatively led to the rise in the photo-reaction output. The synthesized UNH (Ce/Zr 1:1) MOF displayed a boosted photocatalytic H-2 production rate of 468.30 mu mol h(-1) (ACE = 3.51%), which is around fourfolds higher than that of pristine MOFs. Moreover, for CIP photodegradation, the UNH (Ce/Zr 1:1) shows an enhanced efficiency of 90.8% and follows pseudo-first-order kinetics with a rate constant of 0.0363. Typically, the active species involved in the photo-redox reaction of the CIP photodegradation follows the order hydroxyl radical (OH center dot) < superoxide radical (O-2(center dot-)), as confirmed by the TA and NBT tests. Consequently, the bimetallic Ce/Zr MOF can be readily employed as a robust photocatalyst with enhanced tendencies towards CIP degradation and H-2 evolution.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0743-7463			WOS:000763586100013	35080880

Ultrathin transition metal compounds (e.g., phosphides and sulfides) have unique structural features but their stability and electroactivity must still be improved for practical applications. We propose a new strategy to synthesis ultrathin sheets of Ni-Cu-Co transition metals on porous nickel and self-assemble them into yam-shaped microspheres. Enhance catalytic activity and stability are then attained by thermochemical phosphorization without morphological modifications. We employed various analytical techniques including XRD, SEM, TEM, and in-depth electrochemical analysis for materials characterizations. It is shown that ultrathin nanosheets with a thickness of few nanometers and lateral dimensions of a few hundred nanometers are formed and assembled to yarn-shape microspheres with an average diameter of similar to 7 mu m. To demonstrate the practical application of the developed nanostructured compounds, their bifunctional electroactivity toward both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an alkaline solution (2.0 M NaOH) is demonstrated. On the best practice, co-alloying of Ni with Cu and Co with a ratio of Cu/Co=2.5 enhances the catalytic activity by similar to 30%. Further improvement (by about 55%) is attained by thermochemical phosphorization. The electrocatalyst merely required an overpotential of 175 mV (for HER) and 265 mV (for OER) to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). No changes in the current density were observed after a long-time at higher current densities (-88 and +39 mA cm(-2)) showing the high stability of the catalyst in the alkaline solution. The mechanism of improved performance is elaborated and ascribed to the engineered morphology of the nanostructures having many active sites at the surface to promote the Volmer reaction combined with accelerated electrolyte diffusion, rapid charge transport, and gas bubbles detachment at the interface with the electrolyte.

Electrochemical dealloying under potentiodynamic conditions (potential cycling) induces not only changes from rather spherical high-index faceted to more cuboctahedral low-index faceted core-shell structures for particles in a size range of 10-20nm but also percolation for some particles larger than 20nm. In contrast, during dealloying under potentiostatic conditions (potential hold) the semispherical shape of small particles is completely retained and extensive porosity is formed on all particles larger than 20nm. Other degradation processes are not observed on performing an additional accelerated aging test; hence, the high specific and mass activity of the catalyst decreases only slightly, mainly owing to continuing Cu leaching. The difference in dealloying protocols and their effect on the structure of the catalysts as well as their activities, considering the promising porosity formation, are discussed and indicate future directions for a rational design of active and stable oxygen reduction reaction catalysts.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000323514200014

Vacancy-rich Ni nanosheets have been fabricated via topochemical formation of two-dimentional (2D) Ni2B on graphene precursor followed by boron leaching. Anchored on graphene, a few atomic layered Ni2B nanosheets are first obtained by reduction and annealing. Large number of atomic vacancies are then generated in the Ni2B layer via leaching boron atoms. When used for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the vacancy-rich Ni/Ni(OH)(2) heterostructure nanosheets demonstrate remarkable performance with a low overpotential of 159 mV at a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) in alkaline solution, a dramatic improvement over 262 mV of its precursor. This enhancement is associated with the formation of vacancies which introduce more active sites for HER along Ni/Ni(OH)(2) heterointerfaces. This work offers a facile and universal route to introduce vacancies and improve catalytic activity.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000691954700001

In this paper, carbide slag without pretreatment served as the new source of calcium and was added to bituminous coal for gasification experiments to realize waste utilization. The gasification experiment after adding carbide slag to bituminous coal enhances H-2 production, which reduced the activation energy of the gasification reaction. The results show that the catalytic effect on steam gasification was evident when the carbide slag was added to Mongolian bituminous coal. The coal char at reaction temperature was prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and FT-IR spectroscopy. The carbon structure evolution and calcium structure changes of coal char under reaction temperature were studied, and the influence of coal char structure changes on gasification performance was analyzed. The results show that in the coal char added with carbide slag, the oxygen-containing functional groups generated by the polycondensation reaction interacted with calcium to form a calcium-oxygen-carbon complex. The existence of this structure not only leads to the highly uniform dispersion of CaO in the char but also hinders the graphitization process of the char. Highly dispersed CaO and disordered carbon structure significantly improved the reactivity of bituminous coal steam gasification. Si and Al in the bituminous coal affected the dispersion of Ca during steam gasification. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

It was shown that the reduction of Fe(CN)(6)(3-) was difficult when an oxide layer was formed on the electrode surface during 1 h immersion in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution due to the poor ionic and electronic conductivities of Al hydroxides. This reaction required a high cathodic overpotential on Al surface pre-treated at -2 V/SCE Al and was kinetically more difficult in comparison to platinum. Rotating disk electrode measurements showed that oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was controlled by kinetics on both Al pre-treated at -2 V/SCE and oxidized Al cathodic dissolution was controlled by the supply of OH- ions through H-2 evolution and by ORR on both oxidized Al electrode and the Al surface pre-treated at -2 V/SCE. Polarization curves obtained at different pH values showed that no dissolution behavior was observed at pH 5, whereas in neutral and alkaline solutions, OH- ions production induced chemical dissolution of the hydroxide layer. In O-2 supersaturated solution, it was shown that ORR kinetics were slightly favored.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2305-6894			WOS:000468153700017

Besides briefly showing the evolution of the technique, the review deals with recent achievements in the generation of benzylic derivatives of alkali metals by the reductive cleavage of carbon - halogen, carbon - oxygen, carbon - nitrogen and carbon - sulphur bonds. Significant synthetic applications of this procedure are described, showing that an appropriate choice of reaction conditions (solvent, temperature, alkali metal, employment of an electron shuttle) strongly affects the outcome of the cleavage reaction.In the second part, the application of the reductive metalation to carbon - carbon, carbon - oxygen and carbon - nitrogen double bonds is described, a procedure leading to the generation of vic-diorganometallic derivatives. Synthetic applications of these diorganometals are illustrated, underlining the possible application of 1,2-diarylsubstituted vic-dicarbanions as synthetic analogues of an activated form of an alkali metal that, however, function under homogeneous and mild reaction conditions.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			1385-2728	1875-5348		WOS:000289785000003

However, the preparation of well-dispersed catalytic phases on the inter-connected porous MXene network is challenging and has been rarely explored. This work focuses on the synthesis of basal-plane-porous titanium carbide MXene (ac-Ti3C2) that is used subsequently as an effective host for the incorporation of a known catalytically active phase (IrCo) as an effective bifunctional electrocatalyst toward water splitting. The porous ac-Ti3C2 with abundant macro/meso/micropores is prepared by a wet chemical method at room temperature and provides ideal anchor sites for intimate chemical bonding with alien compounds. The resulting IrCo@ac-Ti3C2 electrocatalyst exhibits an excellent reactivity (220 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) towards the oxygen evolution reaction in 1.0 m KOH, which surpasses that of the benchmark RuO2, a low voltage cell of 1.57 V (@ 10 mA cm(-2)) and good long-term durability. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of porosity engineering in MXene nanosheets as a support material to shorten ion migration pathways, to increase electrolyte accessibility between inter-sheets and to overcome inherited re-stacking and aggregation issues.									30	0	0	0	0	0	30			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000510775400001	31891223

Herein, we demonstrate the capacity of nanoperforated gold films deposited on flexible substrates coated with nanometer thick Ti/TiO2 adhesion layers for electrochemical water splitting under light irradiation. The strong plasmonic induced electromagnetic field enhancement, which occurs under the illumination of plasmonic electrodes, facilitates the dissociation of water into hydrogen and improves the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity beyond that of platinum. Under illumination at 980 nm at 2 W cm(-2), a current density of -10 mA cm(-2) was recorded at a low overpotential of eta approximate to -0.045 V (vs. RHE); under the same conditions, a Pt electrode achieved -10 mA cm(-2) at eta approximate to -0.048 V (vs. RHE). Mechanistic investigations revealed that plasmon-excited perforated gold thin layers are an efficient source of hot electrons, contributing to their injection into the underlying TiO2-based adhesion layer. Direct electrochemical reduction of water appears to be a parallel reaction pathway to sustain the hydrogen evolution reaction on the interface. Both reaction pathways decrease the activation energy for the hydrogen evolution reaction similar to the benchmark Pt electrocatalyst.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000551538000046

Herein, highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts, comprising Ni, NiO clusters, and defective carbon, are successfully constructed via a facile and large-scale route. Multiple synchrotron radiation-based X-ray spectroscopic characterizations, combining high-resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements, indicate the formation of ternary interfacial superstructure with intimate interfacial coupling through abundant Ni-O-C bonds. Impressively, the optimized catalyst loaded onto the usual glass carbon electrode exhibits exceptional catalytic activities with overpotentials of 64 and 76 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH and 1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS), respectively, representing one of the best non-noble-metal HER electrocatalysts to date. Insights into the metal/oxide interfacial effects through density functional theory calculations reveal that the interface sites could efficiently lower the energy barrier of the rate-determining step (RDS), contributing to the fast reaction kinetics. This work not only provides comprehensive insights into interfacial feature of highly active HER catalysts but also broadens the fundamental understanding of interfacial effects toward HER catalysis.									33	4	0	0	0	0	35			1369-7021	1873-4103		WOS:000441765700018

In the present paper, the catalase-like oxygen production by human methemoglobin in the presence of H2O2 was kinetically characterized with a Clark-type electrode. Progress curves showed a pseudo-steady state in the first minutes of the reaction, while double-reciprocal plots were upwardly concave, indicating positive co-operativity dependent upon protein concentration, which is a very unusual kinetic behavior. Addition of superoxide radical scavengers slightly increased activity, suggesting that most oxygen was produced biocatalytically. By considering all the experimental data obtained, a possible mechanism was proposed, including: (a) competition between the one-electron and the two-electron reductions of the oxoferryl free radical species of hemoglobin, giving rise to ferrylhemoglobin and methemoglobin, respectively; (b) competition between the superoxide-dependent inactivation of the protein and its reduction back to the met state. Computer simulations of that model have been performed by numerically integrating the differential equations set describing the mechanism, which was seen to yield predictions of the kinetic parameters variation consistently with the kinetic behavior experimentally observed. We suggest that the catalase-like activity of methemoglobin must predominantly be a biocatalytic reaction that protects the protein against H2O2-induced suicide inactivation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Here we introduce an electrochemical synthesis method that is rapid, simple and performed under ambient conditions. Using this approach it is possible to create a catalytically active FeCoNiOxHy amorphous material whose activity is dependent on the nature of the underlying support. The trimetallic oxide is significantly more active than any single or bimetallic oxide combination for the OER.

These Pt particles are formed by sputter deposition of high-purity Pt metal followed by sintering. Conditions were chosen to stay below the percolation threshold of Pt particles. In-plane polarization of Pt particles results in a bipolar system and leads to the formation of a large number of galvanic cells partially or completely polarized. We have defined an equivalent number of active cells (n(cell)) which has been estimated from the oxygen evolution reaction as a function of the applied current on the two feed electrodes. The CO oxidation rate is measured under high vacuum conditions as a function of applied current. The use of isotopically labeled oxygen allows the discrimination of the faradaic process (180 from YSZ) from the non-faradaic process (O-18 from O-18(2)) and to determine the faradaic efficiency (Lambda) and the rate enhancement (rho) parameters in this bipolar system. These results mark an important step in the realization of electrochemical promotion on highly dispersed catalysts. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Importantly the present synthesis approach can be readily extended to prepare composites of CuS tailored structure and morphology for potential application in energy storage and conversion. The CuS@rGO nanocomposites can strongly accommodate a large volume changes by supplying the conducting network and in turn increasing the charge transferability.

The morphology and chemical structural evolution of electrospun and oxidized nanofibers were studied using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). FT-IR analysis indicated that the treated nanofibers were effectively oxidized under different contents of oxygen and prolonged plasma exposure times by increasing the peak intensities of polar groups at 1730 and 3400 cm(-1) corresponding to C=O stretching band and OH stretching vibration mode, respectively. Additionally, a reduction in the extent of the cyclization reaction is observed with further increase in exposure times and contents of oxygen, which implies lower conversion of Ca parts per thousand N bands into C=N ones in the copolymer chain. According to the FE-SEM studies, the surfaces of the treated nanofibers were completely etched after 15 min of treatment due to the existence of strong ion bombardment and a reduction in the average fiber diameters was observed.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000326052300022

However, the questions of large overpotential and poor cycling stability caused by sluggish oxygen reaction kinetics are remain. Here, we propose that constructing heterostructured nanomaterials with high conductivity is an effective way to enhance the eletrocatalytic activity in LOBs. The core-shell Pd@Pd4S heterostructures decorated on the porous carbon matrix are successfully fabricated by adopting hypo (Na2S2O3 center dot 5H(2)O) as a sulfidation reactant in a simple method, which is used as an oxygen cathode for LOBs for the first time. The hierarchical regular pore structure in Pd@Pd4S-C with a high surface area offers sufficient Li2O2 accommodations, which can facilitate a higher capacity and achieving a longer cycle life. The introduction of the Pd4S shell greatly boosts decomposition of Li2O2, which effectively decreases the overpotentials, and contributes to the outstanding cycling stability of Pd@Pd4S-C electrode (176 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g(-1)). This novel heterostructure fabrication method highlights the importance of efficient O-2-electrode designs and provides a facile way to optimize the cathode materials for LOBs.									22	1	0	0	0	0	23			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000518874300024		
J	Salmanion, Mahya; Najafpour, Mohammad Mahdi								Structural changes of a NiFe-based metal-organic framework during the oxygen-evolution reaction under alkaline conditions								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				46	37	SI		19245	19253		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.03.107		MAY 2021		MAY 28 2021	2021	The design of new supramolecular complexes and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as water-oxidizing catalysts requires the stability studies because many metal-organic com-pounds are decomposed under the harsh conditions of water oxidation. Metal-organic frameworks have been extensively reported as catalysts for water splitting toward hydrogen production. Recently, a NiFe MOF has been claimed as an excellent catalyst for oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions (KOH (1.0 M)). Herein, using electrochemical methods, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy, the stability of this NiFe MOF was investigated during OER. In the Raman spectrum, the peaks related to C-C and C-O in 1100-1550 cm-1 become weak after OER, indicating the decrease of the carboxylate functional group. Comparing energy-dispersive spectra for the MOF before and after OER shows a decrease in carbon, but an increase in oxygen contents. Similar to the results of linear sweep voltammetry, energy-dispersive spectroscopy spectra suggest that the surface of the MOF converts into an oxide-based structure after OER. Transmission electron microscopy also shows some new crystalline areas after OER. The crystalline areas indicate a crystal lattice spacing of 0.21-0.23 nm, corresponding to (012) plane of the NiFe layered double hydroxide. Taken together, these experiments show that during OER the MOF converts to NiFe oxide with significant defects and imperfections in the regular geometrical arrangement of the ions, and the NiFe oxide is a candidate for catalyzing OER. This finding could be a roadmap for progress in the field of sustainable catalysis. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

With the different mass concentrations of CeO2, the morphology and X-ray diffraction patterns of Ni-S/CeO2 are diverse. Apparently, the CeO2 contents of Ni-S/CeO(2)composite electrodes under supergravity fields are higher than that under normal gravity field. In addition, the HER catalytic activity of Ni-S/CeO2 composite electrodes can be measured in 1.0 M NaOH at 298 K. The results show that overpotential of Ni-S/CeO2 electrode of 7 g/L CeO2 under 3000 rpm is the least, suggesting perhaps too much content of CeO2 hinder the desorption of H-ads, or too little CeO2 can not play palpable roles in improving the catalytic activity and increasing oxygen vacancies. And the exchange current density j(o) value of Ni-S/CeO2 composite electrode prepared under the speed of 3000 rpm, which is 1.16 times larger than the Ni-S/CeO2 of 0 g/L CeO2, is 1.9 times higher than that under normal gravity field. EIS results suggest that there exists a synergetic effect on HER between CeO2 and Ni-S alloy matrix. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Routes for C-1 and C-2 species production by C-C scission of acrolein and acrylic acid and C4+ product generation by C-C bond formation, which involve reactions between either a vinyl or methyl surface species and either acrolein or acrylic acid, are discussed. The model accurately describes transient evolution of acrolein, O-2, water, and 17 products in 33 independent batch reaction experiments. Forward simulation of the model matches experimental observation of instantaneous C-13 content across byproducts during a co-feed of C-13(3) acrylic acid, validating pathway and parameter accuracy. Estimation of surface coverages reveals comparable fractions of lattice oxygen and vacancy sites at all measured P-O2 and P-C3H4O Comparison of model parameters governing production of CO and CO2 shows that the two combustion products arise primarily from acrolein, with smaller contributions from acrylic acid, while comparison of rate and equilibrium parameters governing production of all other side products reveals that acrolein and acrylic acid play comparable roles in formation of these species.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000457345400023

Fossil fuels are unrenewable and will inevitably be exhausted despite continuous progress in exploitation techniques. Biodiesel has excellent fuel properties and it does not contain environmentally harmful aromatic alkanes. Biodiesel transesterification reaction can be broadly classified into two categories: chemical and enzymatic. Chemical catalysis have high yield of production but need high energy consumption, and the waste water has a high chemical oxygen demand (COD) value and incur extra cost during downstream processing. By comparison, biocatalyst allows moderate conditions; thus it requires less equipment and is less harmful to the environment. Microbial lipase provides multiple catalytic activities with high yield. It is easily modified genetically and grows rapidly on inexpensive medium. However, some of their characteristics are not suitable for industrial production and it has become a hot topic for researchers to study on how to improve microbial lipases characters through directed evolution. In the past 10 years, directed evolution has been the powerful tool for tansformation of lipase function. It makes lipase with greater activity, thermostability, organic solvent tolerance in industrial condition. The short version addresses the various directed evolution methods to optimize lipase characters above.									7	1	0	0	6	0	9			1996-0808			WOS:000306317600023

Herein, MOF-derived 2D nanosheet arrays loaded on a 3D porous Ni substrate are elaborately constructed, whose surfaces are densely populated with oriented 1D N, P dual-doped carbon nanotubes, wherein the ultrafine OD NiCoP nanoparticles are encapsulated on the tip (denoted as NiCoP-NPCNT-NF). Benefiting from the unique multidimensional hierarchical architecture, it can not only inherit the advantages of isolated building units but also possess a promising superhydrophilic and superaerophobic surface, thus facilitating close contact with the electrolyte and fast removal of gas bubbles. Experiments combined with theoretical calculation corroborate that the interface coupling between graphite carbon layers and NiCoP species can modulate the local electronic density, leading to moderate adsorption and desorption energy of various intermediates. Consequently, the optimized NiCoP-NPCNT-NF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performances (53/248 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline media for cathode hydrogen evolution reaction and anode oxygen evolution reaction. Moreover, the assembled water electrolysis device only needs a much lower voltage (1.582 V) at 10 mA cm(-2), accompanied by robust operational stability for over 100 h. This study provides an innovative and available avenue to prepare MOF-derived catalysts for overall water electrolysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2168-0485			WOS:000800078600024

Different wood species as a carbon substrate have a significant impact on the electrocatalytic performance. Herein, to fundamentally understand the electrochemical catalytic performance of carbonized natural wood, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances of various carbonized wood (pine, fir, poplar, and balsa) calcined at different temperature were studied. The OER performance of wood carbon was improved with the increase of carbonization temperature, and better OER performance was obtained at a carbonization temperature of 900 degrees C. The overpotentials of pine carbon, fir carbon, poplar carbon, and balsa carbon are 507 mV, 539 mV, 490 mV, and 651 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The pore structure of wood carbon significantly affected the OER activity. Among the four types of wood carbon, poplar carbon exhibited better electrocatalytic activity due to its cross-distribution of pores and pore diameter. This work is conducive to the selection of suitable wood carbon substrates for the preparation of environmentally friendly electrocatalysts, and is of great significance for improving the efficiency of electrocatalytic water splitting to produce clean and sustainable hydrogen energy.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000714156900001

In this work, a low-cost and highly efficient HER electrocatalysts of amorphous Ni-S-B coating on nickel mesh is successfully synthesized by means of a simple current-density electro-deposition. The obtained Ni-S-B coating shows superior HER electrocatalytic activity as evidenced by low onset overpotential of 27 mV and 240 mV to drive 10 mA.cm(-2) under alkaline conditions. Such high hydrogen evolution activity for Ni-S-B coating can be mainly attributed to the larger surface area (more exposed active sites), faster electron transport between electrode-catalyst-electrolyte interfaces, and nickel mesh substrate. Therefore, Ni-S-B coating can be applied as an efficient HER electrocatalyst to use in alkaline water electrolyzers.									18	2	0	0	2	0	18			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000463008200077

The catalytic reaction involves the redox cycle of ketonic carbonyl-hydroxyl pairs on nanocarbon materials, during which the substrate of ethylbenzene (EB) dehydrogenates to product styrene, and the molecular oxygen re-oxidizes the catalysts yielding water. The rate equation based on the mechanistic interpretations of the catalytic reactions provides intrinsic rate or equilibrium constants, which have their specific physicochemical meanings and could be directly linked to the catalytic process. The proposed rate equation could also accurately describe the effects of reactant (EB or O-2) pressures and isotopomers (deuterated-EB or O-18(2)) on rate data, and provide a quantitative analysis on the evolution and content of surface intermediates on carbon catalysts, which is a reliable descriptor of the intrinsic reactivity and essential to establish the structure-function relations for carbon catalyzed redox reactions.

First, O-2 loading has been applied here to Ge-doped optical fibers to reduce the concentration of GLPC point defects. Next, by means of cathodoluminescence in situ experiments, we found evidence that the 10 keV electron irradiation of the treated optical fibers induces the generation of GLPC centers, while in nonloaded optical fibers, the irradiation causes the bleaching of the pre-existing GLPC. Ab initio calculations were performed to investigate the reaction of the GLPC with molecular oxygen. Such investigations suggested the stability of the dioxagermirane (DIOG) bulk defect, and its back conversion into GLPC with a local release of O-2 under irradiation. Furthermore, it is also inferred that a remarkable portion of the O-2 passivated GLPC may form Ge tetrahedra connected to peroxy bridges. Such structures may have a larger resistance to the irradiation and not be back converted into GLPC.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2076-3417		WOS:000787013500001

The OER activity of Ca0.5CoO2 can be dramatically improved by iron doping, and the overpotential of Ca0.5Co1-xFexO2 (x = 0.25) is only 346 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The mass activity and intrinsic activity of Ca0.5Co0.75Fe0.25O2 at 1.6 V are, respectively, similar to 18.7 and similar to 11.4 times higher than those of Ca0.5CoO2. Iron doping modifies the electronic structure of Ca0.5CoO2, resulting in partial oxidation of the surface cobalt and increased amount of highly oxidative species (O-2(2-)/O-2).

However, reaction-induced atomistic modifications of nanoclusters often result in reduced stability and efficacy. Herein, we report a highly active and multifunctional transition metal nanocatalysts encapsulated in porous carbon network (M@C where M = Cu, Ni, Fe, Co) prepared by leveraging the sacrificial templating properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The as-synthesized M@C nanocatalysts were employed for oxidative degradation of organic pollutants and electrocatalytic hydrogen generation. Fenton like catalytic studies revealed that the nanocatalysts were highly active and reusable following the order of Co@C > Fe@C > Cu@C > Ni@C. On the other hand, Ni@C electrocatalyst displayed superior activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction as compared to others, delivering a low onset potential of 61 mV, Tafel slope of 82 mV/dec and an overpotential of 286 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2). The activity was essentially unchanged even after 500 cycles, suggesting the long-term stability under acidic conditions. The impressive multifunctional catalytic performances of M@C nanocatalysts are attributed to their unique porous carbon matrix doped by transition metal nanoparticles which provide a large number of interconnected catalytically active sites.									21	0	0	0	8	0	21			2468-8231			WOS:000600410800001

Herein, we report high catalytic activity toward HER on the edges of platinum nanoclusters (NCs) supported on single-layer molybdenum disulfide and provide a direct link between ab initio calculations and electrochemical experiments. We determine the active catalytic sites using a cluster expansion method in conjunction with an ab initio thermodynamic approach and show that the system is thermodynamically active at HER reversible potential under electrochemical conditions. We also show that the preferred HER mechanism is the Volmer-Tafel pathway with the Volmer reaction as the rate-determining step. Using a Butler-Volmer kinetic model to simulate a linear sweep voltammogram, we obtain an exchange current density of 10(-3)-10(-2) A/cm(2), which is in the same order as those measured for Pt(111) and supported Pt NCs. Importantly, we show that, contrary to expectations, the enhanced HER mechanism is only attributable to the edges of the supported Pt NCs but not due to metal-support interactions. Our findings are general and applicable to NCs with different sizes and shapes on various supports as well as to different catalytic reactions.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000513299400037

Herein, an amorphous CoMoO3/Cu (a-CoMoO3/Cu) electrode was designed and fabricated through a facile Cu2+-guided electrodeposition strategy. During the synthetic process, the formation of the Co3Mo alloy was suppressed, and the precipitation of a-CoMoO3 was accelerated due to the easily reduced feature of Cu2+. Moreover, metallic Cu can also endow the a-CoMoO3/Cu nanocomposite with remarkably high electron transfer rates. Benefitting from the synergetic effect between Cu and a-CoMoO3 and the high activity of a-CoMoO3, the as-prepared nanocomposite exhibits excellent water electrolysis performance with a low cell voltage of 1.50 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to that of the Pt/C parallel to Ir/C pair. Such prominent performance can be attributed to the abundance of active sites, as well as the optimal adsorption/desorption energy of the intermedia.

Herein, a hierarchical structured CoP/carbon nanofibers (CNFs) composite was successfully synthesized and its potential application as a high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall splitting water was evaluated. The synergetic effect of two-dimensional (2D) CoP nanosheets and one-dimensional (1D) CNFs endowed the CoP/CNFs composites with abundant active sites and rapid electron and mass transport pathways, and thereby significantly improved the electrocatalytic performances. The optimized CoP/CNFs delivered a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotential of 325 mV for OER and 225 mV for HER. In the overall water splitting, CoP/CNFs achieved a low potential of 1.65 Vat 10 mA cm(-2). The facile strategy provided in the present work can facilitate the design and development of multifunctional non-noble metal catalysts for energy applications.

J	Mathi, Selvam; Jayabharathi, Jayaraman								Inexpensive Amorphous Fe-III Oxo-/Hydroxide as Highly Active and Ultradurable Electrocatalyst for Water Electrolysis								CHEMELECTROCHEM				8	5			887	894		10.1002/celc.202001547				MAR 1 2021	2021	Developing highly active, cost-effective, and robust electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) still remains a crucial challenge for enhancing the conversion of sustainable energy resources. The performances of existing electrocatalysts is restricted by low electronic conductivity and the limited amount of active sites. Herein, newly synthesized (FeOH)-O-III nanoparticles (NPs) are shown to be efficient and durable electrocatalysts for the OER reaction. (FeOH)-O-III NP-coated nickel foam ((FeOH)-O-III NPs/NF) operates at an overpotential of 300 mV (@10 mA cm(-2)) with excellent stability even after 30 h and shows higher stability relative to a cell voltage of 1.55 V in alkaline media, which is substantially lower than the commercial electrocatalyst IrO2 (1.61 V). The (FeOH)-O-III NPs/NF overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) is 89 and 127 mV lower than IrO2/NF (389 mV) and NF (427 mV), respectively. The Tafel slope of (FeOH)-O-III NPs/NF (104 mV dec(-1)) is lower than IrO2/NF (164 mV dec(-1)) and NF (199 mV dec(-1)). The calculated turnover frequency (TOF) of (FeOH)-O-III NPs (0.0128 s(-1)) is approximately five times higher than that of the IrO2 catalyst (0.0089 s(-1)) at 1.60 V. This reflects that the (FeOH)-O-III NP catalyst is intrinsically active, giving outstanding OER performances and showing satisfactory kinetics to overcome the sluggish water oxidation rate. Solar water electrolysis shows continuous evolution of oxygen and hydrogen gas at the anode and cathode, respectively, at 1.55 V. The amount of hydrogen generated during solar water electrolysis was calculated as 3.22 mmol h(-1) cm(-2), which is close to the coulombic efficiency at 1.55 V. This demonstration develops the hope for superior exploration of (FeOH)-O-III NPs/NF toward the expansion of real and large-scale hydrogen production with the lowest price.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2196-0216			WOS:000627423800014

Herein, heterostructured CoP/MoO2 electrocatalyst was synthesized by employing MoO2 nanorods as framework for the growth of CoP nanoparticles. Owing to the fact that the effective interface of heterostructure can enhance electron transfer/mass diffusion and expose ample active sites, the CoP/MoO2 reveals eminent HER activities with favorable long-term stability in all pH electrolytes, overpotentials of 69, 78, and 165 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1.0 M KOH, and 1.0 M PBS (phosphate-buffered solution) electrolytes were required for CoP/MoO2 to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This work emphasizes that strategy of electronic structure engineering holds great promises in pH-universal HER electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.

Recent work has indicated that nickel chalcogenide materials show promise as electrocatalysts for this reaction and that their performance can be further enhanced with the generation of ternary, bimetallic chalcogenides (i.e., Ni1-aMaX2); however, relatively few studies have investigated ternary chalcogenides created through the addition of a second chalcogen (i.e., NiX2-aYa). To address this, we studied a series of Se-modified Ni3S2 composites for use as OER electrocatalysts in alkaline solution. We found that the addition of Se results in the creation of Ni3S2/NiSe composites composed of cross-doped metal chalcogenides and show that the addition of 10% Se reduces the overpotential required to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) by 40 mV versus a pure nickel sulfide material. Chemical analysis of the composites' surfaces shows a reduction in the amount of nickel oxide species with Se incorporation, which is supported by transmission electron microscopy; this reduction is correlated with a decrease in the OER overpotentials measured for these samples. Together, our results suggest that the incorporation of Se into Ni3S2 creates a more conductive material with a less-oxidized surface that is more electrocatalytically active and resistant to further oxidation. Importantly, oxidation does still occur, and the active catalyst is most likely a nickel (oxy)hydroxide surrounding a crystalline, conductive Ni3S2-xSex core.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000535170300023	32270999

This is directly linked to the design and facile fabrication of low overpotential water oxidation electrocatalytic materials, engaging applied methods and earth-abundant precursors. Here, we demonstrate facilely synthesized ZnTe nanospheres (ZnTe-NS) as an efficient and durable OER electrocatalyst, executing water oxidation with a much lower energy cost relative to other previously reported non-noble metal-based catalytic systems. The catalytic system shows excellent performance, initiating the oxygen evolution reaction at just 1.41 V vs. RHE (eta = 180 mV) and reaching current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2) at 1.44 V vs. RHE (eta = 210 mV) and 1.63 V vs. RHE (eta = 400 mV), respectively; this performance is superior to state-of-the-art RuO2 and IrO2 catalysts reported previously. Furthermore, a modest Tafel slope of 62 mV dec(-1), indicative of a one electron and one proton transfer mechanism, and a large TOF of 0.25 s(-1) at just eta = 210 mV are achieved. The catalyst advantageously exhibits a stable current density of >50 mA cm(-2) for more than 24 hours during water electrolysis experiments for extended time periods. The hydrothermally developed ZnTe-NS are 150-200 nm in size and display hollow structures, as evaluated via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. XRD and XPS techniques are employed to confirm the formation of ZnTe-NS. DFT calculations show that hydroxyl attachment energy is very favorable on the highly porous and crystalline ZnTe-NS, further confirming their remarkable properties for enhanced electrocatalytic OER activity. This study demonstrates valuable insights into developing the first example of a highly durable Zn chalcogenide, more specifically ZnTe-NS, as an efficient and inexpensive electrocatalyst material for water oxidation. Through an easily accessible synthesis method, ZnTe-NS maintain their integrity, morphology and chemical structure, even after many hours of continuous water electrolysis.									50	0	0	0	3	0	50			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000501213600022

In order to solve the biofouling of the optical instrument, a specific electrochemical chlorination device with highly efficient chlorine evolution reaction (CER) catalyst prepared by potentiostatic electrodeposition was designed and utilized. The catalytic activity, CER selectivity, and durability of the as-prepared CER catalyst are better than the noble metal catalysts in near-neutral seawater. Compared with the common optical glass, the application of the chlorination instrument effectively inhibits the bacterial settlement, and helps to maintain high light transmittance of the optical window.

Notably, anion vacancy engineering, with functions of enhancing intrinsic activity, providing/increasing active sites, improving electrical conductivity, and strengthening stability, has been widely applied to boost the activity of electrocatalysts. In this review, we focus on anion vacancy engineering on electrocatalysts for water splitting. First, various synthesis strategies are introduced. Then the characterization techniques are classified and summarized into three catalogs: microscopy characterization, spectroscopy characterization, and theoretical studies.

In addition, the mechanism of the Pt-Ru nanoclusters modified the band structure of the beta-SiC NWs and the synergistic catalytic AB hydrolysis are addressed clearly, and proposed a newly possible mechanism of photocatalytic AB hydrolysis to produce hydrogen. The orbital hybridizations of Pt-3d-orbitals, 4s-orbitals and Ru-3d-orbitals, 4s-orbitals, 4p-orbitals to the beta-SiC result in the variation of band structure and band gap, the experiment results show the band gap of beta-SiC NWs, Pt/beta-SiC NWs and Ru/beta-SiC NWs are 2.36 eV, 1.97 eV and 1.74 eV, respectively. Pt-Ru nanocluster's modification is beneficial to increase the transition probability of photo-induced electrons and the separation of photo-electron and hole pairs, and then improve the photocatalytic quantum efficiency. Pt-Ru/beta-SiC NWs both obtained higher catalytic activity in the light irradiation condition compare with in dark condition, the reaction required time decreased by 2'26. and 4. 12'. The experimental results above confirm the synergistic photocatalytic AB hydrolysis and conventional metal catalyze AB hydrolysis exist in the Pt-Ru/beta-SiC NWs catalytic AB hydrolysis reaction system. Ru/beta-SiC NWs have a perfect reusability due to the required time of completed reaction only extended by 0'58. even experiencing ten life cycles. In addition, the previous mechanism of AB photocatalytic hydrolysis which believes the reaction is related to the dissolved oxygen in the solution have proved to be inaccurate via demonstration experiment, and have proposed a newly possible mechanism of photocatalytic AB hydrolysis to produce hydrogen through the inference of the especial Lewis structure of AB.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000479141700099

However, the photo-corroded phenomenon and stability during the photocatalytic process reduce the photocatalytic activity. To overcome these disadvantages, strategies of combining Ag3PO4 with two-dimensional materials have been put forward to improve its stability and photocatalytic properties under visible-light irradiation. In this work, a novel Z-scheme Ag3PO4/graphdiyne/g-C3N4 nanocomposite was constructed via a simple electrostatic and pi-pi stacking interaction for the first time. Significantly, such Z-scheme nanostructures show highly oxygen evolution, and 753.1 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) of O-2 was produced with Ag3PO4/graphdiyne/g-C3N4, which was 12.2 times higher than that of Ag3PO4 nanoparticles. Graphdiyne with pi-conjugated structure of sp(-) and sp(2)-hybridized carbon atoms, can not only act as conductive electron mediator bridges to collect photogenerated electrons and boost the O-2 evolution kinetics, but also used as a promising substrate for stabilizing Ag3PO4 in the composite.

Thus, using the thermodynamically favorable hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) to substitute the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has attracted ever-growing attention. Herein, well-defined copper selenide nanoflakes, in situ grown on copper foam (termed CuxSe/CF), were synthesized by a one-step selenization strategy, which are composed of nonstoichiometric Cu2-xSe with stable Cu2Se berzelianite that show remarkable bifunctional activities for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and HzOR electrocatalysis. Investigations into the mechanisms uncovered that the high copper deficiencies in the Cu2-xSe phase make it both an excellent electron donor and acceptor, leading to faster electron transfers across the catalyst (electrode)-electrolyte interface, which greatly boosts the reaction kinetics of HER and HzOR processes. Meanwhile, the Cu2Se berzelianite phase plays a pivotal role in the long-term electrocatalytic operation for the HER and HzOR. Encouraged by this synergistic advantage, the CuxSe/CF catalysts were further employed as good bifunctional catalysts for electrocatalytic hydrazine-assisted overall water splitting with a low cell voltage of 0.49 V at 25 mA cm(-2), as well as having good stability over 20 h, which indicates the broad potential for future industrialization of a sustainable hydrogen-based society.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000866408200001

The deposition of platinum occurred as a spontaneous redox process in which a copper layer, obtained by underpotential deposition, was oxidized by platinum ions, which were reduced and simultaneously deposited. The present method could provide a very low Pt-loading electrode and the results demonstrated that ultra thin Pt coating effected efficiently and behaved as the nanostructured Pt for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. The loading of Pt was calculated as 4.2 x 10(-3) mu g cm(-2) for PtNPGF electrode. The current density at -0.4 V and -0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl was as high as 0.66 A mu g(-1) Pt and 3 A mu g(-1) Pt, respectively and the j(o) was evaluated as 0.03 mA cm(-2) or 8 mA mu g(-1) Pt.

In this work, CoSe2 nanoparticles embedded in defective carbon nanotubes (CoSe2@DC) was synthesized by a carbonization-oxidation-selenylation procedure of Co-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The pre-oxidation treatment was a crucial step in introducing an increasing number of defects into carbon nanotubes, which promoted the reaction between Co@carbon and selenium and led to the enhanced HER performance. The as-prepared CoSe2@DC exhibited excellent HER catalytic reactivity with a low onset potential of -40 mV vs. RHE, a small Tafel slope of 82 mV dec(-1) as well as a high current density with robust catalytic stability in 0.5 M H2SO4.

Constructing electronic structures to enhance the catalytic activity is always interesting and meaningful. Herein, electronic structures are simply synthesized through a rational design of Co-Co0.85Se heterostructures anchoring on the defective N-doped carbon matrix. Co anchoring on the defective N-doped carbon matrix is obtained from hydrothermal-carbonization process of pectin, melamine and cobalt chloride. Rational design of partial selenization can construct electronic structures to form Co-Co0.85Se heterostructures anchoring on the defective N-doped carbon matrix (Co-Co0.85Se-CN). The introduction of Co atoms induces the electron cloud redistribution of Co0.85Se, enhancing the electrocatalytic activity for water splitting. The defective N-doped carbon matrix provides plenty of catalytic sites and good conductivity for ions transition. Co-Co0.85Se-CN exhibits outstanding catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. The Operando Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the dual active centers of Co and Se atom, facilitating the catalytic process for water splitting.

The high HER performance of Cu2MoS4/MWCNTs could be attributed to their large electrochemical surface area (ECSA), their unique conductive structure and the strong interfacial interaction between Cu2MoS4 and MWCNTs.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000471940800028

The content of CeO2 nanoparticles in the electrodes increase with the increase of peak current density. The effects of peak current density on the morphology and structure of PbO2-CeO2 nanocomposite electrodes were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. The SEM and XRD results show that the increase of peak current density can make the morphology finer and more compact, and the crystal size decreases with the increase of peak current density. The oxygen evolution overpotential and stability of PbO2-CeO2 nanocomposite electrodes enhance with the increase of peak current density. The electrocatalytic property of PbO2-CeO2 nanocomposite electrodes was examined for the electrochemical oxidation of rhodamine B (RhB). The results show that the RhB removal efficiency on PbO2-CeO2 nanocomposite electrodes increase with the increase of peak current density, which can be attributed to the higher oxygen evolution overpotential and CeO2 content in the composite electrodes.									2	1	0	0	1	0	3			1023-1935	1608-3342		WOS:000403074500011

The oxide layers have been prepared by thermal decomposition of aqueous nitrate solutions on nickel supports at 623 K. Powder samples were also prepared by thermal decomposition under the same conditions. The powder samples and the oxide layers were characterised by X-ray powder diffraction. The influence of the copper content on the voltammetric response of the electrodes and activity towards oxygen evolution reaction is analysed and correlated with the surface composition of the electrodes by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data. The analysis of the results reveals that the presence of Cu affects the electrode behaviour and its influence depends on which cation has been replaced.									55	1	0	0	0	0	55			1432-8488			WOS:000166573300009

The strip is thereby indirectly polarized, and electrochemical reactions at the strip surface result in the dissolution of the oxide layer and the evolution of hydrogen and oxygen. To obtain a better understanding of this process, we derive in this paper a mathematical model for predicting the potential, current density and ionic species distributions in a vertical pickling cell, as well as the oxide dissolution rate at the steel strip. The model is two dimensional, steady state and isothermal, and is based on the conservation equations for ionic species in dilute solution, involving convection, diffusion, migration and reaction. Kinetic Tafel expressions for the electrochemical gas evolving reactions at the lead anode, stainless steel cathode and at the bipolar steel strip surface are introduced. The derived model comprises six ionic species; numerical solutions for a full version and two reduced versions of this model are then obtained. Finally, the implications of the results for the actual pickling process are discussed. (c) 2007 The Electrochemical Society.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000248984700089

Dynamic mechanical and thermal analyses show that under aerobic conditions the coatings become stiffer and more brittle in the glassy state. This stiffening is probably due to the increase in the amount of hydrogen bonding and the formation of oxidized groups which increase the polarity of the material and enhance the interactions of the polymer segments. However, oxidation reactions result in a considerable decrease in cross-link density and stiffness in the rubbery state. Both changes, in the glassy and rubbery states, give rise to development of internal stresses. These stresses increase as the degradation process proceeds. Nevertheless, for samples exposed to anaerobic conditions, the stiffness remains constant in the glassy state and the cross-link density slightly increases as a result of degradation. This reconfirms the dominance of the effect of oxidation reactions on the mechanical failure of the coatings. Oxygen permeation measurements show a more-or-less time-independent diffusion coefficient and a gradual decrease in solubility of oxygen as a function of exposure time. This results in a slight decrease in oxygen permeation (mainly in the early stage of the degradation) as degradation proceeds. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part B: Polym.

The adjustable porosities, high thermal and chemical stabilities, tunable functionalities and flexibility in installing catalytic active sites translate COFs into highly promising catalytic materials. In this review, we comprehensively elaborate the designed synthesis of COF-based catalysts and their applications in the field of chemical catalysis, photocatalysis and electrocatalysis.

The microstructural evolution of the oxide scale with time was characterised by Xray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray microanalysis and electron back scattering diffraction. The oxide scale is comprised of a continuous alpha-Al2O3 inner layer with isolated coarse TiO2 particles on top. At the early oxidation stage (roughly less than 0.5 h), alpha-Al2O3 and TiO2 are the main reaction products, while at longer reaction times the oxidation only leads to the formation of alpha-Al2O3. The alpha-Al2O3 grains in the oxide scale grow in size upon high-temperature oxidation with the grain size being uniform throughout the thickness of the scale. As diffusion of oxygen along the grain boundaries dominates the oxide scale growth, the change in grain size affects the oxide scale growth kinetics. A simple oxide scale growth model, that takes into account this change in fast diffusion paths, describes the experimentally observed oxide scale growth kinetics perfectly.									36	0	0	0	2	0	36			0960-3409			WOS:000306976700008

A dodecahedral ZIF architecture is first constructed with two metal sources, followed by a pyrolysis process with thiourea to obtain hollow composite materials consisting of Zn-Co sulfide uniformly dispersed on nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon. Benefitting from the distinctive structure and synergistic effect of the binary metal system, the as-prepared Zn-Co-S@NSC displays excellent electrocatalytic performance on ORR in alkaline condition. The superior performances, which are evaluated in terms of onset-potential (0.955 V vs. RHE) and half-wave potential (0.831 V vs. RHE), are comparable to the conventional Pt/C catalyst. In addition, Zn-Co-S@NSC exhibits remarkable electrochemical durability and exceptional methanol tolerance compared to the commercial Pt/C. The DFT calculations further demonstrate that the binary metal system can promote electrocatalytic activity by optimizing the reaction free energy for intermediates of ORR.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2468-8231			WOS:000670356900008

A facile wet-chemistry strategy has been developed for the synthesis of a porous Ru layer deposited onto Ni foam (NF) as a competitive candidate for HER over the whole pH range, especially under economical alkaline conditions. The catalyst shows outstanding HER performance, which stems from the porosity of the Ru layer, the electronic structure of the electrode, and the charge transfer between the NF and the Ru layer, which gives rise to the strong activity of the Ru layer in the HER process. Moreover, the Ru loading was as low as approximately 1.1 wt %, representing significant potential for application in cost-effective HER.									20	2	0	0	0	0	21			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000478761200036	30938925

Herein, we document a co-precipitation synthesis of antitypical spinel nanoparticles (FeMn2O4) by post-annealing at different temperatures to enable modulation of the cationic oxidation state and tuning of the conversion degree for efficient and good OER performance. The electrocatalytic activity test shows that the sample annealed at 500 degrees C has the most optimal catalytic activity with an overpotential of 360 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope as low as 105.32 mV dec(-1). The formation of FeOOH during in situ OER promotes the catalytic activity of the catalysts. More importantly, according to the results of Brunauer-Emmett-Teller normalization, we demonstrate that the activity of the catalyst is also inseparable from the internal crystal structure. This work broadens the field of research on the electrocatalysis of spinel manganese ferrites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000860832000001	36276028

Ruthenium (Ru) has been commonly employed due to its high OER activity although its electrochemical stability in Ir-Ru mixed oxide nanoparticles (IrxRu1-xO2 NPs), especially at high relative contents, is rarely evaluated for long-term application as water electrolyzers. In this work, we bridge the knowledge gap by performing a thorough study on the composition- and phase-dependent stability of well-defined IrxRu1-xO2 NPs prepared by flame spray pyrolysis under dynamic operating conditions. As-prepared NPs (IrxRu1-xOy) present an amorphous coral-like structure with a hydrous Ir-Ru oxide phase, which upon post-synthetic thermal treatment fully converts to a rutile-type structure followed by a selective Ir enrichment at the NP topmost surface. It was demonstrated that Ir incorporation into a RuO2 matrix drastically reduced Ru dissolution by ca. 10-fold at the expense of worsening Ir inherent stability, regardless of the oxide phase present. Hydrous IrxRu1-xOy NPs, however, were shown to be 1000-fold less stable than rutile-type IrxRu1-xO2, where the severe Ru leaching yielded a fast convergence toward the activity of monometallic hydrous IrOy. For rutile-type IrxRu1-xO2, the sequential start-up/shut-down OER protocol employed revealed a steady-state dissolution for both Ir and Ru, as well as the key role of surface Ru species in OER activity: minimal Ru surface losses (<1 at. %) yielded OER activities for tested Ir0.2Ru0.8O2 equivalent to those of untested Ir0.8Ru0.2O2. Ir enrichment at the NP topmost surface, which mitigates selective subsurface Ru dissolution, is identified as the origin of the NP stabilization. These results suggest Ru-rich IrxRu1-xO2 NPs to be viable electrocatalysts for long-term water electrolysis, with significant repercussions in cost reduction.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			2155-5435			WOS:000684035000030

Here, a series of highly active and robust Co-doped nickel phosphides (Ni2-xCoxP) catalysts and their hybrids with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) are developed as bifunctional catalysts for both HER and OER. The Co-doping in Ni2P and their hybridization with rGO effectively regulate the catalytic activity of the surface active sites, accelerate the charge transfer, and boost their superior catalytic activity. Density functional theory calculations show that the Co-doped catalysts deliver the moderate trapping of atomic hydrogen and facile desorption of the generated H-2 due to the H-poisoned surface active sites of Ni2-xCoxP under the real catalytic process. Electrochemical measurements reveal the high HER efficiency and durability of the NiCoP/rGO hybrids in electrolytes with pH 0-14. Coupled with the remarkable and robust OER activity of the NiCoP/rGO hybrids, the practical utilization of the NiCoP/rGO|| NiCoP/rGO for overall water splitting yields a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.59 V over 75 h without an obvious degradation and Faradic effi ciency of approximate to 100% in a two-electrode configuration and 1.0 M KOH.									433	32	0	0	12	0	438			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000384810300003

Ultrathin electrocatalysts have noteworthy advantages in maximizing the use of active sites. Among the pioneering works on such performing catalysts, the development of single-unit-cell-thick layered electrocatalysts (STLEs) has attracted extensive attention owing to their superior specific surface area and large number of vacancies, which can provide abundant available surface active sites. Therefore, this minireview provides recent advances in STLE synthesis and applications, which are helpful for electrocatalysis-oriented researchers.

Here, we demonstrate a metallic MoS2 electrocatalyst decorated with platinum single atoms. When combined with electron microscopy observations, our synchrotron X-ray characterizations and theoretical calculations clearly reveal that the doped Pt atoms bond to S atoms on the surface of MoS2. Notably, these Pt single atoms serve as critical active centers for the HER through capturing H+ from the solution. The optimized Pt-MoS2 catalysts achieve significantly enhanced HER performance due to the single-atom coordination effect. This finding is expected to facilitate further realization of hybridized catalysts through the monatomic riveting strategy.									41	6	0	0	1	0	42			1948-7185			WOS:000492425100014	31539474

Herein, a facile one-pot solvothermal strategy is designed to fabricate uniform spherical PdCu nanocrystals (NCs) assembled by many smaller grains. Oeylamine (OAm) is acted as the reaction solvent and reductant. KBr and hexadecylpyridinium chloride monohydrate (HDPC) are used as the capping agent and surfactant to avoid the aggregation, respectively. The architectures possess larger electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 13.6 m(2) g(-1) than commercial Pd black (4.4 m(2) g(-1), showing the improved catalytic ability for glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) in alkaline electrolyte in contrast with Pd black. Besides, the obtained catalyst exhibits more positive onset potential (-56 mV) and Tafel slope (51 mV decade(-1)) toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media relative to commercial Pd/C, albeit with their performance bellow commercial Pt/C catalyst.

However, fluorine termination on the basal planes and edges of the resulting MXenes is undesirable for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while oxygen (O), hydroxyl (OH), and sulfur (S) termination favors this reaction. Herein, we unveil a simple fluorine-free exfoliation and two-step vulcanization method for synthesizing molybdenum sulfide-modified molybdenum carbide (MoS2/Mo2CTx MXene, T = OH, O, S) for the HER in alkaline medium. Microwave-assisted hydrothermal treatment of the MAX phase (Mo3AlC2) with sodium hydroxide-sodium sulfide as an etching solution and thioacetamide as a source of sulfide ions enabled the selective dissolution of the aluminum (Al) layer and sulfidation of the surface Mo atoms to form amorphous MoS2. Thus, the vulcanization of Mo2CTx MXene resulted in the formation of MoS2/Mo(2)CT(x )MXene. The MoS(2 )formed on the surface of Mo2CTx provided enhanced stability by preventing oxidation. MoS2/Mo(2)CT(x )exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward the HER, mainly due to the O, OH, and amorphous MoS2 functionalities. The MoS2 sites on the sur-face exhibited an overpotential of 110 +/- 7 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) as a result of enhanced charge transfer and mass transfer. Thus, the sulfidation method demonstrated herein is capable of producing amorphous MoS2structures on Mo2CTxMXene, which could be applied for the surface modification of other molybdenum-based nanomaterials or electrocatalysts to improve stability and enhanceelectrocatalytic activity.

However, there is a big gap between the Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets and noble metal catalysts in terms of the OER activity which is difficult to meet the request of application. Here, a strategy was developed to deposit Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets on FeCo/C nanocubes surface to create a hierarchical heterostructure as a new type of non-noble metal catalyst. The initial overpotential of the prepared FeCo/C@Ni(OH)(2) catalyst is as low as 212 mV and the Tafel slope is smaller compared with the precursor materials. The composite materials revealed enhanced cycle stability which can maintain more than 90% of initial current density after running for 10 h under 100 mV overpotential. The improvement of OER activity is ascribed to the FeCo/C nanocubes, which can not only improve the charge transport of the material, but also prevent the agglomeration of Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets. The exciting features of FeCo/C@Ni(OH)(2) nanocomposite open up the possibilities of preparing efficient and stable non-noble metal catalysts for OER electrocatalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we report the readily preparation of self supported Ni2P/V2O3-x heteronanosheets on nickel foam (NF) as an active and robust catalyst for the alkaline HER via a hydrothermal method followed by a phosphorization treatment. Our experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that these two constituent phases (Ni2P and V2O3-x) optimized by the interfacial coupling and defect-induced dual effects cooperatively work together to improve the inherent activity of the catalyst. Impressively, the introduction of the abundant oxygen-defect in the V(2)O(3-x)specie resulted in the improvement of its electrical conductivity, which in tight contact with the metalloid Ni2P endowed the catalyst with high electron transfer capability. Meanwhile, the unique superhydrophilic nanostructure of the catalyst promises the maximized utilization of active sites. As a consequence of the contribution of these benefits, the as-prepared Ni2P/V2O3-x/NF heterostructure electrocatalyst exhibits high catalytic performance and excellent stability for the alkaline HER, outperforming most existent non-noble metal electrocatalysts. This work highlights the potential of the rational combination of defect-rich metal oxides and transition metal phosphides to construct highly efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts toward the alkaline HER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000850943500001

In this work, we design a high efficient and stable HER catalyst though a simple adsorption and pyrolysis method. The fabricated catalyst presents ruthenium (Ru) quantum dots (QDs) uniformly distributes on the carbon nano -fibers (CNF) with a three dimensional (3D) networks structure (Ru@CNF). By means of quantum size effect of Ru QDs and the 3D networks structure of the carbon nanofibers, the former is beneficial to provide more catalytic active sites and the latter is in favour of electron transport. The sample Ru@CNF exhibits a low overpotential of 20 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 31 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH, which is better than that of Pt/C (28 mV and 36 mV dec(-1)), and most of reported Ru-based and transition metal catalysts. Furthermore, it exhibits robust stability when testing at an overpotential of 75 mV for 24 h. Therefore, this work provides a low-cost, simple and feasible method for fabricating HER catalyst, which possesses commercial application prospect in the field of producing hydrogen by water electrolysis.

One effective strategy to activate the electrocatalytic properties of TMDs is through doping. The optimistic outlook of doped-MoS2 as an electrocatalyst witnessed in previous reports spurred us to examine the effect of doping WSe2 with Group 5 transition-metal species, namely V, Nb, and Ta, in aspects of inherent electroactivities and catalysis. Apart from the mild reduction signal unique to the Group 5 transition-metal dopants, the Group 5 transition-metal-doped WSe2 materials are found to possess largely identical inherent electrochemistry to the undoped WSe2 with a characteristic anodic peak. Living up to expectations, the Group 5 transition-metal-doped WSe2 materials exhibit improved electrocatalytic HER efficiency, as evident by the lower HER overpotentials and Tafel slopes relative to undoped WSe2. After doping with V, Nb, or Ta species, an increased number of active sites is observed given the distinct changes in morphology from thick bulky pieces in undoped WSe2 to thinner fragments in doped WSe2. Although undoped WSe2 exists in the semiconducting 2H phase, the Group 5 transition-metal-doped WSe2 materials are dominated by the metallic 1T phase. Doping WSe2 with V, Nb, or Ta stabilizes the catalytic 1T phase and appears to induce the transition from the 2H to 1T phase. In contrast to the enhanced HER performance of WSe2 upon doping, Group 5 transition-metal dopants proved futile in activating the ORR electrocatalytic behavior of WSe2, for which the ORR efficiency is unchanged. Therefore, these findings facilitate the understanding of the role of Group 5 transition-metal dopants in the electrochemical and catalytic properties of WSe2 relative to their morphological features and provide an evaluation of the efficacy of doping TMDs in electrocatalytic applications.									30	1	0	0	1	0	30			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000426495100021	29266541

Homogeneous and highly continuous thin films of beta-Cu2V2O7, gamma-Cu3V2O8, Cu11V6O26, and Cu5V2O10 are grown via reactive co-sputtering and their performance characteristics for the light-driven oxygen evolution reaction are evaluated. All four compounds have similar bandgaps in the range of 1.83-2.03 eV, though Cu-rich phases exhibit stronger optical absorption and higher charge separation efficiencies. Transient photocurrent analysis reveals a reduction of surface catalytic activity with increasing Cu:V elemental ratio due to competitive charge recombination at Cu-related surface states. This comprehensive analysis of PEC functionalities-including photon absorption, carrier separation, and heterogeneous charge transfer-informs strategies for improving PEC activity in the copper vanadate materials system and provides insights that may aid discovery, design, and engineering of new photoelectrode materials.									53	1	0	0	2	0	53			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000429625400006	29489326

We predict that the poly(p-phenylene) (PPP) is thermodynamically unable to oxidise water and that PPP is hence unlikely to split water in the absence of an external electrical bias. For other polymers, however, for example carbon nitride, the lack of oxygen evolution activity appears kinetic in origin and hence a suitable co-catalyst could potentially transform them into true watersplitting photocatalysts.									45	0	0	0	3	0	45			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000339535100058

Herein, a practical strategy was reported to rationally design single copper atoms coordinated with both sulfur and nitrogen atoms in metal-organic framework derived hierarchically porous carbon (S-Cu-ISA/SNC). The atomic interface configuration of the copper site in S-Cu-ISA/SNC is detected to be an unsymmetrically arranged Cu-S1N3 moiety. The catalyst exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction activity with a half-wave potential of 0.918V vs. RHE. Additionally, through in situ X-ray absorption fine structure tests, we discover that the low-valent Cuprous-S1N3 moiety acts as an active center during the oxygen reduction process. Our discovery provides a universal scheme for the controllable synthesis and performance regulation of single metal atom catalysts toward energy applications.									246	20	0	0	18	0	250			2041-1723			WOS:000542988800003	32546781

Herein, a cation-anion dual doping strategy has been proposed for modifying the electronic structure of CoP via doping Fe and S atoms. Impressively, Fe doping has been demonstrated to be favorable for improving the carrier density of CoP to produce more hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH), while S doping can further modify the electronic structure of CoP to improve the charge-transfer characteristics, thereby synergisti-cally decreasing the energy barrier for the transformation of O* to OOH* and promoting the electrocatalytic OER performance. More importantly, the highly open nanobox structure is also beneficial for the exposure of more accessible catalytically active sites, which can substantially facilitate the electron and mass transport, leading to the superb catalytic OER performance. The successful modulation of OER performance via dual-doping strategy will pose a new strategy for designing more advanced nanocatalysts for energy-related catalysis process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000870302500001	36223524

In contrast to alpha-Fe2O3 (hematite), however, little detailed information is available concerning fundamental reactivities of the Fe(III) oxyhydroxides themselves. We here report a macroanion-like polyoxometalate cluster-anion complex of 2.6 nm gamma-FeOOH nanocrystals, 1, that not only catalyzes visible light-driven water oxidation with no need for added photosensitizers but also whose unique stability and solubility facilitate investigation of oxygen evolution using the toolbox of solution-state methods typically reserved for molecular catalysis. The gamma-FeOOH active centers of 1 are comprised of ca. 250 Fe atoms and coordinated by an average of six oxo-donor ligands, [alpha-PW11O39FeIII](4-)-mu-O-, each with a formal charge of 5-, giving freely diffusing macroanion-like hexacoordinate complexes readily observed in their native, vitreous water solution state by cryogenic TEM. With a bandgap energy of 2.3 eV and valence- and conduction-band (VB and CB) energies of 2.34 and 0.04 V vs NHE, 1 catalyzes visible light-driven water oxidation by orthoperiodate {(H3IO6)-O-VII}(2-) at pH 8, at a rate similar to that documented for hematite nanocrystals. Kinetic data show the reaction to be one-half order in concentrations of both 1 and {(H3IO6)-O-VII}(2-), indicative of a chain mechanism. A solvent kinetic isotope effect (KIE), k(H)/k(D), of 1.32 was assigned to the rate-limiting trapping of photoexcited electrons by {(H3IO6)-O-VII}(2-), which initiates a radical-chain process inhibited by added iodate [(IO3)-O-V](-). In contrast to the rate-determining O-O bond formation typical of metal-oxide electrocatalysts and of many molecular catalysts, chain mechanisms initiated by the rate-limiting trapping of excited-state electrons may prove a general feature of water oxidation by freely diffusing photoactive nanocrystals.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000697346200006

While molybdenum (Mo)-based inorganic compounds have been extensively investigated as catalyst candidates toward the alkaline HER, Mo-based oxides, in particular, complex oxides, are rarely explored. Here we report a Mo-containing, metallic BaMoO3 perovskite, which is derived from a scheelite-type, insulating BaMoO4 oxide through a thermal reduction-induced phase transformation, as a potential electrocatalyst for driving the alkaline HER. The BaMoO3 perovskite made of interconnected MoO6 octahedra is found to be more HER-active than the BaMoO4 scheelite consisting of isolated MoO4 tetrahedra, showing a significant increase in intrinsic activity by about one order of magnitude, which is due to the stabilized Mo tetravalent state, the increased surface oxygen vacancy concentration, and the improved electrical conductivity of BaMoO3. Importantly, BaMoO3 exhibits a smaller overpotential to deliver a geometric current density of -10 mA cm(geo)(-2) when compared with many of the bulk-sized perovskite catalysts comprising other transition metals (e.g., Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) and the intensively studied Mo-based catalysts (e.g., MoS2), making it highly promising as an alternative electrocatalyst for the alkaline HER.									24	1	0	0	1	0	24			1359-8368	1879-1069		WOS:000571772800004

Ti foil as a substrate can significantly enhance electron transfer, and flowerlike SrTiO3 with a highly exposed (110) crystal surface was controlled by NaOH concentration and HF. Therefore, the use of Ti and F- as the substrate and the shape-directing additive, respectively, is a feasible and simple strategy to induce a high-energy surface on a photoelectrocatalyst for photoelectrocatalytic splitting of water.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1569-4410	1569-4429		WOS:000468716500001

It is well-known that there are intrinsic hydrated layers on the surfaces of metal oxides in ambient air or the electrolyte. Generally, interface layers between metal oxides and solutions have significant effects on the performances in these applications. However, the exact roles of the intrinsic hydrated layers are still unclear. In this study, taking TiO(2)and Fe(2)O(3)as model materials, we propose a mild heat treatment to increase the hydroxyl concentration in the hydrated surface layers of the oxides, which improves their photoelectrochemical performance remarkably. Moreover, we find that the heat-regulated hydrated layer plays the role of a hole transfer mediator between oxides and the electrolyte, which can accelerate both interface charge collection and oxygen evolution reaction kinetics in acidic solution. The new insights into the intrinsic hydrated interface layer on oxides can offer guidance not only in photoelectrocatalysis, but also in the other applications mentioned above.									12	2	0	0	2	0	12			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000542898000018	32953025

Here, the Mo doped Ni3N and Ni heterostructure porous nanosheets grow on Ni foam (denoted as Mo-Ni3N/Ni/NF) are successfully constructed, featuring simultaneous interface engineering and chemical substitution, which endow the outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic performances toward both hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), demanding a working potential of -0.3 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for HzOR and -45 mV for that of HER. Impressively, the overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) system requires an ultralow cell voltage of 55 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) with remarkable long-term durability. Moreover, as a proof-of-concept, economical H-2 production systems utilizing OHzS unit powered by a waste AAA battery, a commercial solar cell, and a homemade direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC) are investigated to inspire future practical applications. The density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the synergy of Mo substitution and abundant Ni3N/Ni interface owns a more thermoneutral value for H* absorption ability toward HER and optimized dehydrogenation process for HzOR.									28	1	0	0	0	0	27			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000664644200001

Groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for major ions at 20 sites for two periods in 2016. Moreover, 6 rainfall samples were collected to determine local meteoric water line. The main water types are Ca-SO4, which is the dominate type for two periods, while a few wells were (Na-SO4) or (Mg-SO4) dominate. All available delta O-18 and delta D data for the study area are plotted to the global meteoric water line (GMWL) and Local meteoric water line (AMWL). They indicated to the meteoric origin of all waters. They are exposed to evaporation before entering the aquifer. Using PHREEQC, Geochemical modeling was conducted to calculate mineral saturation indices for all water samples. These results show that dissolution of dolomite, gypsum, halite and siderite and precipitation of calcite, Sylvie and hematite are the main chemical reactions in the first period, whereas there are no specific reactions can be shown in the second period. Hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater as modeled with NETPATH-WIN, the inverse geochemical modeling results showed that the main reaction controlling the groundwater quality is Dedolomitization process (dolomite dissolution driven by anhydrite dissolution and calcite precipitation).

In this work, two different Service Life Tests have been designed and implemented, aiming at including particular conditions (i.e. inverse polarity and short-circuit) in the durability and catalytic activity of cathode characterization. For this purpose, Ni/Cu bilayered porous electrodes were prepared using different Ni electrodeposition times (15, 30 and 45 min) following a double template electrochemical method. It has been confirmed that the electrode with the lowest Ni content can be considered as a promising electrocatalyst for hydrogen production under industrial conditions because of its optimal activity and stability after the two sets of testing conditions. In particular, electrochemical studies demonstrated that an inversion in polarity can positively affect the electrode performance, as a consequence of the synergetic interaction between CuO/Cu(OH)(2) and beta-Ni(OH)(2) species formed at potentials below the oxygen evolution domain.

Herein we report a bifunctional vanadium-doped Ni3S2 nanorod array electrode for overall water splitting in alkaline media. To afford a catalytic current of 10 mA cm(-2), the designed V-Ni3S2 electrode only requires overpotentials of 133 mV for hydrogen evolution and 148 mV for oxygen generation, meanwhile showing high long-term stability. The excellent catalytic properties are attributed to the V dopant and geometric advantages of the nanorod array. The V-Ni3S2 electrodes are simultaneously utilized as cathode and anode in one two-electrode cell for overall water splitting, exhibiting a cell voltage of 1.421 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The water splitting in this cell can also be feasibly driven by a single-cell AA battery (1.5 V). Our report shows substantial advancement in the exploration of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting.									39	1	0	0	2	0	39			2052-1553			WOS:000461666900010

Recently, FDMPOs are being applied in electrocatalysis for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and overall water splitting reaction. Numerous promising FDMPO-based water splitting electrocatalysts have been reported, along with new catalytic mechanisms. Therefore, an in-time summary of the current progress of FDMPO-based water splitting electrocatalysts is now considered imperative. However, few reviews have focused on this particular subject thus far. In this contribution, we review the most recent advances (mainly within the years 2014-2020) of FDMPO electrocatalysts for alkaline water splitting, which is widely considered to be the most promising next-generation technology for future large-scale hydrogen production. This review begins with an introduction describing the fundamentals of alkaline water electrolysis and perovskite oxides. We then carefully elaborate on the various design strategies used for the preparation of FDMPO electrocatalysts applied in the alkaline water splitting reaction, including defecting engineering, strain tuning, nanostructuring, and hybridization. Finally, we discuss the current advances of various FDMPO-based water splitting electrocatalysts, including those based on Co, Ni, Fe, Mn, and other first d-block metal-based catalysts. By conveying various methods, developments, perspectives, and challenges, this review will contribute toward the understanding and development of FDMPO electrocatalysts for alkaline water splitting.									19	1	0	0	2	0	20				2073-4344		WOS:000558341700001

Here, density functional theory was carried out with (DFT + U) to study the reaction mechanism of water splitting on the (110) surface of the spinel oxides. The mechanism process and catalytic activity of M2CoO4 (M = Co, Fe and Ni) are not yet understand in depth. In this case, a systematic study of water splitting on different activation sites of our supported systems are presented. The optimum active site of optimized structures were used to explore the free energy profile during the entire reaction of water oxidation, indicating that the rate-determining step of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the third step to form atomic oxygen species. The Fe2CoO4 and Co3O4 surfaces were more catalytically efficient than the Co2NiO4 surface with small overpotentials of 0.33 and 0.35 V, respectively. Analysis of the electronic structure shows that the main density of states was contributed by 3d states of metal near the Fermi energy, they are all exhibition metallic. On preferred site were investigated, The formation energies, limiting potential, overpotential and activation energy of the OER intermediate species (OH, O, and OOH) are studied. Furthermore, the thermodynamic properties in each elementary reaction step are evaluated, with the results implying that both of the M2CoO4 surfaces share the same mechanism path (H2O -> OH -> O -> OOH -> O-2). It is found that the formation of atomic O requires an activation energy of 0.56 eV on the Co3O4(111) surface and 0.38 eV on the Fe2CoO4(111) surface, indicating that the Fe2CoO4 surface has significantly better catalytic properties than the other surfaces. Our results suggest that the these spinel oxide compounds are suitable for catalysis of water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0927-0256	1879-0801		WOS:000600373200012

The nitrogen-doped supports are expected to have pyridinic, pyrrolic, and graphitic functionalities at different ratios responsible for their improved performance. The N-doped supports and catalysts are synthesized via pyrolysis and the hydrothermal method using natural and synthetic graphite of three different flake sizes and evaluated for their structural and electrochemical characteristics. The average size of IrO2 nanoparticles deposited on the N-doped supports is independent of the flake size and doping amount of nitrogen. The catalysts show optimum current densities but improved stability with increasing flake sizes of 7, 20, and 125 mu m. Our results demonstrate that the selection of the flake size of the doped support is necessary to achieve durable catalysts for the OER in an acidic medium.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-1343			WOS:000841412600001	36033719

Herein we explore the OER activity and stability in acidic electrolyte of a combined IrOx/RuO2 system consisting of RuO2 thin films with submonolayer (1, 2, and 4 angstrom) amounts of IrOx deposited on top. Operando extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) on the Ir L-3 edge revealed a rutile type IrO2 structure with some Ir sites occupied by Ru, IrOx being at the surface of the RuO2 thin film. We monitor corrosion on IrOx/RuO2 thin films by combining electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) with inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). We elucidate the importance of submonolayer surface IrOx in minimizing Ru dissolution. Our work shows that we can tune the surface properties of active OER catalysts, such as RuO2, aiming to achieve higher electrocatalytic stability in PEM electrolyzers.									62	5	0	0	4	0	63			1520-6106			WOS:000423140600068	29045788

Replacement of noble metals catalysts with non-noble metals is trending due to their specific characteristics such as eco-friendly, cheap, and electrocatalytic activity. Herein, we synthesized CdSe/SnO2 with a feasible strategy that is commercially favorable because of their non-expensive and ease of availability as well as their enhanced catalytic activity supporting overall water splitting. Several characterization techniques were performed to confirm and analyze the successful synthesis and activity of CdSe/SnO2 nanocomposite. The unique morphology of nanocomposite exhibits enhanced surface area, which increases active sites with abundant charge transfer potential and also supports the material for an extended period. Synergistic effect exhibited due to the superior active sites and the composite display an exceptional lower overpotential (233 mV) for OER, reaching at current density (j) of 10 mA cm(-2) with smaller Tafel slope of 89 mV dec(-1), showing high charge transfer during the OER representing good electrocatalytic performance on the graphite pencil electrode (GPE). The synthesized material is also used for overall water splitting with minute cell potential (2.4 V vs. RHE). The nanocomposite design by this strategy can also be used for many other materials to enhance the efficiency of the materials for future applications.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000799861400003

In this study, we identified the actual catalytically active phase of this oxide formed via the long-term OER and, moreover, demonstrated that the active phase can persist during the OER for 4 weeks without significant loss of electrocatalytic activity. The long-term durability tests were carried out on CFCO via continuous galvanostatic OER in 4 mol dm(-3) KOH aqueous solution for periods ranging from a few hours to 1 month, and the specimens submitted to the tests were characterized by means of electrochemical measurements and structural analysis using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption fluorescence spectroscopy. CFCO was readily converted to amorphous cobalt oxyhydroxides with 10% Fe substituents through the OER process, and these compounds had a local rearrangement similar to that of the layered gamma-CoOOH-type structure. This transformation involved large morphological changes of the oxide particles because of the extensive dissolution of Ca and Fe, yielding skeletal grains made of oxyhydroxide nanosheet aggregates. The extended durability studies with total polarization charge density of the order of 10(5) C cm(-2) revealed that a (Co, Fe)OOH-like compound is the actual electrocatalytic phase.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2574-0962			WOS:000543715100022

Herein, we introduce high-performance water-splitting electrodes (WSEs) with extremely low overpotentials and unprecedently high operation stability via a carbonization/interfacial assembly-induced electroplating approach. To this end, silk textiles were first converted to carboxylic acid-functionalized conductive textiles using carbonization and subsequent acid treatment. Then, amine linkers were assembled onto the conductive textiles to achieve favorable interfacial interactions with electrocatalysts. For a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrode, Ni was electroplated onto the interface-modified textile, while to prepare an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrode, NiFeCo was additionally electroplated onto the Ni-electroplated textile. These HER and OER electrodes exhibited extremely low overpotentials in alkaline media (12 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and 186 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) for the OER), outperforming the conventional non-noble metal-based electrodes. Additionally, the overall-water-splitting reaction of full-cell electrodes was stably maintained at a remarkably high current density of 2000 mA cm(-2) and a low cell voltage of 1.70 V. We believe that our approach can provide a basis for developing commercially available high-performance WSEs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000825710300001

The cells were synchronized using two cell cycle inhibitors: one for cells grown under light:dark cycles and one for growth in continuous light. We observed that the maximal photosynthetic capacity, p(m)(B) and ETRm were lowest just before cell division, when the percentage of cells in G2 + M was maximal, and were highest after division, when the percentage of cells in G1 was maximal. These results clearly show that photosynthetic activity is related to the cell cycle. In addition, the role of different oxygen uptake processes was determined using O-18(2), We showed that light stimulated oxygen uptake, which increased with irradiance between 0 and 250 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1). This variation was partly due to an increase of mitochondrial respiration, but mostly to a high Mehler activity. It seems that this increase was due to the Mehler reaction rather than photorespiration, because no increase of oxygen uptake was observed at low DIC (0.1 mM) concentration, which should have stimulated Rubisco oxygenase if there was diffusive CO2 entry. The activity of the Mehler reaction was independent of the cell cycle and explained 50 - 60% of the light stimulated oxygen uptake at irradiances equal to or exceeding the growth irradiance.									43	1	0	0	40	0	45			0967-0262	1469-4433		WOS:000220361000005

As the deposition potentials decreased from the double layer region to the hydrogen underpotential deposition region and finally into the hydrogen evolution reaction region under acidic conditions, the morphology of Pt nanocrystals changed from spherical Pt nanoparticles to willow-like Pt nanocrystals and finally to concave Pt nanocubes. We took advantage of the unique features of hydrogen adsorption/desorption on the surface of Pt in different potential regions to achieve the shape-controlled synthesis of Pt nanocrystals, and the different degrees of interaction between hydrogen and Pt played a key role in obtaining nanocrystals with various shapes. Concave Pt nanocubes exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity to the ethanol oxidation reaction, as compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts. The peak current density in the positive scan of concave Pt nanocubes was 2.3 mA cm(-2), which was 4.7 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2168-0485			WOS:000529151600030

Unfortunately, traditional proton exchange membrane possesses strong acidic chemical environment, which facilitates undesired hydrogen evolution reaction. Here we report a proton antagonist strategy, through which the proton diffusion pathways have been severely impeded by Na+ cation to produce an alkaline-rich environment. With this new membrane electrode assembly, we can significantly suppress the hydrogen evolution and achieve a Faradaic efficiency of 95.7% for CO with 51.5% energy efficiency. In addition, our proton antagonist membrane outperforms the commercial anion exchange membrane in both conductivity and oxidation resistance lifetime, which are crucial for large scale electrolysis of carbon neutral chemicals.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000866366100005

In this work, we make a significant step ahead in this direction by preparing a high-performance electrocatalyst and suggesting new structure-activity design concepts which could shape the future of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst design. For this, we present a new one-dimensional nanowire catalyst consisting of a L1(0) ordered intermetallic PtCo alloy core and compressively strained high-index facets in the Pt-rich shell. We find the nanoscale PtCo catalyst to provide an excellent turnover for the ORR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which we explain from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory calculations to be due to the high ratio of Pt(221) facets. These facets include highly active ORR and HER sites surprisingly on the terraces which are activated by a combination of sub-surface Co-induced high Miller index-related strain and oxygen coverage on the step sites. The low dimensionality of the catalyst provides a cost-efficient use of Pt. In addition, the high catalytic activity and durability are found during both half-cell and proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) operations for both ORR and HER. We believe the revealed design concepts for generating active sites on the Pt-based catalyst can open up a new pathway toward the development of high-performance cathode catalysts for PEMFCs and other catalytic systems.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000809999800001	35609281

Here, populations of Escherichia coli were adaptively evolved for similar to 1000 generations on uniformly labeled C-13-glucose, a commonly used isotope for C-13-MFA. Phenotypic characterization of these evolved strains revealed similar to 40% increases in growth rate, with no significant difference in fitness when grown on either labeled (C-13) or unlabeled (C-12) glucose. The evolved strains displayed decreased biomass yields, increased glucose and oxygen uptake, and increased acetate production, mimicking what is observed after adaptive evolution on unlabeled glucose. Furthermore, full genome re-sequencing revealed that the key genetic changes underlying these phenotypic alterations were essentially the same as those acquired during adaptive evolution on unlabeled glucose. Additionally, glucose competition experiments demonstrated that the wild-type exhibits no isotopic preference for unlabeled glucose, and the evolved strains have no preference for labeled glucose. Overall, the results of this study indicate that there are no significant differences between C-12 and C-13-glucose as a carbon source for E. coli growth.									37	0	0	0	31	0	37			1932-6203			WOS:000371993000106	26964043

In this study, a porous Ni layer was first electrodeposited on the surface of Ni mesh (NM) as a substrate, and then Ni/NM electrodes were prepared by CV oxidation for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER); NiFe-LDH/Ni/NM electrodes were prepared by a hydrothermal approach for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrode has excellent electrocatalytic performance; when the current density reaches 10 and 100 mA cm-2, the Ni/NM electrode's HER overpotential is 65 and 178 mV, respectively; when the current density reaches 100 mA cm-2, the NiFe-LDH/Ni/NM electrode's OER overpotential is 236 mV. As cathode and anode, when the Ni/NM || NiFe-LDH/Ni/NM electrolyzer was constructed for total water splitting in 1 M KOH, the cell voltages required 1.53 V and 1.80 V were to achieve 20 and 100 mA cm-2 current density. When simulating industrial applications at high current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm-2, the electrolyzer retains stability for at least 154 h. This study can offer an effective strategy for the preparation of structurally stable electrocatalysts from large current water electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000829297200001

Herein, Graphene-Quantum-Dots (GQDs) loaded and molybdenum doped porous Ni3S2 hybrid (G-Mo-Ni3S2) was in situ grown on Ni foam by a GQDs induced hydrothermal method and directly used both as a HER and OER electrocatalyst. The in situ coupling of GQDs and molybdenum doping Ni3S2 not only allow the modulation of electrochemical behavior, but also enhance electrical conductivity and expose more active sites. Benefiting from the inductive effect of GQDs, the in situ formed G-Mo-Ni3S2 porous structure showed outstanding HER performance with a low over-potential of 68 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and OER property with overpotential of 326 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. In addition, a two-electrode cell using G-Mo-Ni3S2 is constructed to deliver low cell voltage of 1.58 V at water-splitting current of 10 mA cm(-2) with remarkable stability for more than 50 h. This work serves as a promising strategy for the construction of efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It can be modified in various ways to improve its catalytic ability. Notably, other 2D materials with similar properties to graphene (black phosphorus (BP), 2D transition metal dichalcogenides represented by molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2), boron nitride (BN), and transition metal carbide and nitride (MXenes) and their hybrid materials also have a wide range of applications in the field of catalysis. In general, 2D materials can be used as catalysts, catalytic supports or electron donors. Therefore, they have been widely used in many catalytic reactions in recent years, such as photocatalysis, thermocatalysis, and electrocatalysis. In this paper, the research progress of the above 2D materials in the catalytic degradation of organic matter in water and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is summarized. In addition, some excellent composite 2D catalysts in the fields of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis are summarized and compared. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of the above 2D materials in the field of catalysis are pointed out, and the development prospects of the 2D materials in the field of catalysis are addressed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-7350			WOS:000849570100001

Here a theoretical method based on the constant-charge first principles periodic continuum solvation model is proposed to resolve the potential-dependent reaction kinetics on Pt and Au surfaces, and the quantitative linkage is established between the Tafel kinetics (current vs potential) and the electrochemical condition, including the surface structure, the surface charging, and the coverage. The theoretical Tafel slopes for HER are determined to be 83 mV on Pt(111) and 70 mV on Pt(100), which are generally associated with the reactions involving the minority weakly adsorbed H, i.e. the atop H above 1 ML on Pt(111) and the bridging H above 1.5 ML on Pt(100). The mechanism and the contribution of each pathway (Volmer, Tafel, and Heyrovsky pathways) are determined quantitatively. It is revealed that HER at the minority surface steps has a much higher activity than at terraces, which is responsible for the overall activity on a typical Pt electrode. The theoretical model here paved the way toward the large-scale computational screening for both active and economic hydrogen electrode.									69	3	0	0	2	0	70			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000317950300031

However, due to the electronegativity of oxygen anions, single-metal atoms often remain positively charged in these oxide supports and are poor at binding hydrogen species for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we report a ligand charge donation-acquisition balance strategy via an amorphous TiBxOy, support to tune the EMSIs, which lead to the boosted HER mass activity of a single Pt atom catalyst. Based on spectroscopic characterizations, we found that Pt single atoms preferentially bonded with nearly neutral B atoms originating from TiB2-like species in the Ti-B-O framework rather than O anions. Density functional theory calculations reveal that due to the charge-transfer balance between B-O and B-Pt, the nucleophilicity of Pt was tuned to an optimum state, with an ideal hydrogen binding energy that benefits the HER. As a result, this Pt/TiBxOy catalyst achieves a high HER mass activity (37.8 A mg(-1) Pt) and a turnover frequency (33.2 H-2 s(-1) Pt site(-1)) at an overpotential of 50 mV in an acid medium, outperforming commercial Pt/C by a factor of 34 and 33, respectively.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000820332000001		
J	Lee, Jordan; Li Yong; Tang Jianing; Cui Xiaoli								Synthesis of Hydrogen Substituted Graphyne through Mechanochemistry and Its Electrocatalytic Properties								ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA				34	9			1080	1087		10.3866/PKU.WHXB201802262				2018	2018	Since the successful synthesis of graphdiyne, graphynes have emerged as an active field in carbon materials research. Hydrogen-substituted graphyne, structurally similar to graphynes, is a kind of two-dimensional (2D) carbon-rich material composed of sp(2)-hybridized carbon and hydrogen from phenyl groups and sp-hybridized carbon from ethynyl linkages. The large pore size in the molecular structure of hydrogen-substituted graphyne aids the diffusion of ions and molecules. In this work, hydrogen-substituted graphyne was synthesized by a facile mechanochemical route. Calcium carbide (CaC2) was employed as the precursor of sp-hybridized carbon and 1,3,5 tribromobenzene (PhBr3) as that of sp(2)-hybridized carbon and hydrogen. Hydrogen-substituted graphyne was directly obtained via the cross-coupling reaction performed by ball milling under vacuum and the impurities were removed by dilute nitric acid and benzene. Mechanochemistry is a mature technology for the simple and high-yield synthesis of nanostructured materials. The composition of the as-prepared hydrogen-substituted graphyne was confirmed by Raman and H-1 solid-state nuclear magnetic spectroscopies. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicated that the purity and crystallinity of the prepared samples are high, which was further confirmed by the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images illustrated that samples had nanosheet structure with a layer-to-layer distance of 0.35 nm. However, owing to the lack of a substrate, the nanosheets reunite to form irregular microparticles, as shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. Twin structure was found in the as-prepared samples, which might be relevant to the mechanochemical process. The samples were used to prepare electrodes for the photoelectrochemical and electrochemical catalytic analysis. The open circuit potential under chopped irradiation of the electrode showed that the as-prepared hydrogen-substituted graphyne was a p-type semiconductor. The band gap was calculated to be 2.30 eV by UV-Vis diffused reflectance (UV-Vis DRS) spectroscopy. The electrocatalytic properties of the sample were determined using a three-electrode cell in a neutral solution (Na2SO4, 0.5 mol center dot L-1 ). The onset overpotential for hydrogen evolution was -0.17 V; however, the Tafel slope was too large (1088.4 mV.dec(-1) ), which restricted application in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. On the other hand, the overpotential for oxygen evolution reaction was only 0.04 V and the Tafel slope was 70.0 mV.dec(-1) , making applications in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution and photocatalysis possible. This strategy opens a new avenue for preparing graphyne with good electrochemical properties using readily available precursors under mild conditions.									21	3	0	0	0	0	22			1000-6818			WOS:000431609200010

The impurity B/Si atoms are more likely to occupy sulfur atom lattice positions with lower formation energies, which results in the breaking of surface chemically inertness of the MoS2 (001) plane. Free H2O molecules can be adsorbed on doped surfaces with lower adsorption energies, and form chemical bonds between oxygen and impurity atoms. Adsorbed H2O can be separated into OH radical and hydrogen adatom with a lower dissociation energy barrier on these doped systems (including impurity B/Si single doped, B and Si co-doped). Furthermore, the adsorbed OH radical can be further dissociated into oxygen and hydrogen adatoms on the surface of B and Si co-doped MoS2. Our theoretical study suggests that substrate of monolayer MoS2 doped with impurity B, Si may be a potential alternative choice for hydrogen evolution reaction.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000472176900116

We design and synthesize a novel composite system based on functionalised Pt(II)-porphyrin and multiwalled carbon nanotubes for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysis. Rather than qualitatively integrating porphyrin with carbon nanotubes, the optimized Pt(II)-porphyrin loading and precisely morphology control could be fine-tuned and quantitatively premeditated by using fluorescence and UV-vis titration based on the unique pi-pi interactions behaviour of the porphyrin for the first time. The as-prepared composites exhibit superior HER catalytic activity with an overpotential of 35 mV for an electrocatalytic current density of j=-10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 32.3 mV dec(-1). Moreover, such catalysts do not exhibit observable activity decay after a 1000-cycle stability test, thus demonstrating their excellent durability. To further reduce Pt loading to achieve cost efficiency, we develop a Pt-Co bimetallic HER catalyst with an ultra-low platinum content through a straightforward synthesis pathway with high catalytic activity and stability. This study provides a new approach for preparing a highly active and stable HER catalyst, which could potentially be extended to other reactions to improve the utilization efficiency of precious metal catalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000521623900001

Exploring efficient electrocatalysts to expedite the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial task that needs to be addressed in order to boost the practical application of water splitting. Intensive efforts have been devoted to develop mixed transition metal based chalcogenides as effective OER electrocatalysts. Herein, we have reported synthesis of a series of mixed metal selenides containing Co, Ni and Cu employing combinatorial electrodeposition, and systematically investigated how the transition metal doping affects the OER catalytic activity in alkaline medium. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was performed to detect the elemental compositions and confirm the feasibility of compositional control of 66 metal selenide thin films. It was observed that the OER catalytic activity is sensitive to the concentration of Cu in the catalysts, and the catalyst activity tended to increase with increasing Cu concentration. However, increasing the Cu concentration beyond a certain limit led to decrease in catalytic efficiency, and copper selenide by itself, although catalytically active, showed higher onset potential and overpotential for OER compared to the ternary and quaternary mixed metal selenides. Interestingly, the best quaternary composition (Co0.21Ni0.25Cu0.54)(3)Se-2 showed similar crystal structure as its parent compound of Cu3Se2 with slight decrease in lattice spacings of (101) and (210) lattice planes (0.0222 angstrom and 0.0148 angstrom, respectively) evident from the powder X-ray diffraction pattern. (Co0.21Ni0.25Cu0.54)(3)Se-2 thin film exhibited excellent OER catalytic activity and required an overpotential of 272 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is 54 mV lower than Cu3Se2, indicating a synergistic effect of transition metal doping in enhancing catalytic activity.									53	0	0	0	1	0	53			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000467249200047

Herein, we synthesize a porous and interfaces-rich Fe3O4/RuO2-C composite from the Metal organic frameworks (MOF) material for overall water splitting in alkaline media. The Fe3O4/RuO2-C catalyst showed superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with high faradic efficacy. It requires 268 mV overpotential to achieve the current density of 20 mA/cm(2). The catalyst also exhibited good hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 94 mV. The stability test confirmed a remarkable long-term OER and HER stability of this catalyst in alkaline media. In addition, the Fe3O4/RuO2-C catalyst was also used as cathode and anode material for overall water splitting. It showed superior activity and stability in alkaline media with 10 mA/cm(2) current density at 1.595 V cell potential. The excellent electrocatalytic activity of the Fe3O4/RuO2-C catalyst can be attributed to its porous structure, synergistic interaction between the components, the presence of hetero-interfaces, high electrochemical surface area etc. This work may provide an opportunity to design a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the development of anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs).									2	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000821427200001		
J	Jia, Siqin; Wang, Qiguan; Chen, Jian; Wang, Sumin								High-active nanoplates of nitrogen-doped carbon@Mo2C as efficient catalysts in water splitting								SYNTHETIC METALS				279						116847	10.1016/j.synthmet.2021.116847		JUL 2021		SEP 2021	2021	Carbon doped metallic compounds have attracted a great deal of interest due to their new synergistic properties and enhanced catalytic performance from the doped-element induced defects. In this paper, polyaniline (PANI) is used as the carbon source to dope molybdenum carbide, which is annealed at 1000 degrees C to be nitrogen-doped carbon coupled with Mo2C (NC@Mo2C). Through the XRD, SEM and TEM methods the prepared NC@Mo2C composite is thoroughly characterized. The NC@Mo2C composite illustrates two-dimensional nanoplate morphology, and shows low overpotential in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, 0.04 V) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 0.13 V) in 1 M KOH solution. Tafel slopes of NC@Mo2C for HER and OER are 100 mV decade-1 and 99 mV decade-1, respectively, rather lower than pure Mo2C (HER: 130 mV decade- 1 and OER: 126 mV decade-1). The Raman and XPS results show that it is the structural defects of Mo2C derived from NC doping that activate the reaction. Meanwhile, the NC doping and resulted defects enhance the conductivity of Mo2C, as well as endow NC@Mo2C nanoplates high electrochemical active surface area, facilitating the ion transfer, water absorption and gas desorption. The results of our work open up a new chance to design efficient non-noble metalbased catalysts for water electrolysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0379-6779			WOS:000692312600002

Few robust water-oxidation catalysts capable of mediating this difficult four-electron, four-proton reaction have yet been described. We report a new method for generating an amorphous electrodeposited material, principally consisting of iridium and oxygen, which is a robust and long-lived catalyst for water oxidation, when driven electrochemically. The catalyst material is generated by a simple anodic deposition from Cp*Ir aqua or hydroxo complexes in aqueous solution. This work suggests that organometallic precursors may be useful in electrodeposition of inorganic heterogeneous catalysts.									190	5	0	0	18	0	193			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000285009500010

The optimum heating temperature to get a single-phase hexagonal layered structure increased with Mn contents in the compound. Oxygen vacancies could be gradually reduced with Mn-substitutions. While the lattice constants, M-O distance, and MO2 slab thickness increased with Mn contents, Li-O and inter-slab distances decreased. Electrical conductivities decreased with Mn contents because of the decreased carrier mobility that resulted from smaller primary particle sizes as well as lager amounts of cation mixing. Samples of x=1/12 and 1/9 in LiNi1-xMnxO2-delta exhibited 0.1 C-rate discharge capacities of 216.2 and 208.9 mAh g(-1) and first cycle efficiencies of 93.3 and 94.0%, respectively. The sample of x = 1/9 in LiNi1-xMnxO2-delta exhibited the highest rate capability. From the systematically investigated phase evolution behaviors, a higher activation energy as well as a slower rate of phase transition reaction for higher Mn contents phase were observed.

Herein, ruthenium and nitrogen codoped carbon nanowires are prepared as effective hydrogen evolution catalysts. The catalytic performance is markedly better than that of commercial platinum catalyst, with an overpotential of only -12 mV to reach the current density of 10 mV cm(-2) in 1M KOH and -47 mV in 0.1M KOH. Comparisons with control experiments suggest that the remarkable activity is mainly ascribed to individual ruthenium atoms embedded within the carbon matrix, with minimal contributions from ruthenium nanoparticles. Consistent results are obtained in first-principles calculations, where RuCxNy moieties are found to show a much lower hydrogen binding energy than ruthenium nanoparticles, and a lower kinetic barrier for water dissociation than platinum. Among these, RuC2N2 stands out as the most active catalytic center, where both ruthenium and adjacent carbon atoms are the possible active sites.									284	15	0	0	15	0	288			2041-1723			WOS:000458008700010	30733437

The catalyst is prepared via a novel one-step solid-state electrolytic reduction of a mixture of MoS2 and polypyrrole nanofiber in molten CaCl2 at 850 degrees C. As comparison, a series of Mo2C materials are prepared by the method using different carbon precursors. TEM tests show that the as-prepared N-doped Mo2C is composed of near-spherical nanoparticles with the particle sizes of about 40-60 nm. Nitrogen-doping of Mo2C is shown to facilitate the exposure of active centers on the surface of the sample, concurrently modify the electronic property of Mo2C to promote electron transfer for HER. As a result, the optimized N-doped Mo2C (Mo2C-PPyF-1/1) displays a low onset potential of 78.1 mV for HER and a Tafel slope of 59.6 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 MH2SO4, meanwhile exhibits high activity and stability in a broad pH range (0-14). Furthermore, the synthesis method is extended to fabricate other N-doped transition metal carbides (NbC, TaC and TiC). All of the N-doped materials exhibit significantly enhanced activity compared to the undoped ones. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The rational development of a photocatalyst for the WOR requires their characterization under appropriate process conditions. A micropipette filled with an aqueous dispersion of nanostructured BiVO4 as a well-defined photoactive substrate is immersed into an immiscible organic solution containing perchlorate as a common anion. Under illumination, hydroxyl radicals (OH center dot) are generated as adsorbed intermediates of the WOR under chemically controlled polarization. Combining the miniaturized liquid-liquid interface with a scanning electrochemical microscope allowed for the application of the surface interrogation mode for quantitative assessment of adsorbed photogenerated intermediates. The loading of OH center dot intermediates per projected area of the substrate (Gamma = 3.33 x 10(-5) mol m(-2)) and kinetics of their decay by a bimolecular reaction (k = 0.61 X 10(5) mol(-1) m(2) s(-1)) were determined with bare BiVO4 assembled at the soft interface electrified by ClO4- transfer and irradiated by visible light. This determination was possible without processing BiVO4 nanostructures to a solid electrode where particle-particle contacts and other structural features strongly modulate the overall outcome.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1932-7447			WOS:000436381600041

The latter include counterflow diffusion flames, plug dow reactors, shock tubes and premixed flames. The reaction mechanism features 743 elementary reactions and 141 species and represents an attempt to develop a chemical kinetic mechanism applicable to intermediate and high temperature oxidation. Toluene thermal decomposition and radical attack reactions leading to oxygenated species are given particular attention. The benzyl radical sub-mechanism is expanded to include izomerization and thermal decomposition reactions, which are important at flame temperatures, and a molecular oxygen attack path to form the benzylperoxy radical, which is found to be relevant at lower temperatures. The final toluene kinetic model results in excellent fuel consumption profiles in both dames and plug flow reactors and sensible predictions of the temporal evolution of the hydrogen radical and pyrolysis products in shock tube experiments. The structures of toll uene/n-heptane, toluene/n-heptane/methanol and toluene/methanol diffusion dames are predicted with reasonable quantitative agreement for major and minor species profiles. Furthermore, the evolution of major and intermediate species in plug flow reactors is well modelled and excellent laminar burning velocity predictions have also been achieved.									73	1	1	0	0	0	75			0010-2202			WOS:A1996WP80100006

To design highly efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to lower the overpotential and enhance the reaction rate is of great importance for electrochemical water splitting. However, the development of low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction is still a major challenge. In this paper, we have fabricated NiSe@CoP nanowires with a core-shell structure array grown on nickel foam (NF), denoted as NiSe@CoP NWs/NF, via a low temperature phosphorization reaction. This 3D core-shell structure catalytic electrode provides synergistic effects, a large number of active sites, fast electron transport and enhanced electrochemical durability, resulting in a remarkable HER activity that delivers overpotentials of 91 mV and 73 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. Notably, the NiSe@CoP NW/NF electrode shows excellent stability evaluated by 1000 potential cycles and operation with a high current density at a fixed potential for 12 h in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000419051200005

To study the solvent effect, one monolayer of water is included in the free energy calculations of adsorbates in CO2RR and HER and compared with the results when water is absent. The emphasis is on the catalytic trends where limiting potential volcano plots for the products are obtained through the scaling relations of adsorbates. We find that cooperative adsorbed (co-adsorbed) water changes the overpotentials for the formation of formic acid and methanol, ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 V. Moreover, co-adsorbed water destabilizes HCOOH on TMOs (except for IrO2 and ZrO2) and therefore the selectivity is shifted more toward formic acid compared to methanol when the model system is improved. We confirm recent experimental observations that the RuO2 catalyst is selective toward HER. Furthermore, NbO2 is predicted to be selective toward formic acid and methanol formation while other TMOs such as MoO2, ZrO2 and OsO2 are predicted to reduce CO2 to CO on their surfaces.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000724596400006

In this paper, an in-situ growth of iron-nickel phosphide on nickel foam (FeNiPx/NF) is demonstrated as a self-supported ternary catalyst for electrochemical water splitting. The FeNiPx/NF were prepared by a thermo-reaction between NaH2PO2 and NiFe hydroxide precursors that are in situ grown on Ni foam via a simple chemical precipitation reaction. In this newly proposed method, the nickel foam not only acts as an electrode substrate, but also serves as a slow-release Ni source in the reaction due to its oxidation by Fe3+ in solution. Benefiting from collaborative advantages of bimetallic composite, metallic phosphide, and unique electrode fabrication, the FeNiPx/NF exhibits extraordinarily high activities for both OER and HER with low overpotentials of of 192 and 106 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), 236 and 161 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. The voltage during the galvanostatic electrolysis is well maintained for almost 400 h without any visible elevation, representing the few most stable noble-metal-free catalysts for water splitting.

Aqueous zinc batteries are environmentally benign and offer more flexibility in manufacturing processes but are plagued by limited energy densities because of an operating voltage below 2 V. Here, we demonstrate a cathodeless battery with decoupled reactions successfully raising the voltage up to 2 V. The decoupled hydrogel electrolyte design inhibits cation crossover without the use of an ion-selective membrane and suppresses oxygen evolution upon bonding water to hydrogen sulfate anions through hydrogen bonding, allowing for high energy output and a long lifespan. The elimination of electrode composite slurries transforms everyday objects into batteries. Thirty minutes of wireless charging drives a multifunction electronic device for more than a day. Hydrogel electrolytes can be easily regenerated by resoaking, inspiring a new generation of sustainable energy storage devices.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2380-8195			WOS:000651810400024

Herein, defect distribution of TiO2 nanosheets was regulated via annealing the pristine TiO2 sample in oxygen and hydrogen atmospheres successively. The results show that the combination of suitable distribution of oxygen vacancy (V-O) promotes the separation of charge carriers, improving the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. More interestingly, V(O)s boost the activation of molecular oxygen to singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) and superoxide anion radical (center dot O-2-) in selectively photocatalytic oxidation of benzylamine to imine. Generation of O-1(2) and center dot O-2- is a competitive process, which can be regulated via adjusting the distribution of oxygen defects, and the key species is O-1(2) that can be mainly induced by V(O)s. These results can provide an avenue to the defect engineering upon photocatalysts used to selective organic synthesis.									56	0	0	0	7	0	55			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000501613700004

First, the structural and morphological analyses of the as-synthesized composite have been carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectral studies, field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX), high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Brunauer- Emmett-Teller (BET) analyses. Second, C-Ni/Co-HS loaded at a 316 stainless steel (SSL) mesh electrode was studied as an efficient and stable electrocatalyst, which firmly initiated the OER at a low potential of 1.47 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) compared to the benchmark catalyst such as RuO2 or other counterparts, ferrite-loaded electrodes such as iron oxide (Fe2O3), nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4), cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4), etc. Accordingly, a very low overpotential of 240 mV was observed for OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under alkaline 1.0 M KOH conditions where the Tafel slope was calculated as 42 mV dec(-1) at the C-Ni/Co-HS-loaded 316 SSL mesh electrode when compared to the counterpart, NiFe2O4/CoFe2O4 heterostructure (Ni/Co-HS)-loaded electrode, i.e., in the absence of 10% MWCNTs under identical electrochemical conditions. Besides, an excellent faradic efficiency was measured for C-Ni/Co-HS, propounding that the carbon support has minimized the corrosion and the additional oxidation of the active electrocatalyst during the course of the electrocatalytic OER test. The stability of the active CNi/Co-HS composites was studied under continued oxygen evolution for several hours at an applied potential of 1.67 V (vs RHE) to interpret the heterostructure phenomenal long-term stability and higher electrocatalytic activity toward OER. Thus, the developed inorganic-complex-derived heterostructure-based electrocatalyst provides an alternative to noble metal systems to afford a simple, highly efficient, and stable process for OER.									16	0	0	0	0	0	15			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000631407400063

Amorphous hydrous TiO2 solid spheres (AHTSS) are first synthesized by a sol-gel method and are then used as precursor and template for the subsequent hydrothermal reaction with alkaline earth metal ions in an alkaline medium. This strategy can be generalized to synthesize porous spheres of various perovskite titanates (i.e., SrTiO3, BaTiO3, and CaTiO3) consisting of single-crystalline nanocubes. By controlling the textural properties (i.e., size, porosity, and structure) of AHTSS, perovskite titanates with tunable Size and inner structures are selectively synthesized. The underlying formation mechanism is manifested by XRD and TEM to involve in situ crystallization or Ostwald ripening during the hydrothermal process. The obtained porous SrTiO3 spheres present superior performance in photocatalytic oxygen evolution and CdSe-sensitized mesoscopic solar cells.									56	1	0	0	3	0	56			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000358395200040	26091019

Improved Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation by the WO3/CuWO4 Composite with a Manganese Phosphate Electrocatalyst								LANGMUIR				31	39			10897	10903		10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b01780				OCT 6 2015	2015	We describe a composite of the n-type semiconductors for the photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A simple drop-casting technique of mixed precursors and a one-step annealing process were used in the synthesis of the WO3/CuWO4 composite. The composite showed improved photocurrent for water oxidation compared to either of the two compounds individually. We discuss possible electron-hole separation mechanisms in two semiconductors comprising a primary photon-absorbing semiconductor of CuWO4 with a secondary semiconductor of WO3. When the WO3/CuWO4 composite is simultaneously irradiated, the photogenerated hole from the WO3 valence band transfers to CuWO4, which results in an enhanced charge separation of CuWO4. Furthermore, the OER catalytic activity of manganese phosphate (MnPO) was compared to manganese oxide nanopartides (Mn2O3) by electrochemical measurements, showing that the manganese phosphate was more efficient for the OER reaction. To investigate the effect of catalysts on semiconductors, manganese phosphate was deposited on the WO3/CuWO4 composite. The result demonstrates the promise of manganese phosphate for improving the photocurrent as well as the stability of the WO3/CuWO4 composite.									71	4	0	0	3	0	72			0743-7463			WOS:000362629000031	26371544

The progenitor problem of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is still unsolved. Most of these events are thought to be explosions of carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs (WDs), but for many of the explosion scenarios, particularly those involving the externally triggered detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass WD (sub-M-Ch, WD), there is also a possibility of having an oxygen-neon (ONe) WD as progenitor.Aims. We simulate detonations of ONe WDs and calculate synthetic observables from these models. The results are compared with detonations in CO WDs of similar mass and observational data of SNe Ia.Methods. We perform hydrodynamic explosion simulations of detonations in initially hydrostatic ONe WDs for a range of masses below the Chandrasekhar mass (M-Ch), followed by detailed nucleosynthetic postprocessing with a 384-isotope nuclear reaction network. The results are used to calculate synthetic spectra and light curves, which are then compared with observations of SNe Ia. We also perform binary evolution calculations to determine the number of SNe Ia involving ONe WDs relative to the number of other promising progenitor channels.Results. The ejecta structures of our simulated detonations in sub-M-Ch, ONe WDs are similar to those from CO WDs. There are, however, small systematic deviations in the mass fractions and the ejecta velocities. These lead to spectral features that are systematically less blueshifted. Nevertheless, the synthetic observables of our ONe WD explosions are similar to those obtained from CO models.Conclusions. Our binary evolution calculations show that a significant fraction (3-10%) of potential progenitor systems should contain an ONe WD. The comparison of our ONe models with our CO models of comparable mass (similar to 1.2 M-circle dot) shows that the less blueshifted spectral features fit the observations better, although they are too bright for normal SNe Ia.									38	2	0	0	0	0	38			1432-0746			WOS:000360020200118

However, such materials are commonly insufficiently stable and/or catalytically inactive at low pH, and positive potentials required to maintain high rates of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To address this, we explore the effects of a dielectric nanoscale-thin layer, constituted of amorphous TiO2, on the stability and electrocatalytic activity of nanostructured OER anodes based on low-cost Co3O4. We demonstrate a direct correlation between the OER performance and the thickness of the atomic layer deposited TiO2 layers. An optimal TiO2 layer thickness of 4.4 nm enhances the anode lifetime by a factor of ca. 3, achieving 80 h of continuous electrolysis at pH near zero, while preserving high OER catalytic activity of the bare Co3O4 surface. Thinner and thicker TiO2 layers decrease the stability and activity, respectively. This is attributed to the pitting of the TiO2 layer at the optimal thickness, which allows for access to the catalytically active Co3O4 surface while stabilizing it against corrosion. These insights provide directions for the engineering of active and stable composite earth-abundant materials for acidic water splitting for high-throughput hydrogen production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000830649400001	35838141

Herein, we report a facile strategy to fabricate Co/Zn sulfide supported on Cu-foam (CoZn-S/Cu-F) as a free-standing electrode with high-performance for overall water splitting. In half-cell electrochemical systems, the overpotentials required to reach the current densities of +/- 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER and HER are only 170 and 130 mV, respectively. After a long-term stability test running 20 000 cyclic voltammograms, the respective potential losses for the OER and HER are only 82 and 41 mV at +/- 50 mA cm(-2). The constructed overall water splitting system driven by simulated solar energy also exhibits prominent performance with gas bubbles continuously generated at both electrodes. A cell voltage of only 1.58 V is required to reach the current densities of +/- 10 mA cm(-2), surpassing the commercialized noble metal and state-of-the-art non-noble metal electrodes. The excellent performance for the overall water splitting is ascribed to the CoS nanoparticles covered with ZnS nanoflocs on the highly conductive Cu-foam, which allows close interfacial contact with the electrolyte, promotes mass and charge transfer, and facilitates desorption of the generated gas from the catalyst surface.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000803532500001

The characteristics of abundant pores, high specific surface area and decreased ion diffusion distance for meshy NiMnO nanomaterial play a major role in both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and supercapacitors. For OER, the porous NiMnO NM demonstrates enhanced catalytic properties, such as modest onset overpotential of similar to 270 mV as well as Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1), large Cdl of 22.5 mF cm(-2), attractive durability for at least 3000 cycles and improved stability over 80 h at different temperatures in 0.1 M KOH. Meanwhile, the excellent capacitive properties in supercapacitors, including intriguing specific capacitance of 371 F g(-1) at a high current density of 10 A g(-1), admirable rate capability and eminent cycling stability for 5000 cycles at 10 A g(-1), are also displayed by NiMnO NM tested in 0.5 M Na2SO4.

Amorphous materials have attracted considerable attention in catalysis because of their abundant catalytic active sites. Herein, a series of derivatives is prepared via the low-temperature heat treatment of ZIF-67 hollow sphere at different temperatures. An intermediate product with an amorphous structure is formed during transformation from ZIF-67 to Co3O4 nanocrystallines when ZIF-67 hollow sphere is heat treated at 260 degrees C for 3 h. The chemical composition of the amorphous derivative is similar to that of ZIF-67, and the carbon and nitrogen contents of the amorphous derivative are obviously higher than those of crystalline samples obtained at 270 degrees C or higher. As electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and nonenzymatic glucose sensing, the amorphous derivative exhibits significantly better catalytic activity than crystalline Co3O4 samples. The amorphous sample as an OER catalyst has a low overpotential of 352 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The amorphous sample as an enzyme-free glucose sensing catalyst can provide a low detection limit of 3.9 x 10(-6) m and a high sensitivity of 1074.22 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2).									79	10	0	0	9	0	79			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000501676000001	31821688

Herein, we report the fabrication of copper nickel bimetallic phosphide nanoparticles encapsulated within hierarchical porous carbon (CuxNi1-xP@PC) based on a bimetallic organic frameworks (BMOFs) assisted phosphorization route. The size-controlled effect of BMOFs led to the ultrafine particle sizes (average about 10 nm), which possess large active surface area and high dispersity in the final catalyst materials. Remarkably, when investigated as electrocatalysts for HER, the fabricated CuxNi1-xP@PC composites exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic activity and excellent long-term stability toward HER at all pH values. It required overpotentials of 102 and 118 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH solution respectively, as well as Tafel slopes of 85.8 mV dec(-1) and 73.1 mV dec(-1). This work offers a promising route to explore BMOFs as precursor for the fabrication of hybrid electrocatalysts with high performance toward water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2365-6549			WOS:000726827000042

The oxygen-deficient WO3 NH surface modified by controlled annealing facilitates the formation of a rich edge-exposed WS2 during sulfurization. In addition, metallic 1T phase WS2 is preferentially grown on the WO3 NHs owing to the strain induced between WS2 and curved WO3 NHs. Such desirable structural properties, metallic 1T phase and a rich edge-exposed morphology of the catalytic electrode directly resulted in an enhanced HER performance in water splitting.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000501213600018

The hierarchical FeCo2S4 nanospheres (HNSs) are synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal method on Ni foam (NF) by vulcanizing Fe-Co precursors with different concentrations of Na2S. Since FeCo2S4 HNSs have the advantages of a large exposed surface area and high dispersity on the Ni foam, the FeCo2S4/NF heterostructure is used as a working electrode for OER in an electrochemical system. The catalysis results represent that the performance of FeCo2S4/NF in OER correlates with the vulcanized HNS surfaces made with different concentrations of Na2S, where the 0.1 M FeCo2S4/NF catalyst is the optimized condition to exhibit the lowest OER overpotential. Besides, the structures of FeCo2S4 HNSs are stable after a 12 h OER durability test. In the results of in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements with the FeCo2S4/NF electrode, the mechanism of FeCo2S4-catalyzed water splitting is through the formation of MOOH (M = metal) followed by the release of O-2, the so-called indirect pathway, in the alkaline condition. Co has the major role to play in the OER reaction, while Fe holds its electronic state. Moreover, the reason for sulfide-assisted OER is the reduced chargetransfer barrier in the HNS structure that benefits MOOH generation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2168-0485			WOS:000736577400001

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising electrocatalysts for the N-2 reduction reaction, but most of them are active for the undesirable and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, we developed a facile strategy to grow a Ce-MOF on copper mesh substrate. The Ce-MOF with a self-supporting structure could be directly used as an electrode for the N-2 reduction reaction, demonstrating highly efficient electrocatalytic performance with an NH3 yield of 14.83 mu g h(-1) cm(-2) and a Faradaic efficiency of 10.81% at -0.2 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode. Structural characterizations of Ce-MOF after electrocatalysis revealed that Ce-MOF as precatalyst underwent structural reconstruction at negative potential, forming catalytically active CeO2 with oxygen vacancies embedded in the amorphous CeMOF. In addition, the self-supporting structure formed by in situ growth of Ce-MOF on porous and conductive cooper mesh endowed the electrocatalyst with enhanced stability, conductivity, and mass transport. This work demonstrated the structural transformation of Ce-MOF during the electrocatalytic process and provided new insight for the rational design of MOF-based electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000734174000007

In this work, ultra-small MoS2 nanosheets with 5% Ni doping grown on both sides of hollow carbon microtubes (5%-Ni-MoS2/aCMT) are prepared by a hydrothermal method. The vertically oriented Ni-doped MoS2 nanosheets provide more active sites for HER, while open porous structure promotes ions transport, and hollow carbon microtube substrate accelerates electrons transport as well as hydrogen release. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis proves that the optimal amount of Ni doping can effectively adjust the electronic structure of MoS2. As a result, 5%-Ni-MoS2/aCMT electrode exhibits enhanced kinetics for HER in both acidic and alkaline conditions. To deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), it requires overpotentials of 140 and 88 mV in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4. 5%-Ni-MoS2/aCMT exhibits better stability than commercial Pt/C at a high current density of 200 mA cm(-2).

The reconfiguration of electrons at the metal and semiconductor interface and well-tuned compositions between Ni and Ni(OH)(2) significantly promote activities for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Owing to the synergistic effect of Ni and Ni(OH)(2), the optimal hybrid electrode delivers low overpotentials of 310 and 168 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER in 1 M KOH, respectively. Assembled as an alkaline electrolyzer for overall water splitting, this bifunctional catalyst for both anode and cathode exhibits an excellent low onset potential of only 1.43 V and provides a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a very low cell voltage of 1.68 V. Furthermore, the symmetric cell shows a prominent long-term durability with negligible degradation even after 16 h continuous operation. The proposed synthesis process can be applied to other transition metals to prepare their metal/metal hydroxide hybrid composites with improved electrochemical performances for energy storage and conversion applications.									34	2	0	0	1	0	34			2168-0485			WOS:000526356300016

In addition, single-atom FeN4 sites at the edges of carbon substrates provide higher electrocatalytic performance than those in plane. Unfortunately, the conventional high-temperature pyrolysis method does not allow the generation of edge-enriched FeN4 single-atom sites. Herein, a novel low-temperature and solvent-free mechanochemical synthesis based on the use of dipyridylpyridazine (dppz) functionalized multilayer graphene as a starting material is proposed for precisely engineered location of these FeN4 active sites at the edges. After careful characterization of these dppz-based materials, the ORR and OER electrocatalytic performance was investigated, demonstrating the efficient formation of FeN4 sites at the edges as well as their excellent bifunctional behavior for the ORR and OER. This work paves the way for the development of sustainable approaches for the generation of edge-enriched FeN4 single atom sites on multilayer graphene structures.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000760911900001

Improved HER activity of Au/MoS2 is evidenced by a positively shifted overpotential (-77 mV) at a current density of -10 mA cm(-2) compared with pure MoS2 nanosheets. Experimental evidence shows that the interface between Au and MoS2 provides more sites to combine protons to form an active H atom. The density functional theory calculations found that new Au active sites on the Au and MoS2 interface with improved conductivity of the whole system are essential for enhancing HER activity of Au/MoS2.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1420-3049		WOS:000736899300001	34946586

Compounds 1 and 2 show remarkable Faradic efficiencies of 95.7% and 89.4% respectively. In terms of overpotential and Faradic efficiency, compound 1 turns out to be a better electrocatalyst for HER from water than compound 2. In this report, we have evidently proved that the active site of this electrochemical HER is the water coordinated Cu(II) center, supported onto POM cluster anion; the polyoxometalate, onto which these aqua-Cu(phen)-complexes are supported, plays an important role in making the overall system heterogeneous, for designing a better electrocatalyst for direct reduction of neutral water.

We provide atomic-scale insight into key factors controlling the stability of the cathode catalyst by studying the influence of particle size, the dealloying protocol and post-acid-treatment annealing on nanoporosity and passivation of the alloy nanoparticles. Scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled to energy dispersive spectroscopy data revealed the compositional variations of Ni in the particle surface and core, which were combined with an analysis of the particle morphology evolution during PEMFC voltage cycling; together, this enabled the elucidation of alloy structure and compositions conducive to long-term PEMFC device stability. We found that smaller size, less-oxidative acid treatment and annealing significantly reduced Ni leaching and nanoporosity formation while encouraged surface passivation, all resulting in improved stability and higher catalytic ORR activity. This study demonstrates a successful example of how a translation of basic catalysis research into a real-life device technology may be done.									304	14	0	0	15	0	311			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000346563600022

Herein, a new parkerite-type compound Pt3Bi2S2 was synthesized, constructed by [PtBi4S2] octahedra. The Bi 6p orbital electrons upshift the Pt 5d band to promote hydrogen adsorption. Moreover, the Bi-Pt orbital hybridization greatly improves the conductivity and accelerates the charge transfer during the electrocatalytic process. Hence, Pt3Bi2S2 exhibits a superior catalytic activity for the HER with a low overpotential of 61 mV (at j = 10 mA cm(-2)) and a Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1). In addition, Pt3Bi2S2 has higher stability than commercial Pt/C. This work proposes a promising strategy for designing new excellent HER catalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000674752800001	34286729

Interestingly, the composite acts as a potential OER electrocatalyst, displaying a low overpotential of 270mV @10 mAcm(-2), which is lower than that for the state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst. The remarkable OER performance of the cobalt-ludwigite is attributed to its basic distorted open crystal structure, which has a relatively high crystal volume, owing to a domain network consisting of edge-sharing octahedra. Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy clarifies the hybrid of cobalt-ludwigite and R-MWCNTs, exhibiting a stable pi-cation-like interaction between the Co3+ of Co3BO5 rather than Co2+ and neutral pi- cloud of R-MWCNTs, which helps in enhancing the conductivity of the system. Thus, the overall performance of the composite stems from the basic crystal structure of the Co3BO5 and the existence of synergistic effects between the R-MWCNTs on Co3BO5 through pi-cation-like interaction. Hence, the results of this study might be useful in developing more efficient other ludwigite-carbon OER electrocatalysts as affordable alternatives.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2196-0216			WOS:000436934000007

However, their essential features, such as the organic-ligand-shielded metal centres and low conductivity, make their electrocatalytic potential far from being exploited. These undesired issues can be avoided by designing and constructing MOF nanoarrays (MOF NAs) on self-supporting and conductive substrates such as the carbon cloth. Transforming appropriate solid material nanoarrays into MOF NAs provides a possibility to unlock the bottleneck. Herein, we have successfully developed a general approach for the morphological and electronic modulation of Co/Ni-MOF-74 NAs with wall-like Co/Ni(OH)(2) NAs as the self-sacrificing template. The wall- or spindle-like morphology of MOF-74 NAs was modulated by changing the dosage of ligand. As a result, Co/Ni-MOF-74 NAs displayed superior activity and stability to those of Co/Ni-MOF-74 prepared without the template. The Co0.5Ni0.5-MOF-74 NAs delivered a low overpotential of 244 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) due to the high proportion of active high-valence Co(iii) and Ni(iii). The proposed strategy can be extended to obtain brick-like Ni-BDC NAs and needle-like Ni BTC MOF NAs on carbon cloth.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1466-8033		WOS:000698347500001

The calcium and chloride requirements of the O-2 evolving complex								COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS				252	3-4			296	305		10.1016/j.ccr.2007.08.010				FEB 2008	2008	Manganese oxidation, catalyzed by chlorophyll photochemistry in photosystem II, is the key step in the pathway of redox reactions leading formation of O-2 from H2O. A unique feature of Mn redox chemistry is its dependence on the presence of both Ca2+ and Cl-; the active site of H2O oxidation consists of four Mn atoms, and one atom each of Ca2+ and Cl-. The best current structural model of the inorganic ion cluster, based on polarized EXAFS experiments on crystals of the photosystem, shows Ca2+ ligated by carboxyl groups from amino acid residues (alanine, glutamate) that bridge to Mn atoms. Chloride is not resolved in the current structures. Calcium is an essential structural element of the cluster during its assembly, and is required for efficient Mn oxidation. There is also compelling evidence that Ca2+ is involved in catalysis of H2O oxidation. Chloride is also required for Mn oxidation by photosystem II, and it has been demonstrated that the anion is required for the Mn redox reactions immediately preceding oxidation of H2O to O-2. Although there are no structural data on the site of Cl- binding in photosystem II, spectroscopic probing and ligand competition experiments position it in the vicinity of the Mn cluster.

One of the key problems limiting widespread implementation of PEMWE into energy systems is the sluggish kinetics of the anodic process: the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Additionally, state-of-the-art OER materials contain large amounts of low abundant noble metals (Ru, Ir), and therefore, development of low-cost, highly active and stable OER catalysts remains an important challenge. We developed a synthetic approach to the iridium pyrochlores complex oxides of iridium with reduced content of the noble metal as compared to IrO2. The materials were synthesized from molten sodium nitrate (Adams fusion method) at moderate temperatures (500-575 degrees C) and consist of highly crystalline iridium pyrochlore nanoparticles with surface areas of up to 40 m(2) C-1, which is a significant improvement compared to the traditional high temperature solid-state synthesis. Electrochemical measurements in acidic media showed that yttrium and bismuth pyrochlore catalysts possess high OER activity approaching the activity of state-of-the-art IrO2 nanoparticles. High intrinsic activities and stability behavior of yttrium iridium catalysts were correlated with the formation of the highly active IrOx surface layer due to leaching of the Y3+ cations into the electrolyte solution, revealed both experimentally and computationally using density functional theory calculations.									124	5	0	0	8	0	125			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000404493100020

The Au/TiO2 and Au/TiO2-Pt samples exhibiting strong photoabsorption due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of supported Au particles were used for the reduction of hexavalent chromium (Cr6+ in Cr2O72-) in aqueous suspensions under irradiation of visible light from a green light emitting diode (LED). These SPR-type photocatalysts reduced Cr6+ and evolved dioxygen (O-2) with O-2-reduced Cr6+ ratio of 3:4 until consumption of Cr6+, indicating that these SPR-type photocatalysts had the ability to oxidize water (H2O) utilizing visible light (lambda = 540 nm) and that a photocatalytic reaction (2Cr(2)O(7)(2-) + 16H(+) -> 4Cr(3+) + 3O(2) + 8H(2)O) occurred. The Au/TiO2 Pt sample exhibited a reaction rate about twice larger than that of Pt-free Au/TiO2, and the apparent quantum yield reached 1.0% at 550 nm and 0.47% even at 700 nm, indicating that functionalization of Au/TiO2 was successfully achieved by introduction of a Pt cocatalyst. This reaction can be used as a test reaction for evaluation of O-2 evolution ability of photocatalysts because this reaction does not induce irreversible changes in photocatalysts.									90	3	0	0	10	0	90			2155-5435			WOS:000322852900025

ZTA ceramics were successfully brazed with Ni50Ti50 active filler metals. The interfacial microstructure of ZTA/Ni-Ti/ZTA joints was characterised through SEM, EDS, XRD and Raman spectroscopy. The effects of holding time on the microstructure and shear strength of the joints were investigated. During brazing, both Al2O3 and ZrO2 reacted with the Ni50Ti50 filler and formed a AlNi2Ti + Ni2Ti4O double layer at the interface. ZrO2 involved in the interfacial reaction transformed into oxygen-deficient ZrO2-x, and ZrO2-x particles were present in the reaction layer because of Al2O3 consumption. NiTi and Ni3Ti compounds precipitated at the centre of a brazing seam. With an increase in the holding time, the thickness of AlNi2Ti and Ni2Ti4O gradually increased and more ZrO2-x particles appeared in the reaction layer. The mechanisms of interfacial microstructure formation and evolution were proposed. The maximum shear strength of 138 MPa was obtained for ZTA brazed at 1320 degrees C for 45 min. Nano-indentation was conducted to characterize the hardness, elastic modulus and plastic deformability of the reaction products, in order to analyse the fracture mechanism of the joints.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000597416000006

Herein, we propose a topochemical domain engineering to realize 2D mosaic heterostructures with ultrafine phosphide nanodomains highly dispersed on the surface of Ru doped CoMoO4 nanosheets (denoted as Ru-CMOP), which are vertically interconnected on the conductive skeleton assembling a 3D array structure. The as-prepared Ru-CMOP electrocatalyst exhibits excellent activity and long-term stability with the overpotentials of 114 and 286 mV at 100 mA cm-2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH solution, respectively, outperforming most reported metal phosphide-based bifunctional heterostructures. Moreover, an assembled electrolyzer using the Ru-CMOP as anode and cathode simultaneously delivers cell voltages of 1.697 V and 1.828 V to achieve 100 mA cm-2 and 500 mA cm-2, respectively, with outstanding durability at 250 mA cm-2 for 120 h. Density functional theory calculations and experimental results indicate that the strongly coupled heterointerfaces with built-in electric field can facilitate electron transfer while multi-porous nanosheet arrays contribute to active sites exposure and mass/gas transport, thereby synergistically accelerating the reaction kinetics. Additionally, combining with a commercial silicon photovoltaic solar cell, the electrolyzer can be efficiently and robustly established, demonstrating the great potential for practical photovoltaic-electrolysis applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000829476800002

Benefiting from its large porosity, high specific surface area, and nitrogen doping properties (mainly pyridinic nitrogen), the as-obtained NPCN-800 shows multifunctional applications as electrode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and catalyst for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). For LIBs application, the NPCN-800 delivers the high reversible capacity of 1286 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1), rate capability of 258 mAh g(-1) at 10 A g(-1), and cycle stability of 818 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) after 200 cycles. In addition, NPCN-800 exhibits good ORR catalytic activity. Therefore, these attributes make NPCN an auspicious candidate for LIBs and ORR.

Herein we introduce a laser-induced method for preparation of MOF-derived Co nanoparticle/nitrogen-doped porous graphene (Co/PNG) at room temperature and in air atmosphere. Through a laser scribing method, the organic complex is converted into nitrogen-doped graphene (PNG) and meanwhile the decomposition of the organic linker yields a reductive chemical atmosphere. This reductive atmosphere and high energy at the local position of laser irradiation allows the reduction of Co ions into atomic Co species and in turn enables the formation of Co/PNG. In addition, the flexible polyimide (PI) film-supported Co/PNG could be directly used as an electrode for electrocatalysis without the requirement of any binder. The electrocatalytic activity of the obtained electrode could be easily controlled by adjusting the power or the loading of MOFs. The electrocatalytic result indicates that Co/PNG shows satisfying activity and stability for water electrolysis. With the porous properties and Co-N-x active sites, the flexible electrode shows overpotentials of 131, 335, and 380 mV for hydrogen, oxygen evolution reaction, and overall water splitting reaction.									19	0	1	0	1	0	20			2168-0485			WOS:000562983600009

A spin-liquid state was found in FeTPyP-Fe and CoTPyP-Co MOFs. Long-range ferromagnetism was observed in FeTPyP-Co and CoTPyP-Fe MOFs. Ferromagnetic coupling in the CoTPyP-Fe (FeTPyP-Co) MOF was attributed to through-bond spin polarization (both spin delocalization and through-bond spin polarization). Our calculations revealed CoTPyP-Fe to be a half-metal. Dirac bands in the CoTPyP-Co and FeTPyP-Co MOFs might be responsible for the high reactivity of these MOFs in oxygen evolution reactions (OERs). The highest reactivity of FeTPyP-Co among the other TPyP MOFs might be related to the many frontier Dirac bands in the conduction band of FeTPyP-Co. In addition, the hazardous gas capturing ability of the most reactive MOF, FeTPyP-Co MOF, was examined. The adsorption of all gas molecules studied was energetically favorable, and the observed adsorption energies in decreasing order were NO2 > NO > SO2 > CO > O-2 > PH3 > N-2 > NH3 > H2S > OCS > H2O > CO2. The highest charge transfer observed was from metal (Fe and Co) to NO2, which may form nitrate species by dissociating the N-O bonds of adsorbed NO2.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000432477400018

Catalysts with proper surface properties are highly needed to optimize the surface binding energy with reaction intermediates and enhance intrinsic catalytic activity. Herein, we present an effective strategy to construct a self-standing catalyst with core-shell structure, which is composited of metallic Co nanoparticles coated by RuCo alloy layer with optimized surface properties. The Ru attracts electrons from Co and optimizes the surface electronic structure. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the water dissociation barrier on the Co surface is decreased from 0.65 eV to 0.58 eV after alloying with Ru. Experimental results reveal that the synthesized Co@RuCo-3 features highly efficient catalytic activity together with good stability at large current densities for HER in alkali, as well as in alkaline seawater and pure seawater.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000815961300004

Modification of Ti0.97Ru0.03O2/Ti electrodes with WO(3)was previously described as improving the effectiveness of an azo dye degradation in a photoelectrochemical treatment. Thus, the effect of WO(3)introduction to oxide film on electrode surface on electrochemical behaviour and stability of the modified electrodes was investigated. Moreover, corrosion behaviour of Ti0.97Ru0.03O2/Ti electrodes modified with WO(3)was evaluated with the application of potentiodynamic polarization sweep method and open circuit potential measurement. Electrodes modified with WO(3)revealed higher anodic and cathodic peak currents in K-4[Fe(CN)(6)] solution (by 35% for 6%WO(3)content) indicating higher electroactive surface area and faster electron transfer reaction. An increase in WO(3)amount in the oxide layer caused an increase in the number of active sites determined in Na(2)SO(4)and most of them (more than 80%) were located in the outer and more accessible surface. The investigation of the tested electrodes at high potentials at which oxygen evolution is observed, allowed their classification in the following order showing an increase in their activity towards oxygen evolution reaction: Ti0.97Ru0.03O2/Ti < Ti0.94Ru0.03O2-W0.03O3/Ti < Ti0.91Ru0.03O2-W0.06O3/Ti. Although the electrode modification with WO(3)resulted in lower resistance to corrosion in Na(2)SO(4)solution regarding corrosion potential, corrosion current densities were clearly lower in comparison with the non-modified electrode, especially after longer immersion in the solution. ASTs showed that even a small addition of WO(3)increased the lifetime of the electrodes. The Ti0.97Ru0.03O2/Ti electrode modification with WO(3)seemed to be advantageous for their application in electrochemical and photoelectrochemical degradation of organic pollutants.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000544219300001

This work shows that a trimetallic carbide (Co3Fe3W6C), derived from one-pot synthesis, could act as a robust electrocatalyst for formaldehyde upgrading reaction (FUR) to produce formate at a high faradaic efficiency (>98%), without any production of CO2 or O-2. Compared to OER, the input voltages of Co3Fe3W6C-catalyzed FUR are 150 and 120 mV lower to achieve current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively, thereby facilitating a significant boost in the energy efficiency of electro chemical H-2 production from water. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the trimetallic carbide system modulates the d band of the transition-metal active sites to achieve optimal adsorption toward the selective oxidation of formaldehyde, while suppressing the further formation of CO2. Co3Fe3W6C was also found to be highly stable under considerably high-throughput electrochemical conditions in an alkaline electrolyte. This work offers a new strategy of synergizing water electrolysis with the oxidative upgrading of organic molecules to simultaneously boost the cost competitiveness of green hydrogen production and the electrochemical upgrading of organic feedstocks.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000819294100001		
J	Summers, DP								Sources and sinks for ammonia and nitrite on the early earth and the reaction of nitrite with ammonia								ORIGINS OF LIFE AND EVOLUTION OF THE BIOSPHERE				29	1			33	46		10.1023/A:1006517823004				JAN 1999	1999	An analysis of sources and sinks for ammonia and nitrite on the early Earth was conducted. Rates of formation and destruction, and steady state concentrations of both species were determined by steady state kinetics. The importance of the reaction of nitrite with ammonia on the feasibility of ammonia formation from nitrite was evaluated. The analysis considered conditions such as temperature, ferrous iron concentration, and pH. For sinks we considered the reduction of nitrite to ammonia, reaction between nitrite and ammonia, photochemical destruction of both species, and destruction at hydrothermal vents. Under most environmental conditions, the primary sink for nitrite is reduction to ammonia. The reaction between ammonia and nitrite is not an important sink for either nitrite or ammonia. Destruction at hydrothermal vents is important at acidic pH's and at low ferrous iron concentrations. Photochemical destruction, even in a worst case scenario, is unimportant under many conditions except possibly under acidic, low iron concentration, or low temperature conditions. The primary sink for ammonia is photochemical destruction in the atmosphere. Under acidic conditions, more of the ammonia is tied up as ammonium (reducing its vapor pressure and keeping it in solution) and hydrothermal destruction becomes more important.									36	1	0	0	16	1	36			0169-6149			WOS:000078979300003	10077867

The bond graph structure is used to reproduce the behavior of reversible electrochemical cells in charging conditions or in discharging conditions. The work presented here has been applied to the particular case of lead-acid battery, so widely used in the automotive industry as standard 12 V batteries and as traction batteries in electrical or hybrid vehicles.The model considers each half-cell independently. For each half-cell the main electrode reaction and the electrolysis reaction of water are considered, that will be the hydrogen evolution reaction in the negative electrode and the oxygen evolution reaction in the positive.Electrochemical principles are considered in order to consider the main phenomena that appear in the battery, like the equilibrium potential, and the overpotential, modeled by means of the activation or charge transfer and the diffusion mechanisms.Each one of this phenomena are modeled with their corresponding bond graph elements and structures, showing the correspondence between bond graph elements and its physical interpretation in this field.First, an isothermal model has been developed in order to show the behavior of the main phenomena. A more complex model has also been developed including thermal behavior. This model is very useful in the case of traction batteries in electrical and hybrid vehicles where high current intensities appear.Some simulation results are also presented in order to show the accuracy of the proposed models and the differences of behavior if thermal effects are considered.

In this study, Ni-Ni(OH)2 or/and Nikel phosphate (NiPi) nanocrystals co-catalysts were deposited on the surface of as-prepared TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs) by a simple electrodeposition route for PEC hydrogen production. The TNTAs loading with Ni and NiPi bifunctional co-catalysts exhibited remarkably enhanced PEC performance, with about an 8.3-fold increase in the photocurrent; and an 11.7-fold improvement in H2 evolution rate in comparison to bare TNTAs. The constructed ternary TNTAs/Ni-Ni(OH)2/NiPi comprised the advantage of Ni-Ni(OH)2 and NiPi nanoparticles to enhance visible-light absorption and promote oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. The internal electric field is generated between supported p-type Ni(OH)2 and n-type TiO2 under light irradiation, which will drive holes to flow to Ni(OH)2 and oxidize it as the OER active layer. Also, the photo-generated holes remaining in the TiO2 valence band can migrate to NiPi co-catalysts to cause OER. Therefore, the photogenerated electron-hole pairs can be successfully separated under the synergetic influence of Ni-Ni(OH)2 and NiPi co-catalyst, leading to a superior PEC water splitting ability.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Whereas, it is still difficult to achieve exact incorporation of Fe ion and maintain the efficient and stable catalytic surface. Bimetallic NiFe-based active sites have been constructed on the surface of LaNiO3 using a straightforward electrochemical technique that involves introducing external and trace Fe3+ ions into the electrolyte. The optimized LaNiO3 with more Ni-O bonds facilitates the adsorption of Fe3+ ions, which promotes the formation of LaNi1_xFexO3 through electrochemical activation. The synthesized LaNi(1_x)Fe(x)O(3)exhibited a synergistic impact and electron rearrangement, resulting in a boost in intrinsic activity. The OER measurements show that the overpotential of LaNi1_xFexO3 reduces to 340 mV (eta 10) and the Cdl value increases by 21 times (0.10 mF cm_2 to 2.18 mF cm_2) in the existence of external Fe3+. Notably, the dynamic equilibrium between the external Fe3+ and Fe3+ in LaNi(1_x)Fe(x)O(3)may stabilize the bimetallic NiFe-based active sites and keep the activity during the long-term OER process. The strategy of utilizing dynamic equilibrium of external ion to obtain the robust catalytic surface offers a novel approach to achieving excellent performance for OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000860703100001

Here, we constructed a threelayered double hydroxide) with an amorphous structure on a Ni foam-supported open-framework nickel phosphate nanorods array (donated as CFN@VSB-5/NF) via a hydrothermal-electrodeposition two-step process. The as-constructed CFN@VSB-5/ NF electrocatalyst merely required an overpotential of 226 mV to generate a current density of 100 mA cm-2 with a Tafel slope of 43.1 mV dec-1, which was remarkably lower than FN@VSB-5/NF (I100 = 273 mV) without the addition of Ce. Also, the CFN@VSB-5/NF could continuously catalyze for 50 h at a current density of 500 mA cm-2 without obvious potential fluctuation, presenting appealing durability at a large current density. Further investigations revealed that the superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic performance should be attributed to the high intrinsic activity, optimal surface, and electronic structure of the as-constructed CFN@VSB-5/NF catalyst. Compared with the traditional FeNi-based catalysts, moreover, the present CFN@VSB-5/NF-integrated electrocatalyst also displayed stronger OER electrocatalytic activity and excellent stability at large current densities. Markedly, this work provides a path for constructing non-noble metal electrocatalysts with high OER activity.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2574-0962			WOS:000734174600003

Two-dimensional nanosheet manganese dioxide (MnO2) arrays are promising candidates for the design and development of advanced catalysts because of their large surface area. Here, a feasible solution to improve the catalytic activity of MnO2 materials via decorating the active sites on the surface is proposed. With the help of plasma engineering, we successfully enabled surface activity of the MnO2 nanosheets by decorating P or Fe species together with rich vacancies on the surface. The decorated P (P-MnO2) or Fe (Fe-MnO2) species were highly beneficial for the absorption of protons and OH respectively, and rich oxygen vacancies induced the formation of stable Mn3+, which contributed to electron and charge transfer. Thus, increased electrochemically active specific areas, accelerated charge transfer, and a proper surface electronic structure could be achieved. On the basis of this activation strategy, the fabricated P-MnO2 and Fe-MnO2 showed excellent catalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions. To our knowledge, the performance of P-MnO2 and Fe-MnO2 outperformed most MnO2-based electrocatalysts in the field of electrocatalytic water splitting. Surface activation of two-dimensional MnO(2 )materials by decorating active species via plasma treatment can provide a feasible route for modulating the performance of earth-abundant electrocatalysts for practical applications.

As compared to excellent progress in electronic and optoelectronic applications, very few reports are available for electrocatalysis by metal-free EBPs. Herein, we couple solution-processable ultrathin EBP nanosheets with higher Fermi level of N-doped graphene (NG) into a new metal-free 2D/2D heterostructure (EBP@NG) with well-designed interfaces and unique electronic configuration, as efficient and durable bifunctional catalysts toward hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) for overall water splitting in alkaline media. By rational interface engineering, the synergy of EBP and NG is fully exploited, which not only improves the stability of EBP, but also effectively modulates electronic structures of each component to boost their intrinsic activities. Specifically, due to the lower Fermi level of EBP relative to NG, their electronic interaction induces directional interfacial electron transfer, which not only enriches the electron density over EBP and optimizes H adsorption/desorption to promote HER, but also introduces abundant positively charged carbon sites on NG and provides favorable formation of key OER intermediates (OOH*) to improve OER energetics. Thus, despite that pure EBP or NG alone has poor or negligible activity, EBP@NG achieves remarkably enhanced bifunctional HER/OER activities, along with an excellent durability. This endows an optimized electrolyzer using EBP@NG as anode and cathode with a low cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which is smaller than that of the costly integrated Pt/C@RuO2 couple (1.60 V).									167	12	0	0	6	0	169			0002-7863			WOS:000462950800024	30839207

Adams fusion method was used to prepare the IrO2-ATO catalysts. The physical and electrochemical characterisation of the catalysts were carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), powder conductivity, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and membrane electrode assembly (MEA) polarisation. The BET surface area and electronic conductivity of the supported catalysts were found to be predominantly arisen from the IrO2. Supported catalyst showed higher active surface area than the pristine IrO2 in CV analysis with 85% H3PO4 as electrolyte. The MEA performance using Nafion (R)-115 membrane at 80 degrees C and atmospheric pressure showed a better performance for IrO2 loading >= 60 wt.% than the pristine IrO2 with a normalised current density of 1625 mA cm(-2) @1.8 V for the 60% IrO2-ATO compared to 1341, mA cm(-2) for the pristine IrO2 under the same condition. The higher performance of the supported catalysts was mainly attributed to better dispersion of active IrO2 on electrochemically inactive ATO support material, forming smaller IrO2 crystallites. A 40 wt.% reduction in the IrO2 was achieved by utilising the support material. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Inorganic chemistry				61	37			14899	14907		10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c02669				2022-Sep-19	2022	Rational design of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) into ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets with controllable thickness is significantly attractive but is also a significant challenge. Herein, the authors report, for the first time, the synthesis of ultrathin 2D nickel-based MOF nanosheets with a thickness of only about 2 nm via a ligand-assisted controllable growth strategy, which cannot be acquired from the exfoliation of their bulky counterparts or the conventional hydrothermal method. The correlation between 2D nanosheets and crystal growth preference was demonstrated through a judicious choice of a specific [Ni(BIP)(p-BDC)(H2O)2]n framework (BIP = (3,5-bis(1-imidazoly)pyridine), p-H2BDC = terephthalic acid) to underlie the geometry of the resultant morphology. Under the modulation by the dosage of terephthalic acid through a corrosion-dissolution-coordination process, the nanosheets of Ni-MOFs with a controllable thickness can be tuned to 50 and 100 nm. Ultrathin 2D Ni-MOF nanosheet-derived N-doped Ni@carbon exhibits a satisfactory electrocatalytic performance with a small overpotential of 170 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2, much outperforming the bulk Ni-MOF and the most reported non-noble-metal oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts to date. It is believed that this ligand-assisted controllable growth strategy represents a novel and simple path to prepare high-performance MOF-based electrocatalysts for wide applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1520-510X		MEDLINE:36052825	36052825

Their surface oxidation is inevitable under air but is often ignored, which can be detrimental for the accurate understanding and precise design of stable carbide catalysts. Herein, molybdenum carbide nanoladders are derived via pyrolyzing MoOx/amine hybrid precursors, and two types of impact of surface oxidation on their HER performance are obvious: (1) the downshift of d-band center in Mo, and (2) the introduced steric hindrance from surface oxygen. Consequently, the negative hydrogen-binding free energy (Delta G(H*), -0.52 eV) of pristine MoC gradually increases to positive values with surface oxidation, indicating the effectively weakened strength of Mo-H. With moderate surface oxygen incorporation, a Delta G(H*) of almost 0 eV is in accordance with the efficiently promoted HER performance via a good balance of Volmer and Heyrovsky/Tafel steps in kinetics. The optimal catalyst supported on a Ti plate (1 cm(2)) gives a high hydrogen production rate of 0.35 mL min(-1) at 300 mV with high stability over the self-made water-splitting configuration. This work does not only make us reacquaint the surface oxidation of carbides on electrocatalysis but also paves the way for developing efficient and stable catalysts via surface engineering.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			2199-692X			WOS:000424107500008

To date, the most advanced method to produce green hydrogen is through water electrolysis using the residual supply of renewable energy. The current state-of-the-art catalysts used in electrolyzers are platinum-based metals and ruthenium/iridium oxides. The scarceness of these elements, combined with their high price, make these catalysts not economically viable for largescale production of hydrogen through water electrolysis. This study presents cobalt boride nanoflakes as materials to be used in both the anode and the cathode of an electrolyzer for electrochemical water splitting over a wide pH range. The cobalt boride nanoflakes were synthesized by the chemical reduction of CoCl2 using NaBH4 at three different concentrations to obtain CoB and Co2B nanoflakes. CoB nanoflakes exhibited both a higher specific surface area and greatest disparity in charge between B and Co, in comparison to Co2B. It was demonstrated that by tuning the properties of the cobalt boride nanoflakes, higher catalytic activities for both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction can be achieved, showing good overall stability.

Instead of using other hydrothermal reactions to produce Ni-Fe layered double hydroxides, we adopted a method using a simple separate nucleation and aging steps to investigate the effect of crystallinity and the intercalated anions of LDH on OER performance. We found that improving the crystallinity and the size of NiFe-LDH by increasing the aging temperature led to a decrease of OER activity. Changing the interlayer spacing of LDH from 8.04 angstrom to 7.69 angstrom by introducing more CO32 to replace NO3 causes the reduction of OER activity. These are probably attributed to the more exposed active sites, lower charger transferring resistance, and better exchange ability with OH- in interlamination. Based on the abovementioned observations and the consequent optimizations, a very-low onset overpotential (similar to 240 mV) and Tafel slope value (33.6 mV dec(-1)) (in 0.1 mol L-1 KOH) for room-temperature synthetic NiFe LDH were achieved. This work proposes a strategy for the rational design of LDHs for the further enhancement of OER electrochemical activity, i.e. by decreasing the size and crystallinity of NiFe-LDH and by introducing more NO3- between layers.									60	8	0	0	1	0	64				2046-2069		WOS:000357051100039

The interaction of alumina in ceria was used for catalyzing HER on electroless deposited Ni-P in mild steel substrate. The crystallinity, size and optical characteristics of the composite were tuned by adjusting its composition during the synthesis process. The remarkable catalytic activity of Ni-P electrode with the present composite was due to superior stoichiometry of Ce (III) ions, which has resulted in an increase in oxygen vacancy concentrations and porous nature of the electrode surface. The enhanced stability of the prepared composite was achieved by changing the lattice parameter values of CeO2 lattice by its incorporation into Al2O3 lattice. The CeO2-Al2O3 (1:1 Ce/Al) composite incorporated Ni-P exhibited a very low overpotential of 61 mV compared to that of the bare Ni-P electrode (95 mV) at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). The high electroactive surface area of the composite incorporate coating is evident from the very high doublelayer capacitance value of 3.23 x 10(-3) F than the bare Ni-P electrode (3.8256 x 10(-6) F). The modified Ni-P electrode is competent with other recently reported electrocatalysts for HER from alkaline solution.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000540239600006

Here, a highly active and durable OER electrocatalyst based on Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets decorated by Ag nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets is designed and sequentially prepared. The Ni(OH)(2)-Ag-RGO nanocomposite exhibits high activity as an OER electrocatalyst, achieving an overpotential of 292 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1) without iR-correction, and reveals a good OER property as compared with the commercial IrO2 electrocatalyst and other previously reported Ni-based OER electrocatalysts. The acceleration of electron transferring from Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets to external circuit is a result of coupling effects of Ag nanoparticles and RGO nanosheets which separately serve to increase the energy of surface Ni 3d electrons and enhance the conductivity. The above mechanism is confirmed by experimental results and computational simulation. Moreover, the generality of this strategy to similar nanostructures with enhanced OER activity is demonstrated by fabricating Co(OH)(2)-Ag-RGO and FeOOH-Ag-RGO nanocomposites.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			2574-0970			WOS:000461400500007

In this manuscript, we have highlighted our recent researches on the catalysis of cobalt-macrocycle complexes for the reduction of O-2, proton and CO2. We have successfully clarified the reaction mechanisms of catalytic O-2 reduction with cobalt phthalocyanine (Co-II(Pc)) and cobalt chlorin (Co-II(Ch)) based on detailed kinetic study under homogeneous conditions. The presence of proton-accepting moieties on these macrocyclic ligands enhances the electron-accepting ability, leading to the efficient catalytic two-electron reduction of O-2 to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with high stability and less overpotential in acidic solutions. When Co-II(Ch) is adsorbed on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and employed as an electrocatalyst, CO2 was successfully reduced to form CO with a Faradaic efficiency of 89% at an applied potential of -1.1 V vs. NHE in an aqueous solution. Finally, photocatalytic H-2 evolution was attained from ascorbic acid with Co-II(Ch) as a catalyst and [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) as a photocatalyst via a one-photon two-electron process.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1088-4246	1099-1409		WOS:000390248600008

The porosity, crystallinity, morphology, and electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite are characterized. Spatially dispersed iridium sites are thereafter installed on the defect sites presented within the entire UiO-66 crystals in these nanocomposites by a self-limiting solution-phase approach. The resulting Ir-functionalized UiO-66, CNT, and UiO-66-CNT nanocomposites are served as the electrocatalysts for water oxidation in acidic aqueous solutions. By utilizing the redox-hopping pathways to transport electrons within the Ir-functionalized MOF crystals as well as the electronic conduction between MOF crystals provided by CNT, the nanocomposite with the optimal MOF-to-CNT ratio can outperform both the Ir-functionalized UiO-66 and CNT. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is utilized to probe the reaction kinetics occurring on the decorated iridium sites and the transporting behaviors of electrons/ions within these catalytic thin films. For the first time, the electrocatalytic kinetics and the transporting limitations within the MOF-based thin film can be decoupled with the help of EIS technique. Post-electrocatalysis characterizations of the nanocomposite after water oxidation are also performed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000784802900001

In this paper, a nickel cobalt sulfoselenide/black phosphorus heterostructure (NiCoSe|S/BP) was fabricated to realize the highly active and durable water electrolysis through interface and valence dual-engineering. The NiCoSe|S/BP nanostructure was constructed by in-situ growing NiCo hydroxide nanosheet arrays on few-layer BP and subsequently one-step sulfoselenization by SeS2. Besides the conductive merit of BP substrate, holes in p-type BP are capable of oxidizing the Co2+ to high-valence and electron-accepting Co3+, benefiting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Meanwhile, Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio in the heterostructure is reduced to maintain the electrical neutrality, which corresponds to the increased electron-donating character for boosting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As for HER and OER, the heterostructured NiCoSe|S/BP electrocatalyst exhibits small overpotentials of 172 and 285 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)) in alkaline media, respectively. And overall water splitting has been achieved at a low cell potential of 1.67 V at eta(10) with high stability. Molecular sensing and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are further proposed for understanding the rate-determine steps and enhanced catalytic mechanism. The investigation presents a deep-seated perception for the electrocatalytic performance enhancement of BP-based heterostructure.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2575-0356		WOS:000775211000001

In this study, we compared two structurally equal Co2FeO4 spinels with nominally identical stoichiometry and substantially different OER activities. In particular, one of the samples, characterized by a metastable precatalyst state, was found to quickly achieve its steady-state optimum operation, while the other, which was initially closer to the ideal crystallographic spinel structure, never reached such a state and required 168 mV higher potential to achieve 1 mA/cm2. In addition, the enhanced OER activity was accompanied by a larger resistance to corrosion. More specifically, using various ex situ, quasi in situ, and operando methods, we could identify a correlation between the catalytic activity and compositional inhomogeneities resulting in an X-ray amorphous Co2+-rich minority phase linking the crystalline spinel domains in the as-prepared state. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that these Co2+-rich domains transform during OER to structurally different Co3+-rich domains. These domains appear to be crucial for enhancing OER kinetics while exhibiting distinctly different redox properties. Our work emphasizes the necessity of the operando methodology to gain fundamental insight into the activity-determining properties of OER catalysts and presents a promising catalyst concept in which a stable, crystalline structure hosts the disordered and active catalyst phase.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000823278700001	35767719

Experimental findings revealed that application of high electrodeposition current densities furnishes more rough beta-PbO(2) films. Surface characteristics were verified by SEM images and the analysis of interfacial pseudo-capacitances and morphology factor (phi). Kinetic study of the overall electrode process (O(2) + O(3)) based on the analysis of the Tafel slope revealed that the electrode morphology and electrolyte composition considerably affect the electrode kinetics. In most cases, the existence of two Tafel slopes distributed in the low and high overpotential domains was observed. Abnormal Tafel slopes (b not equal 120 mV) obtained for the primary water discharge step during water electrolysis were interpreted considering the apparent charge transfer coefficient (alpha(apa)). Optimum conditions for the ozone production were obtained for the less rough beta-PbO(2) electrode immersed in a sulfuric acid solution (1.0 mol dm(-3)) containing KPF(6) (30 x 10(-3) mol dm(-3)), where the current efficiency of 15 mass % for the ozone production was obtained.

To date, various metal-based heterogeneous catalysts have shown promising electrochemical catalytic activities for CO2 reduction, yet there have been no systematic studies of the active sites of these metal catalysts that can guide further experiments. In this study, we use first-principles calculations to identify active sites for the CO2 reduction reaction for Ag and Au metals, the two metals that have been shown to be the most active in producing CO. We compare the catalytic activity and selectivity of three reaction sites of nanoparticles, namely, low-index surfaces, edge sites, and corner sites of these metals. For nanoparticle corner sites, in particular, we find that the size effect is critical, and 309-atom (or larger) nanoparticles should be used to appropriately describe realistic metal nanocatalysts. However, a 55-atom cluster model is often used in the literature to model nanoparticles. From a comparative study, we reveal that corner sites are the most active for the CO2 reduction reaction in the case of Au, whereas edge sites are the most active in the case of Ag. Although Au is generally the more active CO2 reduction catalyst than Ag due to the intrinsically stronger binding of *C-species, our results indicate that reducing the size of Au nanoparticles up to 2 nm also increases the unwanted H-2 evolution reaction, as observed in a recent experiment. However, reducing the size of Ag nanoparticles up to 2 nm enhances the CO2 reduction reaction without suffering from the H-2 evolution reaction, and on this basis, Ag nanoparticles are a comparable or even better-performing, inexpensive catalyst than Au for electrochemical CO production. Our findings suggest that the catalyst design principle (elemental composition, morphology, and size) is metal-dependent and should be carefully tailored for each system.									336	15	0	0	19	0	340			2155-5435			WOS:000361089700015

Platinum (Pt)-based catalyst is the finest electrocatalyst for ORR in BESs; however, it is constrained by its low abundance, high price, and poor catalytic durability in an electrochemical setup for cathodic reaction kinetics. In recent years, significant efforts in trimming the metal-based catalyst up to nanoscale to cater high performance of ORR have been explored. Still, there are many opportunities to improve catalyst performance at cathode through proper selection of an efficient low-cost metal-based ORR catalyst. Molybdenum (Mo) with its multi-dimensional form as 2D and 3D layers and synergistic combination with other non-metals offers prospects of extraordinary performance as low-cost metal-based ORR catalyst over the Pt in delivering enhanced ORR potential. The present review throws light on current requirements of a sturdier catalyst material and thus provides a comprehensive review on the continuing efforts in exploring the possibility of Mo as a low-cost metal-based ORR catalyst. This literature analysis would enlighten the significance of ORR in BESs, followed by the electrochemistry of Mo-based cathodic catalyst, its underlying mechanism and performance limiting factors in the operation of ORR. Moreover, the extensive and systematic acumen in the context of Mo-based catalytic formulations for increased ORR potentials including nano-composite Mo-cathode catalyst; development of Mo-catalyst with varied configurations; carbon-supported Mo-catalyst; morphological changes; surface area modifications; and Mo-coupling with other transition metal and its derivatives were discussed in great detail to provide prospective application of Mo-based catalyst. Lastly, numerous opportunities and projections for future research in fabrication, juxtaposition, and implementation of Mo-based cathodic catalysts and consequent recommendations were discussed as conclusive remarks for bringing out the state-of-the-art review on this subject.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0161-4940	1520-5703		WOS:000734909100001

We investigated in greater detail the effect of mercury using photosystem II submembrane fractions of higher plants. Oxygen evolution was strongly inhibited and variable chlorophyll fluorescence was severely quenched by mercury. Chloride, an inorganic cofactor known to be essential for the optimal function of photosystem II, significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of mercury. However, calcium, another essential cofactor, showed no reversal capacity. It is concluded that on the donor side of PSII, mercury exerts its action by perturbing chloride binding and/or function. Considering the exceptional affinity of mercury for sulfhydryl groups of proteins, the results suggest the implication of cystein residue(s) in maintaining structural and functional integrity of photosystem II.									46	7	1	0	41	0	54			0014-5793			WOS:A1993KX62100005	8467906

This, however, has rarely been achieved due to the inherent complexity for precise surface manipulation down to molecule level. Here, we build a MoS2 di-anionic surface with controlled molecular substitution of S sites by -OH. We confirm the -OH group endows the interface with reactant dragging functionality, through forming strong non-covalent hydrogen bonding to the reactants (hydronium ions or water). The well-conditioned surface, in conjunction with activated sulfur atoms (by heteroatom metal doping) as active sites, giving rise to up-to-date the lowest over potential and highest intrinsic activity among all the MoS2 based catalysts. The di-anion surface created in this study, with atomic mixing of active sites and reactant dragging functionalities, represents a effective di-functional interface for boosted kinetic performance. H-2 energy as an alternative to fossil fuels requires cost-effective catalysts with fast kinetics for splitting water. Here, authors design MoS2 materials with di-anionic surfaces to improve the electrocatalytic H-2 evolution activities.									74	7	0	0	7	0	75			2041-1723			WOS:000518626300009	32111845

In this paper, radio frequency hydrogen plasma was employed to create surface defects on WO3 nanoparticles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis confirmed that hydrogen plasma modification increases the density of oxygen vacancies on the surface of WO3. The broadening of characteristic WO3 peaks in Raman spectra indicates the increase of oxygen vacancies by increasing voltage in hydrogen plasma treatment. The sample treated with hydrogen plasma at 20 volts shows enhancement in photocurrent density by an order of magnitude, attributable to the band-gap narrowing and subsequent increase of quantum yield in the visible range. Consistent results were also obtained from photocatalytic O-2 evolution from water oxidation.									44	1	0	0	4	0	44			2053-1591			WOS:000209665400046		
J	魏超; 徐梽川							Wei Chao; Xu Zhichuan J	The possible implications of magnetic field effect on understanding the reactant of water splitting			磁场效应对理解水分解反应物的可能意义				催化学报	Chinese Journal of Catalysis				43	1			148	157	0253-9837(2022)43:1<148:TPIOMF>2.0.TX;2-Y					2022	2022	Electrochemical water splitting consists of two elementary reactions i.e., hydrogen evolution reaction(HER) and oxygen evolution reaction(OER). Developing robust HER and OER technologies necessitates a molecular picture of reaction mechanism, yet the reactants for water splitting reactions are unfortunately not fully understood. Here we utilize magnetic field to understand proton transport in HER, and hydroxide ion transport in OER, to discuss the possible implications on understanding the reactants for HER and OER. Magnetic field is a known tool for changing the movement of charged species like ions, e.g. the magnetic-field-improved Cu~(2+) transportation near the electrode in Cu electrodeposition. However, applying a magnetic field does not affect the HER or OER rate across various pH, which challenges the traditional opinion that charged species(i.e. proton and hydroxide ion) act as the reactant. This anomalous response of HER and OER to magnetic field, and the fact that the transport of proton and hydroxide ion follow Grotthuss mechanism, collectively indicate water may act as the universal reactant for HER and OER across various pH. With the aid of magnetic field, this work serves as an understanding of water might be the reactant in HER and OER, and possibly in other electrocatalysis reactions involving protonation and deprotonation step. A model that simply focuses on the charged species but overlooking the complexity of the whole electrolyte phase where water is the dominant species, may not reasonably reflect the electrochemistry of HER and OER in aqueous electrolyte.			电催化水分解由两个基元反应构成, 即析氢反应(HER)和析氧反应(OER). 开发强大的HER和OER技术需要在分子层面理解反应机理, 然而, 目前水分解反应的反应物还没有完全确定. 本文利用磁场来研究HER中的质子传输和OER中的氢离子传输, 对确定HER和OER中真实的反应物具有重要意义. 磁场是改变离子等带电物质运动的一种有效工具, 例如,在铜电沉积中, 磁场改善了Cu~(2+)在电极附近的迁移. 然而, 施加磁场对不同pH下的HER或OER速率没有影响, 这挑战了带电物种(即质子和氢氧化离子)作为反应物的传统观点. HER和OER对磁场的这种异常反应, 以及质子和氢氧根离子的传输遵循Grotthuss机制的事实, 都表明水可能是HER和OER在不同pH值下的通用反应物. 磁场研究结果表明, 水可能是HER和OER中的反应物, 也可能是其他涉及质子化和脱质子化步骤的电催化反应中的反应物. 综上, 在复杂的电解质相模型中,只有充分考虑水的作用, 才能充分反映水电解质中HER和OER的电化学.						3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0253-9837			CSCD:7163567

An important loss process for atomic species, such as oxygen, is ionospheric photochemical escape. Dissociative recombination of O-2(+) ions (the major ion species) produces fast oxygen atoms, some of which can escape from the planet. Many theoretical hot O models have been constructed over the years, although a number of uncertainties are present in these models, particularly concerning the elastic cross sections of O atoms with CO2. Recently, the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission has been rapidly improving our understanding of the upper atmosphere and ionosphere of Mars and its interaction with the external environment (e.g., solar wind), allowing a new assessment of this important loss process. The purpose of the current paper is to take a simple analytical approach to the oxygen escape problem in order to (1) study the role that variations in solar radiation or solar wind fluxes could have on escape in a transparent fashion and (2) isolate the effects of uncertainties in oxygen cross sections on the derived oxygen escape rates. In agreement with several more elaborate numerical models, we find that the escape flux is directly proportional to the incident solar extreme ultraviolet irradiance and is inversely proportional to the backscatter elastic cross section. The amount of O lost due to ion transport in the topside ionosphere is found to be about 5-10% of the total.									31	1	0	0	0	0	31			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000395655800077

A comprehensive theoretical investigation								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				601						154225	10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.154225				NOV 1 2022	2022	By means of first-principles calculations, we systematically evaluated the possibilities of M(4)X(9)s (M = Ge, Sn; X = S, Se, Te) as the platform for photocatalytic water splitting by checking their stabilities, electronic and optical properties, carrier properties, and the free energy changes of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It was found that all the studied monolayers are stable. From the viewpoints of electronic and optical properties, the facts of suitable band gaps and band edge positions as well as good optical absorption meet with the fundamental requirements for a qualified photocatalyst toward overall water splitting. However, from the viewpoints of carrier mobility and carrier location, the electron mobilities are in moderate quantity whereas the hole mobilities are in single digits, and only Te-based materials have the feature of carrier separation, which are indicative of a low application prospect as the photocatalysts. Additionally, thermodynamic calculations clearly show that the external potential provided by the light-induced electrons and holes are insufficient to drive the HER and OER, respectively; thus, the M(4)X(9)s monolayers are not the ideal candidates for water splitting. Our results offer clear information and guidance of these novel M4X9s for the application in water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000848351700002

Characterization of the electrode reveals that it is a well-defined, compact beta-FeOOH film whose thickness, photoelectric properties, and catalytic performance are controllable by varying synthetic conditions. The direct-growth strategy is beneficial in improving its electrical conductivity compared to that of catalyst-powder-coated electrodes. The integrated electrode exhibits an onset overpotential of 383 mV toward OER and a Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1) at pH 7, which are impressive results for an iron-based catalyst. Calcination of beta-FeOOH at 650 degrees C gives alpha-Fe2O3, which allows for a direct comparison of catalysis performance between the two electrodes and for a comparison by density functional theory. The iron integrated electrode can also serve as an excellent electrode substrate for stepwise fabrication of a high-performance NiFe-based electrocatalyst for OER in alkaline media. In this line, the beta-FeOOH film electrode is first calcined at a low temperature of 215 degrees C, which produces amorphous Fe2O3. Consequently, the amorphous nature of this electrode substrate favors anodic deposition of Ni with a maximized Ni-Fe contact, resulting in a high-performance NiFe electrocatalyst.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000468368800034

Herein, we report a simple process for the synthesis of one dimensional mesoporous rod-like NiCo2O4 structure (NCO NRs) grown on reduced graphene oxide sheets (RG/NCO NCs). This noble metal free RG/NCO NCs composite manifested as the dual-functional electrode material for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and supercapacitor applications. The RG/NCO NCs shows significant OER performance with prosperous reaction kinetics with a smaller Tafel slope of 35 mV dec(-1). It requires only 313 mV overpotential to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) current density, showing superior OER activity compared to some of the state-of-art electrocatalysts under similar electrochemical conditions. Moreover, the RG/NCO NCs showed enhanced energy storage efficacy in terms of higher specific capacitance (1315 F g(-1)), long-term operational durability, higher specific energy and power output. The porous structure, higher specific surface area and better electrochemical conductivity of the RG/NCO NCs make it a suitable material for both the energy conversion and storage application. Additionally, to validate the supercapacitor performance, a prototype device in coin cell configuration has been designed and successfully tested to power a LED. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The asprepared CuCo-Nx@N-CCs composites exhibit favorable electrocatalytic activity and robust durability for oxygen reversible catalysis (ORR/OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the same low concentration alkaline electrolyte (0.1 M KOH), including EORR, 1/2 = 0.80 V, EOER, 10 = 1.58 V and EHER, 10 = -0.319 V. The nanocomposites show the superior electrocatalytic practical application in Zn-air batteries self-driven overall water splitting. Insights into the experimental analyses reveal that during the pyrolysis process, CuCo-PBA-2MI precursor captures volatile CNx active species from dicyandiamide, eventually forming high dispersed CuCo-Nx active sites with unique N-doped porous hollow carbon scaffolds structure. Such hollow nanocage structures can effectively protect the active site from agglomeration and uneven distribution. It also prevents nanomaterials corrosion from alkaline electrolyte in the electrocatalytic reaction process. We believe that this strategy will offer useful guidelines to researchers who are interested in developing advanced and performance-oriented multifunctional electrocatalysts for clean energy devices.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000720662500006

Recently, silica-based protective-layer or intermediate layer-assisted synthesis strategies have been developed to preferentially generate catalytically active Fe-N-x sites while suppressing inactive Fe clusters. However, the role of the silica layer in the formation of Fe-N-x sites remains elusive. In this study, we used X-ray absorption and Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopies to determine the evolution of the structure of Fe-based species during the silica-coating-mediated synthesis. Through X-ray absorption near-edge structure and Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy analyses, the formation of iron silicide (Fe-Si) species after silica coating was identified. Peak parameter analyses of Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy data suggested that the density of active Fe-N-x species with the Fe-N/C catalyst prepared with silica coating was twice as high as that of the Fe-N/C without silica coating. Consequently, the Fe-N/C catalyst with silica coating exhibited a kinetic current density for the ORR (0.9 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) twice as high as that without silica coating.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000662197000012

It simultaneously provides the basis for the production of value-added compounds at the anode. We investigate earth-abundant transition-metal oxide nanoparticles (Fe, Ni, Mn, Co) embedded in multiwalled carbon nanotubes as GOR catalysts. Out of the four investigated composites, the Ni-based catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic activity toward the GOR according to rotating disk electrode voltammetry, reaching a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) already at 1.31 V vs RHE, a potential below the formation of Ni3+. Chronoamperometry conducted in a flow-through cell followed by HPLC analysis is used to identify and quantify the GOR products over time, revealing that the applied potential, electrolyte concentration, and duration of the experiment impact strongly the composition of the products' mixture. Upon optimization, the GOR is directed toward oxalate production. Moreover, oxalate is not further converted and hence accumulates as a major organic product under the chosen conditions in a concentration ratio of 60:1 with acetate as a minor product after 48 h electrolysis in 7 M KOH, which represents a promising route for the synthesis of this highly valued product.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000740445700001

The impact of varying the hydrolyzing agent, urea, on the structural and morphological properties of hydrous cobalt phosphate thin films and the consequent electro-catalytic performances was studied. The morphology of hydrous cobalt phosphate thin films resembles a microflower-like structure consisting of microplates. Upon urea variation, the microplates undergo changes in thickness and width and eventually transform into microflakes. The remarkable electrocatalytic performance of hydrous cobalt phosphate thin films was observed towards the OER and they exhibit a low overpotential of 292 mV (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) current density with a Tafel slope of 98 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Also, the stability of the electrocatalyst is demonstrated by continued electrolysis, showing that the hydrous cobalt phosphate thin film electro-catalyst sustains superior long-term electrochemical stability for 10 h at 10 mA cm(-2) constant current density. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance of hydrous cobalt phosphate thin film electro-catalysts was attributed to a high ECSA (1210 cm(-2)) and low electrochemical impedance imparted by the microflower structure with microflake-like morphology.									28	0	0	0	1	0	28			1466-8033			WOS:000458828500012

However, the poor intrinsic conductivity and moderate electro-catalytic performance hinder their practical applications. Hence, various strategies have been explored and reported in addressing the issues. Herein, an elaborate approach for enhancing the ORR performance of spinel NiCo2O4 is proposed, by combining the deco-ration of NiCo2O4 nanoparticles on electrospun carbon nanofibers and defect engineering with rich oxygen vacancies on NiCo2O4 nanoparticles through a facilely controlling on calcination circumstance, which could not only increase more active sites and improve the intrinsic catalytic activity, but also render an excellent stability for long-term operation. Thus, the as-prepared hybrid exhibits significantly improved ORR electrocatalytic performance, including a high limited current density of -5.8 mA cm(-2), a positively shifting of the onset potential at 0.88 V and half-wave potential at 0.76 V (vs. RHE). performance of rechargeable Zn-air battery based on the as-prepared catalyst surpasses the one based on Pt/C catalyst significantly. This work can be also applied to other metal oxides based electrocatalysts, and then provided an avenue for the realization of metal-air batteries and fuel cells with high efficient and cost-effective.

Low temperature electrolyzer technologies are first briefly introduced and the challenges thereof are presented. The non-carbon electrocatalysts are briefly overviewed, with an emphasis on the modes of action of different active phases. The main part of the review focuses on the role of carbon-metal compound active phase interfaces with an emphasis on the synergistic and additive effects. The procedures of carbon oxidative pretreatment and an overview of metal-free carbon catalysts for OER are presented. Then, the successful synthesis protocols of composite materials are presented with a discussion on the specific catalytic activity of carbon composites with metal hydroxides/oxyhydroxides/oxides, chalcogenides, nitrides and phosphides.

Over a 3 h controlled potential coulometry (CPC) experiment, the photocurrent density recorded during OER in a nitrate electrolyte decreases to half the starting photocurrent. However, if the same electrolysis experiment is performed with a chloride electrolyte, the photocurrent density is much more stable, degrading by only 5% over the same period. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in the nitrate electrolyte exhibits a foot of the wave approximately 150 mV more positive than in the chloride electrolyte and the saturated photocurrent density is approximately 20% greater in the chloride electrolyte compared to the nitrate electrolyte. Also, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) for the OER is 87 +/- 2% in the nitrate electrolyte compared to an FE of 100% for the oxidation of the chloride electrolyte to hypochlorous acid. These results suggest that the chloride ion rapidly injects electrons into the photogenerated holes in the HxWO3 valence before these holes destructively recombine with W5+ electron donors. The result is an increase in HxWO3 stability during photoelectrochemical chloride oxidation when compared to water oxidation. FeOOH electrocatalysts are known to efficiently remove holes from photoresponsive metal oxides, and FeOOH was deposited on HxWO3. The HxWO3 vertical bar FeOOH material also exhibits a negligible loss of photocurrent during OER and chloride oxidation, supporting this hypothesis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000647271300008

Self-Assembled Monolayer Stabilized Gold-Vanadate Nanoflute for Water Splitting Reactions								CHEMISTRYSELECT				4	24			7042	7050		10.1002/slct.201901715				JUN 28 2019	2019	Vanadium oxide (VOx) decorated with gold-nanoparticles via self-assembled monolayer approach is herein reported to be an efficient electrocatalyst for both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER) in alkali medium. The voids created in the nanoflute of gold-vanadate were believed to be responsible for high mass transfer allowing the material to be highly applicable as a catalyst for water splitting and nitro-arene reduction. The nanoflute exhibited high current density with low onset potential value in both OER and HER. The overpotential value at 10 mAcm(-2) was observed to be 310 mV with onset potential of 1.43 V in case of OER while the overpotential value for HER was measured to be 282 mV. The nanocatalyst was found to be stable upto 10 h with minimal increment in the overpotential value. The Tafel plot value of 127 mVdec(-1) in OER and 131 mVdec(-1) in HER also signified for the high efficacy of the catalyst towards splitting of water molecules under high basic condition. The same material was also used as catalyst for reduction of various nitro-arenes in isopropanol with 0.25 M KOH. The liberation of hydrogen via the oxidation of isopropanol was supposed to be responsible for reduction of nitro-arenes. The ability of the catalyst to oxidize isopropanol was substantiated from electrochemical studies.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2365-6549			WOS:000473201200002

However, the stability of these surface terminations has not been thoroughly explored. In this work, the stability of the alpha-SnWO4(010) surface termination was studied using a thermodynamic analysis based on density functional theory (DFT). Under appropriate thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, it is possible to stabilize the O-W, O-Sn, R-OOSn and ST3 terminations of the alpha-SnWO4(010) surface. The electronic structures of these three potential stable surface terminations are also calculated using a Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional to determine the conceivable bandgap values. It is found that there are numerous surface states in the bandgap of these terminations. This is due to the evident reconstruction of these terminations after geometry optimization. In addition, work functions are substantially different for possible surface terminations. The results suggest that Z-scheme heterostructures based on SnWO4 can be regulated by securing the thermodynamically favorable surface terminations under suitable physical/chemical conditions. At last, O-Sn termination exhibits a low overpotential value of 0.51 V, showing remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance among all stable surface terminations considered in this work. Our study may help explore the intrinsic surface properties of SnWO4, which will be a viable strategy for developing SnWO4-based photocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000835928500001	35920205

Designing and developing earth-abundant, low-cost, and highly efficient electrocatalysts is crucial for commercializing water splitting technology. In the last couple of years, various nanostructure electrocatalysts have been reviewed. However, most catalysts go through fewer active sites, instability, and other deficiencies. For enhancing the activity, various emerging strategies, such as decreasing the layer thickness, creating crystal defects, forming the composite, doping heteroatoms, and so on, have been developed. Therefore, it is highly demanding to summarize the existing data, which could afford a conclusive track for the thriving research of electrocatalysts toward water splitting. Instead of focusing on a special strategy for improving the catalytic activity, we present a relatively comprehensive review of the recent research progress on various emerging strategies. We have systematically discussed the fundamental science regarding water splitting and different electrochemical parameters for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The computational and experimental approaches for the recent advancement of catalytic activity developed in the current year have been discussed and investigated. Finally, the outlook of the water-splitting technology has been summarized. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2468-6069			WOS:000737249900003

The growth process of (PEI/P5W30-GO)(n) multilayer films was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The atomic force microscopy images clearly showed the morphology of single-sheet GO in multilayer films. The UV-light irradiation of multilayers afforded reduced graphene oxide (RGO) in the multilayers. The changes in composition of C is in GO, W 4f in P5W30, and N 1s in PEI were detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A possible photoreduction mechanism of GO was proposed. The electrochemical behavior of (PEI/P5W30-RGO)(n) multilayers modified on a glassy carbon electrode at room temperature and their electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were investigated. At a potential of -0.6 V, the multilayers clearly exhibited electrocatalytic activity for ORR via almost a four-electron reduction pathway to H2O. A remarkable electrocatalytic HER could be detected on the (PEI/P5W30-RGO)(n) multilayer, whereas the (PEI/P5W30-GO)(n) multilayer did not show any HER signal in the same potential range. This study investigated and extended the application of POTs/G nanocomposites to the electrocatalysis of ORR and HER.									33	2	0	0	0	0	34			1932-7447			WOS:000338693600032

Based on measurements of light-induced absorption changes and quasielastic neutron scattering in combination with mechanistic considerations, evidence is presented for the protein acting as a functionally active constituent of the water cleavage machinery, in particular, for directed local proton transfer. A specific flexibility emerging above a threshold of about 230 K is an indispensable prerequisite for oxygen evolution and plastoquinol formation.

B	Raissi, A.T.; Cunping Huang; Liqun Mao; Muradov, N.						Jena, P.; Kandalam, A.; Qiang Sun		New solar metal sulfate ammonia based thermochemical water splitting cycle for the production of hydrogen								Proceedings of the International Symposium on Materials Issues in a Hydrogen Economy								15	45						2007	2007	All sulfur-family thermochemical water splitting cycles (TCWSCs) rely on concentration and decomposition of sulfuric acid for the oxygen evolution step of the cycle. The sulfuric acid decomposition step presents serious materials and catalyst deactivation challenges. Platinum based catalysts are currently the most active for the H2SO4 decomposition, but they deactivate rapidly. To overcome this difficulty metal sulfate based TCWSCs have been developed. However, the metal sulfate based TCWSCs utilize thermal heat input thus degrading photonic energy. Based upon FSEC's S-NH3 TCWSC, a new family of hybrid photo/thermo-chemical water splitting cycles is introduced in this paper that employs the quantum portion of the solar spectrum for the production of hydrogen and the thermal energy (i.e. IR) portion of solar radiation for generating oxygen. FSEC's metal sulfate ammonia (MSO4-NH3) hybrid photo/thermochemical water splitting cycles are represented by the following reactions: SO2(g) + 2NH3(g) + H2O(I) rarr (NH4)2SO3(aq) (chemical absorption) 25degC (NH4)2SO3(aq) + H2O rarr (NH4)2SO4(aq) + H2(g) (solar photocatalytic) 80degC x(NH4)2SO4 + M2Ox rarr 2xNH3 + M2(SO4)x + xH2O (solar thermocatalytic) 500degC M2(SO4)x(s) rarr xSO2(g) + 2MO(s) + (x-1)O2(g) (solar thermocatalytic) 1 100degC Where, M = Zn, Mg, Ca, Ba, Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu. Chemical equilibrium calculations for the reaction between ZnO and (NH4)2SO4 indicate that both ZnSO4 and ZnO.2ZnSO4 can form as the stable reaction products. A series of thermogravimetric/ differential thermal analyses/mass spectrometric (TG/DTA/MS) experiments has been carried out to determine the exact nature of all ZnO + (NH4)2SO4 reaction products. Results obtained to date are presented and discussed.

Compared to bare cobalt hexacyanoferrate with higher onset overpotential of 296 mV vs. RHE, a larger Tafel slope of 107.27 mV dec(-1) and higher overpotential of 411 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, the optimized cobalt hexacyanoferrate/carbon nanotubes hybrid exhibits a much lower Tafel slope of 62.43 mV dec(-1) and smaller onset overpotential of 152 mV, and its overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) is only 274 mV. Most importantly, at a fixed overpotential of 400 mV, cobalt hexacyanoferrate/carbon nanotubes hybrid with 20 mg carbon nanotubes delivers a large current density of 95.02 mA cm(-2), which is over ten times than that of bare cobalt hexacyanoferrate (8.52 mA cm(-2)). The dramatically enhanced OER performances are mainly assigned to the unique globular clusters-like structure and the good synergistic effect between cobalt hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles and highly conductive carbon nanotubes skeleton, leading to producing the higher electrochemical active surface area and much lower impedance. This work provides a simple strategy to rationally design and synthesize transition metal hexacyanoferrate-based catalysts as highly efficient nonprecious electrocatalysts for OER.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000480664400018

The reaction probability dependence with collision energy, the weighed partial wave contributions to the integral cross sections, and the integral cross sections of the exchange reaction H + OH+ in the collision energy range of 0.0-1.0 eV with reactant OH+ in the rotational state j(i) = 0 and vibrational states v(i) = 0-4 are calculated. The calculated time evolution of CS probability density distribution in logarithmic scales at total angular momentum J = 0 clearly indicates that the convex structure in the reaction path of the exchange H + OH+ reaction has significant influence on the dynamics of title reaction.

The results showed that i) oxidative pre-treatment (O-2) leads to larger Au nanoparticles than reductive pre-treatment (CO), that ii) Au is predominantly metallic during CO oxidation, irrespective of the preceding pre-treatment, and that iii) there is a reaction induced Au particle growth. Correlations with the activity of the respective catalysts and its temporal evolution give insights into the origin of deactivation of these catalysts under reaction conditions, in particular on reaction induced changes in the Au particle size.					16th International Conference on X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS)16th International Conference on X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS)	AUG 23-28, 2015AUG 23-28, 2015		Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Karlsruhe, GERMANYKarlsruhe Inst Technol, Karlsruhe, GERMANY	10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1742-6588		*****************	WOS:000383249000045

Yet, the poor interface and coating quality of the catalyst overlayer often plagues the performance enhancement due to the interference of hole/electron transport across the photoanode/catalyst interface. Here we address these challenges using a citrate-assisted method that allows conformal deposition of Ni-Fe hydroxide [NiFe(OH)(x)] overlayers on hematite nanowire photoanodes. These NiFe(OH)(x) overlayers significantly enhance the surface hole transfer kinetics and passivates the surface states. The NiFe(OH)(x)-encapsulated hematite nanowires exhibit an early turn-on potential of 0.53 V vs RHE. The findings highlight not only the importance of uniform OER catalyst coating but also the critical role of molecular linkers in boosting the performance of photoanodes.									52	3	0	0	3	0	52			2380-8195			WOS:000480672800024

In this study, we demonstrate that [Dema-H](+) [TfO](-) can be used as an electrolyte for intermediate temperature water electrolysis. The cyclic voltammograms of [Dema-H](+) [TfO](- )on Pt show a potential window of 2.5 V which is beyond water decomposition potential of 1.23 V. Two hydrogen evolution reactions are observed on Pt electrode in both "as prepared" [Dema-H](+) [TfO](-) and 10% [Dema-H](+) [TfO](-) in water. The first HER involving H3O+ had a peak potential at -0.255 V (vs SHE with limiting current density of 0.016 mA/cm(2) assigned to Pt low surface coverage/adsorption of H+/H3O+. The second HER involving [Dema-H] + had an on-set at -0.475 V vs SHE and did not show limiting current up to 0.1 mA cm(-2) (-0.8 V vs. SHE). Second observed HER is believed to be due to reduction of two [Dema-H] + to produce H-2 and diethyl methyl amine [Dema]. The latter is reoxidised at anode to reproduce [Dema-H](+). In-situ mass spectrometric analysis confirmed H-2/O-2 evolution at both potentials. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on IrO2 in 10% [Dema-H](+) [TfO](-) also shows two onset potentials.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000510947000062

The edge-to-edge assembly of ultrafine NiFe-LDH directed by graphite-like carbon is performed through a one-step hydrothermal process to form self-supporting nanosheet arrays (named NiFe-LDH/C), in which ascorbic acid is employed as the carbon precursor to control both the platelet size and the assembly mode of NiFe-LDH. Benefiting from the unique structural engineering, NiFe-LDH/C can not only achieve a fast surface reconstruction into the highly active gamma-phase structure, but also exposes abundant active edge sites, thus leading to a superior OER performance with the overpotential as low as 234 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the unsaturated Fe-sites and the bridge-sites connecting Ni and Fe atoms, which only exist on the edge planes of NiFe-LDH, are the main active centers responsible for promoting the intrinsic OER activity. This work provides a specific and valuable reference for the rational design of high-quality electrocatalysts through structural engineering for renewable energy applications.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000705987800001	34636152

The alloys were deposited under potentiostatic conditions within potential range from -0.7 to -1.1 V in electrolytes of pH 9.5, containing ammonia complexes of cobalt(III) and palladium(II), [Co(NH3)(6)](3+) and [Pd(NH3)(4)](2+), of different concentration ratio. Structural changes in electrodeposited alloys were discussed based on results of X-ray diffraction measurements. An elemental analysis was performed using the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy technique. Finally, based on results of galvanostatic measurements, the Tafel slope within the range of activation control for hydrogen evolution reaction was determined and mechanism of the process was discussed. The alloys presented low Tafel slope value, from 25.4 to 88.7 mV dec(-1). The alloy of the highest activity for hydrogen evolution reaction contained 31.2 at.% of Pd.									32	1	0	0	1	0	32			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000329325100009

The transition metal mixed oxide based HER electrocatalyst are promising candidates for hydrogen generation in renewable energy field due to their low-cost nature, ease of commercialization and green nature. Herein, graphene oxide supported MnO2-TiO2 nanourchins synthesized by thermal decomposition technique was incorporated to bimetallic phosphide ENCP coatings by electroless plating technique. During alkaline hydrogen evolution, the incorporation of composite onto bimetallic phosphide causes a drastic decreases in overpotential value to 190 mV dec(-1) and respective Tafel slope value to 45 mV dec(-1). The studies reveals that the modified electrode follows Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. The lower Rct of 140.8 Omega and a high C-dl value obtained from Nyquist plot of modified electrodes ensures the fastest electron transfer kinetics and confirms its more facile electrocatalytic nature towards hydrogen evolution. Also, a high value for exchange current density of modified electrode authenticate its superior HER performance. The modified electrodes was durable, long term stable, economically viable and performance was consistent over a wide span of time during alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. The enhanced performance of modified electrode can be ascribed to the intermetallic synergetic effect arises within ENCP matrix and MnO2-TiO2 nanourchins. These conclusions lead to innovative insights on future perspective for the development and tuning of novel electrocatalysts with enhanced electrochemical performance for hydrogen evolution reaction.

A phthalocyanine-like ligand supported on carbon black serves as the nitrogen source and carbon support, respectively, for the catalysts. The as-prepared materials are thermally activated by pyrolysis at temperatures ranging from 600 degrees C to 1000 degrees C. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability in 0.1 M KOH are tested by rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) experiments. Several of the catalysts show ORR activities in the RRDE experiment that are superior to Pt, with Co, Co/Fe and Ag/Co being the best. All catalysts show remarkable stability, even when they are tested under air for 5000 RRDE cycles. RRDE experiments are also used to study the effect of catalyst loading and to determine reaction order. A thorough study of the catalyst performance in a single cell fuel cell test is conducted; exploring different methods to prepare the electrodes and the effects of catalyst loading, the catalyst-to-binder ratio and the removal of excess metal on the cell performance. Different methods of preparation of membrane electrode assemblies are also studied.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000438001800016

With in situ photogenerated [Ru(bpy)(3)](3+) (bpy=2,2'-bipyridine) as the oxidant, quite high catalytic turnover number (TON; 313), turnover frequency (TOF; 3.2 s(-1)), and quantum yield (Phi(QY); 27%) for oxygen evolution at pH 9.0 were acquired. Comparison experiments with its structural analogues, namely [Ni(H2O)(2)(gamma-SiW10O35)(2)](10-) (POM-2) and [Mn(H2O)(2)(gamma-SiW10O35)(2)](10-) (POM-3), gave the conclusion that the cobalt center in POM-1 is the active site. The hydrolytic stability of the title polyoxometalate (POM) was confirmed by extensive experiments, including UV/Vis spectroscopy, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and cathodic adsorption stripping analysis (CASA). As the [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+)/visible light/sodium persulfate system was introduced, a POM-photosensitizer complex formed within minutes before visible-light irradiation. It was demonstrated that this complex functioned as the active species, which remained intact after the oxygen-evolution reaction. Multiple experimental parameters were investigated and the catalytic activity was also compared with the well-studied POM-based water-oxidation catalysts (i.e., [Co-4(H2O)(2)(alpha-PW9O34)(2)](10-) (Co-4-POM) and [(CoCoII)-Co-III(H2O)W11O39](7-) (Co-2-POM)) under optimum conditions.									34	5	0	0	2	0	34			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000344332200026	25145473

However, achieving a well-defined interface between low-dimensional semiconductors and co-catalysts is challenging due to difficulties in depositing a uniform co-catalyst layer and attaining mixed and disordered states. CaMn2O4 center dot xH(2)O has been extensively studied for the purpose of decreasing the overpotential in the oxygen evolution reaction. In this study, CaMn2O4 center dot xH(2)O was synthesized via a hydrothermal method, and loaded onto a GaN nanowire (NW) photoanode. Optimized CaMn2O4 center dot xH(2)O layers were decorated on GaN NWs to create CaMn2O4@GaN, which delivered a maximum photocurrent of 0.4 mA/cm(2) at 0 V vs. the Ag/AgCl reference electrode under an AM 1.5 G solar simulator, 1.6-fold higher than that (0.25 mA/cm(2)) of bare GaN NWs. Thus, highly efficient and stable PEC water splitting was achieved on the GaN NW photoanode.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0253-2964	1229-5949		WOS:000650469900001

The assembly of low density, porous, versatile, robust and submissive copper nickel hybrid nanostructure fabricated via reduction method for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and high performance supercapacitor applications is presented. Copper and nickel-based alloy coated on fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) with composition CuNi/FTO employed for electrochemical test recorded reduced overpotential of 294 mV to get current density of 10 mA cm-2, high electrochemical surface area (0.087 cm2), low Tafel slope 92 mV dec- 1 and high specific capacitance (726 mF g-1) at current density of 6 A g-1. The synthesized nanostructured material maintains promising electrical linkage due to large number of catalytic sites with large surface area (130 cm2 g-1). First principle calculations are also performed to examine effect of Cu and Ni vacancy defects on thermodynamic stability and OER of CuNi alloy. Theoretical calculations showed that CuNi alloy with less Cu content provide easier diffusion path owing to its less defect formation energy.

Compared to single metal-based electrocatalyst, multi metal-based electrocatalyst offers more active sites, high surface area, and distinctive nanostructure for effective water oxidation. In this work, nickel and cobalt co-doped MnCO3 was successfully synthesized via a facile co -precipitation technique. Rhombohedral crystal phase of MnCO3 nanostructures and its crystallite sizes were thoroughly analyzed by the XRD spectra. Incorporation of doping element such as Ni and Co in MnCO3 nanostructures exhibited two different morphologies which enhanced the catalytic performance of the prepared samples. Large surface area and porosity of the nanomaterials improved the stability and activity of the prepared MnCO3 nanostructures. EDX analysis confirmed Mn, C, O, Ni and Co elements in stoichometric ratio. Moreover, the specific capacitance of (Ni, Co) co-doped MnCO3 nanostructures attained 581 F/g while the other electrodes attained only 207, 332 and 175 F/g respectively. A small Tafel slope with low overpotential of Ni, Co co-doped MnCO3 nanostructures was & nbsp;20.2 mV/dec and 293 mV respectively. Therefore, the prepared electrocatalysts of Ni, Co co -doped MnCO3 nanostructure is one of the attractive anode material for high performance energy conversion applications.

In acidic media, noble metals are commonly used as electrocatalysts, whereas in alkaline media, non-noble metals are used. However, due to the high cost and rarity of noble metals, as well as the low activity and stability of non-noble metals, industrial uses are severely constrained. Heterostructures are a possible alternative to costly electrocatalysts because of their tunable properties. The origin of activity and stability of heterostructures lies in the coupling between their constituent components. Thus, the establishment of interfacial component coupling effects such as the Mott-Schottky effect, the Strong-Metal-Support-Interaction effect, the support-stabilizing effect, and the synergistic effect is a promising technique for enhancing activity and stability. However, a lack of the generation rules for the interfacial coupling effects impedes their widespread application for the rational design. This review summarizes the progress made towards heterostructure design from the interfacial component coupling effects with respect to the various components. The challenges and future prospective have also been presented for the heterostructure electrocatalyst design. The findings reported in this review pave a way for the heterostructure electrocatalyst design for water splitting as well as other electrocatalytic processes such as oxygen reduction, CO2 reduction, nitrogen reduction reactions, etc.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000863316800004

However, the development of a low-cost and easy-to-prepare OER electrocatalyst with glorious performance and superior stability remains a huge challenge. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted tremendous interest owing to their charming features including ultrafine porosity, rich active metal sites and tunable structures. However, most MOFs directly acting as electrocatalysts for the OER have intrinsic low electrical conductivity, poor electrochemical activities and short-term durability, hindering their practical application. Herein, we develop a facile and effective one-pot solvothermal method to rationally design a new S-doped Fe-based organic framework grown on nickel foam (NF), which prominently boosts the OER performance. Specifically, S-0.05-Fe-BTB/NF exhibits remarkable OER activity with an ultralow overpotential of only 231 mV to afford 20 mA cm(-2) current density without iR drop compensation in alkaline media, as well as a small Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1), superior to that of the commercial RuO2 electrocatalyst. Particularly, it also demonstrates outstanding catalytic durability under an overpotential of 235 mV for 50 h. More significantly, the probable active species during the OER process are determined to be the electrochemically transformed metal oxyhydroxide.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000838181700001

Perovskite oxides have received great attention as a prospective type of noble-metal-free candidates for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode, because of the intrinsic activity, distinctive physicochemical properties, and abundant compositions. In addition to the conventional metal element doping approach, non-metal element doping is a significant avenue to strikingly enhance the electrochemical performance of perovskite oxides. Herein, nitrogen-doped Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-delta (SFMON), synthesized by ammonolysis of Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-delta (SFMO), is exploited as an outstanding electrocatalyst toward catalyzing HER in alkaline media. With the partial substitution of O by N, the increased contents of oxygen vacancy and high-valence Fe in the SFMON are considered to be favorable for enhancing the HER performance. As such, the overpotential of the optimized SFMON-450 is approximately 149 mV less than that of the parent SFMO at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), along with higher mass/specific activity, faster HER kinetics, and increased electrochemical active area. More importantly, the constant hydrogen production prolongs to 40 h at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2), much superior to the benchmark Pt/C catalyst, making the SFMON a potential cathode material for water electrolysis devices.

Local structure around doped Ni atoms was characterized by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) functions obtained from X-ray absorption spectra acquired at Ni-K edge (8333eV). It was found that Ni ions are confined to the Ru site in the RuO2 rutile-type crystal structure, and Ni atoms tend to group by entering neighbouring sites along the body diagonal of rutile lattice. Such a neighbourhood of two Ni atoms may act as an active site for oxygen evolution by promoting simultaneous two electron transfer from the absorbed molecule of water. The refined Ni-O bond distances suggest that oxidation state of Ni ions is between +2 and +3.					14th International Conference on X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS14)14th International Conference on X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS14)	JUL 26-31, 2009JUL 26-31, 2009		Camerino, ITALYCamerino, ITALY	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1742-6588	1742-6596	*****************	WOS:000275152100167

Tetragonal A-site cation ordered layered LaBaCo2O5+ double perovskite was obtained by annealing cubic A-site cation disordered La0.5Ba0.5CoO3- perovskite at 1100 degrees C in N-2. High temperature X-ray diffraction between room temperature (RT) and 800 degrees C revealed that LaBaCo2O5+ remains tetragonal during heating in oxidizing atmosphere, but goes through two phase transitions in N-2 and between 450 degrees C and 675 degrees C from tetragonal P4/mmm to orthorhombic Pmmm and back to P4/mmm due to oxygen vacancy ordering followed by disordering of the oxygen vacancies. An anisotropic chemical and thermal expansion of LaBaCo2O5+ was demonstrated. La0.5Ba0.5CoO3- remained cubic at the studied temperature irrespective of partial pressure of oxygen. LaBaCo2O5+ is metastable with respect to La0.5Ba0.5CoO3- at oxidizing conditions inferred from the thermal evolution of the oxygen deficiency and oxidation state of Co in the two materials. The oxidation state of Co is higher in La0.5Ba0.5CoO3- resulting in a higher electrical conductivity relative to LaBaCo2O5+. The conductivity in both materials was reduced with decreasing partial pressure of oxygen pointing to a p-type semiconducting behavior.									40	0	0	0	1	0	40			1996-1944			WOS:000373805400085

In this work, hydrothermal pretreatment of waste cotton textiles was conducted at 240 degrees C-340 degrees C to obtain bio-crude oil and biochar. The hydrothermal pretreatment at 320 degrees C for 60 min yielded the highest bio-crude oil of 23.3%, in which ketones, diverse oxygen-containing functional group compounds, alcohols, furans, phenols, esters, carboxylic acids, ethers, nitrogen compounds, hydrocarbons and aldehydes were main compounds. Carbon-rich (as high as 76.86%) biochar with low oxygen shows high heating value as high as 30.505 MJ/kg, and lower atomic H/C and O/C ratios, which could be used as alternative solid biofuel. To broaden the utilization of biochar, it was further characterized by SEM, Raman spectra, and XRD. The biochar was the first time to use as electrocatalytic material. It significantly reduced both the overpotential (eta 10) from 403.6 mV to 247.6 mV and the Tafel slope from 192.5 mV dec-1 to 120.8 mV dec-1. It could speed up charge transfer rate and made H2 release facilely to promote the hydrogen evolution reaction activity with good stability. These results evidence the feasibility of converting waste cotton textiles to high-quality biofuels or even electrocatalytic carbon material via hydrothermal treatment.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000747392900005

Herein, we reported a continuous molybdenum sulfide-carbide heterostructure-based nanosheets incorporated with ruthenium atoms (2.02 at%) and shelled over high-conductive 1D titanium nitride nanorod arrays (Ru-MoS2-Mo2C/TiN) to form a 3D hierarchical porous material via an effective synthesis strategy. The material with fine-tuned electronic structure and multi-integrated active sites exhibited small overpotentials of 25 and 280 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH medium, respectively. An electrolyzer delivered from Ru-MoS2-Mo2C/TiN required an operating voltage of only 1.49 V at 10 mA cm(-2), surpassing that of a commercial catalyst-based system as well as earlier reports. The good performance was identified by its enlarged electroactive surface area and superior charge-transfer ability. In addition, theoretical calculations further showed its reasonable density of states near the Fermi level together with optimum adsorption free energy for reactants. The result indicated that the Ru-MoS2-Mo2C/TiN on CC is an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting.									27	1	0	0	0	0	26			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000704378200001

We determine the conditions for the existence of the various types of MHD reaction fronts and the character of the changes in physical quantities across these reaction fronts. The analysis is carried out in general for a perfect gas equation of state and a constant energy release, and then extended to thermonuclear reaction fronts in degenerate carbon oxygen mixtures and degenerate helium in conditions typical of Type Ia supernova explosions. We find that as unburned matter enters perpendicular to a reaction front, the release of energy through burning generates shear velocity in the reacting gas that, depending on the type of reaction front, strengthens or weakens the magnetic field. In addition, we find that the steady-state propagation of a reaction front is impossible for certain ranges of magnetic field direction. Our results provide insight into the phenomena of MHD thermonuclear combustion that is relevant to the interpretation of future simulations of SN Ia explosions that have magnetic fields systematically incorporated.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000342581200087

Herein, it is demonstrated that (TiO2(B) nanosheet)/(metallic phase MoS2) hybrid nanostructures have high activity for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water. The TiO2(B) nanosheets are prepared by solvothermal reaction with TiCl3 as a precursor in the presence of ethylene glycol. Due to the short transportation distance of charge carriers, more negative conduction band edge, and the existence of oxygen vacancy, the photocatalytic activity of the pure TiO2(B) nanosheets is one order of the magnitude larger than that of the commercial P25. After loading metallic phase MoS2, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2(B) is further improved by approximate to 13 times to 1444 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) because of the superior activity of metallic phase MoS2 for hydrogen evolution. The findings provide a cost-effective and highly active photocatalyst for hydrogen production from water and are very helpful for the development of sustainable and clean hydrogen energy.									14	2	0	0	1	0	14			2367-198X			WOS:000485117000001

The procedure yields a highly efficient, durable, and flexible bifunctional catalyst for water splitting. The material exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance with high stability in both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, owing to the enhanced activity resulting from the incorporation of a small amount of Ru into anodic Ni-Fe oxide and a change in morphology that facilitates mass transfer. A stable cell voltage of 1.83 V is achieved at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in a symmetric electrolyzer composed of flexible Ru-doped Ni-Fe oxide electrodes that can be formed into various shapes. The applicability of bifunctional electrodes of various shapes is demonstrated by their excellent stability for 100 h.									10	1	0	0	2	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000646734800001

The effect of adding Ti, V, Cu, Zn, and/or Mo into a baseline quinary-metal HEG, consisting of Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni, on the electrocatalytic performance is investigated. The quinary-metal HEG shows an overpotential of 307 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) (eta(50)). We demonstrate that the catalytic activity can only be enhanced via doping with desired metals. The additions of Ti, V, and Zn lead to enhanced electrocatalytic performances, exhibiting eta(50 )also of 254, 283, and 289 mV, respectively. The co-doping of Ti and Zn into the quinary-metal HEG results in a synergistic effect, giving robust catalytic activity with an ultra-low overpotential of 251 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 42.3 mV dec(-1), and durable stability in 1 M KOH electrolyte for 60 h at different current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) . Also, phase transformation of the metal glycerate into metal (oxy)hydroxide during OER is investigated using various in situ and ex-situ analyses. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation validates the synergistic effect of addition of Ti and Zn in HEG system.

Whereas RuO2 is typically considered to be non-magnetic (NM), it has recently been established as being anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) at room temperature. The presence of magnetic moments on the Ru atoms signals an electronic configuration that is markedly different from what is commonly assumed, the effect of which on the OER is unknown. We use density functional theory (DFT) calculations within the DFT+U approach to model the OER process on NM and AFM RuO2(110) surfaces. In addition, we model the thermodynamic stability of possible O versus OH terminations of the RuO2(110) surface and their effect on the free energies of the OER steps. We find that the AFM RuO2(110) surface gives a consistently low overpotential in the range 0.4-0.5 V, irrespective of the O versus OH coverage, with the exception of a 100% OH-covered surface, which is, however, unlikely to be present under typical OER conditions. In contrast, the NM RuO2(110) surface gives a significantly higher overpotential of, similar to 0.7 V for mixed O/OH terminations. We conclude that the magnetic moment of RuO2 supplies an important contribution to obtaining a low overpotential and to its insensitivity to the exact O versus OH coverage of the (110) surface.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000744533300001

On Trapped Modes in Variable White Dwarfs as Probes of the C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 Reaction Rate								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				935	1					21	10.3847/1538-4357/ac7ec3				AUG 1 2022	2022	We seek signatures of the current experimental C-12 (alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction rate probability distribution function in the pulsation periods of carbon-oxygen white dwarf (WD) models. We find that adiabatic g-modes trapped by the interior carbon-rich layer offer potentially useful signatures of this reaction rate probability distribution function. Probing the carbon-rich region is relevant because it forms during the evolution of low-mass stars under radiative helium-burning conditions, mitigating the impact of convective mixing processes. We make direct quantitative connections between the pulsation periods of the identified trapped g-modes in variable WD models and the current experimental C-12 (alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction rate probability distribution function. We find an average spread in relative period shifts of Delta P / P similar or equal to +/- 2% for the identified trapped g-modes over the +/- 3 sigma uncertainty in the C-12 (alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction rate probability distribution function-across the effective temperature range of observed DAV and DBV WDs and for different WD masses, helium shell masses, and hydrogen shell masses. The g-mode pulsation periods of observed WDs are typically ,given to six to seven significant figures of precision. This suggests that an astrophysical constraint on the C-12 (alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction rate could, in principle, be extractable from the period spectrum of observed variable WDs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000838333500001

As for HER, the introduction of sulfur in Ni sulfoselenide not only increases the electrochemical active area, but also improves the water adsorption ability and provides an optimal adsorption site for hydrogen atom. As for UOR, the in-situ formed amorphous oxyhydroxide is believed as the real active species. The electrolyzer assembled by Ni sulfoselenide electrodes shows a low voltage of 1.47 at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH + 0.5 M urea, which is much lower than that required for overall water splitting. The present work demonstrates an effective bifunctional electrode for HER and UOR that can be used to produce hydrogen and remove pollutant (urea) in water at the same time.									37	1	0	0	2	0	38			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000620327600001

Increasing the fraction of H-2 generated by such environmentally friendly routes requires, however, further progress in electrode design to overcome the limited stability and activity of earth-abundant electrocatalysts. Herein, we report the multiscale engineering of the properties of Co3O4 electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), revealing insights into the close interplay between activity and stability. The surface chemistry and physical properties of Co3O4 electrodes such as Co2+/Co3+ ratio, fractal features, and electron conductivity are modulated by a highly scalable one-step hot-aerosol synthesis. Optimized Co3O4 electrodes are obtained with a high mass-specific current density for OER of 642 A g(-1) at 400 mV overpotential, which can be boosted to 1947 A g(-1) at industrially-relevant elevated electrolyte temperature of 80 degrees C. Through operando Raman measurements, we reveal the in situ transformation of the as-synthesized cobalt oxide moieties to oxyhydroxide species, identifying their role as catalytic active sites for OER. The potential of these earth-abundant electrocatalysts and their scalable preparation approach are demonstrated with a custom-designed electrolyzer, achieving a very high mass-specific current density of 800 A g(-1) at 400 mV overpotential and more than 12 h stable operation.									13	0	0	0	0	0	12			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729165000006

We report a scalable binder-free OER electrode with open hollow nanocubes of Ni-doped CuOx on Ni foam (hNC/NF) through spontaneous galvanic displacement followed by simple electrochemical oxidation. Face-selective etching for the unique structure of hollow nanocubes with large open ends is achieved by utilizing the different accessibility of the top and side faces of cubes to solution species, more specifically the depletion of reactants between the densely supported nanocubes. Besides, the in situ deposition on Ni foam allows spontaneous Ni doping, which, as revealed by DFT calculations, fortunately strengthens the adsorption of oxygenated intermediates and therefore could optimize the free energy path of OER on Cu oxides. Benefiting further from the high accessible surface area of the unique open hollow architecture, the hNC/NF exhibits an outstanding OER activity with a small overpotential (eta = 305 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) as well as excellent stability without significant decay after 120 h operation. To our knowledge, this should represent the best OER performance of Cu-based electrocatalysts and is competitive with those based on Fe-group metals. Besides, the hNC/NF-based water electrolyzer delivers a performance of 1.50 V cell voltage at 10 mA cm(-2), offering great promise for practical application.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526609100029	32073819

Under visible light irradiation, the composite photocatalyst shows higher photocurrents, more negative onset potential and lower photoluminescence intensity compared with those of p-C3N4, which demonstrated that the modification of IrO2 QDs accelerated the transformation, separation, and utilization of photoelectrons and thereby significantly improved the photocatalytic performance.									7	1	0	0	1	0	7			2052-1553			WOS:000445217200023

The in situ generated H2O2 was subsequently decomposed to generate OH radicals, which enabled the degradation of organic compounds in water. The oxygen reduction reaction proceeded along with the concurrent oxidation of phosphide to phosphate, then copper ions and phosphate ions were dissolved out during the reaction. The reactivity of CuxP was gradually reduced during 10 cycles with consuming 8.7 mg of CuxP for the successive removal of 17 mu mol 4-chlorophenol. CoP which was compared as a control sample under the same experimental condition also produced H2O2 through activating dioxygen but did not degrade organic compounds at all. The electrochemical analysis for the electron transfers on CuxP and CoP showed that the number of electrons transferred to O-2 is 3 and 2, respectively, which explains why OH radical is generated on CuxP, not on CoP. The Cu+ species generated on the CuxP surface can participate in Fenton-like reaction with in situ generated H2O2. CuxP is proposed as a solid reagent that can activate dioxygen to generate reactive oxygen species in ambient aqueous condition, which is more facile to handle and store than liquid/gas reagents (e.g., H2O2, Cl-2, O-3).									52	2	0	0	13	0	53			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000460709100068	30801172

Here, we perform extensive hybrid density functional theory calculations to explore electronic structures, interfacial charge transfer, electrostatic potential profile, optical absorption properties, and photocatalytic properties of a proposed two-dimensional (2D) small-lattice-mismatched GaTe/Bi(2)Se(3)heterostructure. Theoretical results clearly reveal that the examined het-erostructure with a small direct band gap can effectively harvest the broad spectrum of the incoming sunlight. Due to the relative strong interfacial built-in electric field in the heterostructure and the small band gap between the valence band maximum of GaTe monolayer and the conduction band minimum of Bi(2)Se(3)nanosheet with slight band edge bending, these photogenerated carriers transfer via Z-scheme pathway, which results in the photogenerated electrons and holes effectively separating into the GaTe monolayer and the Bi(2)Se(3)nanosheet for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively. Our results imply that the artificial 2D GaTe/Bi(2)Se(3)is a promising Z-scheme photocatalyst for overall solar water splitting.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1674-0068	2327-2244		WOS:000573915700006

The protocol is designed to closely mimic the fluctuations of renewable energies. The unit cycle of the current ADT protocol represents the "ON/OFF" operation mode. In the "ON" step, the electrolyzer operates under a DC current of 0.6A cm(-2). In the "OFF" step, the electrocatalyst is subjected to a constant potential that is clearly more cathodic than its OER onset potential (namely, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 V vs. RHE) for 10 or 60s. The transition from the "ON" state to the "OFF" state occurs through a cathodic linear sweep voltammetry of a fast sweep rate to mimic the sudden changes in the renewable power. A NiCoOx/Ni-mesh electrode was used as a case study. The electrode showed remarkable durability under continuous operation (i = 0.6 A cm(-2)) for about 900 hours. However, it did suffer severe degradation after a certain number of ADT cycles, and the rate of degradation mainly depends on the potential value and the duration of the "OFF" step. Interestingly, the inclusion of the 10-sec open-circuit potential step after the "ON" step clearly mitigates the impact of energy fluctuations on the durability of OER electrocatalysts.

However, little attention has been paid to the crystal-plane-dependent interactions in CeO2-based nanocomposites for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In this work, CeO2/g-C3N4 were synthesized with tunable CeO2 crystal planes ({110}, {100}, and {111}). Photoelectrochemical, XPS, Raman, ESR results suggested that the electron-separation efficiency, oxygen defects and Ce3+/Ce4+ reversibility pairs were greatly dependent on the crystal-faceted CeO2 and g-C3N4 interaction, and the photocatalytic performances of hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation were in the order: CeO2{110}/g-C3N4 > CeO2{100}/g-C3N4 > CeO2{111}/g-C3N4 > g-C3N4. Furthermore, the FT-IR, XPS and density functional theory (DFT) calculations shown that the different properties of CeO2/g-C3N4 were resulted from the built-in electric field at the interface, and more intensive electronic interaction was found on CeO2{110}/g-C3N4, leading to the efficient separation and transfer of photo-generated electrons under light illumination.									105	7	0	0	13	0	107			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000443666000012

Due to the deleterious health effects of carbonaceous nanoparticles it is important to gain a better understanding of the fundamental processes that lead to their formation and growth. We have utilised our Stochastic NAnoParticle Simulator software to model the growth of soot precursor species in a laminar premixed benzene-air flame. We implemented a newset of pathways containing oxygenation reactions and assessed the effects on the growth mechanisms. The inclusion of oxygenation growth pathways with the previously established hydrocarbon growth pathways creates a much larger set of potential configurations for the particle to explore and thus the rate of growth is faster. Hydrogen abstractions and acetylene additions are still the most common events the particle experiences during its evolution trajectory; however, a significant amount of ethers and oxygen-containing rings are formed. Though the role of soot precursor oxygenation is not completely solved, it certainly adds layers of complexity to the nanoparticles' formation process and likely influences the formation of soot particles.					9th Mediterranean Symposium on Combustion9th Mediterranean Symposium on Combustion	JUN 07-11, 2015JUN 07-11, 2015	Combust Inst; Int Ctr Heat & Mass TransferCombust Inst; Int Ctr Heat & Mass Transfer	Rhodes, GREECERhodes, GREECE	10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1364-7830	1741-3559		WOS:000398056600003

The superior hydrogen evolution activity stemmed from the synergistic effect of MoS2 with its electrocatalytically active edge-sites and excellent electrical coupling to the underlying graphene and CNT network.									78	9	0	0	3	0	78			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000371797000025

In natural photosynthesis, water oxidation occurs in the oxygen evolving complex (OEC), a manganese-oxo cluster {Mn4CaO5} with a cubane-like topology that is embedded within a redox-active protein environment located in photosystem II (PS II). Therefore, the preparation of biomimetic manganese-based compounds is appealing for the development of efficient and inexpensive water oxidation catalysts. Here, we present the water oxidation catalytic activity of a high-nuclearity mixed-metal manganese-strontium cluster, [(Mn12Mn6Sr)-Mn-III-Sr-II(mu(4)-O-8)(mu(3)-Cl)(8)(HLMe)(12)(MeCN)(6)]Cl-2 center dot 15MeOH (Mn18Sr) (HLMe = 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)-p-cresol), in neutral media. This biomimetic mixed-valence cluster features different cubane-like motifs and it is stabilized by redox-active, quinone-like organic ligands. The complex displays a low onset overpotential of 192 mV and overpotentials of 284 and 550 mV at current densities of 1 mA cm(-2) and 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Direct O-2 evolution measurements under visible light-driven water oxidation conditions demonstrate the catalytic capabilities of this cluster, which exhibits a turnover frequency of 0.48 s(-1) and a turnover number of 21.6. This result allows for a direct comparison to be made with the structurally analogous Mn-oxo cluster [(Mn12Mn7II)-Mn-III(mu(4)-O)(8)(mu(3)-OCH3)(2)(mu(3)-Br)(6)(HLMe)(12)(MeOH)(5)(MeCN)]Br-2 center dot 9MeCN center dot MeOH (Mn-19), the water oxidation catalytic activity of which was recently reported by us. This work highlights the potential of this series of compounds towards the water oxidation reaction and their amenability to induce structural changes that modify their reactivity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4441		WOS:000682150800001

In an alkaline solution, the synthesized Fe2O3/N-rGO affords superior ORR and OER activity in comparison with Fe2O3 and N-rGO, demonstrating the reinforced synergistic effect. Moreover, it exhibits a comparable limiting current density and a higher current retention ratio in the ORR than commercial Pt/C. A Zn-air battery with Fe2O3/N-rGO delivers a peak power density of 80.1 mW cm(-2), and the energy density reaches 730.2 Wh kg(Zn)(-1). In addition, stable voltage gaps of similar to 0.91 V during discharge and charge are achieved at 5 mA cm(-2), and the energy efficiency is maintained at similar to 60% over 120 cycles, illustrating the remarkable stability for rechargeable Zn-air batteries.

Preliminary results have shown the widest known electrochemical window before water decomposition, allowing new possibilities for both anodic and cathodic reactions. Studies of the oxidation of organic compounds has been performed with alcohols such as isopropanol, phenol and organic acids. Cyclic voltammetry demonstrates no activity in the potential range where water is stable. In the potential region of oxygen evolution, the organic compounds are mainly oxidized to CO2. No deactivation or reduction in the thickness of the electrode has been observed. In addition, no fouling of the diamond surface has been detected. Furthermore, no hydrodynamic effects have been observed. Concentrated (1 M) and diluted (3 x 10(-4) M) cyanide solutions have been oxidized on diamond electrodes both in the presence and in the absence of chloride ions. The results show a direct oxidation with a current efficiency of about 40% for concentrated solutions. At low cyanide concentrations, the current efficiency is strongly increased by the presence of Cl-. Electrochemical reduction of cadmium and copper has been carried out on diamond electrodes. Non-adherent deposits have been obtained on diamond cathodes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

But it is limited by slow biochar oxidation reaction (BOR). Here we adopted the biochar derived from pyrolysis (PB) and hydrothermal carbonization (HB) of rice husk. Replacement of oxygen evolution reaction with BOR leaves a significantly reduced onset potential (E-onset) and an increased current density. Strongly related to carbonization temperature, the physicochemical properties of biochar markedly affected BOR. The abundant -OH groups in HB contributed to a low E-onset, while the well-developed pore structure and high specific surface area of PB enhanced its reactivity at higher potential. Exposure of functional groups on PB surface after pickling made an increase in current density, but the simultaneous elimination of easily oxidized solutes in HB dominated and caused current density decline. H2SO4 electrolyte of 1 mol/L was most appropriate for the uniform dispersion of biochar particles. The oxidation of PB derived at 800 degrees C with a slurry concentration of 10 g/L showed the lowest charge-transfer resistance and a favorable kinetics. Continuous BAWE indicated that PB was more superior than HB in increasing current density and H-2 production. This work provides favorable strategies for improving BAWE. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

X-ray diffraction reveals a slightly distorted octahedral coordination of cobalt (four nitrogens and two oxygens) in (1) and regular octahedral or tetrahedral ones (oxygens only) in (2).

Herein, we report the bi-metallic PdRu tripods (PdRu TPs) as a highly effective catalyst for the electrochemical nitrogen reduction to ammonia in an alkaline solution under ambient conditions. The PdRu TPs assembled with three spatially separated branches are directly synthesized by a one-pot synthetic route. Owing to its tripod structure and bi-metallic compositions, the PdRu TPs exhibit superior catalytic activity and stability for NRR. The proposed one-pot route is highly valuable for preparation of active metallic catalysts for NRR.									102	4	0	0	3	0	102			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000455124900037

A durable robust electrocatalyst, a MOF-driven C, N-codoped nanoarray grown on nickel foam, namely CuO/Cu2O@CD-CN/NiF, serves as both the cathode and anode for the N-2 reduction and urea oxidation. It is significant that an NH3 yield rate of 102.2 mu g h(-1) cm(-2) and a faradaic efficiency of 23.9% were obtained, significantly exceeding those of its urea-free counterpart. This research not only provides value to the future artificial nitrogen fixation to ammonia but also opens up new avenues for the replacement of the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for energy-efficient NH3 generation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000596714600003

It was found that CoO, Co and CoO+Co all can improve the performance of Ni electrode to some extent and the effect of CoO was the most obvious. This could be attributed to several causes: all three forms of additives increased the reversibility of Ni(II)/Ni(III) redox reaction, enhanced the oxygen evolution polarization, improved the charging efficiency of Ni electrode, improved the lattice imperfection of Ni hydroxide and made it more beneficial to charge transfer and H+ diffusion processes.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1005-0302			WOS:000172126300028

The aim is to find promising electrocatalysts which are able to change the reaction pathway and reduce the overpotential. Here, based on density functional theory, a comprehensive mechanism study of the N-2 activation and NH3 synthesis on the Mo2TiC2 MXenes is presented. For catalytic reaction mechanism, nineteen different possible pathways are screened for the lowest overpotential, where the corresponding potential-determining step are compared by Gibbs free energy calculation. The result reveals Mo2TiC2 MXenes exhibit both valid N-2-philicity and high catalytic activity for electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis through a dissociation mechanism with a low overpotential of 0.26 V. Further, the competing reaction of H-2 evolution is simultaneously suppressed which shows a relatively high potentials of 0.74 V. This study shows a brand new material for catalyzing NH3 synthesis under ambient conditions and provides the theory background to reduce the overpotential by changing the reaction pathway.

J	McDonald, Kenneth J.; Choi, Kyoung-Shin					Choi, Kyoung-Shin/0000-0003-1945-8794			Photodeposition of Co-Based Oxygen Evolution Catalysts on alpha-Fe2O3 Photoanodes								CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS				23	7			1686	1693		10.1021/cm1020614				APR 12 2011	2011	Cobalt-based oxygen evolution catalysts containing phosphates (Co-Pi OEC) were photochemically deposited onto the surface of n-type alpha-Fe2O3 electrodes to enhance solar O-2 production. alpha-Fe2O3 films used in this study were prepared by electrodepositing Fe films followed by thermal oxidation at 500 degrees C. The use of a nonaqueous plating solution made it possible to deposit adherent and uniform Fe films, which is difficult to achieve in an aqueous medium. Photodeposition of Co-Pi OEC was carried out by using photogenerated holes in the valence band of alpha-Fe2O3 to oxidize Co2+ ions to Co3+ ions in a phosphate buffer solution, which resulted in the precipitation of Co-Pi OEC on the alpha-Fe2O3 surface. Two different deposition conditions, open circuit (OC) and short circuit (SC) conditions, were studied comparatively to understand their effect on the growth and composition of Co-Pi OEC deposits. The results showed that the SC condition where the photoreduction reaction is physically separated from the photo-oxidation reaction significantly increased the yield and nucleation density of Co-Pi OECs, resulting in a better coverage of the alpha-Fe2O3 surface with Co-Pi OEC nanoparticles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that the OC condition resulted in a higher Co2+/Co3+ ratio in the Co-Pi OEC deposits than the SC condition. This difference in composition is due to the simultaneous photoreduction occurring on the a-Fe2O3 surface under OC conditions. Co-Pi OEC improved the photocurrent of alpha-Fe2O3 electrodes more than Co2+ ions simply adsorbed on the alpha-Fe2O3 surface and the Co-Pi OEC deposited under SC conditions resulted in the most pronounced photocurrent enhancement. These results demonstrate the advantages of creating a SC condition for photodeposition of Co-Pi OECs. O-2 detection measurements show that the presence of photodeposited Co-Pi OEC on the alpha-Fe2O3 surface not only increases the total amount of photocurrent generated by facilitating electron hole pair separation but also increases the photocurrent to O-2 conversion efficiency by improving O-2 evolution kinetics.									183	3	0	0	17	0	183			0897-4756			WOS:000289029400010

The fundamental chemistry governing NO evolution developed in this article is based on a full set of processes regrouped in 150 selected chemical reactions involving 25 molecular, excited, atomic, and charged species. The density was calculated using the continuity equation without the diffusion and convective terms, beneath different values of electric reduced fields within the vary of 50-90 Td, at various times in the ranges 10(-9)-10(-4) s. The results of our numerical simulations show the role played by different chemical reactions on NO production and reduction, such as N(D-2) + O-2 -> NO + O and NO + O + N-2 -> NO2 + N-2, respectively. We have found that, at 50 and 70 Td, nitrogen oxide creation dominates when O-2 concentration equals 5%, while, for 90 Td, creation dominates when X%O-2 concentration equals 10%. These results are the same for both reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0093-3813	1939-9375		WOS:000638401300031

Therefore, in this work, a novel Fe-N based electrocatalyst with high activity, porous structure, and durability were prepared. Highly active N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) was used to form zinc-based zeolitic imidazole frameworks involved with zinc carbonate (Zn-ZIFs@ZnCO3). Fe-doping can be feasibly achieved by partial substitution Zn by Fe using Fe (NO)(3). Owing to the presence of ZnCO3 and Fe3+, carbonization of Fe/Zn-ZIFs@ZnCO3 at 925 degrees C under N-2 atmosphere endows the pyrolysis products with many highly active heterostructures of 3D graphene structure. The obtained Fe-N@ZnO possesses superior ORR performance to commercial 20% PVC catalysts, such as positive half-wave potential (0.851 V), good durability and methanol tolerance in 0.1 M KOH.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000510846500132

It is shown by measurements of differential capacitance and anodic current that during the benzene oxidation at the BDD electrode, adsorption of a reaction intermediate occurs, which partially blocks the electrode surface and lowers the anodic current. At the NCD electrode, benzene is oxidized concurrently with oxygen evolution, a (quinoid) intermediate being adsorbed at the electrode. The adsorption and the electrode surface blocking are reflected in the impedancefrequency and impedancepotential complex-plane plots.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1439-4235			WOS:000307841900023	22431387

Zn-air batteries, which operate in alkaline electrolytes, are promising with the highest theoretical volumetric energy density. However, rechargeable zinc anodes develop slowly in alkaline electrolytes due to passivation, dissolution, and hydrogen evolution issues. In this study, we report the design of a submicron zinc anode sealed with an ion-sieving coating that suppresses hydrogen evolution reaction. The design is demonstrated with ZnO nanorods coated by TiO2, which overcomes passivation, dissolution, and hydrogen evolution issues simultaneously. It achieves superior reversible deep cycling performance with a high discharge capacity of 616 mAh/g and Coulombic efficiency of 93.5% when cycled with 100% depth of discharge at lean electrolyte. It can also deeply cycle similar to 350 times in a beaker cell. The design principle of this work may potentially be applied to other battery electrode materials.									56	1	0	0	6	0	55			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000541691200084	32453958

Herein, we exhibit that the above-mentioned problems can be solved by introducing a foreign dopant (Mo6+) into the BiVO4 film to create a distributed n(+)-n heterojunction and combining the BiVO4 photoanode with cobalt-phosphate water oxidation catalyst to improve the oxygen evolution kinetic. We systematically study the relationship between the higher photoelectrochemical performance and Mo-doping and cobalt-phosphate (CoPi) modification by XRD, Raman, SEM, TEM, LSV, EIS, I-t, and Mott-Schottky measurements, and the CoPi-Mo:BiVO4 heterojunction photoanode shows a current density of 3.27 times higher than that of pristine BiVO4 photoanode. Then, we concentrate our attention on a novel perspective for understanding the photoelectrochemical mechanism of interfacial charge transfer with the Mo-doping and CoPi modification on the BiVO4 photoanodes. This work provides new insights into the rational design of novel photoanodes from various improvement strategies with high photoelectrochemical performance and further utilization for environmental practical applications.									15	0	0	0	5	0	15			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000468051900008

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				56	9			5820	5829		10.1021/acs.est.2c00405				MAY 3 2022	2022	An electrochemical advanced oxidation process (EAOP) is demonstrated with a catalytic cathode capable of simultaneously catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with resultant in situ generation of atomic hydrogen (H*) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). A palladium-coated carbon-PTFE gas diffusion electrode (Pd/C GDE) was used as a catalytic cathode with hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) formed as a result of the reaction of electrogenerated H* with H2O2. As both the HER and ORR can be induced to occur at the same cathode, the H*/GDE process results in more effective degradation of organic contaminants than can be achieved by a conventional H*/H2O2 process involving direct addition of H2O2. At circumneutral pH, 82.7% of added formate was degraded after 2 h treatment at an applied potential of -1.0 V vs Ag/AgCl with relatively low concentrations of generated H2O2 remaining in the solution. We also show that H* and H2O2 (and thus (OH)-O-center dot) can be electrogenerated effectively over a wide range of pH (3.2-7.0). These results suggest that by in situ generation of H* and H2O2, the H*/GDE process is able to produce significant amounts of (OH)-O-center dot without external chemical addition and thus offers an alternative method for abatement of aqueous organic contaminants.									3	0	0	0	0	0	2			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000798709200051	35442646

Oxygen vacancy defects were further introduced into Co2AlO4 nanosheets by a mild solvothermal reduction method, resulting in large electrochemical surface area and high active site densities, making the related Co atoms get electrons, and producing more empty orbitals. The positive charge of Co and Al atoms adjacent to the O vacancies in VO-rich Co2AlO4 reduced significantly, that is, more electrons are concentrated on the Co and Al atoms. Those electrons closed to the Fermi level have a promoting effect during the H2O activation. As a result, the obtained ultrathin Co2AlO4 nanosheets with oxygen vacancies show a low overpotential of 280 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 70.98 mV dec(-1). Moreover, it also displays a remarkable stability in alkaline solution, which is superior to most of the reported Co3O4 electrocatalysts.

The MIMS approach is based on using a gas permeable membrane to enable the entry of gas molecules into the mass spectrometer source. This is a simple yet durable approach for the analysis of volatile gases, particularly atmospheric gases. The MIMS technique strongly lends itself to the study of reaction flux where isotopic labeling is employed to differentiate two competing processes; i.e., O-2 evolution versus O-2 uptake reactions from PSII or terminal oxidase/rubisco reactions. Such investigations have been used for in vitro studies of whole leaves and isolated cells. The MIMS approach is also able to follow rates of isotopic exchange, which is useful for obtaining chemical exchange rates. These types of measurements have been employed for oxygen ligand exchange in PSII and to discern reaction rates of the carbonic anhydrase reactions. Recent developments have also engaged MIMS for online isotopic fractionation and for the study of reactions in inorganic systems that are capable of water splitting or H-2 generation. The simplicity of the sampling approach coupled to the high sensitivity of modern instrumentation is a reason for the growing applicability of this technique for a range of problems in plant photosynthesis and respiration. This review offers some insights into the sampling approaches and the experiments that have been conducted with MIMS.									77	0	0	0	53	0	77			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000271795400035	19653116

As carbon-based supports are expected to play a major role in low cost electrocatalysis, improved synthetic methods and a deeper understanding of their mechanisms of action are now required. To this end, we synthesized transition metal catalysts for overall water splitting encapsulated into nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (M-N-CNTs, M = Ni, Co, Fe) through a direct and convenient pyrolysis of bulk g-C3N4. Furthermore, the addition of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) leads to a significant dispersion of the catalytic N-CNTs. Among the obtained catalyst series, NiFe-N-CNT with rGO (NiFe-N-CNT-rGO) exhibits extremely low overpotential of 270 mV (on glassy carbon) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This performance is superior to most of the previously reported noble metal-free catalysts for OER. Our comprehensive study unravels that the growth of CNTs follows a "reduction-nucleation-growth" process. The thermally reduced metallic nanoparticles (NPs) serve as nucleation sites of carbon species on their surface to further promote N-CNT growth. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the CNT walls and N-dopants in the catalysts modify the electronic structure and adjust the free energy toward the adsorption of intermediates. The one-step hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process is influenced more strongly by N-centers when compared to the four-electron transfer OER process. The scalable and straightforward synthesis together with excellent electrocatalytic performance renders the NiFe-N-CNT-rGO hybrid catalyst quite promising for large-scale water splitting applications.									43	2	0	0	1	0	43			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000473054500016

The electrochemical results suggest that the FeCo-alloyed structure exhibits better stability and electrocatalytic activities toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than the Fe-NR/NCNT and Co-NR/NCNT. This is ascribed to the presence of more metal-NCNT heterointerfaces, resulting in more active sites for catalyzing ORR and OER. The Fe0.33Co0.67-NR/NCNT requires only 285 mV overpotential to deliver 10 mA cm(-2)in the OER catalysis indicating a better catalytic activity compared to Co-NR/NCNT (298 mV) and Fe-NR/NCNT (363 mV) as well as the benchmark of the IrO2(313 mV). Moreover, Fe0.33Co0.67-NR/NCNT with a half-wave potential of 857 mVvs.RHE (comparable to commercial Pt/C (853 mVvs.RHE)) outperforms Fe-NR/NCNT (842 mVvs.RHE) and Co-NR/CNT (839 mVvs.RHE). Consequently, the assembled rechargeable ZAB from Fe0.33Co0.67-NR/NCNT (164 mW cm(-2)) exhibits higher battery performance and stability than Co-NR/NCNT (70 mW cm(-2)), Fe-NR/NCNT (89 mW cm(-2)) and Pt/C-IrO2(71 mW cm(-2)). Furthermore, the all-solid-state ZAB fabricated from Fe0.33Co0.67-NR/NCNT shows a considerably high battery performance (54 mW cm(-2)) and stability.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2398-4902			WOS:000573449300024

A CeO2 functional metal oxide was used to modify a spinel oxide in order to further improve the electrocatalytic performance of the spinel oxide. In this work, a CeO2@CoFe2O4/NF hybrid nanostructure was synthesized for the first time by typical hydrothermal and calcination methods. In an alkaline medium, CeO2@CoFe2O4/NF displays superior OER activity and needs an overpotential of 213 mV to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), which makes it one of the most active catalysts reported so far. In addition, the as-prepared CeO2@CoFe2O4/NF material needs a potential of 1.40 V at the same current density in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea, which displays superior UOR activity. The CeO2@CoFe2O4/NF catalyst also displays good durability and the performance of the electrode is negligibly attenuated at a large current intensity of 125 mA cm(-2). Experimental results demonstrate that the activity of the CeO2@CoFe2O4/NF catalyst is ascribed to the exposure of more active centers and a faster electron transfer rate. This work develops a novel method for exploiting Earth-abundant, robust and environmentally friendly OER and UOR electrocatalysts.									35	0	0	0	1	0	35			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000686618700001	34519756

The precise control and design of defects and dopants in carbon electrodes will allow the fundamental understanding of activity-structure correlations for tailoring catalytic performance of carbon-based, most particularly graphene-based, electrode materials. Herein, we adopted monolayer graphene - a model carbon-based electrode - for systematical introduction of nitrogen and oxygen dopants, together with vacancy defects, and studied their roles in catalyzing ORR. Compared to pristine graphene, nitrogen doping exhibited a limited effect on ORR activity. In contrast, nitrogen doping in graphene predoped with vacancy defects or oxygen enhanced the activities at 0.4 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by 1.2 and 2.0 times, respectively. The optimal activity was achieved for nitrogen doping in graphene functionalized with oxygenated defects, 12.8 times more than nitrogen-doped and 7.7 times more than pristine graphene. More importantly, oxygenated defects are highly related to the 4e(-) pathway instead of nitrogen dopants. This work indicates a non-negligible contribution of oxygen and especially oxygenated vacancy defects for the catalytic activity of nitrogen-doped graphene.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000732439800001	35028190

Polarization was found to enhance propene oxidation rate. Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 was used as infiltration material to enhance the effect of polarization on propene oxidation rate, especially at low temperatures. The influence of infiltrated material, as a function of heat treatment, on the reactor electrochemical behavior has been evaluated by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The infiltration of Ce0.9Gd0 O-1(1.95) increased the catalytic activity of the reactor and helped to mitigate the degradation of the electrode induced by prolonged polarization. The results suggested that the formation of a thin and continuous layer of Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 on the electrodes played a crucial role in suppressing the competing oxygen evolution reaction and promoting the oxidation of propene under polarization, with faradaic efficiencies above 70% at 250 degrees C.

However, platinum catalysts suffer from CO tolerance, which affects their stability. The present study focuses on ultrafine Pt nanoparticles stabilized by flowerlike MoS2/N-doped reduced graphene oxide (Pt@MoS2/NrGO) architecture, developed via a facile and cost-competitive approach that was performed through the hydrothermal method followed by the wet-reflux strategy. Fourier transform infrared spectra, X-ray diffraction patterns, Raman spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectra, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy verified the conversion to Pt@MoS2/NrGO. Pt@MoS2/NrGO was applied as a potential electrocatalyst toward the anode reaction (liquid fuel oxidation) and the cathode reaction (oxygen reduction). In the anode reaction, Pt@MoS2/NrGO showed superior activity toward electro-oxidation of methanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol with mass activities of 448.0, 158.0, and 147.0 mA/mg(Pt), respectively, approximately 4.14, 2.82, and 3.34 times that of a commercial Pt-C (20%) catalyst. The durability of the Pt@MoS2/NrGO catalyst was tested via 500 potential cycles, demonstrating less than 20% of catalytic activity loss for alcohol fuels. In the cathode reaction, oxygen reduction reaction results showed excellent catalytic activity with higher half-wave potential at 0.895 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode for Pt@MoS2/NrGO. The durability of the Pt@MoS2/NrGO catalyst was tested via 30 000 potential cycles and showed only 15 mV reduction in the half-wave potential, whereas the Pt@NrGO and Pt-C catalysts experienced a much greater shift (Pt@NrGO, similar to 23 mV; Pt-C, similar to 20 mV).									85	2	0	0	3	0	85			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000463843900037	30848889

Water splitting offers a promising renewable energy mechanism by converting water into H-2 and O-2 gas, which can directly power fuel cells or be utilized as chemical feedstocks. To increase the efficiency of water splitting, catalysts must be developed for the water reduction and water oxidation half-reactions. To promote rational catalyst design, atomically precise metal clusters (APMCs) with earth-abundant metals provide a framework for developing both structure-activity relationships and cost-effective catalysts. Previous reports on the water oxidation activity of nickel-thiolate clusters [Ni-n(SR)(2n)] have not developed a systematic description of a possible size-activity relationship. Utilizing recent advancements in preparative chromatography for isolating APMCs, we have synthesized a series of Ni-n(SR)(2n) (n = 4, 5, or 6) clusters as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. We discovered a clear size-activity and size-stability trend, with intrinsic activity and stability increasing with cluster size. Using density functional theory, we found that intrinsic activity is inversely correlated to intermediate binding energy, and by extension the oxidation potential of each cluster. Our work demonstrates the ability of APMCs to uncover previously unknown structure-activity relationships that can guide future catalyst design.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000832682200001	35862896

However, they are costly, toxic, and not practical for an efficient OER process. Here, a two-step method is introduced, based on earth-abundant manganese; molten salt-assisted self-assembly process to prepare mesoporous LiMn2-xCoxO4(x= 0-0.5) modified electrodes, in which a systematic incorporation of Co(II) into the structure is performed using successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction followed by an annealing (SILAR-AN) process. Applying SILAR-AN over a stable m-LiMn(1.6)Co(0.4)O(4)electrode improves the OER performance; the Tafel slope and overpotential drop from 66 to 46 mV dec(-1)and 304 to 265 mV (at 1.0 mA cm(-2)), respectively. The performance of the modified electrodes is comparable to benchmark IrO(2)and RuO(2)catalysts and much better than cobalt oxide electrodes. Electronic interactions between the neighboring Mn and Co sites synergistically amplify the OER performance of the m-LiMn(2-)(x)Co(x)O(4)electrodes. The data are compatible with an eight steps nucleophilic acid-base reaction mechanism during OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2365-709X			WOS:000540464100001

Herein, a novel and facile supramolecular anchoring strategy was developed to achieve the embedding of ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles in N-doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres through pyrolyzing the precursor formed by coordination assembly between metal ions and zinc gluconate (G(Zn)). Featuring rich hydroxyl groups, the G(Zn) can effectively chelate Ru3+ via metal-oxygen bonds to form 3D supramolecular nanospheres, and meanwhile, mesopores in carbon nanospheres were expanded after subsequent pyrolysis thanks to the volatilization of zincic species at high temperature. As a demonstration, the best-performing catalyst displayed extraordinary activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a small overpotential of 43 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE) at 10 mA/cm(2) and a Tafel slope of 39 mV/dec, which was superior to that of commercial Pt/C in alkaline medium. Theoretical calculations revealed that the catalytic activity was significantly promoted by the strong electronic coupling between Ru nanoparticles and N-doped porous carbon, which increased the electron transfer capability and facilitated the adsorption and dissociation of H2O to realize an efficient HER.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000677540900036	34251788

After the reaction of Si atoms with oxygen, a film-like SiO2 phase with holes is initially formed on GB of Cu. At temperatures used for the internal oxidation, the holes rapidly grow and the morphology of the film-like SiO2 changes to a particulate equilibrium shape through formation of two-dimensional SiO2 network and its subsequent breakup. During the morphological evolution, the volume of SiO2 on GB is conserved. The morphological evolution of SiO2 on GB is caused by diffusional flow of matter to decrease the sum of Cu/SiO2 interface and Cu grain-boundary energies. The activation energy Q of the morphological evolution is obtained as Q approximate to 290 kJ/mol. Among the values of activation energies reported in the previous studies on diffusion in SiO2, Q approximate to 290 kJ/mol is close to that for the volume-diffusion of SiO in SiO2, Q(SiO) approximate to 268 kJ/mol. This supports that the morphological evolution of SiO2 on GB is controlled by the volume-diffusion of SiO in SiO2.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1345-9678	1347-5320		WOS:000220734500033

Herein, a self-standing core@shell Co@CoMoO4 nanowire array (Co@CoMoO4 NA) electrode is developed by calcination of a cobalt carbonate hydroxide@CoMoO4 (CCH NA@CoMoO4) precursor under H-2/N-2 atmosphere. In this way, synergistic Co/CoMoO4 heterostructure interfaces and 3D porous electrode architecture are built up, which are proved to be reliable strategies for HER catalytic activity enhancement. In 1.0 M KOH solution, Co@CoMoO4 NA electrode exhibits an impressive activity with an extremely low overpotential of 46 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), quite closing to that of commercial PtC (31 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). These findings may inspire the exploration of new electrocatalysts for efficient HER by modulating multiple components interfaces.									60	8	0	0	3	0	62			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000460495400005

Acetaldehyde and monomeric anthocyanins were determined by HPLC, the chromatic characteristics and the main phenolic classes by spectrophotometry, the saliva precipitation index (SPI) by CHIP electrophoresis, and the astringency subqualities by sensory analysis. The results confirmed that during aging there is an increase in polymerisation reactions. A higher amount of acetaldehyde was detected in wines which were bottled with a lower content of free SO2 and were less rich in anthocyanins and tannins; a significant closure effect was observed for these wines. Regarding the influence of closure on tannins, significant slight differences in vanilline reactive flavans and SPI content were observed for Pallagrello wines only, which were characterised by higher values for tannins at bottling. Astringency subqualities differed with closures for each wine.Conclusion: this study indicates that the amount of initial free and combined sulfur dioxide, as well as that of anthocyanins and tannins, are key factors in driving polymerisation reactions and the aging of red wines. After five years of bottle aging the influence of closure could still be observed.Significance of the study: this study provides new insights into the parameters that need to be evaluated before bottling in order to avoid the wrong evolution of red wines after long bottle aging.									6	1	0	0	2	0	7				2494-1271		WOS:000579120900014

Herein, we have demonstrated one-step chemical reduction strategy to fabricate platinum-nickel alloy nanoparticle-supported reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as excellent electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in basic condition. Graphene-supported alloy nanocatalysts are achieved by simply controlling the molar ratios of bimetallic precursors. We confirm that nickel species on the surface of as-synthesized nanocatalysts tend to be oxidized as nickel hydroxide during the fabrication. Our nanocatalysts synthesized at the equivalent molar ratios of platinum and nickel salts exhibit much higher electrocatalytic activity for HER than the commercial Pt/C and graphene-supported Pt counterparts in same conditions. The performance improvement is not only attributed to nickel hydroxide layer on our nanocatalysts facilitating the decomposition of water in basic media but also ascribed to the partial replacement of Pt atoms by Ni ones decreasing the Pt-H bond energy and improving desorption of hydrogen atoms on Pt-Ni alloy nanocatalysts. Furthermore, our nanocatalysts present excellent HER catalytic stability. Our results will provide a facile and effective strategy on the development of the excellent Pt-containing composite nanocatalysts for applications in electrocatalysis.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000454941800001		
J	Iben, I; Tutukov, AV				Tutukov, Alexander/AAY-5487-2021				On the evolution of close triple stars that produce Type Ia supernovae								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				511	1			324	334						JAN 20 1999	1999	Current observational estimates suggest that similar to 30% of all binary stars are in triple systems. In similar to 70% of these, the enclosed binary is close enough that the primary in the binary can evolve to fill its Roche lobe. In similar to 10%-20%, the third, more distant component can evolve to fill its Roche lobe, leading to configurations inaccessible to isolated binary stars. Triple stars are unstable if the ratio of the orbital period of the enclosed binary to the period of the third component exceeds a critical value. Hence, an increase in the orbital period of the binary due to conservative mass transfer between components or to wind mass loss from the binary can destabilize an initially stable triple system, causing it to decompose into a rapidly moving single star and an evolved binary recoiling in the opposite direction with a velocity large compared with velocities typical of primordial binaries. To highlight the different possibilities inherent in triple-star evolution, we discuss qualitatively several possible scenarios whereby triple stars with component masses in the range 1-10 M. can evolve into Type Ia supernovae, which we assume to be explosions of merging carbon-oxygen or oxygen-neon white dwarfs of total mass larger than 1.4 M.. Before quantitative predictions of the likelihood of these scenarios can be made, it is necessary to determine the initial distribution of young triple stars over their masses and orbital separations and to calculate the reaction of the enclosed binary to matter transferred to it by the third component when it fills its Roche lobe or supports a strong wind.									36	0	0	0	0	0	36			0004-637X			WOS:000079157900031

However, the extremely strong N equivalent to N triple-bonds in nitrogen molecules and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction lead to the unsatisfactory NH3 yield and the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of eNRR, making the development of high-performance catalysts with adequate active sites and high selectivity essential for further development of eNRR. Addressing this, we herein report a Bi and K dual-doped titanium oxide (BTO@KTO) material, which is prepared by a cation exchange reaction between K2Ti4O9 and molten BiCl3, for high-performance eNRR catalysts. Benefiting from the controllable molten-salt cation exchange process, a highly active surface containing Bi/K sites and rich oxygen vacancies has been obtained on titanium oxide. Under the synergy of these two merits, an efficient eNRR catalysis, with the NH3 yield rate of 32.02 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1) and the FE of 12.71%, has been achieved, much superior to that of pristine K2Ti4O9. This work thus offers a high-performance electrocatalyst for eNRR, and more importantly, a versatile cation-exchange strategy for efficiently manipulating materials' functionalities.

Here, we report such single-layer graphene flakes (SLGFs) (>90%) prepared by a nondestructive, energy-efficient, and easy up-scalable physical approach. These high-quality graphene flakes are attributed to a novel 10 s microwave-modulated solid-state approach, which not only fast exfoliates graphite in air but also self-heals the surface of graphite to remove the impurities. The fabricated high-quality graphene films (similar to 200 nm) exhibit a sheet resistance of similar to 280 Omega/sq without any chemical or physical post-treatment. Furthermore, graphene-incorporated Ni-Fe electrodes represent a remarkable similar to 140 mA/cm(2) current for the catalytic water oxidation reaction compared with the pristine Ni-Fe electrode (similar to 10 mA/cm(2)) and a 120 mV cathodic shift in onset potential under identical experimental conditions, together with a faradic efficiency of >90% for an ideal ratio of H-2 and O-2 production from water. All these excellent performances are attributed to extremely high conductivity of the defect-free graphene flakes.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000667982100084	34110762

The SEM, TEM and XRD results demonstrated that the obtained CuWO4 films possessed a network structure that was composed of single crystalline NFs intersected with each other. The CuWO4 NF films showed superior photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity to other CuWO4 photoanodes reported recently for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We attributed the high activity to the unique morphological and crystalline structure of the CuWO4 film, which enhanced the photoactivity by providing a large specific area, a short hole transport distance from the inside of CuWO4 to the CuWO4/solution interface, and a low grain boundary density. Hydrogen treatment by annealing the CuWO4 NF film in mixed gases of H2 and Ar could further enhance the photoactivity, as hydrogen treatment significantly increased the electron density of CuWO4 by generating oxygen vacancy in the lattice. The photocurrent density for OER obtained on the hydrogen-treated (H-treated) CuWO4 NF film is the largest ever reported on CuWO4 photoanodes in the literature. Moreover, the CuWO4 photoanodes exhibit good stability in weak alkaline solution, while the H-treated CuWO4 photoanodes exhibit acceptable stability. This work not only reveals the potential of CuWO4 as a photoanode material for solar water splitting but also shows that the construction of nanostructured CuWO4 photoanodes is a promising method to achieve high PEC activity toward OER.									67	2	0	0	5	0	67			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000372245900013	26912373

Different proton concentrations and accelerated hydrolysis of the generated chlorine into hypochlorous acid at high pH can change the electrokinetics and stability of reaction intermediates. We have investigated a unique reaction mechanism of Co3O4 nanoparticles for chloride oxidation at neutral pH. In contrast with water oxidation, the valency of cobalt was not changed during chloride oxidation. Interestingly, a new intermediate of Co-Cl was captured spectroscopically, distinct from the reaction intermediate at acidic pH. In addition, Co3O4 nanoparticles exhibited high selectivity for active chlorine generation at neutral pH, comparable to commercially available RuO2-based catalysts. We believe that this study provides insight into designing efficient electrocatalysts for active chlorine generation at neutral pH, which can be practically applied to electrochemical water treatment coupled to hydrogen production.									17	2	0	0	2	0	18			1948-7185			WOS:000463678800011	30816050	
J	Ma, Liyang; Zhang, Lan; Wang, Deming; Xin, Haihui; Ma, Qiulin								Pore structure evolution during lean-oxygen combustion of pyrolyzed residual from low-rank coal and its effect on internal oxygen diffusion mechanism								FUEL				319						123850	10.1016/j.fuel.2022.123850				JUL 1 2022	2022	The lean-oxygen combustion of incompletely pyrolyzed char dominates at the combustion front of coalfield fires. Using non-local-density functional theory (NLDFT) and Barrette-Joynere-Halenda (BJH) analysis based on N-2 and CO2 composited adsorption isotherms, the pore (0.4-300 nm) structure characteristics of pyrolyzed char during lean-oxygen combustion were obtained. The results indicate that the main pore morphology changes from irregular ink-bottle shape of raw coal to cylindrical shape of pyrolyzed char, then to slit-shaped and wedgeshaped pores under the effect of oxidative expansion, and finally coalesce into amorphous macropores during combustion. For the weak-caking coal, softened colloids diffuse and block the mesopores, leading to the reverse development of mesopores into smaller-sized pores. The pore development changes from the generation of secondary micropores in pyrolysis stage to the progressive expansion mode of mesopores in initial combustion stage, then to the free coalescence mode of macropores in late combustion stage. The dominant internal oxygen diffusion mechanism transforms from Knudsen diffusion to transition diffusion at 650 C, and the carbon-oxygen reaction interfaces shift from the inner surface of deep micropores to the shallow mesopores and macropores. Finally, 650 ? is determined as the early-warning temperature for the accelerating spread of coalfield fires.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000783253800003

The relationship between GS inhibition and ROS accumulation was investigated in Amaranthus palmeri. Glufosinate's fast action is light-dependent with no visual symptoms or ROS formation in the dark. Inhibition of GS leads to accumulation of ammonia and metabolites of the photorespiration pathway, such as glycolate and glyoxylate, as well as depletion of other intermediates such as glycine, serine, hydroxypyruvate, and glycerate. Exogenous supply of glycolate to glufosinate-treated plants enhanced herbicidal activity and dramatically increased hydrogen peroxide accumulation (possibly from peroxisomal glycolate oxidase activity). Glufosinate affected the balance between ROS generation and scavenging. The activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase increased after glufosinate treatment in an attempt to quench the nascent ROS burst. Low doses of atrazine and dinoseb were used to investigate the sources of ROS by manipulating photosynthetic electron transport and oxygen (O-2) evolution. ROS formation depended on electron flow and O-2 evolution in photosystem II (PSII). Inhibition of GS disrupted photorespiration, carbon assimilation, and linear electron flow in the light reactions. Consequently, the antioxidant machinery and the water-water cycle are overwhelmed in the presence of light and glufosinate. The O-2 generated by the splitting of water in PSII becomes the acceptor of electrons, generating ROS. The cascade of events leads to lipid peroxidation and forms the basis for the fast action of glufosinate.									14	2	0	0	12	1	17			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000530620900001	32372199

In contrast, electron exit from PSI to ferredoxin is diminished in the PSI acceptor side PsaC mutants K35E and FB1. Although, the electron transfer reactions are diminished to a similar extent in both type of mutants, the PsaC mutants K35E and FB1 are more light-sensitive than the PsaF-deficient strain 3bF or the PsaB mutants E613N and W627F. To assess the differential photosensitivity of donor and acceptor side mutants fluorescence transients, gross oxygen evolution and uptake, PSII photo-inhibition and rate of recovery were measured as well as NADP(+) photoreduction. The NADP(+) photoreduction measurements indicated that the donor side is limiting the reduction rate. In contrast, measurements of gross oxygen evolution and uptake showed that the reducing side limits linear electron transfer. However, under high light, donor and acceptor side mutations lead to PSII photo-inhibition and to a diminished rate of PSII recovery, cause lipid peroxidation and result in a decrease in the levels of PSI and PSII. The wild type is not affected under the same conditions. These responses are most pronounced in the PsaC-K35E and PsaB-W627F mutants, and they correlate with the light sensitivity of these strains. The correlation between limitation of electron transfer through PSI and the formation of reactive oxygen species as a cause for the light-sensitivity is discussed.									8	1	0	0	9	0	9			0140-7791			WOS:000186500700008		
J	Beckman, JE; Casuso, E								The evolution of the light elements, Be and B (also Li), in the Galaxy								CHINESE JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS				3				105	114		10.1088/1009-9271/3/S1/105			S	2003	2003	We consider the evolution of the light elements, especially beryllium and boron but also lithium, in the Galaxy as derived from observations within 1 kpc of the Sun. The interest in Li has much to do with the evaluation of the universal baryon abundance via primordial nucleosynthesis, but the difficulties of interpretation have led to the need to understand Li synthesis' within the Galaxy, and this entails understanding many processes, both stellar and interstellar. In the case of Be, and B although measurable abundances produced in the primaeval fireball were predicted in certain models, these are largely (but not totally) discounted observationally. However understanding the evolution of Be and B as tracers of Galactic chemical evolution is,important. While most experts in nucleosynthesis have concentrated on the linear relation between B/Be and Fe, (or 0) in the Galactic halo, and taken disc evolution rather for granted, we show that it is vital to use a valid chemical evolution model for the disc to explain the observations. We present such a model, and emphasize its implications for the infall of low metallicity gas to the disc as the driving element in star formation during the whole disc lifetime.					5th International Workshop on Multifrequency Behaviour of High Energy Cosmic Sources5th International Workshop on Multifrequency Behaviour of High Energy Cosmic Sources	MAY 26-31, 2003MAY 26-31, 2003	INTA; MPE; IASF; USN Res LabINTA; MPE; IASF; USN Res Lab	Vulcano, ITALYVulcano, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1009-9271			WOS:000229374500011

Herein, coverage dependent hydrogen adsorption on seven fcc Ru surfaces was investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The morphology evolution of the fcc Ru nanoparticles under the reactive environment was further illustrated using the multiscale structure reconstruction (MSR) model, which combines the DFT results with the Fowler-Guggenheim (F-G) adsorption isotherm and the Wulff construction. At constant pressure, the shape of a fcc Ru nanoparticle changes from a rhombic dodecahedron to a truncated octahedron with an increase of the temperature. More importantly, the desired Ru morphology, with abundant open facets, was predicted to occur at a high temperature and low pressure. Our results provide an insightful understanding of the reshaping of Ru nanoparticles during real reactions, which is crucial for its rational design for use as a nanocatalyst.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000467776400052	30968086

The increase of the temperature and of the negative polarization as well as the decrease of the saturation level of the negative plate can all promote oxygen recombination, yet the SOC has almost no effect on the oxygen recombination as long as the capacity of the negative plate is high enough. Furthermore, it is found that the oxygen recombination rate increases and then drops when the H2SO4 concentration at the negative plate increases from 0 to 5 M. The experiments also show that considering all factors, the saturation level of the negative plate is the dominant factor affecting the oxygen recombination rate.

Large Mass-Independent Oxygen Isotope Fractionations in Mid-Proterozoic Sediments: Evidence for a Low-Oxygen Atmosphere?								ASTROBIOLOGY				20	5			628	636		10.1089/ast.2019.2060		MAR 2020		MAY 1 2020	2020	Earth's ocean-atmosphere system has undergone a dramatic but protracted increase in oxygen (O-2) abundance. This environmental transition ultimately paved the way for the rise of multicellular life and provides a blueprint for how a biosphere can transform a planetary surface. However, estimates of atmospheric oxygen levels for large intervals of Earth's history still vary by orders of magnitude-foremost for Earth's middle history. Historically, estimates of mid-Proterozoic (1.9-0.8 Ga) atmospheric oxygen levels are inferred based on the kinetics of reactions occurring in soils or in the oceans, rather than being directly tracked by atmospheric signatures. Rare oxygen isotope systematics-based on quantifying the rare oxygen isotope O-17 in addition to the conventionally determined O-16 and O-18-provide a means to track atmospheric isotopic signatures and thus potentially provide more direct estimates of atmospheric oxygen levels through time. Oxygen isotope signatures that deviate strongly from the expected mass-dependent relationship between O-16, O-17, and O-18 develop during ozone formation, and these "mass-independent" signals can be transferred to the rock record during oxidation reactions in surface environments that involve atmospheric O-2. The magnitude of these signals is dependent upon pO(2), pCO(2), and the overall extent of biospheric productivity. Here, we use a stochastic approach to invert the mid-Proterozoic Delta O-17 record for a new estimate of atmospheric pO(2), leveraging explicit coupling of pO(2) and biospheric productivity in a biogeochemical Earth system model to refine the range of atmospheric pO(2) values that is consistent with a given observed Delta O-17. Using this approach, we find new evidence that atmospheric oxygen levels were less than similar to 1% of the present atmospheric level (PAL) for at least some intervals of the Proterozoic Eon.									13	3	0	0	4	0	15			1531-1074	1557-8070		WOS:000522898600001	32228301

However, ingenious design and preparation of bi-metal SACs is still difficult to further enhance the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity. Herein, modified zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (SiO2@Fe-ZIF-8/67) was facilely designed to preparation atomically dispersed Fe and Co doping 3D nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (A-FeCo@NCNs). The Fe or Co single atoms are identified to be coordinated with N atoms and form FeN4, CoN4 or N3Fe-CoN3 anchored on 3D defect carbon, which act as reactive sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Through synergetic coupling effect, A-FeCo@NCNs exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with ORR/OER potential gap of 0.80 V. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further indicate the synergistic effect between Fe and Co in A-FeCo@NCNs towards the enhancing ORR activity. The as-prepared catalyst assembled Zn-air battery shows a maximum power density, and superb cycling stability, surpassing that based on commercial Pt/C + IrO2. Results from this study may provide a facile method for precious control of dual-metal single sites doped carbon with highly activity and durability for bifunctional electrocatalysis.

The graphene-coated copper NW networks retain a low sheet resistance of less than 25 Omega sq(-1) even after annealing at a temperature of 240 degrees C in a pure oxygen environment for 1 h, while a sheet resistance less than 100 Omega sq(-1) can still be maintained in natural sea water, and acidic and basic solutions. Their highly stable features in harsh environments make these graphene-coated copper nanowire networks suitable as a catalyst toward high efficiency hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) with a low overpotential of 252 mV at 10 mA Cm-2 and a low Tafel slope of 67 mV dec(-1).

The exploitation of efficient hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) bifunctional electrocatalysts is undoubtedly a vital spark yet challenging for imperative green sustainable energy. Herein, through introducing a simple pH regulated redox reaction into a tractable hydrothermal procedure, a hierarchical Fe3O4@MnOx binary metal oxide core-shell nano-polyhedron was designed by evolving MnOx wrapped Fe3O4. The MnOx effectively prevents the agglomeration and surface oxidation of Fe3O4 nano-particles and increases the electrochemically active sites. Benefiting from the generous active sites and synergistic effects of Fe3O4 and MnOx, the Fe3O4@MnOx-NF nanocomposite implements efficient HER/OER bifunctional electrocatalytic performance and overall water splitting. As a result, hierarchical Fe3O4@MnOx only requires a low HER/OER overpotential of 242/188 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 116.4/77.6 mV dec(-1), combining a long-term cyclability of 5 h. Impressively, by applying Fe3O4@MnOx as an independent cathode and anode, the overall water splitting cell supplies a competitive voltage of 1.64 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) and super long cyclability of 80 h. These results reveal that this material is a promising candidate for practical water electrolysis application.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000719452200001	34787163

However, the mechanism behind such an unusually high activity has remained largely unclear. To solve this puzzle, a decomposition-and-reaction mechanism is proposed for the OER with the dinuclear FeIII(ppq) complex as the initial state of the catalytic agent. In this mechanism, the high-valent dinuclear iron complex first dissociates into two mononuclear moieties, and the oxidized mononuclear iron complexes directly catalyze the formation of an O-O bond through a nitrate attack pathway with nitrate functioning as a cocatalyst. Density functional theory calculations reveal that it is the electron-deficient microenvironment around the iron center that gives rise to the remarkable catalytic activity observed experimentally. Therefore, the outstanding performance of the Fe-III(ppq) catalyst can be ascribed to the high reactivity of its mononuclear moieties in a high oxidation state, which is concomitant with the structural stability of the lowvalent dinuclear complex. The theoretical insights provided by this study could be useful for the optimization and design of novel iron-based water oxidation catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000653539100052	33914515

Several open questions concerning thesein situformed LOH remain such as: an explanation for their strongly varying activities, or the effect of the precatalyst structure, leaching anions, and transformation conditions on the formed LOH. Herein, we report on a cobalt selenite precursor, which, depending on pH and potential, transforms irreversibly into two different LOH OER catalysts. Combining multiple electrochemical and analytical methodsexandin situ, we prove that one of these products is near-surface catalytically active and the other one throughout the bulk with anin situaverage cobalt oxidation state of 3.2. We deduce a detailed structural model explaining these differences and propose general concepts relating both the precatalyst structure and the transformation conditions to the final catalyst. Further, we apply these models to the most promising non-noble metal catalyst, NiFe LOH.									44	0	0	0	3	0	44			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000579868500025

Herein, we designed and synthesized a high-efficiency and stable catalyst with low ruthenium content CoRu alloy nanoparticles supported on porous nitrogen-doped graphene layers (CoRux@N-C) via pyrolysis of small organic metal molecules. The amount of ruthenium in the catalyst that showed the highest activity was only 5.07 wt %. CoRu0.25@N-C can efficiently catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a wide pH range and low overpotential to drive current densities of 10 mA.cm(-2) of only 27 mV (1.0 M KOH) and 94 mV (0.5 M H2SO4). CoRu0.25@N-C also showed decent durability with negligible degradation after and alkaline solutions. It also has excellent catalytic activity and can easily sustain 1000 cyclic-voltammetry cycles in both acidic ammonia borane hydrolysis with an initial turnover frequency (TOF) of 457.8 mol(H2) min(-1) mol(cat)(-1) under ambient conditions. CoRu0.25@N-C can readily perform both NH3BH3 hydrolytic dehydrogenation and electrochemical hydrogen evolution as a result of its highly specific surface area, carbon layer protection, metal vacancies, and a porous carbon matrix doped with heteroatoms. The creation of a multifunctional composite/hybrid by the use of small metal organic molecules can lead to cost-effective and highly efficient catalysts for energy conversion.									76	7	0	0	2	0	78			2168-0485			WOS:000463462100061

PES films have been irradiated both with 6 keV Ar and 3 keV e(-) beams. The Ar irradiation is assumed to be representative of the processes which strictly depend on collisional energy loss, while the electron irradiation puts in evidence mainly the processes related to electronic energy loss.In particular, three basic chemical reactions have been followed by XPS: 1) the reduction of the sulphonyl groups (-SO2-) to sulphidic-like groups (-S-); 2) the elimination of sulphur-containing groups; 3) the formation of new oxygen-containing groups, as ether, hydroxyl or carbonyl groups. Differences are observed when irradiating with Ar and with e(-) projectiles both for the rate of evolution of the different species and for the quantitative trends of modification.The rates of the reactions 1) and 2) are found to depend essentially on the total deposited energy. The trend and the rate of reaction 3) depend dramatically on the energy transfer mechanism.The key factor determining the sensitivity to the energy deposition mechanisms seems to be the inherent chemical selectivity of the involved reactions. In particular, this means that some types of reactions are sensitive to the energy transfer mechanism due to their selectivity (as it is the case of the ''oxygen attachment'' reactions), while others will depend only on the total deposited energy (as the sulphur loss or the sulphonyl reduction) due to the availability of many concurrent pathways producing a random succession of chemical events yielding an unique product.					8th International Conference on Radiation Effects in Insulators (REI-8) - Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms8th International Conference on Radiation Effects in Insulators (REI-8) - Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms	SEP 11-15, 1995SEP 11-15, 1995	Catania Univ, Phys Dept; Catania Univ, Dept Chem Sci; Catania Ric ConsortiumCatania Univ, Phys Dept; Catania Univ, Dept Chem Sci; Catania Ric Consortium	CATANIA, ITALYCATANIA, ITALY	16	0	0	0	2	0	16			0168-583X			WOS:A1996VG59200048

Herein, we report a scalable strategy to fabricate nanoporous Ag2Al intermetallic compound as a self-standing cathode for the hybrid Zn battery. The abundant surface oxygen species, the Ag-Al intermetallic interaction and the npAg(2)Al@AgAlOx interface cooperatively contributed to the catalytic ORR activity. The electrode endows efficient catalytic oxygen reduction (a Tafel slope of 38.0 mV/dec and an onset potential of 0.998 V) and regulated redox activity as compared with Ag. The nanoporous channels allow efficient ion transport, interface charge exchange and gas molecular diffusion. Significantly, the assembled hybrid Zn-Ag2Al/air battery delivers a high capacity of 3.23 mAh/cm(2) as compared with recent reports. As far as we know, this is the first exploration for the electrochemical property of Ag2Al, and it would inspire more exploration in developing multifunctional materials and robust hybrid batteries for practical applications.

But there remain enormous uncertainties about the atomistic interactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface (EEI). As the first step toward an understanding of the EEI, we report here the details of the initial steps of H2O adsorption and complex formation on a Ag(111) surface, based on coupling quantum mechanics (QM) and ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) experiments. We find a close and direct comparison between simulation and experiment, validated under various isotherm and isobar conditions. We identify five observable oxygen-containing species whose concentrations depend sensitively on temperature and pressure: chemisorbed O* and OH*, H2O* stabilized by hydrogen bond interactions with OH* or O*, and multilayer H2O*. We identify the species experimentally by their O 1s core-level shift that we calculate with QM along with the structures and free energies as a function of temperature and pressure. This leads to a chemical reaction network (CRN) that we use to predict the time evolution of their concentrations over a wide range of temperature (298-798 K) and pressure conditions (10(-6)-1 Torr), which agree well with the populations determined from APXPS. This multistep simulation CRN protocol should be useful for other heterogeneous catalytic systems.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000466987900026	30945541

However, the high overpotential, time consumed synthesis process and complicated working condition largely limit their application. In the present work, a one-step approach to fabricate Schiff base cobalt complex modified electrode is developed. Microrod clusters (MRC) and rough spherical particles (RSP) can be obtained on the ITO electrode through different electrochemical deposition condition. Both of the MRC and RSP present favorable activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared to the commercial Co3O4, taking an overpotential of 650 mV and 450 mV to drive appreciable catalytic current respectively. The highly active and stable RSP shows a Tafel plot of 84 mV dec(-1) and negligible decrease of the current density for 12 h bulk electrolysis. The synthesis strategy of effective and stable catalyst in this work provide a simple method to fabricate heterogeneous OER catalyst with Schiff base metal complex. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The chemical modification of graphene sheets with aromatic diazonium ions (carbon attachment) is analyzed by con focal Raman spectroscopy. The temporal and spatial evolution of surface-adsorbed species allows accurate tracking of the chemical reaction and identification of intermediates. The controlled transformation of sp(2) to sp(3) carbon proceeds in two separate steps. The presented derivatization is faster for single-layer graphene and allows controlled transformation of adsorbed diazonium reagents into covalently bound surface derivatives with enhanced reactivity at the edge of single-layer graphene. On bilayer graphene the derivatization proceeds to an adsorbed intermediate, which reacts slower to a covalently attached species on the carbon surface.									151	3	0	0	12	0	151			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000278629300010	20449850

Combining the high-resolution and intense synchrotron radiation with the supersonic molecular beams technique, we have succeeded in the analysis of the time evolution of Si oxidation states (Si1+, Si2+, Si3+ and Si4+) induced by the translational kinetic energy of O-2 (Et-O2 = 0.04, 0.6, 2.0 and 3.0 eV). Furthermore, we proposed that the oxidation on a clean Si(0 0 l)-2 x I surface progressed in the mechanism of almost consecutive Si oxidation in the low translational kinetic energy region. It was found that the translational kinetic energy Of O-2 induced the adsorption of oxygen atom at the bridge site between the Si dimer and at the backbonds of the Si dimers and the subsurface.

It has been well understood in our recent work that the secondary metal dopant at B-site (e.g., Mn in LaMnxCo(1 x)O(3)) can regulate the electronic structure and improve the ORR/OER activity. In this work, the Mn-Ni pairs are employed as the dual dopant in LaMnxNiyCozO3 (x + y + z = 1) catalysts toward bifunctional ORR and OER. The structure-property relationships between the triple metal B-site (Mn, Ni and Co) and the electrochemical performance are particularly investigated. Compared to the individual Mn doping (e.g., LaMnCoO3 (Mn:Co = 1:3) catalyst), the dual Mn-Ni doping significantly improves the ORR mass activity@0.8 V by 1.54 times; meanwhile, the OER overpotential@l 0 mA cm(2) is reduced from 420 to 370 mV, and the OER current density at 1.55 V is increased by 2.43 times. Reasonably, the potential gap between E-ORR@-1 mA cm(2) and E-OER @10 mA cm(2) is achieved as only 0.76 V by using the optimal LaMnxNiyCozO3 (x:y:z = 1:2:3) catalyst. It is revealed that the dual Mn-Ni dopant efficiently optimizes electron structures of the LaMnNiCoO3 (1:2:3) catalyst, which not only decreases the e(g) orbital electron number, but also modulates the 0 2p-band closer to the Femi level, accounting for the enhanced bifunctional activity.

Journal of colloid and interface science				623				520	531		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.05.045				2022-Oct	2022	Crystal plane effect has attracted remarkable attention in the process of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation in water. In this work, nanocube-Co3O4 (Co3O4-NC), nanoplate-Co3O4 (Co3O4-NP) and nanorod-like Co3O4 (Co3O4-NR) with (100), (111) and (110) plane predominant exposure is prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. Co3O4-NR with (110) plane exposed possesses more lattice defects (oxygen vacancies, Ov) and low oxidation state Co (Co2+), consequently, it exhibits a superior activity for PMS activation to efficiently remove bisphenol A (BPA) in water. Furthermore, it could be used in a widely water pH values ranging from 5.0 to 9.0 with an excellent PMS activited effects. During Co3O4-NR/PMS oxidation process, it is found that singlet oxygen (1O2) plays a dominant role in BPA degradation. However, Co3O4-NR treated by H2O2 shows a poor PMS activation performance, confirming Ov acting as the active site during such oxidation process. The important effect of dissolved oxygen is tested by Ar introduction into the reaction system and the Ov-O* metastable intermediate is proposed. In situ Raman proves the interaction between dissolved oxygen and Ov and then the intermediate activates PMS to degrade BPA. This work not only explores the effect of different crystal plane exposures on PMS activation in Co3O4/PMS system, but investigates the evolution of Ov during the PMS activation.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5				1095-7103		MEDLINE:35598482	35598482

A key enabling factor is the effective synthesis of active materials, which, due to the global environmental circumstances and the growing demand, we must ensure are made sustainably. Thus, we unveil a rapid, sustainable, and scalable electrosynthesis route for a whole range of nanocrystalline materials with bright prospects for batteries, solar fuels and fuel cells, among others. For the proof of concept of the synthesis method, gas-diffusion electrocrystallization (GDEx), we synthesize manganese and cobalt oxides and hydroxides: Co-doped Na-birnessite, cubic/tetragonal spinels and layered double hydroxides (CoMn-LDH), owing to their current relevance. An oxygen depolarizing gas-diffusion electrode is used to fuel the oxidative synthesis at the electrochemical interface. Aside from the necessary metal precursors, all reagents are producedin situwith high efficiency. To elucidate the synthesis mechanism, a broad range of materials were produced under the same conditions. By changing the Co and Mn concentrations in the feed solution, the composition (Co/Mn stoichiometry), morphology (spinelsvs.nanosheets), structure (tetragonal/cubic-spinel, birnessite, LDH), particle size (15-35 nm), crystallinity (polycrystalline particlesvs.single-crystals), and phase purity were precisely tailored. A comprehensive library of nanostructures was built, wherein some materials exhibited outstanding catalytic properties for the oxygen evolution reaction, illustrating the significance of our strategy. To showcase the versatility of the method, we also prove the feasibility for sodium intercalation capacity in the materials, applicable to batteries. This work opens the door to a new systematic way of producing optimized and affordable materials for electrochemical energy applications and beyond.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000542761900019

The sample was well characterized via SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS and BET methods. The Co-NCNT shows excellent and stable catalytic performance for OER. The overpotential of Co-NCNT at 10 mA cm(-2). is 370 mV (vs RHE). The current density of Co-NCNT could reach 100 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 520 mV, which showed much better performance than RuO2, while the largest current density of RuO2 could reach is only 44 mA cm(-2). The Tafel slope of Co-NCNT is 56 mV dec(-1), which is smaller than that of commercial RuO2 (58 mV dec(-1)). The results indicate that metal-melamine based CPs or MOFs can be promising precursors for the preparation of efficient metal-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon materials for electrocatalysis.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000406572600030

Although many OER electrocatalysts have been developed to negotiate this difficult reaction, substantial progresses in the design of cheap, robust, and efficient catalysts are still required and have been considered a huge challenge. Here, we report a composite material consisting of CoSe2 nanobelts anchored on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxides (denoted as NG-CoSe2) as a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst. In 0.1 M KOH, the new NG-CoSe2 catalyst afforded a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of mere 0.366 V and a small Tafel slope of similar to 40 mV/decade, comparing favorably with the state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst. This NG-CoSe2 catalyst also presents better stability than that of RuO2 under harsh OER cycling conditions. Such good OER performance is comparable to the best literature results and the synergistic effect was found to boost the OER performance. These results raise the possibility for the development of effective and robust OER electrodes by using cheap and easily prepared NG-CoSe2 to replace the expensive commercial catalysts such as RuO2 and IrO2.									453	17	0	0	19	0	458			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000334990600096	24649855

Herein, we reported a self-supported Mo modified hierarchical nanoporous Cu as an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution. The optimized nanoporous Cu-Mo electrocatalysts with extremely dilute Mo content exhibits a high HER activity with a negligible onset potential, a small Tafel slope, and an excellent durability in alkaline solution. The dealloying process provides nanoporous Cu-Mo electrocatalysts a unique three-dimensional interconnected bicontinuous nanoporous architecture, which can not only offer high-density catalytic active sites for HER, but also accelerate the desorption of hydrogen molecule from catalysts surface. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the introducing of Mo into Cu matrix can accelerate water adsorption and dissociation and optimize adsorption-desorption energetics of H intermediates, thus improving the intrinsic HER activity of nanoporous Cu-Mo electrocatalysts.

The results show that Ni ions have been successfully doped into the CuCoO2 crystal structure and this Ni introduction can reduce its grain size, and 5 at% Ni doped CCO (5NCCO) nanosheets exhibit an average particle size of 386 nm with thicknesses around 28 nm. The optimal Ni@5NCCO electrode needs an overpotential of 409 mV to generate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and is able to sustain galvanostatic OER electrolysis for 18 hours with only a minor degradation of 30 mV. The enhanced OER performance may be due to the increase in the catalytic activity area and the improvement in conductivity, which is caused by a decrease in grain size and the formation of a porous structure for Ni doped Cu-BTC derived CuCoO2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000803461500001	35612865

Herein, we adopted a Co metal zeolitic imidazolate framework (Co-ZIF) as a precursor by ion-exchange/etching reaction with Fe(NO3)(3) to obtain hierarchical N-doped Co-Fe layered double hydroxide (CoFe-LDH) in situ generated in Co-ZIF nanoarrays based on a self-supported carbon cloth (CC) substrate noted as CoFe-LDH@Co-ZIF@CC. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of these species and their highly ordered self-supported nanoarray structure, the catalytic active sites were fully exposed and highly protected in alkaline electrolyte, which significantly promoted electron transport and improved electrochemical performance. The CoFe-LDH@Co-ZIF@CC exhibited the low overpotentials of about 225 and 319 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 81.8 mV dec(-1) recorded in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. In addition, it also showed a long-term durability without obvious decay after 30 h. Therefore, its remarkable OER activity demonstrates this material's promising application in the green hydrogen energy industry.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1996-1944		WOS:000819113700001	35744229

Mo-Fe/CaCO3 and Fe/CaCO3 have been used as the catalysts for the growth step, which Fe/CaCO3 produced the more appropriate products with smaller diameters in higher yield. Moreover, different growth temperatures were used and among all examined temperatures (750, 800, 850, 900 degrees C), the product produced at 750 degrees C (SCP750) has the smallest diameter, the highest sulfur content and the least defect in its structure. The product with 0.5% Mo content in the catalyst showed the highest yield and The I-D/I-G ratio of SCP750 is less than that of SCP900. The sulfur content of in SCP750, SCP800, SCP850, and SCP900 (using EDS analyses) are respectively 7.6, 3.8, 6.9, and 5.7 w/w%. The porosity of the product (SCP750) was examined using adsorption-desorption diagrams, which showed macro-porous structures with the diameters of the pores between 40 and 80 nm and high surface area (770.9 m(2)/g). Finally, the abilities of all products (CPs and all SCPs) as a catalyst for sustainable energy processes, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were investigated. In both electrochemical reactions, SCPs had better activities than CPs. However, the products showed appropriate efficiencies only in OER reaction and among doped products, SCP750 and SCP800 showed the highest catalytic efficiencies. The results showed that doping is an appropriate way to enhance the catalytic ability of this type of non-metal materials in OER and HER reactions.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-7442	1944-7450		WOS:000476978700001

In this study, a novel catalyst consisting of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) on TiOx/Ccomposites (TiOx-Vo-H/C) with abundant oxygen vacancies (Vo) is proposed, which isabbreviated as PTO-Vo-H/C. The introduction of Vohelps anchor highly dispersed PtNPs with low loading and strengthen the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), whichbenefits to the enhanced ORR catalytic activity. Moreover, the accelerated durability test(ADT) demonstrates the higher retention of ORR activity for PTO-Vo-H/C. Experimentaland theoretical analyses reveal that electronic interactions between Pt NPs and TiOx/Ccomposite support give rise to an electron-rich Pt NPs and strong SMSI effect, which isfavorable for the electron transfer and stabilization of Pt NPs. More importantly, theassembled PEMFC with PTO-Vo-H/C shows only 6.9% of decay on maximum powerdensity after 3000 ADT cycles while the performance of Pt/C sharply decreased. Thiswork provides a new insight into the unique vacancy regulation of dispersive Pt on metal oxides for superior ORR performance									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000779822100035	35289604	
J	Zhang, Xian-Fu; Guo, Wenfeng								Indole substituted zinc phthalocyanine: Improved photosensitizing ability and modified photooxidation mechanism								JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY A-CHEMISTRY				225	1			117	124		10.1016/j.jphotochem.2011.10.008				DEC 1 2011	2011	The photophysical and photochemical processes within a novel photosensitizer (PS), zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) modified by indole units, were explored. The properties related to photodynamic therapy of tumor (PDT) were studied by time-resolved transient UV-vis absorption spectra, steady state and time-resolved fluorescence spectra, and chemical trapping of singlet oxygen by diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF). Intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer (PET) within the conjugate from the indole subunits (donor A), to S-1 (excited singlet state) of ZnPc moiety (acceptor D), is featured by the significant decrease of fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime of ZnPc moiety, and the occurrence of transient absorption bands of ZnPc center dot- at 570 and 630 nm. The triplet state, on the other hand, was not quenched by indole units. The kinetics and thermodynamics of PET were analyzed quantitatively, and the quantum efficiency of PET is computed to be 38%, almost double of the emission efficiency (20%). The quantum efficiency of triplet (T-1) formation is 0.50 and the quantum yield of DPBF photooxidation is 0.72. Both are larger than the expected value of 0.32. The evolution of transient absorption spectra showed that the charge separation state (ZnPc center dot--indole(center dot+)) recombined to triplet state ZnPc(T-1)-indole, which is responsible for the high yield of T-1 formation. In the presence of oxygen, both T-1 and ZnPc center dot- were quenched efficiently, which forms singlet oxygen and superoxide anion, respectively. DPBF is therefore photo-oxidized by both singlet oxygen (Type II reaction, 46%) and superoxide anion radical (Type I reaction, 54%), which led to the high yield of photooxidation. This is in contrast to free ZnPc PS, in which only singlet oxygen is responsible for the photooxidation. The result suggests that the reaction mechanism is changed upon conjugation so that the importance of Type I reaction is greatly enhanced, and the indole-conjugated ZnPc is an even better PS than the free ZnPc.

However, the intangible evolution of structure in popular synthetic routes containing pyrolysis leads to discrete and irregular M-Nx sites, resulting in limited descriptors and thus ambiguous understandings of structure-activity relationships. We report here a facile method to synthesize Cu-Nx sites of high homogeneity anchored on carbon substrates through deposition and carbonization of glycoluril on metallic copper surface. The Cu-Nx sites take shape under the surface regulation of metallic copper and preferentially exposed after removal of excess Cu. The optimal catalyst presents efficient activity towards ORR with a half-wave potential of 0.84 V (vs. RHE). More importantly, linear relationships over the catalyst between current densities and electrochemical active surface areas (ECSAs) are derived, suggesting activities countable by ECSAs. The correlation clearly demonstrates the high homogeneity and catalytic accessibility of surface-regulated Cu-Nx sites. The well-elucidated structure-activity relationship identifies Cu-Nx sites as originates of catalytic ORR at an experimental level and sheds light on rational engineering of catalysts containing M-Nx sites.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000656776700001

Our Ni-doped Zn(O,S) catalyst reached the highest hydrogen generation rate of 14,800 mol g(-1) h(-1) or 0.92 mmol g(-1) h(-1) W-1 corresponding to apparent quantum yield 31.5%, which was 2.3 times higher compared to the TiO2/Pt used as a control in this work. It was found that a small amount of Ni doped into Zn(O,S) nanoparticles could increase the optical absorbance, lower the charge transfer resistance, accordingly decrease the electron-hole recombination rate, and significantly enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The as-prepared catalyst has the characteristics of low cost, low power consumption for activating the catalytic HER, abundant and environmental friendly constituents, and low surface oxygen bonding for forming oxygen vacancies. The photocatalytic performance of Ni-doped Zn(O,S) was demonstrated with a proposed kinetic mechanism in this paper. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, porous nonprecious metal catalysts (PNMCs) have received tremendous interest for application in the OER. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) built from metal ions and organic linkers have been demonstrated to be promising precursors for preparing PNMCs for the OER owing to their tunable structures/compositions, high surface area and large pore volume. Benefitting from the versatility of compositional/structural modification, MOFs and MOFs-derived PNMCs are robust in generating various high density active sites, which greatly contribute to their electrochemical OER performances. In this review, we first summarize the composition engineering of pristine MOFs and their derivatives, such as heteroatom-doped carbon, metal oxides/phosphides/sulfides/selenides and their hybrids, followed by structural/morphology engineering, including nano-coating and nano-perforating, and the configuration of high-dimensional architecture and single atom sites. Simultaneously, insights toward an in-depth understanding of the actual active sites and the intrinsic mechanism for OER enhancement are highlighted combined with experimental and theoretical studies. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for engineering MOF-based electrocatalysts are addressed.									104	6	0	0	6	0	104			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000466314400003

Herein, it is demonstrated that a novel class of hydrothermally grown dual-phase heterogeneous electrocatalysts, in which silver-manganese (AgMn) heterometal nanoparticles are anchored on top of 2D nanosheet-like nickel vanadium oxide (NiV2O6), allows an enlarged surface area and efficient charge transfer/redistribution, resulting in a bifunctional OER/ORR superior to those of conventional Pt/C or RuO2. The dual-phase NiV2O6/AgMn catalysts on the air cathode of a zinc-air battery lead to a stable discharge-charge voltage gap of 0.83 V at 50 mA cm(-2), with a specific capacity of 660 mAh g(-1) and life cycle stabilities of more than 146 h at 10 mA cm(-2) and 11 h at 50 mA cm(-2). The proposed new class of dual-phase NiV2O6/AgMn catalysts are successfully applied as pouch-type zinc-air batteries with long-term stability over 33.9 h at 10 mA cm(-2).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2198-3844		WOS:000853572300001	36104225

Therefore magnitude and eventual effects of isotopic chirality caused by natural abundance isotopic substitution (H, C, O, Zn) in the reagents of the Soai reaction were analyzed by combinatorics and probability calculations. Expectable enantiomeric excesses were calculated by the Pars-Mills equation. It has been found that the chiral isotopic species formed by substitution in the otherwise achiral reagents provide enantiomeric excess (e.e.) levels that are higher than the sensitivity threshold of the Soai autocatalysis towards chiral induction. Consequently, possible chiral induction exerted by these e.e. values should be taken into account in considerations regarding the molecular events and the mechanism of the chiral induction in the Soai reaction.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2073-8994			WOS:000369508500003

Based on a fine control of the oxidation process conditions, experiments allow the investigation of the growth kinetics of nanometric oxide layer. The theoretical model is formulated using a reaction rate approach. In this framework, the oxide thickness is estimated with the evolution of the various species during the reaction. Standard oxidation models and the reaction rate approach are confronted with these experiments. The interest of the reaction rate approach to improve silicon oxidation modeling in the nanometer range is clearly demonstrated.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0021-8979	1089-7550		WOS:000245317700167

In this work, a bimetallic NiFeP catalyst is coated on nickel phosphide rods grown on nickel foam (NiFeP@NiP@NF). This self-supported and interfacially connected electrode structure is favorable for mass transfer and reducing electrical resistance during electrocatalysis. The preparation of NiFeP@NiP@NF is optimized in terms of (i) the coprecipitation time of the NiFe Prussian blue analogue layer that serves as phosphides precursor and (ii) the phosphidation temperature. The optimized sample exhibits excellent OER performance delivering current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 227 and 252 mV in 1.0 M KOH, respectively, and maintaining 10 mA cm(-2) for more than 120 h without obvious degradation. Moreover, it can also be operated as a hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst, requiring an overpotential of 105 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in the same medium. Thus, the as-prepared material was tentatively utilized as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in a symmetric electrolyzer, requiring a voltage bias of 1.57 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, while exhibiting outstanding stability.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000657202500035	33974401

Herein, three different sizes of hollow octadecahedron Cu2O crystals, with different degrees of exposed {110} facets, were developed and exhibited excellent, stable photocatalytic degradation performances. This study has shown that the intermediates in the photocatalytic degradation process are mainly peroxy radicals from the reaction of excited electrons in the Cu2O conduction band with oxygen molecules adsorbed on the surface. In the photodegradation process of the hollow octadecahedron (HO) Cu2O crystals, the excited-state electrons must break away from the work function restriction before participating in the reaction. HO-2 has achieved the best photocatalytic properties due to its smallest work function as a determining factor affecting the photocatalytic activity.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000441583300040	30027959

Based on the resulting particle size, phase composition, passivity against corrosion and electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions, microwave synthesis appears to be a simple heating procedure which can be carried out more rapidly than conventional methods. Because microwave synthesis produces finer grain size than furnace heating. its products function better as electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions. The role of KCl, Ni(II), Fe(II) and Mn(II) present as reactants during microwave synthesis is demonstrated. Also presented for the first time is the electrocatalytic activity obtained from tantalum carbide synthesised under microwave heating.

(1991) Photosynth. Res. 30, 123-130]. Since the binding sites of these cofactors are protected by a shield of three extrinsic polypeptides (17, 23 and 33 kDa), we investigated whether these metal ions affect the extrinsic polypeptide shield of OEC. By immunoblotting with antibodies recognizing the 23 and 33 kDa polypeptides, we showed that both the metal ions significantly dissociated the 23 kDa (+17 kDa) polypeptide, and partially dissociated the 33 kDa. Ca2+, one of the important inorganic cofactors of oxygen evolution, strongly prevented the dissociating action of Pb2+ but did not prevent the action of Zn2+. The probable molecular mechanism of action of Pb2+ and Zn2+ on PSII OEC is discussed.									54	6	0	0	53	1	60			0014-5793			WOS:A1994PD82000033	8070582

It is shown that the radical density rapidly increases shortly after the discharge for all mixture compositions studied, although it does not contain water molecules. Afterwards this density decreases with a characteristic time much longer than the one estimated from the known reactivity of OH with CH3CHO. This emphasizes that processes other than oxidation of acetaldehyde by O-atoms play a significant role in OH radical production.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000232452900020

In this work, we demonstrate unexpected influence on the catalytic activity and selectivity of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) through the functionalization of Au with thiols. 2-Phenylethanethiol modified Au electrodes (2-PET-Au) show up to a 2-fold enhancement in both Faradaic efficiency and current density for CO evolution, between -0.6 and -0.9 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode. Functionalization with 2-mercaptopropionic acid, which has a readily ionized carboxylate group, leads to hydrogen evolution with up to 100% Faradaic efficiency at the expense of CO evolution. Remarkably, the adsorption of certain thiols on Au does not have a negative impact on the total current density compared to blank Au. We present evidence that it is due to ligand-induced reconstruction of Au surfaces resulting in the creation of structurally and chemically modified local reaction environments. Thus a thiol species such as 2-PET, which does not contain any nitrogen-based heterocycle with a charge transfer center, can induce the formation of active sites on Au that are electrochemically active toward CO2RR within the range of electrode potential that most of the ligand concentration remains stable on Au. Our findings suggest a simple, effective, and tunable way to modify the activity and selectivity of Au electrodes.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000472455800024

The synthesis of 3D hollow nanocoils (HNCs), however, is limited by the lack of an appropriate template or synthesis method, thereby restricting the wide-scale application of HNCs. Herein, a strategy for preparing HNCs by harnessing a single sacrificial template to modulate the interfacial reaction at a solid-liquid interface that allows the shape-regulated transition is studied. Furthermore, the triggering of the Kirkendall effect in 3D HNCs is demonstrated. Depending on the final state of the transition metal ions reduced during the electrochemical preparation of HNCs, the surface states of the binding anions and the composition of the HNCs can be tuned. In a single-component CrPO4 HNC with a clean surface, the Kirkendall effect of the coil shape is analyzed at various points throughout the reaction. The rough-surface multicomponent MnOxP0.21 HNCs are complexed with ligand-modified BF4-Mn3O4 nanoparticles. The fabricated nanocomposite exhibits an overpotential decrease of 25 mV at neutral pH compared to pure BF4-Mn3O4 nanoparticles because of the increased active surface area.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000698850600001	34561965

Mimicking nature's route can be a direct and feasible way for synthetic organic chemists to construct complicated molecules. However, lacking nature's ability to manipulate enzymes often prevents us from reproducing the same route. Modifying nature's approaches can provide a simpler synthetic alternative to access complex structural target molecules. Here we report a strategy that simplifies the synthesis of terpenes by inverting the order of nature's two-phase biosynthesis route. We first unite simple molecules into a polyfunctionalized linear polyenyne, with all the desired carbons and oxygens in the targeted places. This compound then undergoes polyenyne cycloisomerization, in the presence of all the functional groups, to give polyoxidized terpenes. The key reaction is a palladium-catalysed polyenyne cycloisomerization that not only tolerates the presence of all of the oxygen functionalities, but also is facilitated by them.Inverting the order of nature's two-phase biosynthesis of terpenes offers a strategy by which the synthesis of these compounds can be simplified.

Recently, metal organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived electrocatalysts have been widely studied in ORR and OER due to their large specific surface area and tunable pore structure. However, it is still a challenge to prepare hierarchical porous structure catalysts via facile approach, which is desired in the device manner. Herein, we synthesized a MOF-derived FeNi co-doped catalyst (termed as B-FeNi-N/C-1000) using the binary ligand strategy with a large specific area and suitable hierarchical pore structures which efficiently improves mass transfer to boost the high device performance. As a result, the B-FeNi-N/C-1000 exhibits an outstanding ORR performance with a half potential of 0.9 V vs. RHE and a low potential of 1.62 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media, which exceeds FeNi catalyst (i.e., FeNi-N/C-1000) via single ligand method and commercial Pt/C + IrO2. Additionally, the B-FeNi-N/C-1000 presents a higher power density of 102 mW cm(-2) and a long-term stability that only losses 2% after 95 h in the selfassembly Zn-air battery. Accordingly, this work can provide a facile method to synthesize efficient bifunctional catalyst for, but not limit to Zn-air flow batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately, rubrene also exhibits a rather low stability, affecting device lifetime, because it is very prone to photo-oxidation. In order to limit this problem, a new substituted-rubrene was synthesized, which should be more stable, still having a good transport behaviour in the solid state.In this paper, we show how molecule degradation by reaction with oxygen under light makes the solutions and thin films become colorless, as observed by monitoring in time the evolution of absorbance. We found that the degradation of rubrene in both solutions and thin films is faster than that of the fluorine-substituted molecule. These results demonstrate that the introduction of fluorine can be a way to enhance the stability of rubrene to photo-oxidation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recent researches focused on NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) as efficient, cost-effective electrocatalyst due to the proton and hydroxide adsorption kinetics by Ni and Fe. However, Cu has been known to exhibit higher adsorption of the proton, thus by replacing Ni with Cu in NiFe LDH shows potential for enhancing the chemical kinetics of HER due to filled d-orbitals and electron transfer. Here, we first demonstrate a strategy of modulating the electronic structure of CuFe LDH, by manipulating Cu/Fe ratio and nanostructure, to improve the HER catalysis of single layer and cost-effective transition metal LDHs in AE. The atomic allocations of Cu and Fe based on the proposed method in the synthesis of LDH allows for optimizing the proton and hydroxide adsorption during electrocatalysis, where the CuFe LDH generate a current density of - 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of - 110 mV and a highly enhanced electrolysis stability at - 100 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, a low overpotential of 257 mV (10 mA cm(-2)) is achieved. Advanced spectroscopic characterizations, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, confirms the electronic structure modulation with adjustment of Cu/Fe ratio; and the synchrotron sourced X-ray absorption spectroscopy unambiguously confirm the higher electron density of Cu and the unique M-O(H)-M structure that enhances water splitting by facilitating ion adsorption and electron transfer. The cathodic activation energy of 14.34 kJ mol(-1) is achieved by higher electronic density due to electronic modulation of the catalyst structure. This work demonstrates the insights of electronic structure modulation for the rational design of efficient catalysts without noble or rareearth metals for HER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000788281700003

Changes in the aromatic profiles were monitored during 12 months and compared to those of a wine packed in glass bottles. Wine in 1osPET bottles was differentiated from wine in glass or 3osPET bottles by ten aging markers such as cis-dioxane, ethyl pyruvate or furfural. Only trans-1,3-dioxolane allowed to discriminate wine in glass and in 3osPET bottles. Methionol, an oxygen sensitive aroma compound, was preserved in glass and 3osPET bottles but was slightly degraded (15%) in 1osPET bottles. Chemical reactions were the main cause of the aroma compound degradation. Indeed, the total amount of compounds sorbed only reached 160 mu g considering the bottles and the joint of cap after 12 months of storage. The use of PET with 3% of oxygen scavenger is adapted to pack wine for at least 12 months. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, for the first time, a facile strategy is developed to synthesize M (M = Fe, Cu, Zn, Mo) doped bimetallic sulfide heterostructure Ni3S2/Co3S4 electrocatalysts. The as-prepared bifunctional Cu-Ni3S2/Co3S4 electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for HER and OER in 1 M KOH electrolyte, and it requires only an overpotential of 79 mV (150 mV) to deliver 10 mA cm-2 (20 mA cm-2) current density for HER process. Moreover, it shows a considerable low cell voltage of 1.49 V at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 in a two-electrode configuration which is far surpassing most of the reported bifunctional metal sulfides. Meanwhile, besides increasing the specific surface area of the electrocatalyst by optimizing the microstructure, the introduction of Cu cation could also stimulate the formation of high-valent Ni/Co sites, which can be verified by XPS technique. Density function theory calculations demonstrate that the Cu-doping boosts the formation of high valent Co sites and enhances the charge transfer performance of Ni and Co species, thus promotes intrinsic catalytic activity through modulating the d-band center of Co and reducing the adsorption energy of H and O-containing intermediates (H*, OH*, OOH*) on the surface of the catalyst. This work suggests the importance of exploitation of transition metal ion-doping for promoting the electrocatalytic activity of bimetallic sulfides.									78	3	0	0	5	0	78			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663203000004

Herein, we present a high-performance bifunctional catalyst with cobalt and manganese oxides supported on porous carbon (Co3O4/MnO2/PQ-7). The optimized Co3O4/MnO2/PQ-7 exhibited a comparable ORR performance with commercial Pt/C and a more superior OER performance than all of the other prepared catalysts, including commercial Pt/C. When applied to practical aqueous (6.0 M KOH) zinc-air batteries, the Co3O4/MnO2/porous carbon hybrid catalysts exhibited exceptional performance, such as a maximum discharge peak power density as high as 257 mW cm(-2) and the most stable charge-discharge durability over 50 h with negligible deactivation to date. More importantly, a series of flexible all-solid-state zinc-air batteries can be fabricated by the Co3O4/MnO2/porous carbon with a layer-by-layer method. The optimal catalyst (Co3O4/MnO2/PQ-7) exhibited an excellent peak power density of 45 mW cm(-2). The discharge potentials almost remained unchanged for 6 h at 5 mA cm(-2) and possessed a long cycle life (2.5 h@5 mA cm(-2)). These results make the optimized Co3O4/MnO2/PQ-7 a promising cathode candidate for both liquid-type and flexible all-solid-state zinc-air batteries.									74	7	0	0	1	0	77			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000432205800030	29616793

Aragonite was the first carbonate to crystallize. It is rare, heterogeneously distributed within the meteorite matrix, and its mean oxygen isotope values are delta O-18 39.9 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand, Delta O-17 -0.3 +/- 1.0 parts per thousand (1 sigma). Calcite precipitated soon afterwards, and following a fall in solution Mg/Ca ratios, to produce small equant grains with a mean oxygen isotope value of delta O-18 37.5 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand, Delta O-17 1.4 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand (1 sigma). These grains were partially or completely replaced by serpentine and tochilinite prior to precipitation of the second generation of calcite, which occluded an open fracture to form a millimetre-sized vein, and replaced anhydrous silicates within chondrules and the matrix. The vein calcite has a mean composition of delta O-18 18.4 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand, Delta O-17 -0.5 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand (1 sigma). Petrographic and isotopic results therefore reveal two discrete episodes of mineralisation that produced calcite generations with contrasting delta O-18, and mean Delta O-17 values. The aragonite and equant calcite crystallized over a relatively brief period early in the aqueous alteration history of the parent body, and from static fluids that were evolving chemically in response to mineral dissolution and precipitation. The second calcite generation crystallized from solutions of a lower Delta O-17, and a lower delta O-18 and/or higher temperature. As two generations of calcite whose petrographic characteristics and oxygen isotopic compositions are similar to those in LON 94101 occur in at least one other CM2, multiphase carbonate mineralisation could be the typical outcome of the sequence of chemical reactions during parent body aqueous alteration. It is equally possible however that the second generation of calcite formed in response to an event such as impact fracturing and concomitant fluid mobilisation that affected a large region of the common parent body of several CM2 meteorites. These findings show that integrated petrographic, chemical and isotopic studies can provide new insights into the mechanisms of parent body alteration including the spatial and temporal dynamics of the aqueous system.

Herein, a series of two-dimensional imide-based covalent organic framework (COFs) electrocatalysts toward the ORR is reported. The hydrodynamic electrochemical study reveals that 3.5 electrons are exchanged during the ORR indicating that the process catalyzed by these COFs has a clear preference for the 4-electron reduction pathway. The COFs contain conjugated electroactive napthalenediimide (NDI) moieties that provides the active sites for the electrocatalysis and promotes the formation of COFs with face-to-face pi-pi stacked structures to provide intrinsic porosity and large surface areas. These COFs can be essentially considered as an organized pattern of active sites embedded in the pore walls of the COF. The choice of suitable comonomers with variable distortions from planarity offers the possibility of obtaining these electroactive COFs with similar redox ability but different degrees of porosity and interlaminar spacing. This work evidences a new insight into developing novel families of electrocatalysts from COFs. Structure and stacking fashion of the COF-systems are investigated on the basis of DFT calculations, as well as the photoabsorption spectra of the representative molecular entities and a proof-of-concept rationalization of the intermediate steps of the ORR mechanism.

Herein, a facile and efficient approach is used to successfully construct Co/N-doped carbon composites (Co@NCs-T). The resultant Co@NCs-900 exhibits a rose-like hierarchical porous structure with high specific surface area (SSA), which can greatly expose a large number of active sites. The embedded cobalt nanoparticles contribute to the improvement of oxygen adsorption capacity and the enhancement for corrosion resistance performance of the metal active centers. The Co-N-x active sites resulted from the combination of Co and N species can increase the ORR catalytic activity. The Co@NCs-900 performs a four-electron reaction process and exhibits a good catalytic activity with a half-wave potential of 0.83 V and limiting current density of 5.93 mA cm(-2) in alkaline medium. The excellent ORR electro-catalytic activities of Co@NCs-900 benefits from the synergetic effect between pyridinic-N, graphitic-N and Co-N-x. The Zn-air battery assembled by Co@NCs-900 exhibits open circuit voltages of 1.441 V and a maximum power density of 57.63 mW cm(-2). Meanwhile, it shows outstanding reversibility and ultralong-life span (1116 h, 3045 cycles). In this work, the catalyst with a rose-like structure is successfully synthesized, and the mechanism of Co-N-x active sites in the ORR is investigated.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000691122500006

Herein, the ultrafine CoMnP nanocrystals confined in amorphous carbon nanosheets are designed and implemented by a topological transformation strategy from layer double hydroxide/carbon interconnected structures in one single nanosheet. The unique interconnected structure favors the exposure of active sites and enables stronger electronic coupling effect between the two phases. Experimental results and density functional theory simulations reveal that the surrounding amorphous carbon and Mn dopants synergistically enable better electron delocalization capacity of Co sites, potentially providing enhanced conductivity and optimal reaction energetics during hydrogen evolution.

Preoxidation experiments demonstrates that the former corresponds to the random-adsorption mode and the latter to the 2D-island growth mode. The obtained time evolutions for the two modes, not only the initial stage but also the one up to one monolayer coverage, are almost perfectly described with the autocatalytic reaction model developed by the authors. The physical background of the model is discussed to show that the coalescence of islands is properly involved in the model, which accounts for its ability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Plain Ru and MoO2 are not very active for the HER under alkaline conditions. In this work, we report the preparation of Ru-MoO2 nanocomposites via a facile in situ carburization of a Ru modified Mo-based metal-organic framework. The nanocomposites exhibited very low overpotential and superior stability to achieve 10 mA cm-2 under both acidic and alkaline conditions (55 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 29 mV in 1 M KOH). Their excellent performance under alkaline conditions was even better than that of 20% Pt/C. Our experimental and computational (DFT) results reveal that the remarkable activity stems from the synergistic interplay produced by strong electronic interactions between MoO2 and Ru nanoparticles. This modulated electronic structure accompanying enhanced electrical conductivity would significantly improve the catalytic activity. This strategy provides an insight into the design and synthesis of a low-cost and high performance alternative to Pt-based catalysts for the HER.									165	3	0	0	5	1	165			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000397605300027

In the process of the surface graphitization of nanodiamond with catalysis by FeCl3, B and N atoms from the decomposition of boric acid and melamine were directly introduced into the graphite lattice to form B, N co-doped graphitic carbon shell, while the core still retained the diamond structure. Electrochemical measurements of the BN-C/ND catalyst show much higher electrocatalytic activities towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium than its analogues doped with B or N alone (B-C/ND or N-C/ND). The high catalytic activity of BN-C/ND is attributed to the synergetic effect caused by co-doping of C/ND with B and N. Meanwhile, the BN-C/ND exhibits an excellent electrochemical stability due to the special shell/core structure. There is almost no alteration occurred in the cyclic voltammetry measurements for BN-C/ND before and after 5000 cycles. All experimental results prove that the BN-C/ND may be exploited as a potentially efficient and inexpensive non-noble metal cathode catalyst for ORR to substitute Pt-based catalysts in fuel cells.

However, CO produced from methanol oxidation can adsorb to H-2-evolution catalysts and drastically reduce activity. In this study, we explore the origins of CO immunity in Mo-containing H-2-evolution catalysts. Unlike conventional catalysts such as Pt or Ni, Mo-based catalysts display remarkable immunity to CO poisoning. The origin of this behavior in NiMo appears to arise from the apparent inability of CO to bind Mo under electrocatalytic conditions, with mechanistic consequences for the H-2-evolution reaction (HER) in these systems. This specific property of Mo-based HER catalysts makes them ideal in environments where poisons might be present.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000654558700001	33913578

There has been a continuous debate on whether autotrophic or heterotrophic metabolism came first. A very similar discussion exists concerning the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis and aerobic respiration. I put forward the synchronistic evolution hypothesis supposing that all metabolic processes develop in a bidirectional manner from the very first. Bidirectionality is claimed to be intrinsic to the evolution of all metabolic processes as (i) all biochemical reactions and enzymes are per se bidirectional, (ii) substrates need to be regenerated, and (iii) flux regulation requires flexibility of direction. Autotrophy and heterotrophy are thus inherent to each other. A scenario for the synchronistic development of oxygenic photosynthesis and aerobic respiration is described. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This substantial technology can be achieved in a two step-photoexcitation system using an artificial Z-scheme process. The key to comprehend this reaction is to discover an effective and robust photocatalyst which preferably makes sufficient use of solar energy. Benefiting from the ultrahigh surface area, appropriate band potentials and unique physiochemical properties of 2D layered structure, MoS2 has attained intensive research attention for hydrogen evolution reaction. The comprehensive review summarizes the recent progression in solid mediator Z-scheme based MoS2 particularly in the field of water splitting. The review initiates with the important bases of Z-scheme water splitting mechanism in addition to structural and optoelectronic properties of MoS2. In addition, detailed discussion on the solid-mediator Z-schemes to further improve the photocatalytic efficacy and limit the back (waterforming) reactions. The review mainly focuses on the solid-mediator based Z-schematic systems involving new tandem structures with an efficient synergistic effect to achieve both wide-range light absorptivity and charge pairs transference. In addition, a new S-scheme heterostructing is briefly introduced to understand the charge-transport route clearly and vividly. The aim of wide-spreading water splitting devices from lab-scale to wide-range potential applications has been considered as 'artificial photosynthetic leaf-to-tree challenge'. Finally, a summary and outlook on the challenges and future research topics on MoS2 based Z-scheme heterostructure photocatalysts are presented.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000686596600002

Given the tremendous progress in the synthesis of h-BN monolayers on transition metals and their potential as electrocatalysts, we investigate the electrocatalytic activities of h-BN/Ni, h-BN/Co, and h-BN/Cu interfaces for CO2 reduction by the first-principles density functional theory. We find that with the h-BN monolayer on the metal, electrons transfer from the metal to the interface and accumulate under the B atoms. By calculating the binding energies of three key intermediates (H, HCOO, and COOH) for hydrogen evolution and CO2 reduction, we find that H binding on the metal can be significantly weakened by the h-BN monolayer, preventing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the binding strength of HCOO is strong on both the metal and h-BN/metal, especially for Ni and Co, promoting the CO2 reduction channel. On the basis of the free-energy diagrams, we predict that h-BN/Ni and h-BN/Co will have very good electrocatalytic activities for CO2 reduction to HCOOH, while the competitive HER channel is filtered out by the surface h-BN monolayer. Our study opens a new way for selective electroreduction of CO2 via the interface engineering of the h-BN/metal system.									37	3	0	0	2	0	38			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000426143900070	29385799

Here we investigate the role of elastic strain on the catalytic activity of tungsten carbide (WC) in the hydrogen evolution reaction. WC makes an interesting material for such investigations as it is an inherently promising catalyst that can sustain larger elastic strains (e.g., -1.4 to 1.4%) than common transition-metal catalysts, such as Pt or Ni (e.g., -0.4 to 0.4%). On the basis of density functional theory calculations, a compressive uniaxial strain is expected to cause weakening of the surface hydrogen interaction of 10-15 meV per percent strain, while a tensile strain is calculated to strengthen the surface-hydrogen interaction by a similar magnitude. Sabatier analysis suggests that weakening of the surface-hydrogen interaction would enhance catalysis. We prepared 20 nm thin films of WC supported on thick polymer substrates and mechanically subjected them to uniaxial tensile and compressive loading, while the films catalyze hydrogen evolution in an electrochemical cell. We report a systematic shift in the hydrogen evolution sweeps of cyclic voltammetry measurements: Compressive strain increases the activity, and tensile strain has the opposite effect. The magnitude of the shift was measured to be 10-20 mV per 1% strain, which agrees well with the computations and corresponds to 5-10% of the difference in the overpotentials of WC and Pt. These results were further substantiated through chronoamperometry measurements and highlight how strain can be used to systematically improve catalytic activity.									39	1	0	0	2	0	40			1932-7447			WOS:000397546300038

The influence of the deposition condition on the microstructure and catalytic activity of the anodes was analyzed, showing different characteristics compared to the substrate steel structure. In particular, the catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in KOH 0.5 M solution showed an increase depending on the EPD conditions. The composite electrodes were also compared to other materials commonly applied in alkaline electrolysis in order to verify their effective electrocatalytic activity. In particular, the results were compared with electroplated platinum and cobalt with the aim of identifying the better synthesis technique. The results show that the EPD methodology can be adopted to provide an effective method for improving steel anodes of alkaline membrane electrolyzers.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000690891900001

However, the catalytic efficiency of traditional nanomaterials is still far below what is expected, because of their low stability in basic solutions and poor active site exposure yield. Here a unique hybrid nanomaterial comprising Co@Co3O4 core-shell nanoparticle (NP) encapsulated N-doped mesoporous carbon cages on reduced graphene oxide (denoted as Co@Co3O4@ NMCC/rGO) is successfully synthesized via a carbonization and subsequent oxidation strategy of a graphene oxide (GO)-based metal-organic framework (MOF). Impressively, the special carbon cage structure is very important for not only leading to a large active surface area, enhanced mass/charge transport capability, and easy release of gas bubbles, but also preventing Co@Co3O4 NPs from aggregation and peeling off during prolonged electrochemical reactions. As a result, in alkaline media, the resulting hybrid materials catalyze the OER with a low onset potential of similar to 1.50 V (vs. RHE) and an over-potential of only 340 mV to achieve a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for at least 25 h. In addition, metallic Co cores in Co@Co3O4 provide an alternative way for electron transport and accelerate the OER rate.									51	0	0	0	5	0	51			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000372608300020	26914166

The optimized NiSAFeSA-Ni@Fe-NPs/CNTs-NGNS catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activities, affording a positive onset potential of + 0.92 V along with a favorable 4e(-) pathway for ORR while delivering a low overpotential (eta) of 309 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER in alkaline medium. The synergistic effects caused by the enhanced OER and ORR allow the NiSAFeSA-Ni@Fe-NPs/CNTs-NGNS air-cathode to produce high-performance Zn- and Al-air batteries with exceptional cell voltage, power density, and durability, surpassing most materials reported so far. The developed Zn- and Al-air batteries deliver cell voltages of 1.41 and 1.61 V with high power density of 163 and 184 mW cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, they exhibit a stable cell voltage even after undergoing deformation testing and long-term charge-discharge operation of 170 h.

NOx-TPD profiles obtained for Ag/Al2O3 were identified by comparison with decomposition profiles of "model" AgNO3/Al2O3 and Al(NO3)(3)/Al2O3 prepared by impregnation of Al2O3 with individual AgNO3 and Al(NO3)(3) compounds. The data obtained indicate that H-2-induced NO adsorption leads to the formation of surface Ag and Al-nitrates. Their accumulation on the catalyst surface is accompanied by an intensive NO2 evolution, which proceeds primarily via reaction of surface nitrates with NO. Thus, NO2 formation appears to result from an intrinsic stage of the H-2-induced NOx adsorption process, rather than from the direct oxidation of NO by gaseous oxygen catalyzed by Ag.					14th Nordic Symposium on Catalysis14th Nordic Symposium on Catalysis	AUG 29-31, 2010AUG 29-31, 2010		Helsingor, DENMARKHelsingor, DENMARK	10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1022-5528	1572-9028		WOS:000300179400021

In this study, their oxidation behaviors were experimentally investigated using thermal gravimetric analysis. Microstructural evolution before and after oxidation was investigated using scanning electron microscope, mercury intrusion, and Raman spectroscopy. The apparent activation energy of NG-CT-10 nuclear graphite is 161.4 kJ/mol in a reaction temperature range of 550-700 degrees C and that of NG-CT-20 is 153.5 kJ/mol in a temperature range of 550-650 degrees C. The activation energy in the inner diffusion control regime is approximately half that in the kinetics control regime. At high temperatures, the binder phase is preferentially oxidized over the filler particles and small pores are generated in the binder. No new large or deep pores are generated on the graphite surfaces. Oxygen can diffuse along the boundaries of filler particles and through the binder phase, but cannot diffuse into the spaces between the nanocrystallites in the filler particles. Filler particles are oxidized starting at their outer surfaces, and the sizes of nanocrystallites do not decrease following oxidation.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1001-8042	2210-3147		WOS:000492016800001

Herein, a predesigned hybrid Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole framework was used to fabricate CoSe2/Co nanoheteroparticles embedded within hierarchically porous Co, N co-doped carbonnanopolyhedra/nanotubes (CoSe2/Co@NC-CNTs) through a facile approach involving controlled carbonization and selenization procedures. As expected, the optimized CoSe2/Co@NC-CNT-1 displayed outstanding electrocatalytic performance for the ORR and OER, with an onset potential of 0.95 Vvs.RHE, a half-wave potential of 0.84 Vvs.RHE for ORR, and a potential of 1.69 Vvs.RHE for OER at 10 mA cm(-2). It also exhibited excellent long-term stability and methanol resistance ability, which were superior to commercial IrO(2)and the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. Notably, the assembled Zn-air battery with CoSe2/Co@NC-CNT-1 showed a low charge-discharge voltage gap (0.696 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) and a high peak power density (100.28 mW cm(-2)) with long-term cycling stability. These superior performances can be ascribed to the synergistic effects of the highly active CoSe2/Co nanoheterostructure, hierarchically porous structure with a large surface area, high electrical conductivity and uniform doping of the Co and N.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2398-4902			WOS:000563991800033

The as-prepared aerogels exhibited a competitive half-wave potential (0.840 V, versus RHE) and peak current density (2.35 mA cm(-2)) to that of Pt/C (0.836 V, 2.23 mA cm(-2), respectively). Furthermore, they demonstrated a significantly perfect catalytic efficiency (nearly 100% of 4e(-) ORR) toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Insight into the structural details of the hybrid aerogels indicates that the CoOX active sites anchored on the graphene matrix play a central role in the upgrading of the catalytic performance of graphene aerogels.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000401526700003	28426072

We have recently developed a solidstate chemical route for synthesizing this family of alloy materials, which is carried out under seemingly impossible conditions. Here, we report an in-depth understanding of the synthesis mechanism, obtained through systematic investigations of the chemical processes involved at different stages of the synthesis process and the structural evolution of the intermediate products. The formation of Pt-RE nanoalloys is made possible by a series of consecutive chemical and physical processes, including the polymerization processes of the nitrogen-rich precursor, the formation of a porous RE carbodiimide phase, the mobility of the formed metal phases on the carbon support, the reduction of the RE metals driven by the alloying reaction, and so forth. This thorough understanding of the mechanism of the synthesis process lays the foundation for optimizing the synthesis procedures and maneuvering this method to synthesize Pt-RE alloy materials with the desired structures and properties.									9	3	0	0	0	0	11			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000613925000005

As a result, the N-C/PtNi keeps the high oxygen reduction reaction activity value of 962-1080 mA mg(Pt)(-1) for 60,000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles and still has a high activity of 265 mA mg(Pt)(-1) even after 120,000 CV cycles. Moreover, the N-C/PtNi shows a max power density of 1.24 W cm(-2) at cathodic loading of 0.1 mg(Pt) cm(-2) in H-2-O-2 fuel cell under 200 kPa absolute pressure of O-2 without performance decrease within 60,000 cycles. Other large noble metal-based particles are believed to gain ultrahigh stabilities and higher activities through performing the similar encapsulation. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, due to the dense packing under high mass loading, the mass/charge diffusion is seriously hindered, making their practical performance with high power density, and energy density difficult to sustain. Herein, we reported an efficient bi-functional electrocatalyst of Ni-Co mixed metal oxides incorporated with cobalt/nitrogen-doped carbon with hierarchical hollow nanostructure (H-Co/N-C@NiCo2O4). Benefiting from the advantages of this structure and composition, the H-Co/N-C@NiCo2O4 exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity and long-time durability for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The potential gap between half-wave potential in ORR and overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in OER reaches 0.8 V, much smaller than that of most reported bi-functional electrocatalysts. Moreover, H-Co/N-C@NiCo2O4 is constructed as an air electrode for rechargeable ZAB, delivering a high power density and long cycling stability. The good linear relationship between the power density and various mass loading of H-Co/N-C@NiCo2O4 on the electrode demonstrates that the performance has been well-maintained even under high dense packing of catalysts, which offers a new pathway for the practical applications in ZAB.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2296-8016			WOS:000494461100001

In this work, we successfully synthesize Ca-doped CuCoO2 nanosheets (CCCO-P NSs) with different Ca2+ dopants (such as 3, 5, and 10 atom %) by a surfactant-modified hydrothermal reaction with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) addition. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances of these CCCO-P NSs in 1.0 M KOH are investigated. An optimal nickel foam supported CCCO-P2 NSs (Ni@CCCO-P2, 5 atom % Ca-doped) electrode requires low overpotential of 470 mV to afford the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and small Tafel slope of 96.5 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, the Ni@CCCO-P2 electrode displays outstanding long-term stability during the galvanostatic OER electrolysis for 18 h with a little degradation of 32 mV. The improvement of OER performances for CCCO-P2 NSs could be attributed to their higher active surface area, more active sites (Co vacancies defect and Co3+/Co4+ redox pairs), and higher electrical conductivity. This work highlights the joint effect of surfactant and Ca doping for preparing CuCoO2 with nanosheet-like morphology and porous crystal structure, which is favorable for enhancing their OER performance.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000552287100043	32631048

Because Fe3+ and Co2+ ions were absorbed onto the BP surface through coordination with the lone pair electrons of 2D BP, the BP@MOF heterojunction had an intimate interface with strong interactions. Electrochemical oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions were studied using BP@MOF as the electrocatalyst. High activity of the overall water splitting in 1.0 M KOH was observed under a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The corresponding overpotentials for HER and OER were as low as 180 and 246 mV, respectively. Meanwhile, the BP@MOF exhibited good environmental stability and long-term electrocatalytic activity for OER and HER, owing to the encapsulation of BP nanosheets by the 2D MOF-Fe/Co. Through this study, a unique hybrid 2D nanomaterial is discovered for the efficient electrolytic splitting of water.									2	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000823206300001	35764924

The oxygen groups on either side of GO basal plane can be functioned as the anchor by employing GO as scaffolds. Vanadium-oxo nanosheets (VON) were assembled onto the surface of GO material from homogeneously dissolved VO(acac)(2) solution via a facile route. Control experiments with different methods prepared graphene materials illustrate the nucleation and fabrication process of VON on GO surface with detailed TEM and XPS investigation. The evolution of oxygen groups in graphene material was also investigated. Hydroxyl/epoxy in GO sheets was considered to be important and favorable for the fabrication of VON on GO surface. The developed material was shown to be an efficient and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for aerobic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethyfurfural (HMF) and furfural into maleic anhydride. Up to 90.9% yield of maleic anhydride from HMF and 59.9% from furfural were achieved under optimized reaction conditions, the reaction rate difference between HMF and FAL was studied on the basis of oxidation mechanism and their molecular structures.

Globins offer a unique opportunity to study the functional evolution of genes and proteins. We have characterized the globin repertoire of two different turtle species: the Chinese softshell turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis) and the western painted turtle (Chrysemys picta bellii). In the genomes of both species, we have identified eight distinct globin types: hemoglobin (Hb), myoglobin, neuroglobin, cytoglobin, globin E, globin X, globin Y, and androglobin. Therefore, along with the coelacanth, turtles are so far the only known vertebrates with a full globin repertoire. This fact allows for the first time a comparative analysis of the expression of all eight globins in a single species. Phylogenetic analysis showed an early divergence of neuroglobin and globin X before the radiation of vertebrates. Among the other globins, cytoglobin diverged first, and there is a close relationship between myoglobin and globin E; the position of globin Y is not resolved. The globin E gene was selectively lost in the green anole, and the genes coding for globin X and globin Y were deleted in chicken. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction experiments revealed that myoglobin, neuroglobin, and globin E are highly expressed with tissue-specific patterns, which are in line with their roles in the oxidative metabolism of the striated muscles, the brain, and the retina, respectively. Histochemical analyses showed high levels of globin E in the pigment epithelium of the eye. Globin E probably has a myoglobin-like role in transporting O-2 across the pigment epithelium to supply in the metabolically highly active retina.									17	0	0	0	16	0	17			1759-6653			WOS:000358800500005	26078264

PE was found to be oxidized with a high rate compared with PP. Even at the base pressure of 10(-4) Pa oxidation takes place. The oxygen concentration in the surface of PET can be increased by irradiation in an oxygen atmosphere, while it is decreased if the treatment is carried out in vacuum. In both cases, however, the composition of surface functional groups changes remarkably.					4th International Conference on Plasma Surface Engineering4th International Conference on Plasma Surface Engineering	SEP 19-23, 1994SEP 19-23, 1994		GARMISCH PARTENKIR, GERMANYGARMISCH PARTENKIR, GERMANY	13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0257-8972			WOS:A1995RT43900010

Oxidation reactions follow first-order kinetics with respect to phenol and half-order kinetics with respect to dissolved oxygen. The activation energy for the reaction was 44.5 and 48.3 kJ mol(-1) for runs employing Fe3+ and Fe2+, respectively. Rate constants and induction periods were also similar for both catalysts. This result could be explained by analysing the evolution of iron during the oxidation process. For pH > 2, Fe2+ was rapidly oxidized under reaction conditions to Fe3+, resulting in a unique catalytic redox system Fe2+/Fe3+. It was also shown that if pH < 2 the dissolved oxygen was unable to oxidize ferrous ion, resulting in a much slower oxidation rate of phenol. The absence of a redox pair resulted in a complete lack of catalytic activity of the dissolved iron salt.

In this work, palmitic acid was used as a model compound of POME to study its oxidation reactions. The experiment was conducted in a flow cell system with boron-doped diamond as the anode. A voltammetric technique was used to remove palmitic acid while observing the change in chemical oxygen demand concentration to monitor the reaction. The effects of supporting electrolyte, potential, time, and flow rate on the oxidation were studied. The results indicate that degradation of palmitic acid occurs as an indirect effect of electro-oxidation at high potential in the region of oxygen evolution or formation of hydroxyl radicals. Furthermore, under optimum conditions, up to 87.91% of the palmitic acid could be electrochemically removed.					2nd International Symposium on Current Progress in Functional Materials (ISCPFM) - Functional Materials for Energy and Environment Applications2nd International Symposium on Current Progress in Functional Materials (ISCPFM) - Functional Materials for Energy and Environment Applications	NOV 08-09, 2017NOV 08-09, 2017		Univ Indonesia, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Bali, INDONESIAUniv Indonesia, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Bali, INDONESIA	2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1757-8981		*****************	WOS:000481620500001

The physicochemical properties of electrodes were investigated by SEM, XRD and XPS, which indicated that the surface coating of MnOx-CNTs/Ti, with MnOx nanoparticles dispersed uniformly on the CNTs, was smoother and with higher integrity than MnOx/Ti. Acid Red B was used as model pollutant to investigate the electro-catalytic activity of the electrodes, and the results revealed that the removal efficiency of Acid Red B reached 93.6% and 98.0% by MnOx/Ti and MnOx-CNTs/Ti, respectively, and the cell potential during the process of degradation by MnOx-CNTs/Ti was relatively low and stable. The electrochemical results confirmed that MnOx-CNTs/Ti possessed smaller charge transfer resistance and higher oxygen evolution current compared with MnOx/Ti, which can enhance the electro-catalytic activity and reduce the energy consumption by accelerating the transfer of electrons on the electrode surface. The accelerated lifetime tests of electrodes were carried out and showed that actual service lifetimes of MnOx-CNTs/Ti were 38 times of that for MnOx/Ti calculated by the experienced formula, which demonstrated that the durability of MnOx-based electrode was significantly promoted by addition of CNTs on Ti substrate.									5	1	0	0	1	0	6			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000475764300020

The activity for Hydrogen Oxidation reaction (HOR), Oxygen Reduction reaction (ORR) and Oxygen Evolution reaction (OER) is tested together in one protocol. A total of 5 Pine Instruments RRDE test stations have been set up with automatic gas flow switching and computer software to control all aspects of the data collection process. The user simply sets up the electrochemical cell with a gas bubbler, reference electrode. counter electrode and sample and then selects a series of tests to be run. The software then switches gas flow, rotation rates and potentiostat set up files automatically. This infrastructure allows the rapid characterization of catalyst candidate materials. The series of tests is described, along with the purpose of each test in the protocol. As an example, the data collected from a Pt1-xHfx composition spread is presented. The optimal composition is found to be approximately 30 at.% Hf, when the ORR performance begins to decrease at a faster rate than the HOR performance and the OER current at 1300 mV is also a maximum. However, it was determined that from an applied point of view the drop in ORR performance was insufficient to adequately protect the cathode from the effects of the transient potentials during start-up of the fuel cell.

The heteroatom doping such as N into graphene is an efficient strategy to facilitate it, but most N-doped electrocatalysts are still inferior to transition metal-based catalysts because it is difficult endowing them with enough electrons to achieve a superb performance. Herein, we successfully tune carbon atoms into near-optimal adsorption sites for ORR by injection of extra electrons from a combined electron-rich source to change the pi electron occupancy at carbon sites in a rationally designed core-shell structure. Ag nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped graphitized carbon shells exhibit an excellent performance of a half-wave potential of 906 mV and limited current density of 6.10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media, which is superior to most N-doped electrocatalysts. Density functional theory calculation shows that the degree of extra p electron occupancy at the carbon site is highly correlated to the adsorption strength of oxygenated species, and it proves that Ag is the optimal selection to transfer enough electrons to the outer carbon shells. The Ag@4C model in which every carbon site is activated by extra pi electrons with transferred 0.0572 e(-) shows the best performance among Ag@xC models.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11			2168-0485			WOS:000489986400074

In this study, the rapeseed meal-based material (ARM-900) prepared by carbonization with high temperature and activation with ZnCl2 had a porous structure and was doped with N and S hetero-atoms. Compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts (onset potential of 0.95 V vs. RHE and limiting diffusion current of -5.7 mA cm(-2)), ARM-900 demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic performance with an onset potential of 0.98 V vs. RHE and limiting diffusion current of - 8.1 mA cm(-2) in O-2 saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. Meanwhile, ARM-900 had higher durability and more superior methanol tolerance than Pt/C catalyst. The excellent ORR performance of ARM-900 was derived from the formation of abundant pore structure and the doping of the autochthonous N and S heteroatoms. MFCs with ARM-900 as the cathode had the maximum power density of 808 mW/m(2), which was obviously better than Pt/C (709 mW/m(2)). This study provided an environment-friendly and effective strategy for the reuse of rapeseed meal and the preparation of N and S-doped non-metallic ORR catalysts.

We examine the abundance data for evidence of H II region self-enrichment effects, which would lead to correlations in the scatter of helium, nitrogen, and oxygen abundances around their mean trends. The observed helium abundance trends show no such correlations, although the nitrogen-oxygen trend does show strong evidence for real scatter beyond observational error. We construct simple models for the chemical evolution of these galaxies, using the most recent yields of He-4, C, N, and O in intermediate- and high-mass stars. The effects of galactic outflows, which can arise both from bulk heating and evaporation of the interstellar medium and from the partial escape of enriched supernova ejecta are included. In agreement with other studies, we find that supernova-enriched outflows can roughly reproduce the observed He, C, N, and O trends; however, in models that fit N versus O, the slopes Delta Y/Delta O and Delta Y/Delta N consistently fall more than 2 sigma below the fit to observations. We discuss the role of the models and their uncertainties in the extrapolation of primordial helium from the data. We also explore the model dependence arising from nucleosynthesis uncertainties associated with nitrogen yields in intermediate-mass stars, the fate of 8-11 M. stars, and massive star winds.									113	0	0	0	0	0	113			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000077778800013

Furthermore, typical carbide preparation includes carbonization of oxide under gaseous carbon sources at a high temperature, resulting in sintering and collapse of the heterostructures. In this work, nano-sized carbon dots (CDs, similar to 2 nm in diameter) were adopted as carbon sources and dispersed on tungsten oxide nanorods allowing abundant nucleation sites for oxide-to-carbide conversion, resulting in high density of carbide-oxide heteminterfaces. The resulting tungsten carbide-oxide heterostructure decorated with carbon dots (WO(3-x) - WCy/CDs) exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity toward the HER with a low overpotential of 65 mV at a current density of - 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic media. This performance is among the best electrocatalytic activities compared to the state-of-the-art tungsten carbide-based electrocatalysts. Importantly, the single-cell test using WO(3-x) - WCy/CDs as the cathode showed a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a cell voltage of only 1.47 V, which is very close to that for Pt/C (1.41 V). In addition, a combined analysis of the X-ray spectroscopic and electrochemical results suggested an optimal W-C ratio in the tungsten carbide-oxide composite to guarantee the high HER activity. Theoretical calculations provided more insight into the carbide-directed enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity of WO(3-x) - WCy/CDs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000830821600008

Homemade gas diffusion layers (GDLs) were prepared with the coated CFs to be employed as air electrodes and bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for Zn-air batteries (ZAB). The Mn-Co oxide was identified as a cubic spinel phase (MnCo2O4) by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The composite air electrode showed excellent catalytic activity towards ORR/OER, outperforming the benchmark Pt-RuO2 catalyst in both half-cell and full-cell configurations with discharge/charge efficiencies of 63.7% and 60.0% at 10 and 20 mA cm(-2), respectively. After 200 cycles (100 h) at 10 mA cm(-2) the final efficiency of the composite electrode (58.9%) was still superior to that of Pt-Ru (43.2%).									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2566-6223		WOS:000725353000001

However, for the specific active N species chiefly responsible for the Pt performance amelioration, there still is no clear understanding up to now. Herein, density functional theory calculations and the experimental relevancy investigations between the different N species and the intrinsic activity of supported Pt towards a probe reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction were combined to identify the active N species from the pyridinic N, amine N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N and N-oxide in N-doped carbon nanotubes. Simulations demonstrate that five N species all can strengthen the interaction of Pt with carbon nanotubes on different degree, however, only graphitic N could drastically alter the charge and spin densities of Pt atoms and reduce the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbitals and the lowest unoccupied ones, revealing that the graphitic N bears the main responsibility for the catalytic performance enhancement of supported Pt especially in both Pt single atom- and cluster-catalyzed reactions with electron-deficiency reactants. Meanwhile, a positive correlation of the intrinsic activity of Pt with the graphitic N was clearly observed from the model reaction of hydrogen evolution reactions with H+ as the electrophilic reactant, further verifying the dominating active structure of graphitic N in N-doped carbon nanotubes. This finding provides a new avenue towards the targeted design of highly efficient Pt-based catalytic materials in Pt-catalyzed chemical reactions by tuning the graphitic nitrogen distribution in nitrogen-doped carbon carriers.									6	2	0	0	0	0	6			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000489066200048

Herein, employing N-doped carbon fiber as support, we report a facile gas-phase transport strategy for the synthesis of a series of transition metal nanoparticles (denoted as M/N-CF, M = Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Fe). The current synthesis strategy not only yields metal nanoparticles with ultra-small size (similar to 5 nm) and good monodispersity, but also introduces a porous nanostructure with large surface area (730 m(2) g(-1)) and rich M-N species. When used for catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction, all the M/N-CF catalysts adopt a highly efficient 4e(-) ORR pathway, reaching a most positive half-wave potential of 0.87 V vs. RHE for Mn/N-CF, quite approaching that of commercial Pt/C (0.88 V vs. RHE). Among them, Co/N-CF can also catalyze oxygen evolution reaction in an overpotential of 380 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), approaching that of commercial RuO2 (295 mV). Furthermore, as air electrode for rechargeable Zn-air battery, Co/N-CF based device achieves a high power density (163 mW cm(-2)) and good long-term cycling stability (over 50 h at 10 mA cm(-2)), suggesting the potential application of M/N-CF catalysts in energy conversion and storage systems.

A study of their electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				40	1			51	61		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.015				JAN 5 2015	2015	Nickel-cobalt based electrodes with different Ni-Co ratios have been prepared by electroless-plating deposition from NiSO4 and CoSO4 solutions. The performance of the electrodes for the HER and OER reactions has been examined by linear sweep voltammetry. The electrode containing only nickel (Ni-ELP) displays the lowest overpotential for the HER. On the other hand, the Ni-Co electrode with Co concentrations of 30 at% (Ni70Co30-ELP) exhibits the lowest overpotential for OER. Durability tests have been carried out with these two electrodes. The potential of electrolytic cell at 0.3 A cm(-2), using Ni-ELP for the HER and Ni70Co30-ELP for the OER, was of 2.2 V. Characterization of the used electrodes by SEM/EDS reveals that the structure of the electrodes remains stable after H2O alkaline electrolysis for 70 h. The results presented in this work show that the electroless-plating method is a successful way to prepare stable nickel electrodes for alkaline water electrolysis.

Of the materials evaluated, Ta0.3Ti0.7O2 exhibited remarkably high stability under aggressive potential cycling tests designed to mimic harsh automotive drive cycles. The capacitance of the Ta0.3Ti0.7O2 support changed by 12% whereas the pseudocapacitance of a carbon benchmark changed by over 100% under identical test conditions. Pt/Ta0.3Ti0.7O2 electrocatalyst prepared by catalyzing this support showed high electrochemical stability which was attributed to a strong metal support interaction (SMSI); and fairly good performance. The stability of the catalyzed supports were evaluated by monitoring the evolution of the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) under potential cycling, loss in ECSA of Pt/Ta0.3Ti0.7O2 was found to be 35% compared to 46% for Pt/C over 10,000 load cycles. Pt/Ta0.3Ti0.7O2 showed fairly good performance: the electrochemical surface area of this electrocatalyst was 41 m(2)/g, while the mass activity and areaspecific activities for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were 62 mA/mgPt and 151 mu A/cm(2) Pt, respectively, as ascertained from electrochemical experiments performed on a rotating disk electrode (RDE). Based on these results, we propose that Ta0.3Ti0.7O2 is an excellent corrosion-resistant alternative to carbon as an electrocatalyst support.					13th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell Symposium (PEFC)13th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell Symposium (PEFC)	OCT 27-NOV 01, 2013OCT 27-NOV 01, 2013	Electrochem Soc; Electrochem Soc, Ind Electrochemistry & Electrochem Engn Div; Electrochem Soc, Battery Div; Electrochem Soc, Corros Div; Electrochem Soc, Energy Technol Div; Electrochem Soc, Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; N E Chemcat CorpElectrochem Soc; Electrochem Soc, Ind Electrochemistry & Electrochem Engn Div; Electrochem Soc, Battery Div; Electrochem Soc, Corros Div; Electrochem Soc, Energy Technol Div; Electrochem Soc, Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; N E Chemcat Corp	San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1938-5862	1938-6737	978-1-60768-446-6; 978-1-60768-445-9	WOS:000354475600180

The spectra show that oxygen plays an important role at the beginning of the process. A large amount of oxygen is responsible for intense powder formation. The admixture of inert or non-reactant gases, such as AT or N-2, into the plasma promotes polymerization of the monomer. The formation of the particulates, the evolution of their size, and chemical characteristics give evidence of a multistep growth process. The size, as well as the production rate, undergoes a reduction once the Ar or N-2 amount is increased in the plasma admixture.									24	0	0	0	0	3	24			1612-8850			WOS:000287830700003

Here, we propose an innovative cation/anion-codoped nickel nitrides (FC-Ni3N) along with creating 3D architecture by integrating N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT), which is found to be an outstanding bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for Zn-air batteries with ultrafast charging rate (Potential =2.02V at 50 mA cm(-2) with area capacity of 4 mAh cm(-2)) and long cycling life (700 cycles at 20 mA cm(-2)). Through varying the cation/anion moiety, the optimal FC-Ni3N/NCNT shows low overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1), much outperforming the RuO2 benchmark with overpotential of 337 mV and Tafel slope of 91 mV dec(-1). The extraordinary oxygen evolution reaction performance (corresponding to the charge process) stems from the simultaneous regulation of charge- and mass-transport kinetics in air electrodes. The proposed strategy and results may pave the way for promoting commercial application of rechargeable zinc-air batteries or other metal-air batteries.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			2405-8297	2405-8289		WOS:000658385000002

Ruthenium phosphide electrocatalysts are attractive candidates for this process, and they recently showed high electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline conditions, which is even higher than that in acidic conditions; however, the origin of their activity has not been addressed to date. Here, we demonstrate that hydroxylated Ru species reconstructed by HER in a basic electrolyte are the key active sites for alkaline HER based on an in-depth X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic study. Ru phosphides with a higher Ru/P ratio in their bulk composition possess a higher ratio of hydroxylated Ru on their surface region of several nanometers with less P sites exposed, which determines the HER activity in alkaline conditions. The Ru phosphide nanofiber electrocatalysts presented here enabled almost zero overpotentials for alkaline HER with stable performance for 320 h. This work provides a deeper understanding of the origin of high HER activity in alkaline conditions.									11	2	0	0	1	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521109000024

Here, we report a general strategy named "nucleation in the irradiation then growth in the dark" for the preparation of Au/M (second metal) NCs. In the irradiation stage, the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of Au NPs is excited to overcome the nucleation energy barrier for the deposition of second metals (Pt, Ag and Pd). In the followed dark process, the preferential growth of second metals on the existed nucleus leads to the formation of nanochain rather than the core/shell nanostructure. In the model reaction of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution, the optimized Au/Pt NCs showed much better performance compared with the commercial Pt/C. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The cyclic voltammetry pattern and electrolysis results in presence of ethanol are closely related to the electrode coating preparation method and electrode composition. A standard preparation method gives an ethanol peak located 200 mV before the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whereas electrodes prepared by a polymeric precursor method showed a negative displacement of OER leading to total suppression of the ethanol peak. The global catalytic activity for the ethanol oxidation is related to the amount of tin oxide introduced into the coating where higher tin oxide amounts lead to a faster ethanol consumption. The results in galvanostatic electrolysis show that in 0.2 mol dm(-3) HClO4 medium the major product for ethanol oxidation is acetic acid whereas in 1.0 mol dm(-3) HClO4 solution, the main product is acetaldehyde. The following sequence toward ethanol consumption is observed at low acidity medium: Ti/Ru0.3Sn0.7O2, Ti/Ru(0.3)Ti(0.3)Sn(0.4)O(2)much greater thanTi/Ru0.3Ti0.7O2.

Physical and electrochemical characterizations of the catalysts were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammogram (CV) and polarization measurements. Nb2O5 addition to RuO2 was found to increase the stability of RuO2. In Adams method the sodium nitrate was found to be forming complex with Nb2O5 at high temperature reaction. This makes Adams method unsuitable for the synthesis of RuO2 Nb2O5 bimetallic system. Hydrolysis method on other hand does not have this problem. But a proper mixture of two oxides was not obtained in hydrolysis method. A lower crystallite size for bimetallic system was obtained with Adams method compared to hydrolysis method. RuO2 prepared by Adams method had higher activity compared to the hydrolysis counterpart in electrolyzer operation with nafion membrane. A cell voltage of 1.62 V was obtained with RuO2 (A) at 1 A/cm(2). A higher stability for Ru0.8Nb0.2O2(A) compared to RuO2(A) was observed in continuous cyclic voltammogram and electrolyzer cell test.

Ex situ and in situ characterization included the use of techniques such as scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EDX showed a surface enrichment with Ti. The voltammetric charge was found to go through a maximum at 60% IrO2. O-2 evolution was studied in 1.0 mol dm(-3) HClO4 by determining Tafel slopes and impedance parameters. Tafel slopes were found to vary between 40 and 60 mV depending on the overpotential range and the oxide composition. Solution and film resistance, film and double layer capacitance, and charge transfer resistance were determined as a function of potential and oxide composition. A reaction mechanism has been proposed. Separation of geometric and electronic effects has been attempted.									50	1	0	0	1	1	50			0008-4042			WOS:000071518100007

Therefore, it is transient and sporadic that poses issues with how the energy can be harvested and processed when the sun does not shine. Scientists assume that electro/photoelectrochemical devices used for water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen may have one solution to solve this hindrance. Water electrolysis-generated hydrogen is an optimal energy carrier to store these forms of energy on scalable levels because the energy density is high, and no air pollution or toxic gas is released into the environment after combustion. However, in order to adopt these devices for readily use, they have to be low-cost for manufacturing and operation. It is thus crucial to develop electrocatalysts for water splitting based on low-cost and land-rich elements. In this review, I will summarize current advances in the synthesis of low-cost earth-abundant electrocatalysts for overall water splitting, with a particular focus on how to be linked with photoelectrocatalytic water splitting devices. The major obstacles that persist in designing these devices. The potential future developments in the production of efficient electrocatalysts for water electrolysis are also described.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2073-4344		WOS:000642869400001

Such reactions are closely related to the anatomical and physiological characteristics in insects with their external skeleton and open circulatory blood system. Encapsulation and nodulation are most important defense mechanisms in insects, as they allow targeting of the immune response to the site of damage to quickly destroy the intruder. Host penetration results in both the production of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and to the presence of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in the hemolymph. Subsequent signal induction occurs by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and other systems. Capsule formation results from aggregation and partial disruption of the hemocytes on the target surface resulting in melanization by the proPO cascade. Reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species are emitted during melanogenesis and targeted against the invader. As a result, the intruder is not only isolated within the capsule but also destroyed. Insects have a number of systems (serpins, antioxidants), aimed at the regulation of melanogenesis and inactivation of toxic products resulting from melanization. All these complex mechanisms allow rapid and effective detection, isolation and destruction of invaders with minimal damage to the insect.									54	4	1	0	49	2	60			1824-307X			WOS:000381619600020

Various compositions of co-precipitated Ni1+xFe2-xO4 and Ni1+yCo2-yO4 nanoparticles were investigated. The intrinsic HER catalytic activity is the same for all the catalysts, which we relate to similar values of the iso-electric point (IEP). However, the mass catalytic activity of the catalysts changes through a modification of the electrochemical surface area. Fractional reaction orders for hydrogen evolution revealed in all catalyst compositions are due to double layer effects and surface acid-base equilibria. Reaction order and Tafel slope of the catalysts are compatible with electrochemical adsorption as the rate-determining step for the HER. Tafel slopes were also evaluated independently from impedance spectroscopy, in good agreement with the polarization curves. Electrodes prepared from catalyst inks containing an anion-exchange ionomer displayed inferior catalytic activity for the HER as compared to electrodes prepared with Nafion in the ink. Chronoamperometry confirmed the sustained superior hydrogen kinetics over time of NiFe2O4 and NiCo2O4 composition over that of NiO. (C) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.

However, the reasons for inter-facial/capacity degradation of SASSLIBs are not yet clearly resolved. Herein, the impacts of surface structures and chemical environments of LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 (NCM83) on SASSLIB performances are systematically investigated. Surface lithium vacancies of NCM83 facilitate Li ion migration from SSE to NCM83 side, sup-pressing the H1 phase transformation of NCM83 and expanding the space charge layer. Surface LixNi1_xO type rock salt phases inhibit oxygen-participating interfacial reactions at high voltages due to their low susceptibility to oxygen evolutions, enhancing the H2/H3 phase transformation of NCM83. Surface Li2O and Li2CO3 mitigate the space charge layer effect and interfacial reactions at high voltages, activating H1 and H2/H3 phase trans-formations of NCM83. On the other hand, the combination of LiOH and Li2CO3 causes severe side reactions with SSE, resulting in escalated interfacial resistance and drastic capacity fading over cycling. Importantly, while the suppression of H1 and H2/H3 transformations reduces the reversible capacity, it mitigates the internal stress and micro-cracks in NCM83 particles, contributing to superior cycling stability of NCM83-sulfide ASSLIBs (94.1 % capacity retention over 500 cycles).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000826970600002		
J	Berndt, D.; Jones, W.								VRLA batteries, required internal balance for proper float charging								Standby Batteries; Balancing Reliability and Monitoring with Costs. Conference Volume								3.1.1	11						1998	1998	Proper float charging of valve-regulated Pb-acid (VRLA) batteries requires that positive and negative electrodes are sufficiently polarised. Otherwise, one of them will suffer gradual discharge. At a high efficiency of the internal oxygen cycle, this conditions means that the two secondary reactions-evolution of hydrogen and grid corrosion-must balance each other. Such a balance, however, often is not reached at the usual low float voltage. As a consequence, a reduction of the actually available capacity is frequently observed, caused by partially discharged negative electrodes. As a remedy, boost charging at increased voltage is occasionally applied, sometimes included in monitoring routines. But the imbalance remains, and so overcharging has regularly to be repeated. Grid corrosion and water loss are increased by such boost charges. A new development is the incorporation of a catalyst. It recombines a certain portion of the oxygen before it can reach the negative electrode. This causes a deficit of oxygen within the internal cycle and so reduces its efficiency. As a consequence, a corresponding amount of hydrogen must be generated by a more negative polarisation of the negative electrode. The fully charged state of the negative electrode is so ensured. Simultaneously the positive electrode is less polarised, and grid corrosion reduced. Most important is, that the oxygen, lost from the internal cycle, is not lost from the cell, but is directly recombined into water.

This is reflected as significant reduction in the onset overpotential (301 mV) and enhanced current density (30 mA cm(-2) @ 577 mV). In order to achieve uniform surface loading, organic-soluble thermolabile cobalt-bis(di-tert-butylphosphate) is synthesized in situ inside the nanocarbon matrix and subsequently pyrolyzed at 150 degrees C to produce Co(H2PO4)(2)/Co(PO3)(2) (80:20 wt%). Annealing this sample at 200 or 250 degrees C results in the redistribution of the two phosphate systems to 55:45 or 20:80 (wt%), respectively. Detailed electrochemical measurements clearly establish that the 55:45 (wt%) sample prepared at 200 degrees C performs the best as a catalyst, owing to a relay mechanism that enhances the kinetics of the 4e(-) transfer OER process, which is substantiated by micro-Raman spectroscopic studies. It is also unraveled that the engineered nanocarbon support simultaneously enhances the interfacial charge-transfer pathway, resulting in the reduction of onset overpotential, compared to earlier investigated cobalt phosphate systems.									38	2	0	0	1	0	39			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000486725400001	31523910

Herein, we develop a straightforward and scalable hydrogel-bridged pyrolysis strategy for the exquisite construction of a "ship-in-a-bottle"-structured bifunctional catalyst consisting of fine CoFe nanoparticles encapsulated inside the carbon nanowall-assembled frameworks (abbreviated as CoFe@N-CNWF hereafter). The deliberate design of such intriguing hierarchical honeycomb-like architecture with tightly confined CoFe nanoparticles and open configuration endows the as-fabricated CoFe@N-CNWF with sufficient well-dispersed active sites, rapid charge transfer efficiency, accelerated mass diffusion and robust mechanical strength. Consequently, the resultant CoFe@N-CNWF catalyst shows outstanding catalytic performance toward the ORR and OER with high activity and long-term stability. More encouragingly, a rechargeable Zn-air battery using CoFe@N-CNWF as the air cathode displays superb energy density, high energy efficiency and robust reversibility, surpassing the state-of-the-art precious Pt/C + RuO2-assembled counterpart. The developed methodology for the fabrication of "ship-in-a-bottle" architectures may open new opportunities to low-cost, mass production of high-efficiency bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for a variety of renewable energy technologies and beyond.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000653229500006

We have designed an experiment using physically mixed Au/AC and Pd/AC (AC=activated carbon) as the catalyst in the liquid-phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol by aerobic oxygen. The evolution of the physically mixed catalyst structures at different stages in the catalytic reaction was investigated by aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and spatially resolved element mapping techniques at the nanometre scale, and they were also compared with the structure of the bimetallic alloy. For the first time we show the formation of surface Au-Pd bimetallic sites by reprecipitation of Pd onto Au nanoparticles. Negligible Au leaching was observed. The in situ structural evolution can be directly correlated to the great enhancement of the catalyst activity. Moreover, we distinguish the different behaviours of Au and Pd, thus suggesting an oxygen differentiating mechanism for Au and Pd sites. The findings are of great importance to both the understanding of the structure-activity correlation and the design of highly active catalysts in green chemistry.									44	1	0	0	3	0	45			0947-6539			WOS:000282156700011	20623809

However, identifying the role of noble metals and especially the active sites remain a persistent challenge. Here, we report a direct synthesis of Au nanoparticles (NPs) decorated NiFe oxyhydroxides via in-situ electrochemical conversion and a comprehensive study of the activity boost via a combination of systematic experimental and theoretical studies. We found that Fe doping greatly improved the electrical conductivity and the Fe sites were the dominant active centers, collectively responsible for the remarkably enhanced performance in NiFe oxyhydroxide. Upon Au NPs decoration, the content of high-valence Fe/Ni ions was substantially reduced and the formation of surface oxygen vacancy was greatly suppressed. As a result, the dominant active centers transfer to the interfacial Au sites that directly participate in catalyzing water oxidation. Our study presents a fundamental insight into the origin of activity enhancement and especially the active centers in noble metal decorated NiFe oxyhydroxide catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000804426800004

The pores are evolved by hydrogen decomposed from the moisture during solidification. Hydrogen atoms dissolve into molten cobalt and silicon according to the reaction xM + yH(2)O = M (x) O (y) + yH(2) at the given temperature. Insoluble hydrogen evolves long pores oriented in one direction during the unidirectional solidification. However, no pores are observed in solidified copper. It is suggested that the formation of pores strongly depends on the magnitude of the dissociation constant of water at the casting temperatures for materials. The oxide clusters formed by metallic elements and oxygen may serve as nucleation sites for the pore evolution to yield fine pore distribution. Thus, the moisture decomposition method is superior to the conventional fabrication method, which requires high-pressure hydrogen gas.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1073-5623	1543-1940		WOS:000262565900023

H-TiO2/Au shows enhanced performance for the NRR process compared with both P-TiO2/Au and H-O-TiO2/Au. After hydrogenation treatment, some disordered regions on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles are formed, and a large number of oxygen vacancies are incorporated into the TiO2 crystalline structures. When the samples are used as catalysts for electrochemical NRR, the yield of NH3 of H-TiO2/Au is about ten times compared to that of P-TiO2/Au and about three times that of H-O-TiO2/Au, while the highest Faradaic efficiency of 2.7% is also obtained at the potential of -0.1 V for the H-TiO2/Au catalyst. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation results confirm that H-TiO2/Au with oxygen vacancies and the disordered surface layer is much preferred energetically for the NRR process. It proves that enhanced adsorption of N-2 molecules on the catalyst and reduced reaction barriers due to the presence of defects play an important role in improving catalysts' performances. The results show that the plasma hydrogenation technique can be used as an efficient method to modify catalysts for electrochemical NRR processes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000794263100001

Such yields are used to accurately identify the stellar origins of meteoritic stardust and recently, distinctive silicon isotopic ratios have been extracted from a number of presolar grains. Here, the lightion Si-28(He-3, p) fusion-evaporation reaction was used to populate low-spin proton-unbound excited states in the nucleus P-30 that govern the rate of the astrophysical Si-29(p, gamma) reaction. In particular, gamma decays were observed from resonances up to E-r = 500 keV, and key resonances at 217 and 315 keV have now been identified as 2(+) and 2(-) levels, respectively. The present paper provides the first estimate of the 217-keV resonance strength and indicates that the strength of the 315-keV resonance, which dominates the rate of the Si-29(p, gamma) reaction over the entire peak temperature range of oxygen-neon novae, is higher than previously expected. As such, the abundance of Si-29 ejected during nova explosions is likely to be less than that predicted by the most recent theoretical models.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2469-9985	2469-9993		WOS:000575177400002		
J	Yoshida, K								Evolutionary process of stress response systems controlled by abscisic acid in photosynthetic organisms								YAKUGAKU ZASSHI-JOURNAL OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN				125	12			927	936		10.1248/yakushi.125.927				DEC 2005	2005	There are many serious problems causing a food crisis such as desertification, population explosion, and environmental destruction, suggesting that a severe food crisis will become reality across the globe. Therefore, the transgenic plants, which have tolerance to environmental stresses, may take on greater and greater importance in attempts to increase food production. Aquatic photosynthetic organisms, such as prokaryotic cyanobacteria and eukaryotic green algae, are considered as an evolutionary origin of higher plants and their basic metabolisms including photosynthesis are similar to higher plants. Thereby, stress responsive genes or reactions from these organisms may be exceedingly advantageous sources for creation of stress-tolerant transgenic plants. In this study, the physiological roles and biosynthesis of abscisic acid (ABA), well known as a signal molecule in the adaptation to environmental stresses, in microalgae were investigated from the point of the view of its functional evolution in the response to environmental stresses. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a green alga, and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, a cyanobacterium, were employed in this study as model organisms. It is expected that this comparative analysis will provide basic information for the creation of stress-tolerant transgenic plants. ABA may act in C. reinhardtii as a signal molecule to induce antioxidant reactions for elimination of reactive oxygen species, but not to induce specific response reactions to mitigate water stresses. In Synechocystis, on the other hand, exogenously added ABA did not influence the growth and gene expression. Moreover, ABA did not relieve growth suppression caused by water and oxidative stresses. From the carotenoid composition and bioinformatic analysis, it can be suggested that the ABA biosynthetic pathway generally found in higher plants exists completely in C. reinhardtii, but incompletely in Synechocystis.									10	1	0	0	10	0	11			0031-6903	1347-5231		WOS:000234103600002	16327238

While it is expected to further optimize the electronic configuration of heterojunctions to boost the reaction kinetics in hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER), but remains a challenge. Herein, a novel in situ hybrid heterojunction strategy is developed to construct 2D porous Co-doped Ni/Ni3N heterostructure nanosheets (Co-Ni/Ni3N) by pyrolysis of partially cobalt substituted nickel-zeolitic imidazolate framework (CoNi-ZIF) nanosheets under NH3 atmosphere. A combined experimental and theoretical studies manifest that the hybrid heterostructures can display regulative electronic states and downshift d-band center from the Fermi level, as well as optimize the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates, thus reducing the thermodynamic energy barriers and accelerating the catalytic kinetics. Consequently, benefitting from the optimized electronic configuration, hierarchical hollow nanosheets architecture, and abundant doped heterojunctions, the hybrid Co-Ni/Ni3N heterostructure catalyst exhibits efficient catalytic activity for both HER (60 mV) and OER (322 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media, which is 105 and 47 mV lower than that of pure Ni3N, respectively. The electrochemically active surface area of Co-Ni/Ni3N is two times higher than that of Ni3N. Furthermore, the coupled practical water electrolyzer requires a low voltage of 1.575 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2), and it can be driven by a 1.5 V battery. This work highlights the interface engineering guidance for the rational establishment of hybrid interfaces by electronic modulation of interfacial effect for alkaline water splitting.									24	0	0	0	2	0	24				2567-3165		WOS:000700049100001

The constructed structure exhibits greatly enhanced catalytic activity (eta(j=10) (mA) (-2)(cm) = 265 mV) and good stability (current retention >94% after electrolysis of 6 h). Moreover, the Co-phytate grown on 3D-NA/Co is also used as the anode in a two-electrode configured alkaline electrolyzer with the sharp decline of energy consumption (41.55 KWh kg(Hydrogen)(-1)) for hydrogen production. We then determine the insight of the electrocatalytic process toward water oxidation on our prepared electrode. First, the results reveal that the 3D-substrate can obviously reduce the resistance for the electron transfer during the oxygen evolution turnover. In addition, the introduction of active cobalt plating will lead to the self-supported Co-phytate nanostructures generation, which can significantly enlarge the electrochemically active surface area (EASA). Further, the electrode after catalysis is also characterized, and we find that the nanostructured cobalt oxo/hydroxide are densely grown on the original Co-phytate nanoplates. These core/shell nanocomposites not only own higher EASA but also obviously decrease the free-energy change during the O-O formation of the CoO6-based intermediate affected by the phytate group.									61	1	0	0	2	0	61			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000368322600021

However, slow oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution (ORR/OER) reaction efficiency and unstable cycling performance restrain the practical applications of the Li-O-2 battery. Herein, Ru-modified nitrogen-doped porous carbon-encapsulated Co nanoparticles (Ru/Co@CoNx-C) are synthesized through reduction of Ru on metal-organic framework (MOFs) pyrolyzed derivatives strategies. Porous carbon polyhedra provide channels for reactive species and stable structure ensures the cyclic stability of the catalyst; abundant Co-N-x sites and high specific surface area (353 m(2) g(-1)) provide more catalytically active sites and deposition sites for reaction products. Theoretical calculations further verify that Ru/Co@CoNx-C can regulate the growth of Li2O2 to improve reversibility of Li-O-2 batteries. Li-O-2 batteries with Ru/Co@CoNx-C as cathode catalyst achieve small voltage gaps of 1.08 V, exhibit excellent cycle stability (205 cycles), and deliver high discharge specific capacity (17050 mAh g(-1)). Furthermore, pouch-type Li-O-2 batteries that maintain stable electrochemical performance output even under conditions of bending deformation and corner cutting are successfully assembled. This study demonstrates Ru/Co@CoNx-C catalyst's great application potential in Li-O-2 batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000869304100001	36251775

Herein, the Mo-Ni-Co trimetallic selenide nanorod arrays are synthesized on a plasma-treated Ni-Co foam (MoSe2-NiSe2-CoSe2/PNCF). The synergistic effects of heterostructured crystal interfaces, the formed 1T-2H mixture phases of MoSe2, and the customized morphological design enable high electrocatalytic activity and stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. The catalysts require a low overpotential of 38 mV, just above commercial Pt/C electrodes (35 mV), to deliver a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (j(10)). The H-2 generation amount (2.6 mmol h(-1)) is much higher than most of the reported transition-metal based electrocatalysts. Numerical simulations attribute the high electrocatalytic activity to the increased Fermi level with multiple heterointerfaces. The catalyst presents a superior long-term electrochemical stability during continuous reactions with a high current density (j(100)) for over 100 h. The success of enhancing the electrocatalytic performance paves new avenues for in situ engineering transition-metal based electrocatalysts for energy-related applications.									63	3	0	0	5	0	64			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000530669500028

However, the oxygen redox reaction induced by the activation of the Li2MnO3 component leads to lattice oxygen release and transition metal migration from the surface, which result in a large irreversible capacity loss, poor rate capability and inferior cycle stability compared with other cathodes. In this study, an integrated surface modification of combining a coating and chemical treatment is proposed to achieve modified LMR cathode materials with graphene wrapping layers and surface spinel phases. The graphene layer promotes electron transfer, and the spinel phase interlayer accelerates Li+ diffusion. Simultaneously, the combination of the two components increases the structural stability of LMR materials. As a result, the surface-modified LMR cathode exhibits a high rate capability of 154.3 mA h g(-1) at 5C and an excellent cycle stability with a capacity retention of 84.2% after 200 cycles at 1C. In addition, the structural evolution of the surface-modified LMR cathode material was studied by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis during the charge-discharge process, which illustrates that the surface modification has a significant effect on mitigating oxygen release by enhancing the surface structural stability.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000507580000054

As 4d/5d rare metal catalysts, such as amorphous iridium oxide (IrOx), display higher activity than 3d metal catalysts, elucidating the critical mechanistic differences between these materials is important for the synthesis of cost-effective OER catalysts. Although most studies of OER catalysts have focused on O-O bond formation energetics, here, we examined the OER mechanism of IrOx based on charge accumulation, which was recently shown to determine the OER activity for Mn and Fe oxides. Kinetic analysis using Tafel and trumpet plots, along with the difference in the pH dependence between the OER onset potential and that of iridium valence change, showed that the valence change of iridium is more favorable than formation. In-situ evanescent wave spectroscopy revealed that an intermediate assignable to Ir5+ with oxygen ligands in opposite spin serves as the precursor of OER regardless of pH. As the generation of this species is not related to valence changes of iridium, these results confirm that charge accumulation is not rate-limiting for OER on IrOx, which is a key mechanistic difference between IrOx and less-efficient 3d metal electrocatalysts.									26	1	0	0	3	0	27			1932-7447			WOS:000408598600033

When exposed to air, reduced minerals of these rocks react with oxygen, modifying the surrounding chemical conditions. Thus, oxidation is an issue in studies about the confining properties of such rocks in the framework of geological disposal projects for radioactive waste. Previous studies in several underground research laboratories (URLs) in argillaceous rocks have shown that oxidation reactions mainly occurred in the excavation-induced fracture network surrounding the drifts. In the Callovian-Oxfordian argillaceous rock, at -490 m in drifts from the Meuse/Haute-Marne URL, oxidized features were systematically looked for in 115 borehole cores. The concerned drifts were of various ages, from a few days to 6.5 years. After 5 months, oxidized features were encountered in numerous excavation-induced extensional fractures. In excavation-induced shear fractures, oxidized features were observed in a few borehole cores after 2 years, and they became frequent after 6 years. In all cases, the oxidized features observed were found on the fracture walls or were connected to them, and were less than 1.8 m from the drift walls. These observations about the oxidation front and its evolution over time provide insights regarding the properties of excavation-induced fractures with respect to oxygen transfer.					5th Conference on Clays in Natural and Engineered Barriers for Radioactive Waste Confinement5th Conference on Clays in Natural and Engineered Barriers for Radioactive Waste Confinement	20122012		Montpellier, FRANCEMontpellier, FRANCE	10	0	0	0	2	0	10			0305-8719		978-1-86239-654-8	WOS:000345273400015

While some PEC systems have reached efficiencies as high as 18%, most demonstrated limited stability, and a non-negligible fraction of these are based on either H-2 production or current measurements, without evidence of O-2 production shedding doubts on the overall requirement of a catalytic cycle. In this work, we focus on a system that works under concentrated sunlight composed of a triple junction, a 3 J InGaP/GaAs/Ge photovoltaic cell with its front side covered with a poly(methyl methacrylate) sheet and its backside protected by metallic Ni foil. The hydroxylated Ni metal, in the alkaline environment used, acts as the oxygen evolution catalyst, in addition to protection from corrosion. It does also act as a heat-dissipating material, which is crucial for cell stability under concentrated sunlight. The complete system is stable, producing stoichiometric amounts of H-2 and O-2, and the reaction is therefore catalytic. Under concentrated light, we have studied the effect of changing the area of the Ni foil (effectively the amount of oxygen evolution catalyst) while keeping the "light-receiving front-cell area" constant. This dimensionless ratio is found to determine the reaction rate, below a ratio (Ni area to cell area) of about 1. Meanwhile, above this number, the reaction rate showed marginal changes; it is desired to have this ratio as large as possible in order to decrease the current density and therefore increase the lifetime of the complete system. A compilation of the most stable and most active similar systems is also given and discussed, in particular, in view of the very small number of available work reporting both H-2 and O-2 measurements. The solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies in this work are found to be 14% at 1-15 suns and 12% at 39 suns.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000582567000122

The dynamical and thermal stabilities of the two monolayers are confirmed by the phonon dispersion calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, respectively. The results show that the two 2D materials have indirect bandgaps of 2.45 and 2.43 eV, and the band edges can match the hydrogen evolution reaction conditions. Absorption spectra show that the monolayers respond to visible light and can be tuned by different strains. Besides, the hole and electron mobilities are different, which is beneficial for photoelectronic performance. The mechanisms of the hydrogen evolution reaction and the direct water splitting process are also explored. The calculational results support the promising applications of SiMI4(M = Ge, Sn) monolayers as visible-light-driven photocatalyst of hydrogen production. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The method consists of anodic dissolution of the corresponding metal in DES followed by the deposition on the cathodic surface. The anodic dissolution process in DES overcomes the problems associated with copious hydrogen and oxygen evolution on the electrode surface when carried out in aqueous medium. The proposed method utilizes the inherent abilities of DES to act as a reducing medium while simultaneously stabilizing the nanoparticles that are formed. The mesoporous metal films were characterized by SEM, XRD and electrochemical techniques. Potential applications of these substrates in surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy and electrocatalysis have been investigated. A large enhancement of Raman signal of analyte was achieved on the mesoporous silver substrate after removing all the stabilizer molecules from the surface by calcination. The highly porous texture of the electrodeposited film provides superior electro catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The mechanisms of HER on the fabricated substrates were studied by Tafel analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The products were characterized by X-ray diffractometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The foam-like holey ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets exhibit high crystallinity, narrower band gap (2.46 eV), more exposed edges and enhanced electron transport ability. N-2 adsorption desorption tests show that the few-layer g-C3N4 has a slightly-enlarged specific surface area of 135.6 m(2)/g and enriched small mesopores. Compared with bulk g-C3N4, the few-layer holey g-C3N4 showed a significantly enhanced ability of reactive oxygen species generation and 4-fold higher activity for visible light -driven Rhodamine B photodegradation, which were mainly attributed to the enriched active sites and shorter pathway from the carrier to the reaction sites. These findings provide an inspiration for clean scale-up production of highly-active few-layer g-C3N4 pholocatalysts towards environmental and biological applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose, we propose a rational top-down method to construct a hybrid structure of nickel encased by a carbon shell (Ni@C) using CH4 as a carbon source and Ni wire as a sacrificing template during an electrical explosion of wire. The Ni@C nanoparticles are introduced as highly active and durable non-noble metal electrocatalysts for the HER. The optimized Ni@C (15%) core-shell catalyst (CH4/Ar = 15/85 pressure ratio) demonstrates the highest catalytic activity for the HER with an overpotential of 85 mV to drive a current density of -10 mA cm(-2) and displays a low Tafel slope of 44 mV dec(-1). Another virtue of Ni@C (15%) is its superior stability during an unattenuated HER chronoamperometry for over 24 h. Furthermore, it endures over 168 h submerging in 2 M H2SO4 solution without losing its catalytic activity for HER. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Two pathways to CO and two to CO(2) evolution, all involving either undissociated or dissociated surface oxide complexes, were assumed. Rate coefficient parameters and O(2) reaction orders were then optimized to simulate the TPO profiles recorded over a range of conditions: heating rates of 2, 5 and 10 degrees C and O(2) partial pressures of 0.939, 1.11, and 5.0% in an atmosphere of N(2). Evolution rates of CO during TPO are independent of the O(2) partial pressure, whereas an order of 0.75 is indicated for CO(2) formation. Because of differences in assumed mechanisms and carbon substrates, calculated preexponential factors and activation energies can not be readily compared with literature values, although some comparisons are made. If the heating rate is high (greater than or equal to 5 degrees C min(-1)) and the oxygen partial pressure is low (less than or equal to 1%), the shape of TPO profiles for highly saturated hydrocarbon coke deposited on cracking catalyst are affected by changes in the rate-determining step with increasing temperature.

At 140 K two molecular SO2 species are observed that are attributed to adsorption on different adsorption sites. Upon heating to 340 K atomic S and molecular SO3 and SO4 are formed with the amount of the various products depending on the initial SO2 coverage. For high SO2 coverages these reactions are accompanied by molecular SO2 desorption. The SO3 species decomposes upon further heating to 500 K leading to SO2 desorption. SO4, which is only formed for high initial SO2 coverages, is stable up to this temperature but decomposes upon further heating to 650 K. In the same temperature range atomic sulphur and oxygen recombine to desorb as SO2.									39	1	0	0	0	0	40			0039-6028	1879-2758		WOS:A1997WE53100007

Electrodes of nominal composition Ti/Ru-0.3 M0.7O2 (where M = Ti ou Sn) were used in 0.5 mol dm(-3) H2SO4 in a filter-press cell. Both electrodes exhibit behaviour typical of such materials in the presence of formaldehyde. However, with acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde non-typical behaviour is observed. This is characterised by a fall in the normalised faradaic anodic charge (q(nf)) and also a decrease in the current density associated with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A possible reaction mechanism, considering the direct oxidation of the aldehyde at the electrode surface, is suggested.									9	1	0	0	2	2	9			0103-5053			WOS:000184902600023		
J	ECKERT, HJ; GEIKEN, B; BERNARDING, J; NAPIWOTZKI, A; EICHLER, HJ; RENGER, G								2 SITES OF PHOTOINHIBITION OF THE ELECTRON-TRANSFER IN OXYGEN EVOLVING AND TRIS-TREATED PS-II MEMBRANE-FRAGMENTS FROM SPINACH								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				27	2			97	108		10.1007/BF00033249				FEB 1991	1991	Photoinhibition was analyzed in O-2-evolving and in Tris-treated PS II membrane fragments by measuring flash-induced absorption changes at 830 nm reflecting the transient P680+ formation and oxygen evolution. Irradiation by visible light affects the PS II electron transfer at two different sites: a) photoinhibition of site I eliminates the capability to perform a 'stable' charge separation between P680+ and Q(A)- within the reaction center (RC) and b) photoinhibition of site II blocks the electron transfer from Y(Z) to P680+. The quantum yield of site I photoinhibition (2-3 x 10(-7) inhibited RC/quantum) is independent of the functional integrity of the water oxidizing system. In contrast, the quantum yield of photoinhibition at site II depends strongly on the oxygen evolution capacity. In O-2-evolving samples. the quantum yield of site II photoinhibition is about 10(-7) inhibited RC/quantum. After selective elimination of the O2-evolving capacity by Tris-treatment, the quantum yield of photoinhibition at site II depends on the light intensity. At low intensity (< 3 W/m2), the quantum yield is 10(-4) inhibited RC/quantum (about 1000 times higher than in oxygen evolving samples). Based on these results it is inferred that the dominating deleterious effect of photoinhibition cannot be ascribed to an unique target site or a single mechanism because it depends on different experimental conditions (e.g., light intensity) and the functional status of the PS II complex.									116	3	1	0	106	0	119			0166-8595			WOS:A1991FE70700003	24414573

To produce the composite Ni/TiO2 electrodeposits, a plating bath based on a deep eutectic solvent, a novel kind of ionic liquids, was used for the first time. The electrolyte contained ethaline (a eutectic mixture of choline chloride and ethylene glycol), 1 M NiCl2 center dot 6H(2)O and the addition of extra water (3, 6, 9 mol dm(-3)). Titania dispersed phase was introduced into the electrolyte as nanopowder Degussa P 25 (0-10 g dm(-3)). It was shown that the introduction of extra water to the plating bath allowed appreciably increasing the content of TiO2 phase in the coating (from ca. 2 to 10 wt%). The effects of electrolysis conditions on the TiO2 content in the coatings, surface morphology and microstructure were determined. The results of voltammetry measurements showed that the Ni and composite Ni/TiO2 coatings electrodeposited from the plating electrolyte based on a deep eutectic solvent exhibit improved electrocatalytic properties towards the hydrogen evolution reaction as compared with deposits obtained from commonly used aqueous electrolytes. The mechanism of the hydrogen evolution reaction on the Ni and composite Ni/TiO2 coatings is a combination of Volmer-Heyrovsky reactions. The introduction of TiO2 particles into the nickel matrix results in the acceleration of the hydrogen evolution reaction. An improved catalytic activity of Ni/TiO2 composites towards the hydrogen evolution reaction can be associated with the presence of titanium-containing redox couples on the surface.

It's known that using non-renewable fossil fuels as a direct energy source causes greenhouse gas emissions. Safe, sustainable and renewable energy sources for biofuel cell (BFC) and metal-air batteries hold considerable potential for clean electrical energy generators without the need for a thermal cycle. In an electrochemical reaction system, the four-electron reduction from molecular oxygen at the air-cathode surface to hydroxide ion or water at a reasonably low overpotential was the ultimate goal of many investigations and plays a vital role in metal-air batteries and fuel cell device systems. Different MnxOy nanostructured materials, from Biofunctional structural catalysts up to their electrocatalytic contributions towards ORR are discussed. Brief descriptions of ORR, principle strategy and mechanism, as well as recent developments of cationic dopants and electrolytic media, effect on the air-cathode surface of manganese oxide nanocatalyst are also discussed. Finally, challenges associated with platinum and carbon support platinum in improving electron and charge transfer between biocatalyst and air-cathode electrode are summarized. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Thick BSTF films were therefore deposited on alumina substrates coated by silver-palladium (Ag-Pd) bottom electrodes and then sintered at 1100 A degrees C for 2 h. These films were physically and electrically characterized. The dielectric constant, loss tangent and conductivity evolutions were investigated in extended frequency and temperature ranges and compared to results given by a non doped barium titanate thick film. A huge increase of the BSTF conductivity variation, by a factor of 10,000 at low frequency when the temperature ranges from 25 to 500 A degrees C, was observed. This behaviour, associated to a relaxation mechanism governed by the migration of oxygen vacancies, has led to a drastic change of the BSTF conductivity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000369010900140

Thus, highly efficient, cheap catalysts are urgently required. Transition metal oxides such as CoOx, FeOx, and NiOx are low-cost, low toxicity, and abundant materials for a wide range of electrochemical reactions, but are almost inert for CO2RR. Here, we report for the first time that nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNT) have a surprising activation effect on the activity and selectivity of transition metal-oxide (MOx where M = Fe, Ni, and Co) nanoclusters for CO2RR. MOx supported on N-CNT, MOx/N-CNT, achieves a CO yield of 2.6-2.8 mmol cm(-2) min(-1) at an overpotential of -0.55 V, which is two orders of magnitude higher than MOx supported on acid treated CNTs (MOx/O-CNT) and four times higher than pristine N-CNT. The faraday efficiency for electrochemical CO2-to-CO conversion is as high as 90.3% at overpotential of 0.44 V. Both in-situ XAS measurements and DFT calculations disclose that MOx nanoclusters can be hydrated in CO2 saturated KHCO3, and the N defects of N-CNT effectively stabilize these metal hydroxyl species under carbon dioxide reduction reaction conditions, which can split the water molecules and provide local protons to inhibit the poisoning of active sites under carbon dioxide reduction reaction conditions.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2575-0356		WOS:000771567100001

The water oxidation reaction occurs in the catalytic core of photosystemII, which consists of a Mn4Ca metal cluster, at which, after the accumulation of four oxidising equivalents through five steps (S0-S4) of the Kok-Joliot cycle, two water molecules are split into electrons, protons, and molecular oxygen. In recent years, by combining experimental and theoretical approaches, new insights have been achieved into the structural and electronic properties of different steps of the catalytic cycle. Nevertheless, the exact catalytic mechanism, especially concerning the final stages of the cycle, remains elusive and greatly debated. Herein, by means of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics simulations, from the structural, electronic, and magnetic points of view, the S-3 state before and upon oxidation has been characterised. In contrast with the S-2 state, the oxidation of the S-3 state is not followed by a spontaneous proton-coupled electron-transfer event. Nevertheless, upon modelling the reduction of the tyrosine residue in photosystem II (Tyr(Z)) and the protonation of Asp61, spontaneous proton transfer occurs, leading to the deprotonation of an oxygen atom bound to Mn1; thus making it available for O-O bond formation.									18	1	0	0	6	0	18			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000439925300032	29660163

Hybrid perovskites contain various components with high polarity and/or charge values, which undergo transformations due to ion exchange, photoinduced phase segregation, or ion migration. These variable characteristics make perovskites "soft materials". Meanwhile, optoelectronic devices often operate under electrochemical reactions in the presence of an electrical field. To examine the effect of this field on the material/photophysical properties of hybrid perovskites, hybrid FAPbBr(3) (FA(+): CH(NH2)(2)(+)) perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) were synthesized. In this study, we report the spectroelectrochemical investigation of the hybrid FAPbBr(3) PQDs to understand the electrochemical stability and degradation process. We also found that the electrochemical condition played an important role in inducing defect-mediated oxidation/reduction reactions, changing the photophysical properties of hybrid PQDs, and causing their irreversible transformations to various lead halide plumbate complexes. These findings can help develop a strategy for enhancing the operational performance of PQDs for the solar driven chemistry.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0003-2654	1364-5528		WOS:000750990000001	35119443

In this study, single atom Iridium (Ir) introduced into both phases of an amorphous NiMoPxOy and crystalline NiMoP phase generates enriched active sites with high intrinsic activity, and the catalyst material coating on the carbon nanotube interconnected graphene sheet on copper foam (Ir-NiMoP-NiMoPxOy/CNTs-Gr/Cu) serves as an electron transport pathway and improves the surface area and protective layer. The engineered material exhibits excellent electrochemical water splitting characteristics, similar to those of Ir-NiMoP-MoNiPxOy/CNTs-Gr/Cu, showing a small overpotential of 138 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 220 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The overall water splitting of Ir-NiMoP-NiMoPxOy/CNTs-Gr/Cu in 1.0 M KOH was extremely stable after 150 hours of operation at 50 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory calculations show that the real active sites are Ir and Mo in the hybrid amorphous/crystalline phase of Ir-NiMoP-MoNiPxOy, providing a new pathway for designing an effective catalyst for future applications in the hydrogen production field.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000818939200001

Among different 1T-TMDCs, vanadium (V)-based 1T-TMDCs has highest thermodynamic stability. Now, among different V-based 1T-TMDCs, 1T-VTe2 holds the best potential for ECWS due to strongest interlayer coupling between V and Te. In the present study, we have developed nickel nanoclusters (NiNCs) hybridized and manganese (Mn) intercalated and doped 1T-VTe2 nanosheets (NiNCs-1T-Mn-VTe2 NS) for ultra-low potential ECWS. Mn doping and intercalation in 1T-VTe2 (1T-Mn-VTe2) significantly improve ECWS efficacy following improving oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performances. Hybridization of NiNCs with1T-Mn- VTe2 develop a true ECWS-catalyst NiNCs-1T-Mn-VTe2 NS for ultra-low potential water-splitting. NiNCs-1T-Mn-VTe2 NS showed excellent performance requiring only HER-overpotential of 61 mV to reach 10 mA cm-2 and OER overpotential of 258 mV to reach 40 mA cm-2. NiNCs-1T-Mn-VTe2NS (+ -) device required a cell potential of 1.51 V to reach 10 mA cm-2.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000707858700001

In this work, a facile thermal decomposition method has been used to synthesize CoP nanorods (NRs) in situ grown on graphene oxide co-doped with nitrogen and sulfur (CoP/ NSGO) as a high activity and stability hybrid catalyst for the HER. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and N-2 sorption. The as-synthesized CoP/NSGO catalyst exhibited much higher HER performance than CoP/NGO and CoP/GO catalysts, indicating the positive role of N, S co doping into the graphene frame. The formation of pyridinic N and pyrrolic N species as well as thiophene S species, which acted as novel active centers and benefited the suitable chemisorption of intermediates for catalyzing HER, improved the catalytic activity. Our current research indicates that both nitrogen and sulfur atoms played an important role in enhancing the HER performance for CoP-based catalysts.

The model includes both heat now by conduction and convection as well as fluid now in and out of a representative volume. Overall mineral reactions can then take place within this rock volume in response to internal and external factors. The paper derives a simple "back-of-the-envelope" expression for the steady state reached by the system. The steady state composition of the fluid and the steady state temperature are then compared with the composition and temperature predicted by the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium. Expressions for the amount of fluid passing through the system based on the kinetic model are compared with previous calculations of the mass of fluid added to the system using the equilibrium assumptions. The approach to this steady state is also analyzed and an analytical solution is obtained for the time evolution up to the steady state. Both the steady state and the time evolution solution are then applied to an understanding of the dynamics involved in obtaining T-X-t paths in nature. The results of the kinetic approach lead to major revisions in many of the previously held concepts used in petrologic fluid flow models. These include the expected reaction pathway, the role of metastable reactions, the calculation of fluid flux, the role of the invariant point, and the interpretation of mineral textures and modal abundances of minerals.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			0002-9599			WOS:000086588900001

Here we report our findings in improving the electrochemical performance and structural stability of a Y doped air electrode with a composition of BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zn0.1Y0.1O3-delta (BCFZY). When applied as the air electrode of a PCEC, high performance is demonstrated, achieving a polarization resistance of 0.04 Omega cm(2) and a high peak power density of 870 mWcm-(2) at 700 degrees C. In addition, the single-cell with BCFZY electrode displays a lower degradation rate of 4.2% per 100 h when operated at 0.5Acm(-2) and 650 degrees C in fuel cell mode, much lower than that of 55% per 100 h for cells with BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zn0.2 (BCFZ) electrode under the same condition. The stable structure has been confirmed by the phase structure analyses of the electrode powder after a long-term heating treatment in air.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000781417300003

The performance of the composite photoelectrode is found to be further enhanced through a cyclic-voltammetry-related in situ activation process, and a photocurrent of 5.0 mA/cm(2) is achieved at 1.23 VRHE with improved photoelectrochemical stability. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman, and electron spin resonance (ESR) characterization results indicate that the surface-loaded a-NiFeMo cocatalyst undergoes a rapid surface reconstruction during the in situ activation process, which results in an incorporation of phosphate ions in the surface-loaded a-NiFeMo, along with an increased oxidation state of Ni ions and enriched oxygen vacancies. These combined effects lead to an improved oxygen evolution reaction performance and finally result in a reduced charge-transfer resistance at the solid/liquid interface, causing the interfacial charge-injection efficiency to be enormously enhanced from the original 25.1% in pure BiVO4 to 83.3% in BiVO4/a-NiFeMo after being in situ activated. Our result indicates that the rapid surface-reconstruction phenomenon shown in the amorphous materials may provide a promising strategy for designing a highly efficient cocatalyst for photoelectrodes.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000730254300001

However, the key bottleneck of MnO2 electrode materials are their poor rate capability and electrochemical stability. Herein, we successfully obtained oxygen vacancy-rich K-birnessite MnO2 (KxMnO2) by plasma etching strategy. K+ intercalation in MnO2 can adjust the interlayer distances, which improves the structural stability of material, and constructs a tunable Zn2+ channel. Meanwhile, the oxygen vacancy is not only contribute to the fast adsorption and diffusion of electrolytic ions, but also to the rapid transfer of charges. In addition, the nano-structure could provide abundant reaction sites and short diffusion pathways. Remarkably, the KxMnO2 is used cathode material of ZIBs after plasma optimization treatment presents reversible specific capacity of 272 mAh g(-1) at 1 mA cm(-2), and then it could reach an admirable capacity of 310 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. As the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts, the overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) of KxMnO2 is 1.47 V of versus RHE. The Tafel slope is 36 mV dec(-1), which is lower than that of the KxMnO2 without plasma treatment (244 mV dec(-1)). This study provides a new opportunity to design low-cost and high-performance electrode materials for rechargeable zinc-ion batteries and OER catalyst by using plasma processing technology.

This work reports a general approach for the synthesis of Pd@PdO-Co3O4 nanocubes using the zeolite-type metal-organic framework (MOF) as a template. The as-synthesized materials exhibit a high electrocatalytic activity toward OER and ORR, which is comparable to those of commercial RuO2 and Pt/C electrocatalysts, while its cycle performance and stability are much higher than those of commercial RuO2 and Pt/C electrocatalysts. Various physicochemical characterizations and density functional theory calculations indicate that the favorable electrochemical performance of the Pd@PdO-Co3O4 nanocubes is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between PdO and the robust hollow structure composed of interconnected crystalline Co3O4 nanocubes. This work establishes an efficient approach for the controlled design and synthesis of MOF-templated hybrid nanomaterials, and provides a great potential for developing high-performance electrocatalysts in energy storage and conversion.									68	2	0	0	5	0	68			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000430163100022		
J	Yang, Gongzheng; Wang, Chengxin								Platinum-Induced Pseudo-Zn-Air Reaction Massively Increases the Electrochemical Capacity of Aqueous Zn/V5O12 center dot 6H(2)O Batteries								ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL MATERIALS				4	4			596	602		10.1002/eem2.12141		DEC 2020		OCT 2021	2021	How to effectively improve Zn2+-storage properties is now becoming an urgent issue in the development of high-energy-density aqueous zinc-ion batteries. Here, a new method is proposed to massively increase the electrochemical capacity of aqueous Zn/V5O12 center dot 6H(2)O batteries. By adding a small amount of platinum (Pt, 1.5 wt.%) and keeping other factors constant, the V5O12 center dot 6H(2)O-Pt electrodes deliver a much higher specific capacity (440 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1)) than do V5O12 center dot 6H(2)O electrodes (270 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1)). The structural and morphological evolution of V5O12 center dot 6H(2)O during cycling results in Zn2+ ion insertion/extraction and the formation/disappearance of the zinc hydroxyl complex (Zn4SO4(OH)(6)center dot 5H(2)O, ZHS), where the latter is closely related to the surface redox reaction, promoting Zn2+ ion stripping/plating on the Zn anode and consequently leading to extra electron transfer. Electrochemical tests in the absence of oxygen reveal that the Pt additive has no contribution and is even counterproductive to electric conductivity but favors remarkable enhancement of the pseudocapacitance. Accordingly, it is apparent that a strong causal relationship exists between Pt and the ZHS. In consideration of the catalytic application for oxygen reduction, Pt is expected to play a vital role in enhancing the electrochemical capacity through the pseudo-Zn-air reaction. This finding introduces a new strategy for achieving high-performance aqueous zinc-ion batteries.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2575-0356		WOS:000604671700001

In this work, this hypothesis is tested by preparing composite heterostructures of chemically and structurally dissimilar and wide-bandgap semiconductors, titania (TiO2) and zirconia (ZrO2). Herein, the underpotential hydrogen generation ability of the composite nanoparticles is studied for the first time. The dissimilarity in coordination can create charge imbalance once the composite of these two materials is formed, which in turn can increase the surface acidity and the active sites for proton adsorption as proved through various analytical techniques. The composite of separately incompetent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts shows improved HER activity due to improved charge transfer between the composite catalyst and reactant caused by the generation of the new electronic states. To improve the electronic conduction, we have performed the reduction of TiO2/ZrO2 binary metal oxide composite, which results in oxygen vacancies in the composite. The reduced counterpart of the composite is found to possess semimetallic properties and shows outstanding high stability and 7 times increase in HER current density at -0.6 V along with a very small overpotential of only similar to 160 mV penalty to have a HER current density of 10 mA/cm(2) .									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2574-0970			WOS:000529206200054

In this model, the reduction and oxidation of water proceeds on the inner and outer surface of novel TiO2 nanotubes, respectively. The variable-valence metal oxide with suitable electrochemical properties could be used as the water oxidation catalyst, and its surface lattice oxygen would take part in O2 evolution. The difficulty of overall water splitting, i, e. , evolving of O2 while needs to transfer four electrons, might be overcome. We want that this nano PEC cell-like model will be explored and verified by colleagues in the future.									0	2	0	0	0	0	2			1674-0475			INSPEC:15543456

Traditionally juxtaposition of two transition metals with one being more oxophilic is necessary for easier access to water in the inner Helmholtz plane as a source of protons in the crucial Volmer step for enhanced HER activity. However, they are prone to passivation at anodic potentials or deactivation via the formation of sub-surface metal hydrides at high cathodic overpotentials. Here we report a method of enabling close juxtaposition of Ni-Ni-oxide surfaces by functionalizing Ni-based catalysts via the careful thermal treatment of carbon-supported Ni nano-particles chelated with a select organic chelating compound referred to as cupferron. This functionalization results in an embedded Ni surface with a clear graphitic coating engendering long-term stability for passivation and subsurface hydride formation. The stability and activity of the functionalized Ni catalyst are demonstrated in half-cell RDE and full-cell AEM membrane-based hydrogen pump experiments. In the case of the latter, the functionalized Ni outperforms carbon-supported Pt.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000683700200001

The samples were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) , scanning electron microscopy (SEM) , transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and electrochemical tests. In addition, their catalytic hydrogen evolution performances were evaluated by the microbial electrolytic cell (MEC). The results show that the ZSM-5 molecular sieves composed of stacked ZSM-5 nanoparticles under the action of carbon spheres are ellipsoidal morphology, which mesopomus specific surface area and mesopomus pore volume have significantly increased. After immersion and roasting, the speckled NiO, nanoparticles are covered the mesoporous surface formed by the crystal gap and the surface of the molecular sieve. Compared with pure NiO, the composites with 40% nickel-salts show that the absorption peak of multivalent nickels and oxygen shift to the high energy direction. Eventually the electrocatalytic activities are significantly improved by increasing active sites of multivalent nickel, aluminum atoms and oxygen vacancies, the composites exhibit high current density (8.45 mA/cm(2)) and low overpotential(151 mV). During the MEC operation cycle, the average hydrogen evolution current density of the composite is (28.64 +/- 7.4) A/m(3), the total gas production is (52.67 +/- 1.64) mL, and the H-2 purity is (89.07 +/- 0.06)%. The hydrogen evolution efficiency (0.571 m(3).m(-3).d(-1)) and coulombic efficiency[ (76.7 +/- 5.4)%] of composite cathode are similar to Pt/C cathode, indicating that the composite is a low cost and high efficiency hydrogen evolution material, which offers a possible alternative to Pt cathode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0251-0790			WOS:000694009900021

Uniformly embedded nanodots on rGO sheets were visualized using transmission electron microscopy.

In particular, P nanodot incorporated rGO demonstrates a high specific capacitance of 334.2 F g(-1), of which 99.2% is retained after 10 000 repeated charge/discharge cycles.

However, during coking wastewater treatment, the coexisting ions and process parameters optimization, which were closely related to the removal efficiency and energy consumption, have never been investigated systematically. Herein, we firstly investigated the influences of some typical ions in coking wastewater on Clremoval. Then we employed response surface methodology to establish mathematical expressions between process parameters and response values (removal efficiency, current efficiency, and energy consumption) and implemented multi-response optimization based on desirability function. Results indicated that all the ions investigated, significantly OH-, SCN-, SO42- and NH4+, could inhibit Cl- removal by thermodynamic inhibition, competing for adsorption sites, or generating Cl- via some reactions. Moreover, the calculated optimal process parameters, which could meet maximum removal efficiency and minimum energy consumption for Cl- removal, were current density of 33.43 mA cm-2, plate distance of 10.17 cm, and initial pH of 7.32. This study systematically analyzed the factors affecting the Cl- removal and further provided ideas for optimizing pollutant removal in electrochemical pretreatment of wastewater.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000681687800004

Here, we propose the introduction of cobalt phosphide (CoP) to efficiently regulate the electronic configuration of Ru. The resultant CoP nanowire array decorated with ultrafine Ru nanoparticles on a conductive carbon cloth substrate (denoted as Ru-CoP/CC) displays comparable catalytic performance to the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst for HER in 1 M KOH solution, requiring an extremely low overpotential of only similar to 21 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), exhibiting a Tafel slope as low as similar to 49 mV/dec, and maintaining excellent stability over 24 h of electrolysis. Density functional theory calculations on the simulated charge distribution reveal that the regulation of the surface electronic structure of Ru by CoP decreases the adsorption energy of OH* and H* intermediates on the surface of Ru and ultimately contributes to the outstanding electrocatalytic activity of the RueCoP/CC electrode for HER.

Subsequently these highly porous materials are demonstrated as an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions. Structure, morphology and porosity of these materials are controlled through thermal oxidation between 200 and 600 degrees C and the resultant materials are designated as NiCo-200, NiCo-400 and NiCo-600 respectively. Among the different materials studied in this work, NiCo-200 exhibits better electrocatalytic behaviour for OER with a lower overpotential of 420 mV for obtaining a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) along with a turnover frequency value of 0.0234 s(-1). The observed higher electrocatalytic activity is attributed to the presence of hydrophilic surface, enriched pores and crystalline nature of NiCo-200. Further the stability studies carried out under alkaline medium at a fixed current density of 20 mA/cm(2) showed that both NiCo-200 and NiCo-600 displayed a good stability and retain OER characteristics for a longer duration. Finally our results clearly show that the binary metallic hydroxide/oxide sponges could potentially act as a new class of electrocatalyst in energy conversion devices mainly for alkaline water electrolysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2523-3963	2523-3971		WOS:000617498700003

Here, we used a simple and efficient method to enhance OER electrocatalytic activity in the alkaline solution by introducing A-site cation deficiency in SrNb0.1Co0.7Fe0.2O3-delta perovskite, namely Sr1-xNb0.1Co0.7Fe0.2O3-delta (x = 0.02, 0.05 and 0.1, denoted as S0.98NCF, S0.95NCF and S0.90NCF, respectively). A-site cation deficiency results in a shrinkage of crystal structure and a change of element oxidation state according to X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The electrochemical OER activity is also greatly improved by a small Sr cation deficiency. Linear voltammetry scanning test, Tafel plots and mass activity analysis demonstrated that Sr0.95Nb0.1Co0.7Fe0.2O3-delta (S0.95NCF) has the highest OER activity among Sr1-xNb0.1Co0.7Fe0.2O3-delta perovskite electrocatalysts. This enhancement is attributed to the increased surface oxygen vacancies and enlarged electrochemical surface area (ECSA). This work highlights the importance of introducing A-site cation deficiency in perovskites as a simple and efficient strategy for the promotion of OER activity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the inevitable instability of electrides, which is caused by inherent excess electrons, has hampered their widespread applications. We report that a self-passivated dihafnium sulfide electride ([Hf2S](2+)center dot 2e(-)) by double amorphous layers exhibits a strong oxidation resistance in water and acid solutions, enabling a persistent electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. The naturally formed amorphous Hf2S layer on the cleaved [Hf2S](2+)center dot 2e(-) surface reacts with oxygen to form an outermost amorphous HfO2 layer with similar to 10-nm thickness, passivating the [Hf2S](2+)center dot 2e(-) electride. The excess electrons in the [Hf2S](2+)center dot 2e(-) electride are transferred through the thin HfO2 passivation layer to water molecules under applied electric fields, demonstrating the first electrocatalytic reaction with excellent long-term sustainability and no degradation in performance. This self-passivation mechanism in reactive conditions can advance the development of stable electrides for energy-efficient applications.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2375-2548			WOS:000540787200047	32548272

Here, we have integrated an ultrathin Al2O3 layer and novel copper-cobalt oxide (CuCoOx) cocatalyst on alpha-Fe2O3 photo-anode to construct unobstructed holes transfer pathway and improve PEC activity. The resultant alpha-Fe2O3/Al2O3/CuCoO x photoanode exhibits high photocurrent density of 2.23 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (V RHE ) and negative onset potential of 0.7 VRETE, which is about 17.6 times higher and 200 mV cathodic shift than bare alpha-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays. Detailed experimental results indicate the surface recombination passivation function of Al2O3 layer and improvement in charge separation and transfer kinetics of the role of low overpotential of CuCoOx with abundant oxygen vacancies for OER. The comparison discussion with CoOx and CuOx oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs) further illustrates the excellent catalytic performance of the CuCoOx. This work points to the effective utilization of novel but cheap CuCoOx OECs on photoanodes and provides a strategy for designing high activity photoanodes in photoelectrochemical water oxidation.									87	2	0	0	4	0	87			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000552015900033

In this work, transparent Ta3N5 photoanodes were fabricated on n-type GaN/sapphire substrates to promote O-2 evolution in tandem with a photocathode, to realize overall water splitting. Following the incorporation of an underlying GaN layer, a photocurrent of 6.3 mA cm(-2) was achieved at 1.23 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode. The transparency of Ta3N5 to wavelengths longer than 600 nm allowed incoming solar light to be transmitted to a CuInSe2 (CIS), which absorbs up to 1100 nm. A stand-alone tandem cell with a serially-connected dual-CIS unit terminated with a Pt/Ni electrode was thus constructed for H-2 evolution. This tandem cell exhibited a solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency greater than 7 % at the initial stage of the reaction.									51	2	0	0	1	0	51			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000458417700018	30548747

Graphene oxide (GO) precursor was synthesized by an improved Hummers' method, whereas N-doping was performed hydrothermally in the presence of ammonia. After nitrogenation, doped graphene oxide samples (NGO) contained a reduced amount of oxygen and about 9% w/w nitrogen as pyridinic, pyrrole, and graphitic groups. Nevertheless, it was possible to obtain a stable aqueous dispersion of NGOs, a prerequisite for the EPD process. According to SEM images, the EPD coatings were compact with minor defects. On the contrary, GO coating possessed cracks and large pores that resulted from gas evolution during electrolysis. Electrochemical studies showed that all coatings prevented copper from corrosion in saline solution, however, the nitrogenated coatings did not exhibit better anti-corrosion properties than reduced graphene oxide coating. A reasonable explanation of this finding is that some positive properties of the nitrogenated coatings, in terms of anti-corrosion action, like low hydrophilicity and good adhesion, were counteracted by their catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction.									19	3	0	0	1	0	21			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000502588700035

Herein, we synthesized Ni/Co9S8@CNT micro flower comprising Ni/Co9S8 mesoporous nanosheets and carbon nanotubes (CNT). HRTEM images indicate that the Ni/Co9S8@CNT micro flower contains abundant Ni/Co9S8 heterojunctions. The band structure and coupling effect of the Ni/Co9S8 heterostructure optimizes the transfer of electrons, thus the synergistic hybrid effectively improves conductivity and electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, Ni/Co9S8@CNT shows good evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in an alkaline environment. Specifically, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotential of OER is 289 mV, and the overpotential of HER is 228 mV. The Tafel slope is 69 mV dec(-1). In addition, Ni/Co9S8@CNT in alkaline electrolyte only loses 10% of its activity after working for 10 h at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). These results indicate that composite materials composed of transition metal sulfides and highly conductive carbon materials are a good choice for low-cost electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000670842800001

Generally, aggregation results in a decline. This is a different case in supramolecular catalysis. A new concept based on surfactants equipped with functional heads is presented, which becomes a more active catalyst itself upon aggregation. The head group of the surfactants is composed of a diethylenetriamine-functionalized fullerene capable of coordinating to catalytically active metals like Co-II. The improvement of catalytic properties upon aggregation is demonstrated via electrocatalytic water-splitting reaction as a model system. Detailed electrochemistry studies were performed at concentrations below and above the critical aggregation concentration (cac). While isolated surfactant molecules represent only moderately active catalysts, drastic improvement of efficiency in the hydrogen evolution (HER) as well as in the oxygen evolution reactions (OER) were detected, once vesicular structures have formed. Self-organization of the surfactants leads to an increase in turnover frequencies of up to 1300 % (HER). The strongly beneficial effect of aggregation arises from the favorable alignment of individual molecules, thus, facilitating intermolecular charge transfer processes in the vesicles.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000534223100009

ACS ENERGY LETTERS				3	1			237	244		10.1021/acsenergylett.7b01103				JAN 2018	2018	Reducing the energy consumption of a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at a platinum (Pt) electrode is important for the hydrogen economy. Herein, we report the loading of alpha- or beta-nickel hydroxide (alpha- or beta-Ni(OH)(2)) nanostructures on the surface of a Pt electrode to improve its catalytic activity and stability for HER in alkaline electrolytes. Both experimental and theoretical studies reveal that beta-Ni(OH)(2) is a better co-catalyst of Pt than alpha-Ni(OH)(2) for promoting the HER, attributed to the higher water dissociation ability of beta-Ni(OH)(2), as well as the stronger interactions between beta-Ni(OH)(2) and the Pt electrode. Particularly, the over potential of the HER in 0.1 M KOH at 10 mA cm(-2) is decreased from 278 mV at the Pt electrode to 92 mV at the beta-Ni(OH)(2)/Pt electrode, and the Tafel slope decreased from 62 to 42 mV dec(-1), correspondingly. The performance of the beta-Ni(OH)(2)/Pt catalytic electrode surpasses that of most of the previously reported electrodes for the same purpose.									157	8	0	0	2	0	161			2380-8195			WOS:000422814500034

The changes in the chemical structure of the lignite during the drying process were investigated using Raman and FTIR spectroscopy. The results indicated that the effect of the drying temperature on the evolution of the macromolecular structure and functional groups of the lignite are different from each other. In the drying temperature range of 500 ~ 700 ℃,the aliphatic structures and oxygen-containing groups such as carboxyls are decomposed and small molecular substances are produced with the increase in drying temperature. During the process,the content of aliphatic structure decreases and that of the aromatic structure increases. The size of the small aromatic rings shows an enlarging tendency due to the further aromatic ring condensation and the new C_(alkyl)-C_(aryl) structures are continuously formed due to the cross-linking effect. Therefore,the stability of coal macromolecular structure has been enhanced. With the drying temperature of 800 ℃,however,the reaction between the aliphatics and the oxygen present in the pore of the lignite results in increases oxygen-containing groups compared with the sample dried at 700 ℃. In addition, the partial aromatic C = C and heterocycles are destroyed and the amorphous phase of carbon increases.			在自制卧式干燥试验台上进行500 ~ 800 ℃褐煤高温干燥脱水实验,采用拉曼光谱和傅里叶红外光谱(FTIR)对干燥后煤样的化学结构进行测试和分析.结果表明,不同干燥温度对褐煤大分子结构以及官能团的演化有着不同程度的影响.500 ~ 700 ℃干燥下,随干燥温度升高,脂族和羧基等含氧官能团相继断键析出,形成小分子物质,脂族结构含量与芳族结构含量总体上呈现互补的演化趋势;芳环缩合性有所增强,导致小芳环系统向大芳环系统转变,交联效应促使烷基-芳基C - C键的新芳香结构生成,褐煤大分子结构的稳定性有所提高.而温度上升至800 ℃,煤中孔隙夹带的氧气与脂族等发生一系列氧化反应,导致此时含氧官能团数量高于700 ℃干燥处理煤样.此外,部分芳烃C = C和杂环断裂,无定形碳结构增加.						0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1001-2060			CSCD:6262287

In this work, the monoatomic-thick dot-sized graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been synthesized and intimately contacted to the basal plane of the graphene sheet to form the monolayer g-C3N4 dots@graphene (MTCG). The electrocatalytic activity of the MTCG in the oxygen reduction reaction is found to rival that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst in terms of the catalytic current density and half-wave potential. The density functional theory calculations confirm the catalytic improvement of the MTCG originates from a higher efficiency for the reduction of OOH-than that of the g-C3N4 alone; therefore, the current work is expected to provide new insights in developing next-generation, highly efficient catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction.									72	3	0	0	5	0	73			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000349473200027	25603736

Herein, a facile co-reduction approach was developed to fabricate three-dimensional (3D) hyperbranched PtRh nanoassemblies (NAs) under solvothermal conditions, where creatinine and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) were employed as the structure-directing agents. The as-synthesized nanocatalyst exhibited intriguing catalytic characters for hydrogen evolution reduction (HER) with a low over-potential (20 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope (49.01 mV dec(-1)). Meanwhile, the catalyst showed remarkably enlarged mass activity (MA: 2.16/2.02 A mg(-1)) and specific activity (SA: 4.16/3.88 mA cm(-2)) towards ethylene glycol and glycerol oxidation reactions (EGOR and GOR) alternative to commercial Pt black and homemade Pt3Rh nanodendrites (NDs), PtRh3 NDs and Pt nanoparticles (NPs). This method offers a feasible platform to fabricate bifunctional, efficient, durable and cost-effective nanocatalysts with finely engineered structures and morphologies for renewable energy devices.

La5Ti2Cu(S1-xSex)(5)O-7 (LTCS1-xSexO) solid solutions were obtained over the composition range of 0 <= x <= 1 by a solidstate reaction, and their physical properties and photocatalytic activities during the H-2 evolution reaction in aqueous solutions were assessed. Structural refinements revealed that the lattice constants and cell volumes of the LTCS1-xSexO series follow Vegards' law. With increases in the Se2- content, the LTCS1-xSexO absorption edge shifts monotonically toward longer wavelengths, to a maximum of 820 nm for LTCSeO (x = 1). Those materials for which x <= 0.8 generated H-2 from aqueous solutions containing Na2S and Na2SO3 as electron donors under visible- light irradiation ( lambda > 420 nm) after surface modification with in situ precipitated NiS. Comparatively higher H2 evolution was observed for LTCS1-xSexO with lower Se(2-)levels, although the sample for which x= 0.2 generated H-2 under visible light at wavelengths longer than 640 nm, whereas the LTCSO did not.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2367-0932			WOS:000406609000004

Herein, unique volcano-like FeIr alloy self-supported on nickel foam (NF) is prepared by hydrothermal process. It only needs overpotentials of 220.0 and 25.6 mV for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER, HER) at +/- 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, and both of them can keep for 124 h at +/- 1,000 mA cm(-2). For overall water splitting, 1.51 and 1.75 V are needed to reach 10 and 500 mA cm(-2), and it can work at 500 mA cm(-2) for 100 h in 30 wt% KOH solution at 60 degrees C. This can be due to the self-supporting volcano-like FeIr alloy structure, which can enhance the HER/OER intrinsic activity, and it is good for bubbles release to improve the stability. Thus, this work provides a strategy for developing efficient catalyst towards water splitting.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664129200001

Herein, we report the highly enhanced oxygen evolution and reduction reaction (OER/ORR) performance in Ce-doped LaCoO3 electrocatalysts: both theoretical and experimental results indicate that the promoted electrocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the spin state of the Co3+ transition from the low-spin state (LS) to the intermediate-spin state (IS) due to the Ce doping, which subsequently results in a synergistic effect between the enlarged Co 3d-O 2p covalency and improved electrical conductivity. As a result, 5.6 at. % Ce-doped LaCoO3 revealed the most outstanding bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalytic performance, with a low potential difference of approximately 0.96 V. Furthermore, the assembled rechargeable aqueous Zn-air battery (ZnAB) exhibited an ultrahigh energy density of 963 mA kg(-1) and excellent durability without significant decay after 160 h. The constructed all-solid-state ZnABs also revealed good discharge rate activity and a flexible nature. This finding provides a novel design strategy for perovskite oxides for a wide range of applications in high-efficiency rechargeable ZnABs.									50	2	0	0	4	0	51			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000546641600009

In this work, the bimetallic oxide composite consisting of CoV2O6 and V2O5 anchoring on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (CoV2O6 V2O5/NRGO-1) was synthesized directly by carbonization of the polyoxometalates, ethylenediamine, and graphene oxide precursors. CoV2O6-V2O5/NRGO-1 used as an electrocatalyst exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 239 mV vs RHE at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability in 1 M KOH. Surprisingly, it has high intrinsic activity with the turnover frequency of 1.80 s(-1) at the overpotential of 300 mV, which is the highest among the electrocatalysts reported to date. Theoretical calculation proves that the outstanding electrocatalytic performance is attributed to synergistic effects, in which CoV(2)o(6) acts as active sites while the hydrogen bond between V2O5 and intermediate HOO* of the OER greatly decreases the composite adsorption energy, thus reducing the overpotential. Most importantly, the results demonstrate for the first time that intermolecular hydrogen bonding plays a key role in improving electrocatalytic properties for the OER, which reveals a new method of designing novel OER electrocatalysts.									57	3	0	0	3	0	58			2380-8195			WOS:000403303500011

CO oxidation activity was found to vary strongly with deposited cluster size, with significant activity appearing at Au-3. Activity is not obviously correlated with affinity for CO, or with cluster morphology, but is strongly correlated with the clusters' ability to bind oxygen (during O-2 exposure) on top of the gold. The temporal dependence of CO2 evolution in reaction of O-2 pre-exposed samples with CO pulses shows an interesting cluster size dependence. For Au-5 and Au-6, the peak CO2 production is coincident with the peak CO flux, but for Au-3, Au-4, and Au-7, there are significant induction periods for CO2 evolution. In addition, it is observed that some of the most active cluster sizes have the slowest CO2 evolution rates. Several mechanistic scenarios capable of accounting for the observations are laid out.

The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), capable of producing high-purity hydrogen rapidly in electrocatalytic water splitting, has received much attention. Abundant research about HER has been done, focusing on advanced electrocatalyst design with high efficiency and robust stability. As potential HER catalysts, metal nanoclusters (MNCs) have been studied extensively. They are composed of several to a hundred metal atoms, with sizes being comparable to the Fermi wavelength of electrons, that is, < 2.0 nm. Different from metal atoms/nanoparticles, they exhibit unique catalytic properties due to their quantum size effect and low-coordination environment. In this review, the activity-enhancing approaches of MNCs applied in HER electrocatalysis are mainly summarized. Furthermore, recent progress in MNCs classified with different stabilization strategies, that is, the freestanding MNCs, MNCs with organic, metal and carbon supports, are introduced. Finally, the current challenges and deficiencies of these MNCs for HER are prospected.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000872152200001	36287086

Herein, we have developed an inexpensive route to synthesize a carbon-rich graphitic carbon nitride (C-rich g-C3N4) with both nitrogen vacancies and a porous structure, which, as a highly efficient photo-induced water splitting catalyst, can meet current demands. The effects of the porous structure, nitrogen vacancies and rich amount of carbon on the electronic band structure and charge transport of g-C3N4 are systematically elucidated. The C-rich g-C3N4 can not only effectively enhance the absorption of visible light, but can also improve the majority carrier mobility and promote photoelectron transport through the defect-induced mid-gap and multiple conductive carbon rings, thus synergistically elongating the diffusion length and lifetime of the photocarriers. Importantly, the metal-free C-rich g-C3N4 photocatalyst not only demonstrates a higher solar-driven hydrogen production performance, which is over 20.5 times that of pristine g-C3N4, but also exhibits an outstanding stability with minimal loss of catalytic activity.									79	3	0	0	5	0	80			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000443118300030

Owning to the prominent merits of strong synergistic relationships between Co and CoP nanoparticles, N-doped carbon configuration, and the interconnected three dimensional (3D) porous carbon network, the Co/CoP@NC nanofibers exhibit robust HER activity with affording an overpotential of 117 mV in acidic and 180 mV in alkaline media to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). As a practical application, when integrated the Co/CoP@NC/Ni foam cathode with the NiFe layered double hydroxides/Ni foam anode (NiFe-LDH/Ni foam), the electrolyzer can afford the cell voltage of 1.62 V to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), as well as ultralong lifetime of 60 h in alkaline medium, providing a viable alternative to the noble-metal electrocatalysts for water splitting.									118	13	0	0	8	0	120			2405-8297			WOS:000428083400007

In this work, we report a facile and general solvent-controlled precipitation method to prepare hybrids of graphene oxide (GO) supporting amorphous metal hydroxide [A-M(OH)(x)/GO, M = Cu, Co, and Mn], which provides us with tangible materials to study the structure-performance relationship of various amorphous oxides. The systematic investigation of A-Cu(OH)(2)/GO by coupling ex situ/in situ characteristic techniques with electrochemical studies reveals that electrocatalytic activity and selectivity toward a two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is highly dependent on the coordinated Cu catalytic sites and the disordered structure of A-Cu(OH)(2). In situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculation verify that the degree of OH* poisoning (Delta G0 (OH*)) tuned by three-OH-coordinated Cu sites in amorphous structures plays a crucial role in selective catalysis of ORR for H2O2 production. The optimized A-Cu(OH)(2)/GO shows superior activity and high selectivity (similar to 95%) toward H2O2, as demonstrated by a zinc-air battery capable of on-site H2O2 production with a rate as high as 3401.5 mmol h(-1) g(-1).[GRAPHICS].									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2096-5745		WOS:000794294900016

Among them, the electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen is the current research hotspot. In this paper, a simple synthesis method is used to prepare amorphous nano-scale monometallic Ni and bimetallic Ni, Fe boron phosphides, which are used as electrocatalysts to catalyze water splitting. We explored the best ratio of B to P in monometallic boron phosphides, and the optimal ratio of Ni and Fe in the bimetallic boron phosphide. It shows that when the ratio of B to P is 1 : 5 and the iron content is 0.2 in the Ni-Fe-BP, the catalytic performance of the material is optimal. It shows outstanding performance of 310 mV overpotential at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2), and its hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential is only 258 mV, which is better than noble metal materials. At the same time, it maintains excellent stability for 12 h at a constant potential. This work provides a better choice for subsequent research on non-precious metal catalyst materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2365-6549			WOS:000804083300001

We used the specialist caterpillar, Junonia coenia (Nymphalidae), which sequesters defensive compounds, iridoid glycosides, from its host plants to assess the effects of plant chemistry and sequestration on the larval immune response. A series of experiments using implanted glass beads to challenge immune function showed that larvae feeding on diets with high concentrations of iridoid glycosides are more likely to have their immune response compromised than those feeding on diets low in these compounds. These results indicate that larvae feeding on plants with high concentrations of toxins might be more poorly defended against parasitoids, while at the same time being better defended against predators, suggesting that predators and parasitoids can exert different selective pressures on the evolution of herbivore diet breadth.									124	2	0	0	118	0	125			1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000266699000005	19392713

The two most promising routes for its large-scale production in high purity are electrocatalytic water splitting and chemical release from hydrogen-storage materials. The rational design and synthesis of robust catalysts for hydrogen evolution are crucial stages in the development of hydrogen as an energy source. This work reports the production of a novel hydrogen evolution catalyst consisting of uniform hollow porous carbon spheres loaded with ruthenium nanoclusters via a simple hydrothermal process at low temperature. The catalyst not only exhibits extraordinary catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction, with extremely low overpotentials at all pH values, but also shows outstanding activity for hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB) with a high turnover frequency. Furthermore, the catalyst remains stable during both reactions, thus allowing one unified catalyst to facilitate hydrogen generation by two different methods for highly efficient and superstable hydrogen production. This work may provide a template method for rational design and fabrication of various metals/N-doped carbon catalysts that promote hydrogen production through both the electrolysis of water and the hydrolysis of AB, which will advance the development of hydrogen as an energy source.									36	5	0	0	2	0	37			2366-7486			WOS:000471815400005

In this study, we report a simple method to prepare a N, F co-doped mesoporous cobalt phosphate with rich-oxygen vacancies by in-situ pyrolysis of a Co-phosphate precursor with NH4+ cations and F- anions. Due to this heteroatom doping, it could achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at lower overpotential of 276 mV and smaller Tafel slope of 57.11 mV dec(-1) on glassy carbon. Moreover, it could keep 92 % of initial current density for 35 h, indicating it has an excellent stability and durability. Furthermore, the optimal material applied in supercapacitor displays specific capacitance of 206.3 F g(-1) at 1 A . g(-1) and maintains cycling stability with 80 % after 3000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical properties should be attributed to N, F co-doping into this Co-based phosphate, which effectively modulates its electronic structure. In addition, its amorphous structure provides more active sites; moreover, its mesoporous structure should be beneficial to mass transfer and electrolyte diffusion.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000649174100001	33792092

The three complexes are isostructural except for the different metal(II) ions in the structures. They all show a one-dimensional (1D) chain, in which the L ligand acts as a mu(2)-bridge linking two metal(II) centers. Different chains are connected by strong H bonds and p-p stacking interactions into a three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular architecture. Among the three complexes, the Ni complex 1 and the Co complex 2 can act as the electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from water, and the Co complex 2 shows better electrocatalytic activity. In the present work, the graphene cannot catalyze the HER; however, the complex 1/graphene composite shows similar electrocatalytic activity to complex 1. The three complexes show different UV-vis absorption values, photoluminescence properties and thermal stabilities.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			1466-8033			WOS:000344451800016

Both complexes have been characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, MS and UV-Vis spectral data. The voltammetric and in situ spectroelectrochemical studies reveal that both complexes exhibit an oxidation and three reduction processes having reversible, one-electron, and diffusion controlled mass transfer characteristics, which are assigned to Mn(III)Pc(2-)/Mn(IV)Pc(2-), Mn(III)Pc(2-)/Mn(II)Pc(2-), Mn(II)Pc(2-)/Mn(I)Pc(2-), and Mn(I)Pc(2-)/MnIPc(3-) couples respectively. The existence of oxygen in solution significantly affects the in situ spectroelectrochemical behavior of the complexes due to the formation of mu-oxo MnPc species. An in situ electrocolorimetric method has been applied to investigate the colors of the electro-generated anionic and cationic forms of the complexes for the first time in this study.

Seawater battery desalination with sodium-intercalation cathode for hypersaline water treatment								Desalination				531				115713	115713		10.1016/j.desal.2022.115713				2022	2022	The seawater battery desalination (SWB-D) system has a unique feature of storing energy while desalinating water. Contrary to other electrochemical processes, such as capacitive de-ionization or battery electrode deionization, SWB-D can be used to directly desalinate seawater owing to the high sodium uptake of the sodium metal composed anode. However, a relatively long time is required for desalination in this newly developed SWB-D because of the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction at the cathode, hindering the practical application of the SWB-D system for desalination. Hence, we propose using a sodium-intercalating cathode (nickel hexacyanoferrate; NiHCF) instead of a capacitive material (carbon felt) in the SWB-D system to overcome this limitation. The redox reaction of NiHCF doubled the applied current from 1 to 2 mA (from 6.5 to 13.0 A m-2) under an initial threshold voltage of 4.5 V, resulting in nearly twice the salt removal rate for the hypersaline water treatment (1.2 M NaCl). In addition, the energy efficiency of the system significantly increased from approximately 61% to 86%. Therefore, using an intercalation cathode in the SWB-D system can minimize the time required for hypersaline water treatment with a higher energy efficiency.

The modification electronic properties caused by unique interfacial interactions resulted in a significant increase in the number of electroactive sites and charge transfer ability, thereby accelerating kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline medium. The catalyst required overpotential of 248.2 and 310 mV at a current response of 50 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively, along with a remarkable stability. In addition, a two-electrode electrolyzer derived from the developed 2D CoS-Mo2TiC2 catalyst showed a cell voltage of 1.74 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and a good stability during 25 h continuous operation. The achieved results were associated to the formation of a unique interfacial heterostructure with the strong interaction between two material phases, which effectively modified electronic structure and surface chemistry, thereby leading to the enhancement of catalytic performance. The study offered a potential route to synthesize new catalyst for green hydrogen production via water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2631-6331		WOS:000728367400001

However, different protocols are typically used to produce Pt nanocrystals with distinctive shapes, making it difficult to directly compare their catalytic activities owing to the complication of surface contamination. Here we demonstrate that Pt nanocrystals with a variety of shapes, including those enclosed with low-or high-index facets, can be synthesized using the same protocol by simply adjusting the concentration of reducing agent and/or the reaction time. Specifically, when the reducing agent was used at a relatively low concentration, Pt truncated cubes, cuboctahedrons, truncated octahedrons, and octahedrons were produced sequentially upon the increase in reaction time. When 67% more reducing agent was used, Pt cubes and concave cubes were obtained consecutively as the reaction time was prolonged. Our quantitative analysis suggests that the diversity of shape and difference in size can be resulted from the difference in reduction kinetics. In evaluating their structure-activity relationship for oxygen reduction, it was established that the high-index facets on Pt concave cubes possessed a specific activity of 6.3 and 1.3 times greater than those of Pt cubes and octahedrons exposed by {1 0 0} and {1 1 1} facets, respectively. This work not only offers a general method for the synthesis of Pt nanocrystals having diverse shapes and thus different types of facets but also highlights the significance of reduction kinetics in controlling the structure evolution of other metal nanocrystals.									42	2	0	0	2	0	43			1369-7021	1873-4103		WOS:000447974200016

Herein, the porous and superhydrophilic nickel phosphide@ NiFe bimetal layered double hydroxides (NF-Ni2P@NiFe LDH) heterostructure in situ grown on nickel foam was successfully constructed. As a result, the unique of self-supported heterostructure and superhydrophilic surface facilitated electron and mass transfer. In addition, the porous structure promoted active site exposure and was in favor of bubble release. Benefiting from the aforementioned advantages, the NF-Ni2P@NiFe LDH performed a superior catalytic performance for water splitting, with a low overpotential of 105.4 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 203.5 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm-2, thus a battery voltage of just 1.53 V providing a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a two-electrode electrolytic cell. Furthermore, the NF-Ni2P@NiFe LDH showed a remarkable stability, which worked for over 60 h at 100 mA cm-2 without visible delay. The ex-situ Raman revealed that the NiOOH and FeOOH severed as active site for OER and HER, respectively.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000847974600001

The buildup of electrolyte ions onto the surface of monolayer MoS2 during the HER may also result in the formation of excitons and trions, similar to those observed in gate-controlled field-effect transistor devices. Using the distinct carrier relaxation dynamics of excitons and trions of monolayer MoS2 as sensitive descriptors, an in situ microcell-based scanning time-resolved liquid cell microscope is set up to simultaneously measure the bias-dependent exciton/trion dynamics and spatially map the catalytic activity of monolayer MoS2 during the HER. This operando probing technique used to monitor the interplay between exciton/trion dynamics and electrocatalytic activity for two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides provides an excellent platform to investigate the local carrier behaviors at the atomic layer/liquid electrolyte interfaces during electrocatalytic reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000780214300075	35254822

The surface of the Al-LTCA photocathode was modified first with CdS by a chemical bath treatment (CBT) and subsequently with TiO2 and Pt (to form Pt/TiO2/CBT-CdS/Al-LTCA). The modified photocathode Pt/TiO2/CBT-CdS/Al-LTCA showed a significantly enhanced photocurrent for the PEC hydrogen evolution reaction in strongly alkaline aqueous phosphate solutions. This enhancement was attributed to surface stabilization by TiO2 and to the enhanced charge separation caused by the formation of a p-n junction at the CBT-CdS/Al-LTCA interface. The BTON photoanode surface modified with Co and Ir species (Ir/Co/BTON) showed a lower onset potential than that of a Coloaded BTON photoanode for the PEC oxygen evolution reaction.

Herein, an efficient self-supported electrode was developed by in-situ growth of interlayer expanded lamellar cobalt diselenide (CoSe2) nanosheets (NS) on carbon paper (CP) substrate (CoSe2 NS@ CP). The analyses of TEM, SEM and XRD confirmed that the CP is homogeneously coated by few stacking layers of interlayer expanded lamellar structured CoSe2. This rationally designed nanostructure can provide more active sites for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The bifunctional electrode exhibits high electrocatalytic performance with -128 mV vs. RHE onset potential for the HER in 0.5 mol dm (3) H2SO4 and + 1521 mV vs. RHE for the OER in 1.0 mol dm (3) KOH. Besides, small electrolysis potentials of -201.1 mV vs. RHE and + 1636 mV vs. RHE are needed to drive the HER and OER at current density of 100 mA cm (2). Finally, a small overall cell voltage (ca. + 1.75 V) was used to drive the water splitting reaction in 1.0 mol dm (3) KOH. The CoSe2 NS@ CP electrode showed both excellent catalytic activity with overall current density of 100 mA cm (2) at 2.13 V and tremendous durability with negligible decrease in potential at a constant current of 20 mA cm (2) for more than 30 hours. Thus this rationally designed electrode material can be readily applied for large-scale water splitting process. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The thickness of the obtained nanosheets is about 2-2.5 nm, which is equivalent to 4-5 layers of BP atoms. And SA-BP-1 : 3 exhibits a best OER and HER performance in the group of SA-BP with different weight ratios, requiring an overpotential of 369.8 mV for OER and 235 mV for HER to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Meantime, L-AA-BP-1 : 1 presents a great OER and HER performance in the group of L-AA-BP with different weight ratios, requiring an overpotential of 459.5 mV for OER and 224 mV for HER to achieve the current density of 10 mAcm(-2), respectively. And two groups of the samples significantly enhance the OER and HER performance of few-layer BP nanosheets (550 mV and 431 mV). In addition, both the consecutive cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometric measurements reveal the outstanding electrocatalytic stability of the samples.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000586051200001

In this work, Co3O4 catalysts with various morphologies were controllably fabricated via hydrothermal method by controlling the pH in precursors solutions and the particular Co3O4 catalyst obtained in the low pH range with ultrathin-sheet-aggregated-sphere structure performed catalytic output for HER. Then the Co3O4 catalysts were triggered into a higher active state with the equipment of Ag substrate. The overpotential at the HER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was optimized into -0.296 V and this catalytic enhancement is attributed to the heterohybrid synergism of spillover effect as well as the enlarged electrochemical specific area. This study turns the HER-inert Co3O4 into active and further provides a practical strategy to equip the Ag substrate for further enhancement of hydrogen evolution. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The oxygen insertion was accompanied by partial oxidation of Cu+ lattice. For CuYO2.25, the chemical analyses as well as magnetic data reveal the presence of mixed valent states containing at least formally an equal number of Cu+ and Cu2+. In air, CuYO2+X are thermally stable up to 500 degrees Cabovc wich they undergo an irreversible conversion into CuY2O5. The oxides arc chemically stable in basic media and under illumination, they are stabilizsd by hole consumption reactions involving SO32- and S2- as holes scavengers. The flat band potentials lying between 0.17 and 0,17 eV, are located above the H2O/H-2 level, leading to a spontaneous H-2-evolution. The rate of H-2-formation is altered by the oxygen insertion and the best photoactivitv is obtained over CuYO2.(25) immersed at 0.025 M sulfide S2- solution. A photoelectrochemical study is reported for comparison with photoactivity results. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here, a new route for further improving Pt catalytic efficiency by cobalt (Co) and Pt dual-single-atoms on titanium dioxide (TiO2) surfaces, which contains a fraction of nonbonding oxygen-coordinated Co-O-Pt dimers, is reported. These Co-Pt dimer sites originate from loading high-density Pt single-atoms and Co single-atoms, with them anchoring randomly on the TiO2 substrate. This dual-single-atom catalyst yields 13.4% dimer sites and exhibits an ultrahigh and stable photocatalytic activity with a rate of 43.467 mmol g(-1) h(-1) and external quantum efficiency of approximate to 83.4% at 365 nm. This activity far exceeds those of equal amounts of Pt single-atom and typical Pt clustered catalysts by 1.92 and 1.64 times, respectively. The enhancement mechanism relies on the oxygen-coordinated Co-O-Pt dimer coupling, which can mutually optimize the electronic states of both Pt and Co sites to weaken H* binding. Namely, the "mute" Co single-atom is activated by Pt single-atom and the activity of the Pt atom is further enhanced through the dimer interaction. This strategy of nonbonding interactive dimer sites and the oxygen-mediated catalytic mechanisms provide emerging rich opportunities for greatly improving the catalytic efficiency and developing novel catalysts with creating new electronic states.									52	4	0	0	8	0	54			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000620217100001	33615589

Yet formation of such atmospheres depends on volatile exchange with the molten interior, governed by volatile solubilities and redox reactions. We determine the evolution of magma ocean-atmosphere systems for a range of oxygen fugacities, C/H ratios, and hydrogen budgets that include redox reactions for hydrogen (H2-H2O), carbon (CO-CO2), methane (CH4), and solubility laws for H2O and CO2. We find that small initial budgets of hydrogen, high C/H ratios, and oxidizing conditions suppress outgassing of hydrogen until the late stage of magma ocean crystallization. Hence, early atmospheres in equilibrium with magma oceans are dominantly carbon-rich, and specifically CO-rich except at the most oxidizing conditions. The high solubility of H2O limits its outgassing to melt fractions below ~30%, the fraction at which the mantle transitions from vigorous to sluggish convection with melt percolation. Sluggish melt percolation could enable a surface lid to form, trapping water in the interior and thereby maintaining a carbon-rich atmosphere (equilibrium crystallization). Alternatively, efficient crystal settling could maintain a molten surface, promoting a transition to a water-rich atmosphere (fractional crystallization). However, additional processes, including melt trapping and H dissolution in crystallizing minerals, further conspire to limit the extent of H outgassing, even for fractional crystallization. Hence, much of the water delivered to planets during their accretion can be safely harbored in their interiors during the magma ocean stage, particularly at oxidizing conditions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2632-3338			INSPEC:22131619

New approaches are required to drive input electricity toward the desired CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) rather than the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, we have used quantum mechanics to demonstrate that the space confinement formed in the gaps of adjacent gold or silver nanoparticles can be used to improve the Faradaic efficiency of CO2RR to CO. This behavior is due to the space confinement stabilizing *COOH, which is the key intermediate in the CO2RR. However, space confinement has almost no effect on *H, which is the key intermediate in the HER Possible experimental approaches for the preparation of this type of gold or silver electrocatalyst have been proposed.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			1948-7185			WOS:000518706000042	32069406

Herein, we show an interfacial engineering strategy to synthesize the NiCoP nanosheets/NiCoP nanocubes homojunction electrocatalyst supported on Ni foam (2D/3D-NiCoP/NF). The assynthesized 2D/3D-NiCoP/NF catalyst shows impressive HER activity, and a current density of 10 mA cm-2 can be achieved with only an overpotential of 37 mV in 1 M KOH solution. Such impressive HER performance of this 2D/3D-NiCoP/NF homojunction electrocatalyst is principally due to the exposure of abundance accessible active sites originated from the hierarchical structure of nanocubes on the nanosheets. Moreover, the intimate contact between 2D/3D-NiCoP and NF can simultaneously shorten the electron transport pathway and improve its stability. This novel 2D/3D-NiCoP/NF homojunction is expected to provide a powerful interface-engineering reference for the design and construction of high-efficiency synergistic HER electrocatalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000681177100004

Transition-metal compounds, due to their lower price and excellent performance, have become the research focus to replace noble metal catalysts in recent years. In this work, a new type of selenium-doped NiTe2 was successfully synthesized by the one-step hydrothermal method. Among them, Se-12%-NiTe2 had the best hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. In the 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, when the hydrogen evolution over potentials were 375 and 514 mV, the current densities of 10 and 200 mA cm(-2) could be provided, respectively. The Tafel slope was as low as 38 mV dec(-1). At the same time, it had good stability in an acidic solution. The density functional theory calculations showed that Se doping not only reduces the hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy of NiTe2 but also generated new Se active sites with higher catalytic performance. In addition, Se doping increased the electrochemical active surface area and reduced the charge transfer resistance. This work provides an idea for the synthesis of an HER electrocatalyst with high efficiency and good stability.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000599610500027

The combination of ultrathin and porous structure, especially with the assistance of vacancy, is expected to be beneficial for achievement of high mass activity, but the development of a facile, robust, and generalized strategy to engineer ultrathin, porous, and vacancy-rich structure into nonlayer structured transition metal-based electrocatalysts is highly challenging. Here, we propose a plasma-induced dry exfoliation method to prepare nonlayer structured Co3S4 ultrathin porous nanosheets with abundant sulfur vacancies (Co3S4 PNSvac), which show an onset overpotential of only 18 mV and an extremely large mass activity of 1056.6 A g(-1) at an overpotential of 200 mV. Experimental results and theoretical calculations confirm that the efficient alkaline HER performance could be attributed to the abundant active sites, good intrinsic activity, and accelerated electron/mass transfer. Additionally, the plasma-assisted conversion method can also be extended to fabricate CoSe2 and NiSe2 ultrathin porous nanosheets with selenium vacancies.									162	12	0	0	4	0	162			2155-5435			WOS:000444364800036

In this study, we report Ru, P dual-doped NiMoO4 multichannel nanorods in-situ grown on nickel foam (Ru/P-NiMoO4 @NF), which can achieve chlorine-free hydrogen production by coupling seawater splitting with thermodynamically favorable urea oxidation. The Ru/P-NiMoO4 @NF exhibits bifunctional activity with working potentials of 0.23 V to deliver 3000 mA cm-2 for HER and 1.46 V to deliver 1000 mA cm-2 for UOR. The overall urea splitting system in the two-electrode electrolyzer require low voltage of 1.73 V to drive 500 mA cm-2, and demonstrate remarkable durability to keep above 100 mA cm-2 for 145 h.

Herein, a facile tempted-defects assisted fractionation strategy is presented to synthesize N, S, and O tri-doped metal-free catalyst (DETDAP). Due to this effective tempted-defects and heteroatoms interlinking in DE-TDAP, it delivers the lowest overpotential toward both the OER (346 mV) and HER (154 mV) at 10 mA cm(2). Remarkably, the DE-TDAP-electrode carries only a cell voltage of 1.81 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting and longterm stability. Considerably, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation exposes that the tailored defects in tri-doped interlinking could enhance bifunctional catalytic performance devising from lower Gibbs free energy of OER/HER intermediates on active sites. This struggle henceforth provides a perceptive understanding of the synergetic principles of heteroatom-interlinking-tailoring nano structures in water splitting. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Ru-S-Sb bonds coupling with antimonene synergistically work to promote HER activity.

In this work, we used a simple way to decorate AuNPs onto the RGO surface by one pot in situ reduction both HAuCl4 and GO, for which the controlled average size of AuNPs (2.7, 11.5 and 45.7 nm) is adjusting with the mass ratio of HAuCl4 and GO. The obtained materials, AuNPs/RGO composites, show excellent electrocatalytic activity for the HER that critical dependence on the particle size of AuNPs.

Design-controlled Synthesis of IrO2 sub-monolayers on Au Nanodendrites: Marrying Plasmonic and Electrocatalytic Properties [arXiv]								arXiv								33 pp.	33 pp.						20 April 2020	2020	We develop herein plasmonic-catalytic Au-IrO2 nanostructures with a morphology optimized for efficient light harvesting and catalytic surface area; the nanoparticles have a dendritic morphology, with closely spaced Au branches all partially covered by an ultrathin (1 nm) IrO2 shell. This nanoparticle architecture optimizes optical features due to the interactions of closely spaced plasmonic branches forming electromagnetic hot spots, and the ultra-thin IrO2 layer maximizes efficient use of this expensive catalyst. This concept was evaluated towards the enhancement of the electrocatalytic performances towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as a model transformation. The OER can play a central role in meeting future energy demands but the performance of conventional electrocatalysts in this reaction is limited by the sluggish OER kinetics. We demonstrate an improvement of the OER performance for one of the most active OER catalysts, IrO2, by harvesting plasmonic effects from visible light illumination in multimetallic nanoparticles. We find that the OER activity for the Au-IrO2 nanodendrites can be improved under LSPR excitation, matching best properties reported in the literature. Our simulations and electrocatalytic data demonstrate that the enhancement in OER activities can be attributed to an electronic interaction between Au and IrO2 and to the activation of Ir-O bonds by LSPR excited hot holes, leading to a change in the reaction mechanism (rate-determinant step) under visible light illumination.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						INSPEC:19843772

Replacing the sluggish water oxidation reaction with thermodynamically more favorable pollutant electro-oxidation (degradation) is a very promising approach to combine energy-efficient hydrogen production and sewage treatment. Herein, a homologous asymmetrical two-electrode configuration, made up of self-assembly induced mosslike Fe2O3 and FeP on electro-oxidized carbon paper (ECP), was used to electrolyze the integrated hydrazine oxidation-hydrogen evolution system. The free-standing Fe2O3/ECP electrode was fabricated by pyrolyzing iron phthalocyanine/ECP self-assembly in air and serves as an anodic reaction catalyst. Subsequent phosphidation of the Fe2O3/ECP leads to the formation of the FeP/ECP catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction. The cross-linked mosslike Fe2O3 and FeP nanoparticles densely covered on the surface of ECP provide richly exposed catalytic sites and the well-distributed stacking holes among nanoparticles offer the expedited electrolyte/gas transmission path. Coupled with hydrazine oxidation, the Fe2O3/ECP parallel to FeP/ECP configuration presents a superior cell voltage of only 0.93 Vat 10 mA cm(-2) for synchronous hydrogen production, which is substantially lower than that of traditional overall water splitting system. Besides the low-voltage-driven energy efficiency, the catalyst electrodes also afford excellent run-to-run reproducibility and stability, as well as good batch-to-batch repeatability. Such a win-win coupling strategy offers the prospect of synchronously achieving energy-saving hydrogen production and the green conversion (or degradation) of hydrazine in wastewater.									17	1	0	0	2	0	16			2168-0485			WOS:000449577200231

CHEMCATCHEM				14	19					e202200611	10.1002/cctc.202200611		JUL 2022		OCT 10 2022	2022	Single atom catalysts (SACs) consist of isolated metal atoms stabilized on a solid support. The name suggests that the catalytic activity is due to the nature of the metal atom, but of course the interaction with the substrate plays a role as well. But what is more important? The metal atom or its surrounding? To answer this question, we have performed numerical experiments based on density functional theory (DFT). 24 transition metal atoms have been incorporated in Nitrogen-doped graphene, and the catalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been studied changing the metal and keeping the N-doped graphene matrix fixed. Then, one specific atom, Pt, has been embedded in the same matrix but the nitrogen neighbors of Pt have been systematically replaced by carbon or oxygen atoms generating more than 20 structures. The HER has thus been studied by keeping the metal center fixed but changing the surrounding. It turns out that the same great variability in chemical behavior can be achieved by changing the active site or the surrounding environment. This shows the importance of the local coordination in determining the catalytic activity. The consequences of this conclusion for modeling studies of SACs are discussed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000854004700001

ACS omega				7	37			33156	33166		10.1021/acsomega.2c03388				2022-Sep-20	2022	Since nonmetal (NM)-doped two-dimensional (2D) materials can effectively modulate their physical properties and chemical activities, they have received a lot of attention from researchers. Therefore, the stability, electronic properties, and electrocatalytic water splitting activity of precious-metal (PM)-adsorbed silicene doped with two NM atoms are investigated based on density functional theory (DFT) in this paper. The results show that NM doping can effectively improve the stability of PM-adsorbed silicene and exhibit rich electronic properties. Meanwhile, by comparing the free energies of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates of 15 more stable NM-doped systems, it can be concluded that the electrocatalytic water splitting activity of the NM-doped systems is more influenced by the temperature. Moreover, the Si-S2-Ir-doped system exhibits good HER performance when the temperature is 300 K, while the Si-N2-Pt-doped system shows excellent OER activity. Our theoretical study shows that NM doping can effectively promote the stability and electrocatalytic water splitting of PM-adsorbed silicene, which can help in the application of silicene in electrocatalytic water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2470-1343		MEDLINE:36157726	36157726

Thin iron films covered with monolayer graphene exhibit outstanding catalytic activity, surpassing even that of platinum, as demonstrated by a method based on evaluating the noise in the tunnelling current of electrochemical scanning tunnelling microscopy. Using this approach, we mapped with atomic-scale precision the electrochemical activity of the graphene-iron interface, and determined that single iron atoms trapped within carbon vacancies and curved graphene areas on step edges are exceptionally active. Density functional theory calculations confirmed the sequence of activity obtained experimentally. This work exemplifies the potential of electrochemical scanning tunnelling microscopy as the only technique able to determine both the atomic structure and relative catalytic performance of atomically well-defined sites in electrochemical operando conditions and provides a detailed rationale for the design of novel catalysts based on cheap and abundant metals such as iron.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			2520-1158			WOS:000707300800001

These powders have been reproduced in the film forms on pretreated Ni-supports by an oxide-slurry painting technique. The study has indicated that Sr-substitution increased both the apparent as well as the true catalytic activity of the oxide and that it has no regular effect on the oxide roughness. The Tafel slope and the reaction order with respect to OH- concentrations at low overpotential have been observed to be approximately 2.3 x 2RT/F and unity, respectively. Sr-substitution seems to slightly decrease the apparent electrochemical activation energy (DeltaH(el)(#0)), while it has no effect on the true electrochemical activation energy (DeltaH(c)(#0)) and on the entropy of activation (DeltaS(#0)) of the reaction.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0376-4710	0975-0975		WOS:000172928600004

This results in high production of CO2 which is the main reason for global warming and harmful for the environment. These issues have driven the scientists to develop environment friendly alternative energies to replace these harmful fuels. Hydrogen has become one of the most promising fuels which are environment friendly and sustainable. To produce this green and clean source of energy, electrochemical water splitting has become one of the most suitable routes. For the efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) an active catalyst is required to achieve high conversion efficiency. Many catalysts have been reported in the literature for hydrogen production through different methods. But Molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) has attracted a lot of attention and attraction to produce hydrogen through HER due to its high surface activity and electrochemical properties. In this review, the recent research progress has been reported on the Mo2C for HER mechanism. Different methods for the synthesis of Mo2C and its hybrid has been discussed extensively, along with different strategies to modify the physicochemical properties of Mo2C and its hybrid. Furthermore, the application of Mo2C related to its activity, durability, activation, and deactivation mechanism of the catalyst are critically reviewed. It is concluded that by the addition of another component in Mo2C can enhance the activity of the catalyst and gives more conversion rate. Hence, it realizes that Mo2C certainly can be used as an alternative catalyst for hydrogen production via water splitting.									20	1	0	0	2	0	20			2468-8231			WOS:000566543400014

Pt-TaOx/Ti electrode was prepared by thermal decomposition procedure. O-3 has been electrogenerated galvanostatically (100 mA cm(-2)) at room temperature in the presence of neutral supporting electrolyte using a Nafion membrane cell. A superior catalytic activity of the Pt-TaOx/Ti electrode towards O-3 evolution was observed. The current efficiency (ca. 11.7%) for O-3 generation at the Pt-TaOx/Ti electrode was found to be much higher than that (0.7%) obtained at smooth Pt electrode of the same geometrical area. The oxygen evolution overvoltage was found to be the controlling factor in O-3 electrogeneration. The stability of the composite electrode was examined by applying a constant current (50 mA cm(-2)) and then following the change in the electrode potential and current efficiency with time. SEM images proved the cracked-structure in the Pt-TaOx/Ti electrode and no apparent significant change in the morphology upon electrolysis. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Here, a three-dimensional cubic electrocatalyst of nickel-iron complex oxides grown on the rich-nitrogen-doped reducedgraphene oxide (NiFe2O4@N-rGO-CC) was synthesized throughthe two-step hydrothermal reaction. The experimental integrity testrevealed that NiFe2O4@N-rGO-CC exhibited excellent electro-catalytic performance and long-term stability in both alkaline andacid electrolytes. In a 1.0 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution,lower overpotentials of 479 and 156 mV were acquired to deliverthe current density of 10 mAmiddotcm-2for both OER and HER,respectively. Besides, NiFe2O4@N-rGO-CC also exhibited excellent HER performance in 0.5 M H2SO4solution, which provided alower overpotential of 188 mV with a current density of 10 mAmiddotcm-2. NiFe2O4@N-rGO-CC showed extremely stable durability overa long time period of 30 h for OER and 50 h for HER in alkaline medium, and 40 h for HER in acid medium. Furthermore,NiFe2O4@N-rGO-CC required only 1.67 V to deliver the current density of 10 mAmiddotcm-2for alkaline water splitting, and it could bemaintained for up to 70 h without any significant potential reduction. As evidenced, rich N-doped rGO modified the carbon cloth,which could significantly increase the electrocatalytic active sites for OER and HER. This work provided a novel approach forsynthesizing transition bimetallic oxides grown on rich N-doped rGO-CC electrocatalysts as an innovative application of the low-cost substitution of precious metal electrocatalysts with highly efficient overall water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000799358500024

With the nitrogen moieties being progressively removed, the NRMC catalysts exhibited enhanced CO generation from CO2RR, whereas the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been suppressed. Through suitable annealing treatment, the defect-rich NRMC catalyst is able to convert CO2 to CO with a Faradaic efficiency (FE co ) of similar to 80% and a partial current density for CO (j(CO)) of -2.9 mA cm(-2) at an applied overpotential of 490 mV. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further revealed the active sites within NRMC catalysts were the defects generated by N removal, which lowered the energy barriers for CO2RR and will not be passivated by hydrogen. These findings provide design guidelines to develop efficient carbon-based catalysts that can display metal-like, and even better, performances for potential scalable CO2RR to fuels and chemicals.									81	5	0	0	2	0	82			2380-8195			WOS:000445052900038

Moreover, we present new processing conditions that successfully reduced and even eliminated the undesirable porosity of the pyrolyzed films Focused-ion-beam (FIB) studies demonstrated that the formation of pores was related to a fast escape of the released gas during precursor decomposition The oxygen partial pressure was determined to be a key parameter to control both the kinetics and thermodynamics of the decomposition reaction and, hence, the porosity This is of great importance because dense films are required to achieve high critical current densities in YBa2Cu3O7 superconducting films									71	4	0	0	2	0	73			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000274929000013		
J	Ma, Chengbo; Zhang, Yuqing								Spinel CuxCo1-xMn2O4 electrode for effectively cleaning organic wastewater via electrocatalytic oxidation								SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY				258						118024	10.1016/j.seppur.2020.118024				MAR 1 2021	2021	Development of anodes with high electrocatalytic activity, electrochemical stability and low cost is a key to clean organic wastewater via electrocatalytic oxidation. Here, spinel CuxCo1-xMn2O4 (CCM-X) was prepared by introducing copper with high catalytic activity into the structurally stable spinel CoMn2O4. The CCM-X were coated on the surface of titanium plate and used as anodes to study their electrocatalytic oxidation performance for cleaning simulated organic wastewater (tetracycline hydrochloride aqueous solution). The maximum removal ratio of 20 mg L-1 tetracycline hydrochloride was 91.3% in 120 min and still reached 84.9% after 5-times' reusing of the anode, which was attributed to the high electrocatalytic activity, oxygen evolution potential (1.70 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and stable structure of multi-metal oxide CCM-X anode. In addition, free radical trapping experiments showed that hydroxyl radicals played a major role in electrocatalytic oxidation process. Electrochemical tests showed that redox of Co(III)/Co(IV) and Mn(III)/Mn(IV) participated in the electrocatalytic oxidation reaction, and doping Cu can effectively improve the electron transfer ability and electrocatalytic activity of CCM-X. Therefore, CCM-X/Ti electrodes perform attractive application prospects in cleaning organic wastewater via electrocatalytic oxidation.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000598715700004

We use the relations to build the largest volcano plot for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). We found that (1) Mn, Ga, and In are overlooked catalysts and (2) there are unidentified materials on the top of the volcano. Using experimental exchange current densities of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and Pourbaix diagrams we have identified conditions at which Mn, Ga, and In remain stable in water and selectively catalyze NRR over HER. We found that Fe, Au, Cu, Bi, and Pd, on contrary to what was reported earlier, need smaller applied potentials to start the onset of HER than NRR in water. We make a critical discussion about them and other candidates and we believe our results can be used to identify false positive measurements in the research field.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11				2589-0042		WOS:000600670000049	34095781	
J	Azzerri, N.; Baudo, G.								Comparative corrosion resistance of tin free steels chromium-type to synthetic and natural food media								British Corrosion Journal				10	1			28	32						1975	1975	The corrosion kinetics of five commercial TFS-CT plates in a number of inorganic and organic solutions of various pH values, and in some typical acidic food products, were evaluated electrochemically by means of potentiodynamic polarisation measurements. In both laboratory media and food products the corrosion process of TFS-CT plates in the absence of oxygen is definitely under cathodic control, owing to the presence of chromium oxide in the coating which depresses corrosion rates and exchange current densities for the hydrogen evolution reaction. From the anodic branches of the experimental polarization curves, dynamic stability diagrams of TFS-CT plates have been derived, indicating for various environmental conditions the potential ranges of practical immunity, negligible corrosion (material `resistant'), and unacceptable corrosion (material `unsuitable'), respectively.									4	0	0		1	0	4			0007-0599			INSPEC:815124

Herein, we developed a novel 3D ternary hybrid electrocatalyst consisting of Fe2O3 strongly coupled with Ni2P/Ni(PO3)(2) grown on commercial Ni foam (denoted as Fe2O3@Ni2P/Ni(PO3)(2)/NF) through a thermal phosphorization reaction. In this 3D hybrid structure, the Fe2O3@Ni2P/Ni(PO3)(2) nanoparticles with a length of similar to 300 nm and width of similar to 200 nm are homogeneously grown on the surface of 3D Ni foam. Owing to the synergistic effect between Fe2O3@Ni2P/Ni(PO3)(2)/NF and their strong coupling effect, the 3D Fe2O3@Ni2P/Ni(PO3)(2)/NF hybrid achieves a superior electrocatalytic OER performance at ultra-high current densities in alkaline electrolyte. High catalytic current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2) are reached by applying only potentials of 1.57 and 1.60 V, respectively, which are almost the lowest potentials among all previously reported transition metal (Ni and Fe) based phosphide and phosphate electrocatalysts, and even better than that of the benchmark Ir/C catalyst (1.64 and > 1.8 V at 100 and 500 mA cm(-2)). In situ Raman spectroscopy revealed that the NiOOH and FeOOH species were the real active phases in Fe2O3@Ni2P/Ni(PO3)(2)/NF during the OER process. A two-electrode electrolyzer with Fe2O3@Ni2P/Ni(PO3)(2)/NF delivers a cell voltage of 1.93, 2.48, and 3.02 V at 100, 500, and 1000 mA cm(-2) for overall-water-splitting.									127	12	0	0	4	0	127			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000457268300009

Herein, a three-dimensional and in situ-activated electrocatalyst derived from stainless steel is successfully fabricated via a two-step laser direct writing strategy. The electrocatalyst appears in the form of nanoparticle-stacked porous clusters on the multiscale stainless steel with irregular microcone arrays and microspheres, which exposes more active sites and facilitates the mass transport. Especially, the clusters undergoe a self-optimizing morphological and compositional reconfiguration induced by the leaching of Cr species under OER conditions for favorable charge transfer and enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity. As a result, the in situ-activated, Ni/Cr-doped Fe3O4 electrocatalyst exhibits an outstanding OER performance with a small overpotential of 262 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 35.0 mV dec(-1), and excellent long-term stability of 120 h, among the best spinel Fe-rich OER electrocatalysts. Finally, we also verify the feasibility of the affordable and efficient electrocatalyst coupled with the commercial Ni cathode in the practical water electrolysis. This work may open up a new avenue to design nanostructured metal oxides for various energy applications and beyond.									14	4	0	0	0	0	15			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526552100039	32115941

Structural and morphological evolution of the GBCO/PVP fibers under calcinations at various temperatures was studied. Using 600 degrees C pre-calcined GBCO/PVP composite nanofibers, pure phase GBCO cathode with homogeneous network structure was easily fabricated on Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC) electrolyte. The as-prepared GBCO cathode was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements based on a GBCO/GDC/GBCO symmetric cell. Its electrochemical performance was compared with the cathode prepared with the GBCO powders synthesized with sol-gel method. The GBCO cathode fabricated using GBCO/PVP composite fibers had area specific resistances (ASRs) of 0.53 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C, 0.22 Omega cm(2) at 650 degrees C, 0.10 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C and 0.043 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C respectively, which are lower than ASR results of the GBCO cathode prepared with powders. The results have demonstrated that the GBCO cathode fabricated using electrospun composite nanofibers has significantly enhanced electrochemical activities for oxygen reduction reaction, and it can serve as a promising cathode material for intermediate- temperature solid oxide fuel cell.

This study presents the synthesis of PtCu tripod nanocrystals with branching structures and high purity prepared using a simple hydrothermal method. The dendritic PtCu triangular nanocrystals were successfully synthesized by regulating the amount of I- ions to achieve different degrees of branching on PtCu nanocrystals, and the process was systematically studied and analyzed. Meanwhile, dumbbell nanocrystals of PtCu were successfully synthesized through slight adjustments to synthesis conditions. In electrochemical tests, the obtained dendritic PtCu triangular nanocrystals exhibited prominent electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability for ethylene glycol, methanol, and ethanol oxidation reactions due to the unique nanostructures as well as alloyed virtue, and were much better than commercial Pt/C. In addition, this study provides a general strategy for designing novel branched Pt-based nanomaterials with high electrocatalytic performance.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000727441800001	34874030

They thus developed a strategy for defence composed of avoidance reactions combined with a set of defence-chemicals. Co-evolution of animals took advantage of this enormous synthesizing capacity of plants. The knowledge about these interrelationships between plants and animals in terms of coping with "oxidative stress" is exponentially increasing and has led to novel insights, especially as far as medical, pharmacological and nutritive aspects are concerned. The biochemistry of oxygen-activation and -detoxification analysed in the past and the identification of similarities between plants and animals opened a new field of research. Biochemical model reactions simulating these common situations allow to predict possible functions of certain chemicals in plants' defence as well to find new fields of application in human health and to exploit up to date unknown resources. In this report we will specially deal with an underestimated and widely ignored group of chemicals: the terpenoids. We could prove that these substances are effective antioxidants in lipid peroxidation processes. They furthermore are able to prevent carotenoids, another class of secondary plant metabolites, from oxidation. (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

The obtained Ru/C nanocomposites exhibit an exciting electrochemical catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the oxygen-free 0.5 M H2SO4 medium. The optical one (Ru/C-2) with a low Ru amount of 2.34% shows higher activity than previously reported Ru-based catalysts. The overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) is 114 mV and the Tafel slope is 67 mV.dec(-1). Ru/C-2 catalyst also has good stability. The overpotential that afford the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) of 20 wt% Pt/C increased 92 mV while that of Ru/C-2 only increased 50 mV after a 30,000 s chronopotentiometry test. Furthermore, the mass activity of Ru/C-2 catalyst is even better than that of the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C when the overpotential is larger than 0.18 V.

This remarkable HER performance mainly arises from the synergic effect between CoP and P, N co-doped C, high density of active sites and large surface area due to the multiple pore structures.

Unexpectedly, the Ni2P@GC exhibited superior HER performance with the onset potential started at -93 mV and good durability due to the synergistic interaction of active Ni2P nanoparticles and graphitic carbon support.

The reaction is essentially under kinetic control at temperatures between 25 and 60 degreesC. It has a pronounced structural sensitivity, having higher rates on a Ru(10 - 10) than on a Ru(0001) surface. The reaction is strongly inhibited by Ru oxide formation at low overpotentials for hydrogen oxidation, which causes a current peak in the polarization curve and a negligible oxidation current at large overpotentials. The structural dependence appears to be predominantly determined by the properties of the oxidized surfaces of Ru(0001) and Ru(10 - 10). The kinetics are faster in H2SO4 than in HClO4 solution due to a slower surface oxidation in the former acid. The apparent electrochemical activation energy for the Ru(0001) surface is about 120 U mol(-1), while 80 U mol(-1) is observed for the Ru(10 - 10) surface. The exchange current densities of 0.13 and 0.16 mA cm(-2) at 40 degreesC for Ru(0001) and Ru(10 - 10), respectively have been determined from the linear part of the polarization curves. The origin of the structural effects on the hydrogen oxidation kinetics on Ru surfaces has been discussed. In sharp contrast to hydrogen oxidation, the hydrogen evolution kinetics shows a very small structural dependence.

Four typical forms of electrochemistry impedance spectra involved in the reconstruction process revealed three dominating forms of reconstructed pyrochlore in the OER stage, including the inner intact pyrochlore, mid metastable [IrO6]-[IrO6] framework, and the outer collapse amorphous layer. The enhancing electron transport efficiency of the corner-shared [IrO6]-[IrO6] framework was revealed as a critical role in acidic systems. The density of state (DOS) for the constructed [IrO6]-[IrO6] framework corroborated the enhancement of Ir-O hybridization and the downshift of the d-band center. Additionally, we contrast the pristine and reconstruction properties of the Pr2Ir2O7, Eu2Ir2O7, and Lu2Ir2O7 in alkaline and acidic media. The DOS and the XANES results reveal the scale relationship between the O 2p band center and the intrinsic activity for bulk pyrochlore in alkaline media. The highest O 2p center and the highest Ir-O hybridization of Lu2Ir2O7 exhibited the best OER performance among the Ir-based pyrochlore, up to a ninefold improvement in Ir-mass activity compared to IrO2. Our findings emphasize the electrochemical behavior of the reconstruction process for activated water-splitting performance.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000670430100039	34148341

Highly dispersed Fe7Ni3 alloy, Ni and Fe metal nanoparticles and 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs) decorated metal-nitrogen species (Me-Nx) anchored carbon-based catalysts (Ni NP|Ni-NDC, Fe NP|Fe-NDC, Fe7Ni3|Ni/Fe-NDC) are prepared by a facile in-situ chemical synthesis. As-prepared three nanohybrid catalysts exhibit exceptional catalytic ability and stability for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and triiodide reduction reaction (IRR). The power conversion efficiency of the dye-sensitized solar cell with the Fe7Ni3|Ni/Fe-NDC counter electrode catalyst reaches 8.58%. The overpotential and corresponding Tafel slope of electrocatalytic water splitting with Fe7Ni3|Ni/Fe-NDC catalyst exhibit 129 mV and 68 mV dec(-1) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution, respectively. The enhanced catalytic performance of the as designed hybrid catalysts can be attributed to the synergistic coupling effect of various components (the dispersed Fe7Ni3 alloy, Ni and Fe metal nanoparticles, Ni/Fe-Nx active sites and 1D CNTs) of the hybrid catalyst.

Recently, both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental studies have demonstrated that earth-abundant MoS2 is a promising HER electrocatalyst in acidic solution. However, the HER kinetics of MoS2 in alkaline solution still suffer from a high overpotential (90-220 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)). Herein, we report a combined experimental and first-principle approach toward achieving an economical and ultraefficient MoS2-based electrocatalyst for the HER by fine-tuning the electronic structure of MoS2 nanorods with N and Mn dopants. The developed N,Mn codoped MoS2 catalyst exhibits an outstanding HER performance with 5, overpotentials of 66 and 70 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline and phosphate-buffered saline media, respectively, and corresponding Tafel slopes of 50 and 65 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the catalyst also exhibits long-term stability in HER tests. DFT calculations suggest that (1) the electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to the enhanced conductivity and optimized electronic structures for facilitating H* adsorption and desorption after N and Mn codoping and (2) N and Mn dopants can greatly activate the catalytic HER activity of the S-edge for MoS2. The discovery of a simple approach toward the synthesis of highly active and low-cost MoS2-based electrocatalysts in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes allows the premise of scalable production of hydrogen fuels.									119	10	0	0	5	0	120			2155-5435			WOS:000441112400080

Herein, we report for the first time the application of two-dimensional (2D) layered transition metal carbides, MXenes, as electrocatalysts for the HER. Our computational screening study of 2D layered M2XTx (M = metal; X = (C, N); and T-x = surface functional groups) predicts Mo2CTx to be an active catalyst candidate for the HER. We synthesized both Mo2CTx and Ti2CTx MXenes, and in agreement with our theoretical predictions, Mo2CTx was found to exhibit far higher HER activity than Ti2CTx. Theory suggests that the basal planes of Mo2CTx are catalytically active toward the HER, unlike in the case of widely studied MoS2, in which only the edge sites of the 2H phase are active. This work paves the way for the development of novel 2D layered materials that can be applied in a multitude sustainable energy future. of other clean energy reactions for a sustainable energy future.									772	58	0	0	36	0	782			2380-8195			WOS:000389617900017

Adsorption of BH4- over Au(1 1 1) and Pt(1 1 1) is examined. Adsorption over Pt(1 1 1) is dissociative and extremely exothermic at potentials of interest, leading to a high surface coverage of H-center dot for which gaseous hydrogen evolution is competitive with oxidation. Elementary surface reactions oxidizing B-containing intermediates are favorable over Pt(1 1 1) at -0.85 V (SHE), consistent with experimental voltammetry results in the literature. The energetics of the initial adsorption step dictate the activity limitation of gold anodes and the selectivity limitation of platinum electrodes. This adsorption energy can be rapidly calculated with DFT methods, enabling screening of pure metals, alloys, poisons, and promoters to optimize borohydride oxidation catalyst design.

Here, a simple one-step chloride ion etching method to in situ synthesis of platinum (Pt) clusters anchored on amorphous nickel molybdenum hydroxide/nickel foam nanosheets (Pt-NiMo-OH/NF) at room temperature is used. Pt-NiMo-OH/NF has better catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution (OER) than Pt/C/NF and RuO2/NF. The overall water splitting required only 1.83 V versus RHE to reach 1000 mA cm(-2), and showed good stability and catalytic activity in 160 h. The excellent catalytic performance and stability of Pt-MiMo-OH/NF may be due to the collaborative electron transfer between Pt and amorphous NiMo-OH leads to an increase in the electron density of Pt clusters, which optimizes the binding energy of Pt and H. At the same time, it induces the formation of high-valence Ni and Mo, thereby promoting the dissociation of water and the production of OER active substances. This work provides a novel strategy for the synthesis of water splitting catalysts at high current density.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-7350			WOS:000751758000001

In this study, a facile one-step hydrothermal process was developed for the fabrication of cubic-like NiS2@MoS2 nanostructures. A few layers of MoS2 hybrids with uniform cubic NiS2 nanocrystals possess rich electrochemical active sites and improved electronic conductivity. This strategy was extended to CoS2@MoS2 and FeS2@MoS2 nanocrystals. The as-synthesized optimal NiS2@MoS2 nanocomposites exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is attributed to the formation of intrinsic synergy in the NiS2@ MoS2 nanocrystals.

J	Exner, Kai S.								Beyond the Traditional Volcano Concept: Overpotential-Dependent Volcano Plots Exemplified by the Chlorine Evolution Reaction over Transition-Metal Oxides								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				123	27			16921	16928		10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b05364				JUL 11 2019	2019	The chlorine evolution reaction (CER) over a single-crystalline RuO2(110) model electrode is one of the best understood model systems in the field of electrocatalysis, which is taken here as a benchmark system to advance the concept of activity-based Volcano plots. Volcano curves can be derived from linear scaling relationships, in which thermodynamic considerations based on Sabatier's principle and the Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi relation at zero overpotential are assumed to describe activity trends of electrocatalysts within a homologous series of materials. However, the underlying approach does not capture the influence of the applied overpotential on the activity, which is given by the Tafel slope. This may explain, why in certain cases the traditional Volcano analysis at zero overpotential does not reproduce activity trends of highly active catalytic materials with an overpotential-dependent Tafel slope correctly. Herein, a novel approach of overpotential-dependent Volcano plots is presented, which connects thermodynamics with kinetics at the respective target overpotential and includes the experimental Tafel slope into the analysis to describe the activity. This methodology is applied to the CER over transition-metal oxide electrodes, such as RuO2(110) and IrO2(110): while the traditional Volcano analysis at zero overpotential ascertains IrO2(110) to be more active in the CER, the overpotential-dependent Volcano plot reproduces the experimentally observed higher CER activity of RuO2(110) compared to IrO2(110) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. This result puts additional emphasis on the fact that the applied overpotential needs to be accounted for in material screening trend studies.									33	0	0	0	0	0	33			1932-7447			WOS:000475537500046

Later, a.c. impedance measurements were carried out in alkaline aqueous solutions to characterize the hydrogenevolution reaction and the data were analysed using the constant-phase element model for etching times of up to 1 h. They showed that the surface roughness factor increases almost linearly with the etching time.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0254-0584			WOS:A1995TF28000005

However, metal cluster with high surface free energy remains a challenge for the synthesis of stable and highly active catalysts. Herein, a highly dispersed platinum cluster anchored on the Mn vacancy of MnO2 nanosheets (PtAC-MnO2) via in situ electrochemical methods is reported. The strongly binding energy between Pt clusters and supports can effectively suppress the migration of active Pt atoms and optimize their electronic structure for excellent electrocatalytic properties. Impressively, the PtAC-MnO2 demonstrates a considerably low overpotential (eta 100) of 47 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and can be catalyzed continuously at 10 mA cm(-2) for 80 h, showing better catalytic stability than the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalysts.

Electrocatalyst candidates are subjected to screening in a N-2-purged bipolar electrochemical cell where a pair of driving electrodes produce an electric field in the electrolyte solution. The HER occurring at the BPE cathodes is electrically coupled to the electrodissolution of an array of Cr microbands present at the BPE anodes. The readout of this device is simple, where the species that dissolve the most Cr microbands are identified as the most promising electrocatalyst candidates for further evaluation. We demonstrate the utility of this technique by comparing several bi- and trimetallic systems involving Co, Fe, Ni, Mo, and W, which are compared directly with pure Pt. Of all the compositions tested, Ni-8-Mo-2 is demonstrated to be the most active for the HER in a neutral electrolyte solution.									70	1	0	0	8	0	71			2155-5435			WOS:000335491200012

The Navier-Stokes equations for chemically reacting flow are solved in a fully coupled manner, using an implicit, time-accurate algorithm. The solution procedure is based on a spatially second order, total variation diminishing scheme and a temporally second order, variable-step, backward differentiation formula method. The hydrogen-oxygen-argon chemistry is modeled with a nine-species, 19-step reaction mechanism. Results of the numerical simulations are presented for two representative cases. We study the temporal developments of shock-induced combustion and thrust farce. Positive thrust occurs in both ram accelerator configurations presented; however, combustion in the boundary layer enhances its separation, ultimately resulting in unstart.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0748-4658			WOS:000071487700002

Various molecular catalysts have been reported that efficiently catalyze reactions involved in artificial photosynthesis, however, these catalysts have been rarely considered in view of practical applications. With this review, firstly we demonstrate in the introduction that molecular catalysts can bring new opportunities to proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. In the following parts, we provide an overview of molecular catalyst modified carbon materials developed for electrochemical water oxidation, proton reduction, and CO2 reduction reactions. These materials and the involved immobilization strategies as well as characterization techniques may be directly employed in the investigations of application of molecular catalysts in PEM electrolyzers. The future scientific perspectives and challenges to advance this promising, yet underdeveloped technology for solar fuel production, integrating PEM electrolyzer with molecular-level catalysis, are discussed in the conclusions.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2542-4351			WOS:000551427400012

We elucidate, via first-principles-based thermodynamics, the operation H* distribution and cyclic voltammetry (CV) during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) across the electrochemical potential, including the underpotential region (U <= 0) that is difficult to assess in experiment. We consider multiple adsorption sites on a 1 nm Pt NP model and show that the characteristic CV peaks from different H* species correspond well to experiment. We next quantify the activity contribution from each H* species to explain the adverse effect of size. From the resolved CV peaks at the standard hydrogen electrode potential (U = 0), we first deduce that the active species for the HER are the partially covered (100)-facet bridge sites and the (111)-facet hollow sites. Upon evaluation of the reaction barriers at operation H* distribution and microkinetic modeling of the exchange current, we find that the nearest-neighbor (100)-facet bridge site pairs have the lowest activation energy and contribute to similar to 75% of the NP activity. Edge bridge sites (fully covered by H*) per se are not active; however, they react with neighboring (100)-facet H* to account for similar to 18% of the activity, whereas (111)-facet hollow sites contribute little. Extrapolating the relative contributions to larger NPs in which the ratio of facet-to-edge sites increases, we show that the adverse size effect of Pt NP HER activity kicks in for sizes below 2 nm.									83	1	0	0	4	1	84			2155-5435			WOS:000352464400041

In this work, we have systematically investigated a two-dimensional (2D) material, namely, B4N monolayer as efficient HER electrocatalysts based on first-principles computations. When the material is metal-free, the calculated Gibbs free energy (delta G(H)*) corresponding to hydrogen coverages of 2/4 reaches to 0.005 eV, which is better than that of the Pt catalyst. Moreover, we also find that the HER activity of the B4N monolayer is sensitive to the strains-driven. The single metal atom supported on B4N can still make the value of delta G(H)* close to 0 eV for Cr/B4N and V/B4N. These results reveal that the B4N monolayer is a promising candidate for HER applications.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The development of superior electrocatalysts, based on hybrid materials, plays a critical role in the future. In this work, TNT/LaFeO3 composite is designed as an electrocatalyst for the hydrogen production in an aqueous acidic solution. The morphology and structure of the individual TNT and LaFeO3 catalysts are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The electrocatalytic activities of TNT, LaFeO3 and TNT/LaFeO3 composite for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.1 mol.L-1 H2SO4 solution are studied by potentiodynamic polarization. TNT/LaFeO3 composite shows a superior electrocatalytic activity as compared to those of individual components. Two aspects can contribute to this performance, first, the nano porous structure of TNT and LaFeO3; and the second is the pn-junction developed at TNT-LaFeO3 interface, which is responsible for the enhanced reducing performance of the composite catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000718145000003

Particle pyrolysis and combustion behavior combined with time scale analysis are used to discuss the flame inerting mechanism. The results showed that the inerting process makes the flame front fuzzy, discrete and irregular. The thickness of flame reaction zone increases as O-2 concentration decreases, while the preheat zone decreases accordingly. The pyrolysis rate always controls the flame propagation process under inerting conditions. With the decrease of O-2 concentration, the control effect of pyrolysis rate is gradually weakened, and the effect of combustion reaction rate on flame propagation appears. A physical model of starch dust flame propagation under partial inerting is established, and the inerting process of dust pyrolysis and combustion on the flame structure evolution is further revealed.

J. 68:2474-2492), which takes into account the reversible exciton trapping by photosystem II (PSII) reaction centers and exciton exchange between PSII units. The model of Trissl and Lavergne was modified by assuming that PSII consists of photosynthetically active and photoinhibited (inactive in oxygen evolution) units and that the inactive PSII units can efficiently dissipate energy even if they still retain the capacity for the charge separation reaction. Comparison of theoretical and experimental fluorescence induction curves of thylakoids, which had been subjected to strong light in the presence of the uncoupler nigericin, suggests connectivity between the photoinhibited and active PSII units. The model predicts that photoinhibition lowers the yield of radical pair formation in the remaining active PSII centers. However, the kinetics of PSII inactivation in nigericin-treated thylakoids upon exposure to photoinhibitory light ranging from 185 to 2650 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) was strictly exponential. This may suggest that photoinhibition occurs independently of the primary electron transfer reactions of PSII or that increased production of harmful substances by photoinhibited PSII units compensates for the protection afforded; by the quenching of excitation energy in photoinhibited centers.									18	0	0	0	18	0	18			0006-3495			WOS:000075246200050	9649412

However, due to the insufficient electron deficiency and unfavorable electronic structure of SACs, resulting in poor NO3--adsorption, sluggish proton (H*) transfer kinetics, and preferred hydrogen evolution, their NO3--to-NH3 selectivity and yield rate are far from satisfactory. Herein, a systematic theoretical prediction reveals that the local electron deficiency of an f-block Gd single atom (Gd-SA) can be significantly regulated upon coordination with oxygen-defect-rich NiO (Gd-SA-D-NiO400) support. Thus, facilitating stronger NO3- adsorption via strong Gd-5d-O-2p orbital coupling and further improving the protonation kinetics of adsorption intermediates by rapid H* capture from water dissociation catalyzed by the adjacent oxygen vacancy site along with suppressed H* dimerization synergistically boosts the NH3 selectivity/yield rate. Motivated by DFT prediction, we delicately stabilized electron-deficient (strongly electrophilic) Gd-SA on D-NiO400 (similar to 84% strong electrophilic sites), which exhibited excellent alkaline NitRR activity (NH3 Faradaic efficiency similar to 97% and yield rate similar to 628 mu g/(mg(cat) h)) along with superior structural stability, as revealed by in situ Raman spectroscopy, significantly outperforming weakly electrophilic Gd nanoparticles, defect-free Gd-SA-P-NiO400, and reported state-of-the-art catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000856561400001	36099061

It has been found that body-centered tetragonal (bct) VH(x) (x less than or similar to 0.1; a=0.301 nm, c=0.312 nm) and NaCl-type VO(y) (y=1.0; a'=0.408 nm) are formed on the substrate held at 270-degrees-C in the early growth stage of the film. With increasing film thickness, body-centered cubic (bcc) V is formed. When the substrate temperature is raised up to 400-degrees-C, bcc V films (a=0.302 nm) grow from the early growth stage. On the other hand, bct VH(x) (x=0.5; a=0.297 nm, c=0.338 nm) grows mainly when the substrate temperature is lowered to -170-degrees-C. The existence of oxygen and hydrogen atoms in the film was confirmed by nuclear reaction analysis and elastic recoil detection analysis respectively. The present paper has verified also that hydrogen and oxygen atoms which dissolve in V films, escape from the NaCl substrate.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0021-4922			WOS:A1992KJ15100046

De-intercalated structure of LiNiTiO4 is obtained by removing one Li atom from Li2NiTiO4 unit cell while shifting another Li atom from octahedral site 4b to tetrahedral lattice site 8c. Due to Li+ extraction, the change in unit cell volume is similar to 5.9%. Li+ de-intercalation voltage is calculated by subtracting total energy of the unit cell of LiNiTiO4 and bcc Li from Li2NiTiO4. The voltage comes out to be 4.84 V which is nearly at the threshold for electrochemical stability of used electrolytes. The redox couples in this case are Ni+2/Ni2 + delta and O-2/O-2+gamma. The presence of redox couple O-2/O-2+gamma leads to the probability of evolution of oxygen during charging. However, partial (50% in this case) vanadium doping at Ti site reduces the redox voltage to 4.64 V considering the de-intercalation reaction forming LiNiTi0.5V0.5O4 from Li2NiTi0.5V0.5O4, by activating the redox couple V+3/V+4 in Li2NiTi0.5V0.5O4. This also reduces the possibility of evolution of oxygen during de-intercalation reaction by shifting the main redox couple from O-2/O-2+gamma to V+3/V+4, which leads to greater structural stability of electrode materials during charge-discharge cycles.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000495300800003

With the help of ab initio molecular dynamics calculations, the evolution of momentum distributions of the O- fragment in terms of the electron attachment energy is identified as the result of a competition between two distinctly different indirect pathways, namely, climbing over and bypassing the energy ridge after the molecular structure bending. These two pathways prefer leaving the N2 fragment at the high vibrational and rotational states, respectively.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-9606			INSPEC:13084208

Herein, we prepared 3D bristlegrass-like Co-doped Ni2P (Co-Ni2P) composites supported on Ni foam (NF) through a facile solvothermal method combined and a subsequent phosphatization treatment. Benefiting from the unique structure, Co-Ni2P shows excellent electrocatalytic activity as an electrode material for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, low overpotential of 116 mV at 50 mA cm(-2)) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER, low overpotential of 266 mV at 50 mA cm(-2)). Moreover, the as-prepared Co-Ni2P composites exhibit excellent stability and corrosion resistance in an alkaline medium. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to evaluate the H* adsorption of Co-Ni2P, and the results proved the high catalytic activity for the HER.

The Ni3S2@NGCLs exhibit a unique architecture with a well-defined core-shell cable-like one-dimensional nanostructure in which NGCLs act as conductive shell and Ni3S2 nanowire as active core. The composite has a nitrogen content of 6.39% in atomic ratio. The Ni3S2@NGCLs/NF shows low overpotentials of 271 mV and 134 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH for OER and HER, respectively. Highly durable OER and HER performances were demonstrated by 40 h chronopotentiometry and 10,000 CV cycle tests. Excellent overall water splitting electrocatalytic activity was found in a Ni3S2@NGCLs/NF parallel to Ni3S2@NGCLs/NF two-electrode system. Particularly, an active-phase NiOOH, a highly active substance for OER, can be controllably formed in the reaction process due to the shell structure of multi-layer carbon that slows down the dissolution of Ni3S2. Theoretical calculations suggest that Ni3S2@NGCLs/NF has a lower Delta G (H*) value of 0.51 eV for HER and lower overpotential value of 0.39 V for OER. These results suggest that the composite structure is a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst.									79	3	0	0	6	0	79			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000569904100005

In the current review, various types of biomass-derived N-doped carbon materials with the combination of heteroatoms (H), transition metals, and conducting polymers are reviewed according to their roles in each application that includes fuel cells, water splitting, batteries, and supercapacitors. The electrocatalytic activity of biomass-derived N-doped carbon materials is discussed based on the key reactions of each application, such as oxygen redox reaction, hydrogen generation reaction, sulfur/vanadium redox reactions and so on. For example, oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysts can be categorized into five types, that is, i) metal-free N doping, ii) metal-free N, H co-doping, iii) metal-free N, H multiple doping, iv) metal-N doping, and v) metal-N, H co-doping. Further, their electrochemical performance is compared with state-of-the-art noble metal-based catalysts including Pt/C and IrO2. The key roles of the biomass-derived N-doped carbonaceous electrocatalysts in various types of rechargeable batteries, meanwhile, are first summarized including metal-air, lithium-sulfur, metal-carbon dioxide, and vanadium redox flow batteries. It is anticipated that this review could not only contribute to the rational design of biomassderived catalyst synthesis but also boost scientific research efforts in the valorization of biomass-derived resources for the electrochemical energy applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000805977300003

By placing neutral density filters in the path of the white light, light saturation curves of the oxygen evolution (P/I curves) were measured using diluted aliquots of algal cultures. The results clearly showed that photosynthetic rates increased exponentially with increasing light/dark frequencies, that a longer dark period in relation to the light period does not necessarily lead to higher photosynthetic rates (efficiencies), and that algae do not acclimate to a specific light/dark frequency. One of the most important factors that influenced photosynthetic rates, either under continuous illumination or intermittent, was whether the algae were dark or light acclimated. Low light/dark frequencies were perceived by the algae as low light conditions, whilst the opposite was true for high frequencies. The light utilisation efficiency in a fluctuating light/dark environment depended on the acclimated state of the algae, the specific frequency of the fluctuations and the duration of the exposure. Since the frequencies determined the 'perceived' quantities of light, dark reactions played an important role in determining the average photosynthetic efficiencies. These results have important implications for algal biotechnology.									132	0	0	0	105	0	133			0921-8971			WOS:A1996WP39700009

The resultant LDH-NDs@C-MOF nonprecious metal catalysts were demonstrated to exhibit super-high catalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with excellent operation stability and low overpotential (similar to 230 mV) at an exchange current density of 10 mAcm(-2). The observed overpotential for the LDH-NDs@C-MOF is much lower than that of large-sized LDH nanosheets (321 mV), pure carbonized MOF (411 mV), and even commercial RuO2 (281 mV). X-ray absorption measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed partial charge transfer from Fe3+ through an O bridge to Ni2+ at the edge of LDH-NDs supported by C-MOF to produce the optimal binding energies for OER intermediates. This, coupled with a large number of exposed active sides and efficient charge and electrolyte/reactant/product transports associated with the porous 3D C-MOF support, significantly boosted the OER performance of the LDH-ND catalyst with respect to its nanosheet counterpart. Apart from the fact that this is the first active side identification for LDH-ND OER catalysts, this work provides a general strategy to enhance activities of nanosheet catalysts by converting them into edge-rich nanodots to be supported by 3D porous carbon architectures.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000621073300005

However, the exact role of non-covalent interaction in the electrode-electrolyte interface on the HER kinetics remains obscure at the molecular level, especially for non-platinum-based electrodes. This is due to the lack of an effective strategy to decouple the effect of each inter-action (delta G(H), noncovalent interactions) on the HER kinetics. Accordingly, herein, we constructed a model catalyst surface (Pd,RuSOy) to decouple the influence of delta G(H) and double-layer structure optimization on HER kinetics, thus exploring the role of this non-covalent interactions on the HER at the molecular level. We found that hydrated cations located in the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) also interact directly with electrode materials and the strength of these interactions would also affect the HER activity. Consequently, Pd,RuS2-xOy exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward HER, which delivered low overpotentials of 38 and 82 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. This study not only illustrates the roles of interfacial interactions, but also provides a new way for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000868331300007

Here, we demonstrated full-cycle synthesis, characterization, and optimization of Co2N0.67/CoMoO4 electrocatalyst on carbon-supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The DFT calculation revealed a significant charge accumulation at the interface between Co2N0.67 and CoMoO4, suggesting the possibility of a strong synergy. As expected, electrochemical studies have shown a bifunctional Co2N0.67/CoMoO4 catalyst with low overpotential and durability towards hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) in alkaline electrolytes and robust overall water splitting performance at high current densities. In addition, the optimized Co2N0.67/CoMoO4 catalyst is also used in a Zn-H2O cell and displayed a power density exceeding Pt/C with the long-term stability of up to 170 h. The excellent electrochemical performance is the outcome of the better charge mobility at the interface resulted in the unique synergy between the active components.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773718000004

Replacing the anodic OER with a thermodynamically favorable organic upgrading reaction not only reduces the operating voltage, but also produces value-added chemicals, which is regarded as a win-win strategy. In this work, MOF-derived Os-doped NixP/N-doped carbon composite nanosheet arrays on nickel foam (Os-NixP/N-C/NF) are fabricated as a bifunctional catalyst for oxidizing methanol to value-added formate while simultaneously facilitating H-2 production. Taking advantage of synergistic structural and compositional properties, the obtained Os-NixP/N-C/NF exhibits high faradaic efficiency for generating anodic formate (92%) and cathodic H-2 (100%).

Mixed Ni-Co oxide films display higher charge densities, broader CV peaks, and negatively shifted equilibrium potentials us. pure Mi oxide films. At slow sweep rates, all films studied showed kinetically reversible surface electrochemical behavior. At higher sweep rates, the redox reactions became kinetically irreversible, being either surface reactions with no diffusion limitations or controlled by the diffusion rate of species inside the film. The effect of the oxide film formation conditions, i.e., the withdrawal rate of the substrate from the sol solution and the firing temperature, on the electrochemical. efficiency of the oxide films was also studied.									47	1	0	0	1	0	51			0013-4651			WOS:A1997WL64700033

Crude glycerol is an extremely alkaline byproduct of biodiesel synthesis that can be valorized or refined to produce more desirable chemicals. Glycerol can also be directly oxidized on an anode, replacing water oxidation, to reduce the applied cell potential requirements of electrolytic H-2 production or CO2 reduction. An advantage of oxidizing glycerol in its crude form is the opportunity to valorize it without initial refinement. We describe an approach to replace the OER half-reaction with the sacrificial crude glycerol electrooxidation on a layered Au-Pt-Bi electrocatalyst on a Ni substrate. Compared to compositions with fewer components, the AuPtBi-Ni electrocatalyst improved the duration of performance and reduced the overall cell potential for glycerol electrooxidation in the extreme alkaline solutions representative of crude glycerol. These enhancements facilitated extended, unassisted hydrogen evolution from crude glycerol electrolysis, even under the power of a single-junction silicon solar cell at less than 1 sun illumination. We characterized the oxidation products of crude glycerol electrolysis and the subsequent products formed spontaneously in the electrolyte in the highly alkaline solution. This analysis helps to both identify the stoichiometric limits of glycerol oxidation at the low cell potentials of interest here and to understand the chemical control imparted by electrocatalysis on the ultimate compounds formed in the crude solution. The results for the AuPtBi electrocatalyst show that incorporating crude glycerol oxidation into integrated electrochemical systems can simultaneously simplify their design and significantly improve solar-to-hydrogen rates.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000812979700001

Considering the similar chemical properties of Sr to Ca, we employed Sr element as a new dopant into the lead matrix, and the detailed properties of this novel binary Pb-Sr alloys are studied. Combining the results from hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) study, anti-corrosion investigations under constant potential or current, it can be concluded that this new dopant is not suitable to be used as a sole additive to the grid for a lead-acid battery. The Sr element may accelerate the electrochemical reaction occurred onto the alloys, resulting in deteriorated anti-corrosive properties. Furthermore, the behaviors of the alloys operated under different temperatures (Room temperature and 60 degrees C) are also studied in this research, aiming to provide some useful guidance in alloy design and application.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			1452-3981			WOS:000483307100030

In this work, the catalytic performance of metal (alkali, alkali-earth, and transition metal) atoms anchored to silicene was investigated by density functional theory. Results showed that all the studied metal atoms are energetically favorably absorbed on the silicene with large binding energies. The pristine silicene is catalytically inert for HER, while the metal (Fe, V, Mn, Ti, Co, Ni, Be, and Cr) atom anchored silicene is catalytically active for HER with the calculated Gibbs free energies in the range between -0.09 and 0.18 eV, which is very close to the optimum value of 0.0 eV. These results suggested that the catalytic behavior of silicene can be effectively improved by metal adsorption. Such metal (Fe, V, Mn, Ti, Co, Ni, Be, and Cr) atom anchored silicenes can be used as potential catalysts for HER.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12				2046-2069		WOS:000483541000041	35531030

Herein, density functional theory (DFT) is used to help explain why a protective graphitic layer on Ni0/NiOx nanoparticles helps prevent surface oxidation at ambient and anodic conditions and reduction (NiOx-* Ni0) at the cathodic potential. We find that the work of adhesion of the graphitic layer to nickel-terminated surfaces is 2-3 times stronger than that to oxygen-or hydroxylated-terminated surfaces. Furthermore, we determined the additional energy required to remove a surface group/ atom (O, OH and Ni) when protected by a graphitic layer. Our findings lead us to conclude that the graphitic layer will limit oxidation, help minimize the reduction of NiOx and favor the formation of Ni-rich surfaces. These findings provide a plausible explanation of how an ideal Ni0/NiOx ratio is maintained during HER, which is crucial for enhanced device performance and stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000874895500001

Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations imply that WC-Mo2C heterostructure may exert a high HER performance since the hybridization of WC and Mo2C can optimize the proton adsorption energy and energy barrier for water dissociation. To test this predication, we prepare the WC-Mo2C heterostructure on a flexible carbon cloth (CC) The obtained WC-Mo2C@CC exhibits notable HER activity (eta 10 = 122 mV; eta 500 = 309 mV) and stability (continuous 100 h at 500 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline media. Furthermore, a solar-panel-driven electrolyzer, including the WC-Mo2C@CC cathode and a NiFe-LDH@Ni-f anode, operates at 10 mA cm(-2) with a cell voltage of 1.51 V in 10 M KOH at 70 degrees C, demonstrating its potential for practical applications.

Herein, we report a robust and highly active nickel selenide(NiSe)spheres grown on carbon cloth(CC)by electrodeposition from a nickel selenite complex which is a single source containing both Ni and Se. A combination of two chemicals containing,separately, Ni and Se is used in traditional preparations of metal selenides, causing possible problems in the uniformity of the products.

The anode catalysts free from carbon substrate were obtained by tailoring the reaction process to avoid occurrence of CO2 formation during water electrolysis. Various Ir contents were added in the Ru catalytic compositions for improving the oxidation-resistance of RuO2 which was the best metallic oxide in H2O splitting. Their physical characterizations revealed the presence of agglomerates due probably to the heat treatment process consisting in the removal of organic carbon at 400 degrees C. The prevalent existence of RuO2 and IrO2 in the anode materials was confirmed by XPS experiments and the electrochemical measurements enabled to show that RuxIr1-xO2 materials were more active towards water oxidation than IrO2 catalyst. The O-2 evolution process started at 1.45 V with Ru0.9Ir0.1O2 in the anodic compartment of a 25 cm(2) Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzer at 60 degrees C.

Therefore, recycling valuable Co element from spent devices, and boosting its service efficiency are becoming two indispensable approaches to promote the utilization of Co in various energy conversion/storage devices. Herein, we realize the recovery of Co from spent LIBs and synthesize a three-dimensional (3D) sea-urchin-like cobalt nitride composite material (labeled as CoN-Gr-2), which is used as a bi-functional catalyst for water splitting. Benefiting from the intrinsic high conductivity, larger surface area and unique 3D sea-urchin-like architecture, CoN-Gr-2 shows an excellent electron transfer efficiency, highly exposed active sites as well as the superior mass transport capacity. The CoN-Gr-2 catalyst exhibits low overpotentials of 128.9 mV and 280 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which are comparable to the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. Moreover, when adopting CoN-Gr-2 as both anode and cathode materials for overall water splitting (in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte), the assembled cell achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.61 V, which almost close to that of Pt/C parallel to RuO2 benchmark (1.60 V), demonstrating its superior water-splitting efficiency. Meanwhile, the CoN catalysts exhibit strong chemical interaction with the Gr support, suppressing the aggregation of CoN catalysts and maintains their high activity during HER and OER reactions. So, the cell exhibits a high current retention of 97.3% after 40 h. This work successfully develops an industrial chain from recycling Co wastes in spent energy devices to controllably designing 3D sea-urchin-like CoN-Gr with high water splitting efficiency. Therefore, it could further promote the efficient utilization of valuable Co element in various energy devices.

Herein, a hybrid of cobalt nanoparticles supported in nitrogen doped porous carbon (Co@NPC) is prepared by using a biomass-based ternary deep eutectic solvent (DES) as precursor and self-templates, which is utlized as bifunctional electrocatalyst for boosting H2 generation and converting glucose into valuable chemicals simultaneously. Importantly, only a small cell voltage of 1.56 V is required to deliver 10 mA cm-2, which is 180 mV lower than that of overall water splitting. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that nitrogen doping porous carbon could synergistically optimize adsorption energies of H2O (Delta E*H2O) and *H adsorption free energies (Delta G*H), enhancing catalytic activity toward HER.

The photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation activity of CoPc(NH2)(4)/BiVO4 composite catalysts is optimized by varying the loading content of CoPc(NH2)(4). Under 1 sun illumination, the optimized 2CoPc (NH2)(4)/BiVO4 photoelectrode exhibits the largest photocurrent density of 3.02 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE in this study, which is 2.7, 1.6 and 1.4 times that of pure BiVO4, 1CoPc(NH2)(4)/BiVO4 and 3CoPc(NH2)(4)/BiVO4, respectively. The enhanced PEC water oxidation performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect between CoPc (NH2)(4) and BiVO4 by improving reaction kinetics. The present study indicates that there is an optimum concentration of CoPc(NH2)(4) in the composite catalysts to maximize the PEC water splitting performance, highlighting the influence of the loading content of CoPc(NH2)(4) on the oxygen evolution reaction.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000675862900003

Here, by combining algorithm screening and density functional theory (DFT) computations, we developed a method to predict two-dimensional (2D) metal-free materials with metallicity as efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). From all metal-free compounds in the Materials Project database, we obtained 18 layered materials without band gaps as candidates for the HER. After being exfoliated into monolayers, a stable metal-free material, a C3N monolayer, proved to be an efficient HER electrocatalyst according to computations. With this strategy, we can adjust the screening conditions with the target to find promising materials, which overcomes the obstacles of traditional trial-and-error methods and greatly saves computational resource. We hope that this work would inspire the development of a new research paradigm and promote the discovery of more functional materials.									38	1	0	0	0	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000482139000005

Herein, we report a facile strategy for constructing Ni nanotube arrays (NTAs) on a Ni foam (NF) substrate through cathodic deposition of NiCu alloy followed by anodic stripping of metallic Cu. Based on Ni NTAs, the as-prepared NiSe2 NTA electrode by NiSe2 electrodeposition and the NiFeOx NTA electrode by dipping in Fe3+ solution exhibit excellent HER and OER performance in alkaline conditions. In these systems, Ni NTAs act as a binder-free multifunctional inner layer to support the electrocatalysts, offer a large specific surface area and serve as a fast electron transport pathway. Moreover, an alkaline electrolyzer has been constructed using NiFeOx NTAs as the anode and NiSe2 NTAs as the cathode, which only demands a cell voltage of 1.78 V to deliver a water-splitting current density of 500 mA cm-2, and demonstrates remarkable stability during long-term electrolysis.

However, the intrinsic drawbacks of g-C3N4, such as low surface area, poor diffusion, and charge separation efficiency, remain as the bottleneck to achieve highly efficient hydrogen evolution. Here, a hollow oxygen-incorporated g-C3N4 nanosheet (OCN) with an improved surface area of 148.5 m(2) g(-1) is fabricated by the multiple thermal treatments under the N-2/O-2 atmosphere, wherein the C-O bonds are formed through two ways of physical adsorption and doping. The physical characterization and theoretical calculation indicate that the O-adsorption can promote the generation of defects, leading to the formation of hollow morphology, while the O-doping results in reduced band gap of g-C3N4. The optimized OCN shows an excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of 3519.6 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) for similar to 20 h, which is over four times higher than that of g-C3N4 (850.1 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) and outperforms most of the reported g-C3N4 catalysts.									24	1	0	0	6	0	24			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000607061500019	34138228

Key issue to large-scale implementation of this technology is the lack of efficient electrocatalysts that can deliver large current density at low overpotential for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER). Herein, we report a strategy leveraging 3D MXene frame with high conductivity, highly hydrophilic properties and kinetics-favorable architecture as multi-functional structural scaffold for engineering water-splitting electrocatalysts yielding high current densities. The macroporous 3D MXene frame not only facilitates the mass/charge transport across the catalyst, but also accelerates the OER redox process of NiFe-LDHs and the Volmer step of HER by enhancing the water adsorption/activation on the catalyst. Commercially required high current density of 500 mA cm(-2) can be achieved at low overpotentials for both OER (300 mV) and HER (205 mV) with good durability in 1.0 M KOH. Alkaline electrolyzer using this electrocatalytic electrode as both the anode and cathode exhibit low cell voltage for achieving high current density of 500 mA cm(-2) with high Faradaic efficiency and excellent durability. Their performance outperforms the Pt/C-RuO2 couple and the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for overall water-splitting in alkaline electrolyte.									152	11	0	0	8	0	155			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000480422400048

To realise this vision, a distributed model based on small scale reactors needs to be constructed. In this context, electrolysers performing water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction to produce sustainable fuels carry paramount industrial importance. All these electrolysers use water oxidation as anodic half-reaction which produces oxygen having a low economic value and a higher overpotential requirement. This increases the input voltage of electrolysers. The product value and energy efficiency of these electrolysers can be further enhanced if the electrochemical hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction can be paired with alternative oxidation reactions such as biomass oxidation, electro-organic synthesis, etc., which are thermodynamically more favorable than water oxidation. This review summarizes the importance of these paired electrolysis processes for simultaneous production of fuels and value-added platform chemicals from hybrid electrolysers along with a discussion of optimization of process parameters for paired electrolysis.									27	0	0	0	2	0	27			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000531211600001

However, the current research efforts toward the NOER mainly focus on metal surface catalysts, while low-cost and high-efficiency single-atom catalysts (SACs) are rarely explored. Herein, using first-principles computations, we systematically investigate the NOER performance of a series of transition-metal-atom-decorated graphitic carbon nitride monolayer (g-C3N4) and identify single Cu-atomdecorated g-C3N4 (Cu@g-C3N4) as the most promising SAC candidate for the NOER. Our results indicate that Cupg-C3N4 harbors excellent catalytic activity for the NOER with a quite low limiting potential of 0.371 V and, interestingly, is promising to be synthesized due to extremely high stability. Most importantly, Cu@g-C3N4 can efficiently suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction, in favor of achieving high Faradaic efficiency. Our work provides a promising SAC candidate for the NOER to resolve environmental pollution and sustainable ammonia production.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000505632900031

The films were deposited on glass substrates at three different temperatures. The textural quality and preferential growth were found to be significantly altered by changes in the deposition temperature. Oleylamine capped nanosheets and the as-deposited thin films by AACVD were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD) and microscopic techniques. The thin films were also studied by Raman spectroscopy. The stoichiometry is marginally affected by temperature, and all films were slightly selenium deficient. The synthesized material was also evaluated for the photoelectrochemical (PEC) splitting of water. The PEC study revealed the bifunctional nature of the material, which can be applied for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), by switching the applied potential.									37	0	0	0	1	0	37			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000430328100041	29595861

In the current work, a new family of 2D nanostructures, 2D transition-metal phosphide monolayer (M2P), is designed to find its multifunctional applications on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We show that the 2D M2P monolayers are thermodynamically stable by carrying out molecular dynamic simulations, analyzing their phonon dispersions, and calculating their mechanical properties. We find that all of the stable 2D M2P monolayers are metallic, and their magnetic states strongly depend on the transition metals and geometric phases. We further demonstrate that 2D W2P and Fe2P monolayers in the 2H phase show the best catalytic performance in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to the relatively low overpotentials at high hydrogen coverage. Importantly, oxygen functionalization can efficiently improve the HER activities of the 2D M2P monolayers at low hydrogen coverage. Our systematic study predicts that these new thermodynamically stable 2D transition-metal phosphides could be applicable in nanodevices, spintronics, and electrocatalysis.									54	2	0	0	1	0	53			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000413884900036

Metal oxide nanostructures having perovskite crystal structure have been found to exhibit unique electrochemical properties owing to its unique electronic band structure and multiple redox-active ions. Herein, MgTiO₃ nanoparticles (MTO-1) were synthesized by wet-chemical sol-gel technique with an average particle size of 50-55 nm, which exhibited superior supercapacitor performance of capacitance (C) = 25 F/g (at 0.25 A/g), energy density (ED) = 17 Wh/kg, power density (PD) = 275 W/kg and 82.41% capacitance retention (after 1000 cycles).

We also succeeded in purification of Photosystem 11 (PSII) particles by differential centrifugation of the thylakoid membranes after treatment with 1% Triton X-100. The diatom PSII particles showed an oxygen-evolving activity of 850 and 1045 mu mol O-2/mg Chl/h in the absence and presence of CaCl2, respectively. The PSII particles contained fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding proteins in addition to main intrinsic proteins of CP47, CP43, D2, D1, cytochrome b559, and the antenna size was estimated to be 229 Chl a per 2 molecules of pheophytin. Five extrinsic proteins were stoichiometrically released from the diatom PSII particles by alkaline Tris-treatment. Among these five extrinsic proteins, four proteins were red algal-type extrinsic proteins, namely, PsbO, PsbQ', PsbV and PsbU, whereas the other one was a novel, hypothetical protein. This is the first report on isolation and characterization of diatom PSII particles that are highly active in oxygen evolution and retain the full set of extrinsic proteins including an unknown protein.

We focus on this mass range in order to estimate the masses and calculate the CNO surface abundances of a sample of observed red giants. The stellar models are calculated from the zero-age main sequence till the early asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Stars of M <= 2.2M(circle dot) are evolved through the core helium flash. In this work, an approach is adopted that improves the mass determination of an observed sample of 21 RGB and early AGB stars. This approach is based on comparing the observationally derived effective temperatures and absolute magnitudes with the calculated values based on our evolutionary tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. A more reliable determination of the stellar masses is achieved by using evolutionary tracks extended to the range of observation. In addition, the predicted CNO surface abundances are compared to the observationally inferred values in order to show how far standard evolutionary calculation can be used to interpret available observations and to illustrate the role of convective mixing. We find that extra mixing beyond the convective boundary determined by the Schwarzschild criterion is needed to explain the observational oxygen isotopic ratios in low-mass stars. The effect of recent determinations of proton capture reactions and their uncertainties on the O-16/O-17 and N-14/N-15 ratios is also shown. It is found that the N-14(p, gamma) O-15 reaction is important for predicting the N-14/N-15 ratio in red giants.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000360833700052

The design and development of cost effective and efficient catalysts and substrates is still crucial and progressive towards the commercialization of water electrolyser. Herein, we have shown abundant mild steel (MS) as an efficient substrate as well as a catalyst host for OER by the cathodic treatment followed by the electrodeposited Ni(OH)(2) at room temperature. The C MS Ni(OH)(2) shows an overpotential (eta) of 267 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 66 mV dec(-1), and affordable stability at the benchmark scale of 10 mA cm(-2) current density operation for 10 h and harsh condition of 100 mA cm(-2) current density for 50 h in the continuous electrolysis chronoamperometry test in 1 M KOH. The higher catalytic activity of C MS Ni(OH)(2) compared to Ni(OH)(2) electrodeposited on MS is due to the interaction of Fe(OH)(2)/FeOOH and Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH. These results suggest a possible way to utilize MS substrates as catalyst and as a host for OER and other electrochemical applications in the future.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2196-0216			WOS:000474158000001

In previous papers, we have proposed a flash-assisted deep-mixing model that can burn (24)Mg and help explain the observed abundance anomalies. Relevant reaction rates have considerable uncertainties at low energies. Using NACRE reaction rates, we recompute the nucleosynthesis predicted by our model and, by adjusting reaction rates within current uncertainties, find that agreement with the observations is considerably improved for almost all isotopes except for (25)Mg, which remains overabundant. A resolution of the latter discrepancy by nuclear physics alone would require that the (25)Mg(p, gamma)(26)Al reaction rate be substantially larger than that given by the experiments. This suggests that our model may require burning of (25)Mg (coupled with some extra mixing) during quiescent hydrogen-burning phases.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0004-637X			WOS:000222184300032

This strategy not only furnishes carbon textiles with a large surface area and hierarchical meso-microporosity, but also enables efficient dual-doping of N and S into carbon skeletons while retaining high conductivity and stable monolithic structures. Thus, although original carbon textile has rather poor catalytic activity, the activated textiles without loading other active materials yield effective ORR/OER bifunctionality and stability with a much lower reversible overpotential (0.87 V) than those of Pt/C (1.10 V) and RuO2 (1.02 V) and many reported metal-free bifunctional catalysts. Importantly, they can concurrently function as current collectors and as ORR/OER catalysts for rechargeable aqueous and flexible solid-state Zn-air batteries, showing excellent cell performance, long lifetime, and high flexibility.									71	7	0	0	2	0	71				2198-3844		WOS:000453685900015	30581696	
J	Kercek, A.; Hillebrandt, W.; Truran, J.W.								Three-dimensional simulations of classical novae								Three-dimensional simulations of classical novae								10 pp	10 pp						Nov. 1998	1999	We present first results of three-dimensional (3D) calculations of turbulent and degenerate hydrogen-burning on top of a C+O white dwarf of 1.0 Modot. The simulations are carried out by means of a code which solves Euler's equation for an arbitrary equation of state together with a nuclear reaction network and the energy input from nuclear reactions on a Cartesian grid covering a fraction of the white dwarf's surface and accreted atmosphere. The flow patterns we obtain are very different from those of earlier 2D simulations using the same initial conditions and the same numerical resolution. The possibility of self-enrichment of the accreted hydrogen-rich atmosphere with carbon and oxygen from the surface layers of the white dwarf during the violent phase of the burning is investigated, and it is demonstrated that self-enrichment proceeds too slowly if the accreted gas has near-solar CNO-abundances at the onset of the thermonuclear runaway. As a result, we do not find a fast nova outburst. This conclusion remains valid if the initial metallicity of the accreted gas is raised by a factor of five. Therefore we conclude that fast nova outbursts indeed require huge enrichments of C and O, as postulated from spherically symmetric models, and that the mechanism which leads to such enhancements must operate prior to the outburst.									0	0	0		0	0	0						INSPEC:6299682

Improving the activity of electrocatalysts is critical for increasing the efficiency of these energy conversion processes. However, the tailored design of highly active electrocatalysts for practical applications remains challenging. In this regard, we present an overview of the general design principles for efficient electrocatalysts and application of these principles in different electrocatalytic processes. Specifically, enhancing the intrinsic activity of electrocatalysts by electronic state modulation through heteroatom doping, vacancy introduction, interfacial electronic transfer and strain engineering is introduced. In addition, improving the apparent performance of electrocatalysts by mass transport regulation, which is realized by morphological and wettability control, is also discussed. Finally, enlightenment from these studies is summarized and perspectives for the future development of electrocatalysts are provided. The important progress highlighted in this work will provide solid foundations for the tailored design of electrocatalysts toward practical applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000854261700001	36112010

Mass spectrometry and optical emission spectroscopy have been used to monitor the formation and evolution of the fragments coming from chain breaking in terms of their concentration and emission intensity, respectively. It was demonstrated that pressure and gas flow rate are two important parameters in the interaction of cold plasmas and of polymer surfaces. The results obtained can be explained by combined effects such as electron energy and its density, residence time, "quenching effect," as well as chemical reactions.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0021-8995			WOS:A1992JY94500001		
J	BURNAP, RL; SHERMAN, LA								DELETION MUTAGENESIS IN SYNECHOCYSTIS SP PCC6803 INDICATES THAT THE MN-STABILIZING PROTEIN OF PHOTOSYSTEM-II IS NOT ESSENTIAL FOR O2 EVOLUTION								BIOCHEMISTRY				30	2			440	446		10.1021/bi00216a020				JAN 15 1991	1991	The photosystem II (PSII) reaction center complex coordinates a cluster of Mn atoms that are involved in the accumulation of oxidizing equivalents generated by light-induced charge separations within the intrinsic portion of the PSII complex. A 33-kDa extrinsic protein, termed the Mn-stabilizing protein (MSP), has been implicated in the stabilization of two of the four Mn atoms of the cluster, yet the precise role of this protein in O2 evolution remains to be elucidated. Here we describe the construction of a mutant of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 in which the entire gene encoding MSP has been deleted. Northern and immunoblot analyses indicate that other PSII proteins are expressed and accumulated, despite the absence of MSP. Fluorescence emission spectra at 77 K indicate PSII assembles in the mutant, but that the binding of MSP is required for the normal fluorescence characteristics of the PSII complex, and suggest a specific interaction between MSP and CP47. Fluorescence induction measurements indicate a reduced rate of forward electron transport to the primary electron donor, P680, in the mutant. It is concluded that in contrast to previous reports, MSP is not required for the assembly of active PSII complexes nor is it essential for H2O-splitting activity in vivo.									193	0	2	0	177	0	195			0006-2960			WOS:A1991ET38100020	1899025

The most prominent feature of a metal-air battery is the combination of a metal anode with high energy density and an air electrode with open structure to draw cathode active materials (i.e., oxygen) from air. In this critical review, we present the fundamentals and recent advances related to the fields of metal-air batteries, with a focus on the electrochemistry and materials chemistry of air electrodes. The battery electrochemistry and catalytic mechanism of oxygen reduction reactions are discussed on the basis of aqueous and organic electrolytes. Four groups of extensively studied catalysts for the cathode oxygen reduction/evolution are selectively surveyed from materials chemistry to electrode properties and battery application: Pt and Pt-based alloys (e. g., PtAu nanoparticles), carbonaceous materials (e. g., graphene nanosheets), transition-metal oxides (e. g., Mn-based spinels and perovskites), and inorganic-organic composites (e. g., metal macrocycle derivatives). The design and optimization of air-electrode structure are also outlined. Furthermore, remarks on the challenges and perspectives of research directions are proposed for further development of metal-air batteries (219 references).									1940	119	0	0	79	0	1986			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000300797700012	22254234

To accelerate the OER process, a nature-abundant non-noble metal catalyst with outstanding catalytic activity is required. Here, a hierarchical CoMoO4@CoFe layered double hydroxide (LDH, denoted by CoMoO4@CoFe/NF) heterostructure supported on three-dimensional (3D) nickel foam (NF) was synthesised by electrodepositing CoFe-LDH nanosheets on the surface of CoMoO4 nanoplates to boost the electrocatalytic performance for the OER. The coupling between CoMoO4 and CoFe-LDH established abundant boundaries, which exposed abundant active sites. Furthermore, the electron transfer in the hierarchical heterostructure effectively promoted the adsorption and dissociation of H2O molecules. Harnessing the aforementioned synergistic effect significantly improved the intrinsic reaction kinetics of the OER. At 10 mA cm(-2), CoMoO4@CoFe/NF reached a small overpotential of 245 mV at room temperature and exhibited outstanding stability for at least 47 h. Furthermore, the Tafel slope for CoMoO4@CoFe/NF was only 46 mV dec(-1). This study provides new ideas for the rational design of hierarchical structures and the use of interface interactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000818744000001	35770502

Herein, a facile precursor route is developed to synthesize CoP nanostructure with different morphologies just by controlling the hydrothermal reaction temperature and time. The precursor Co(CO3)(0.5)OH center dot 0.11H(2)O (CHCH) nanowire (NW) and uniform flower-like microball (MB) with exposed (001) facet were firstly successfully prepared at hydrothermal reaction temperature of 115 degrees C for 3 h and 10 h, respectively. And then a phosphorization treatment of CHCH was performed to get CoP NWs and flower-like CoP MBs assembled with ordered NWs that exposed (002) facets. The CoP MBs exhibit a lower over-potential of 105.3 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a smaller Tafel slope of 53.5 mV.dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution for HER. Furthermore, this hierarchical structure could possess its good activity for 40,000 s. The catalyst also shows an excellent activity with the overpotential of 97.3 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and a Tafel slope of 84.3 mV.dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution for HER. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that hydrogen adsorbed on all P sites of CoP could result in smaller adsorption energy (0.085 eV), which is comparable to Pt. So, all P sites are the main active sites for HER. Also, these flower-like CoP MBs could display a good electrocatalytic activity for OER. Compared to disordered CoP NWs, the flower-like CoP MBs exhibit a better HER and OER performance because this hierarchical structure possessed two merits, that is, the fast vectorial electron transfer along the ordered NWs and improved inherent activity of each active site due to the exposed (002) facet. This low-cost and high-activity hierarchical structure is an efficient catalyst for HER and OER. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report a one-step electroless synthesis of an amorphous Co2.90B0.73P0.27 ternary alloy and its application as a new highly active and robust HER catalyst. The synthesized Co2.90B0.73P0.27 nanosheets supported on Ni foam exhibit remarkable catalytic performance in alkaline media, delivering a low onset overpotential of 12 mV and a low Tafel slope of 42.1 mV dec(-1). Moreover, this self-supported monolithic electrode sustains a high current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) and extended polarization over 20 h, outperforming the Pt/C benchmark. The superior performance is attributed to the superhydrophilic properties of the nanosheet microstructure and the synergistic effect of elements P and B, which favors dissociation of H2O, weakens surface H absorption, and suppresses Co oxidation. This work provides a new avenue for the design and optimization of transition metal boron phosphides for HER electrocatalysis.									105	13	0	0	3	0	106			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000456724800036

The way to the understanding of the common natural laws on earth and in space paved by Galilei's observations by the telescope, has been extended in the last decades, by new technologies such as radioastronomy and space missions. Plenty of new chemistry was surprisingly discovered. Extreme rich information on the chemical "composition" of the universe is being obtained, either from the other planets and satellites in the Solar System, from meteorites and comets, or from the interstellar space. In this article we will present selected topics regarding the chemical structures and reactions being discovered.

Herein, porous dendritic PtRuPd nanospheres (PtRuPd NSs) were synthesized by a facile hexadecylpyridinium chloride (HDPC)-mediated one-pot aqueous method with ascorbic acid (AA) as the reducing agent. The as-obtained PtRuPd NSs displayed high-efficient catalytic activity and durability for ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). It exhibited enlarged mass activity (MA, 1.368 A mg(-1)) compared to commercial Pt/C (1.100 A mg(-1)) for EGOR. Besides, the onset potential (E-onset, 0.930 V) and half-wave potential (E-1/2, 0.852 V) of PtRuPd NSs were more positive relative to homemade PtPd NSs (0.905 and 0.840 V), PdRu NSs (0.895 and 0.839 V), and commercial Pt/C (0.910 and 0.822 V) toward ORR.

At the same time, it requires high energy input and generates a product of little commercial value (i.e., oxygen). Finding appropriate alternative anode processes to be coupled with CO2 reduction is a major undertaking. Several factors need to be considered, such as (i) the value of the product, (ii) abundance and cost of the substrate, (iii) necessary cell voltage (energy input), (iv) needed catalysts, (v) cell structure and components, and (vi) ease/complexity of product analysis and separation.

This is equally true for artificial leaf-type structures and electrolyzer systems. Inspired by the oxygen evolving complex of Photosystem II, the biological catalyst for this reaction, scientists around the globe have investigated the possibility to use manganese oxides ("MnOx") for this task. This perspective article will look at selected examples from the last about 10 years of research in this field. At first, three aspects are addressed in detail which have emerged as crucial for the development of efficient electrocatalysts for the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER): (1) the structure and composition of the "MnOx" is of central importance for catalytic performance and it seems that amorphous, Mn-III(/IV) oxides with layered or tunnelled structures are especially good choices; (2) the type of support material (e.g. conducting oxides or nanostructured carbon) as well as the methods used to immobilize the MnOx catalysts on them greatly influence OER overpotentials, current densities and long-term stabilities of the electrodes and (3) when operating MnOx-based water-oxidizing anodes in electrolyzers, it has often been observed that the electrocatalytic performance is also largely dependent on the electrolyte's composition and pH and that a number of equilibria accompany the catalytic process, resulting in "adaptive changes" of the MnOx material over time. Overall, it thus has become clear over the last years that efficient and stable water-oxidation electrolysis by manganese oxides can only be achieved if at least four parameters are optimized in combination: the oxide catalyst itself, the immobilization method, the catalyst support and last but not least the composition of the electrolyte. Furthermore, these parameters are not only important for the electrode optimization process alone but must also be considered if different electrode types are to be compared with each other or with literature values from literature. Because, as without their consideration it is almost impossible to draw the right scientific conclusions. On the other hand, it currently seems unlikely that even carefully optimized MnOx anodes will ever reach the superb OER rates observed for iridium, ruthenium or nickel-iron oxide anodes in acidic or alkaline solutions, respectively. So at the end of the article, two fundamental questions will be addressed: (1) are there technical applications where MnOx materials could actually be the first choice as OER electrocatalysts? and (2) do the results from the last decade of intensive research in this field help to solve a puzzle already formulated in 2008: "Why did nature choose manganese to make oxygen?".									26	1	0	0	2	0	26			0942-9352			WOS:000534258100009

Therefore, the active sites are only necessary to be distributed on the surface of the electrocatalyst. Based on this motivation, here, we demonstrate a systematic study on surface tuning for a carbon-based electrocatalyst from metal-free (with the heteroatoms N and S, NS/C) to metal-containing surfaces (with Co, N, and S, CoNS/C). The CoNS/C electrocatalyst was obtained by pyrolyzing the Co precoordinated and p-toluenesulfonate-doped polypyrrole (PPy). It was found that the coordination of Co on the PPy ring tuned the final carbon electrocatalyst into a catalyst with a CoNx moiety-rich surface. In addition, the assynthesized CoNS/C was determined to have a very high loading of cobalt up to 2.02 wt %. The pyrolysis of the cobalt-containing precursor tends to proceed toward a characteristic of a higher sp(2) carbon content, a higher surface area, and more nitrogen as well as active nitrogen sites than its metal-free counterpart. The most distinguished feature for such a catalyst is that the truly most active component is only distributed on the surface, in contrast with that of the conventional metal-N-based catalyst present throughout the bulky structure. Especially, the electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been investigated experimentally and theoretically. The results showed that the OER performance of the carbon-based electrocatalyst was remarkably boosted after the introduction of Co with an overpotential decrease from 678 to 345 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, CoNS/C displayed an excellent durability upon a longterm measurement. The apparent activation energy measurements revealed that the metal-rich surface contributed to overcome the energy barrier for OER. In addition, density functional theory calculations have been conducted to explain the correlated OER mechanism. This study is expected to provide an effective strategy for the design and the synthesis of highly active metal-nitrogentype electrocatalysts with a high metal loading for various electrocatalytic reactions.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000611066000045	33372775

Especially, the air cathodes with bifunctional catalytic activity,i.e.oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have been received enormous attention. In this work, we provide a novel phosphorus/nitrogen co-doped and bimetallic metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived cathode configurated with phosphorus-doped bimetallic FeNi alloys and a nitrogen-doped porous carbon layer loaded on graphene (P-FeNi/NC@G). The P-FeNi/NC@G electrode exhibits a superior OER activity with an overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and an ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.81 V. With P-FeNi/NC@G as the air cathode, the integrated all-solid-state rechargeable zinc-air battery presents a high open-circuit voltage of 1.53 V, a high peak power density of 159 mW cm(-2), a small charge-discharge voltage gap of 0.73 V at 5 mA cm(-2), as well as excellent long-term stability up to 144 cycles. This work not only expands the air cathode materials database but also develops a new co-doped synthesis method that can be utilized to fabricate a cathode with promoted catalytic efficiency, resulting in improved performance for an all-solid-state zinc-air battery.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2046-2069		WOS:000568227200035	35515043

Surprisingly, Mn-doped FeOOH can significantly modulate the nanosheet morphology to increase the active surface area, boost more active sites, and augment the intrinsic activity by tuning the electronic structure of FeOOH. Due to the 2D nanosheet architecture, the optimized FeMnOOH exhibits superior electrochemical activity and outstanding durability for the oxygen evolution reaction with a low overpotential of 246 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 414 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), and long-term stability for 40 h without decay, which is comparable to the best electrocatalysts for water oxidation reported in the literature. By integrating with semiconductor photoanodes (such as -Fe2O3 nanorod (NR) arrays), bimetallic FeMnOOH catalysts achieve solar-driven water splitting with a significantly enhanced PEC performance (3.36 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) with outstanding long-term stability (approximate to 8 h) compared to that of the bare Fe2O3 NR (0.92 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs RHE).									35	0	0	0	1	0	35			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000439935800012	29966042

Herein, highly efficient and long-term durable OER by coupling B and P into an amorphous porous NiFe-based electrocatalyst is reported, which possesses an amorphous porous metallic bulk structure and high corrosion resistance, and overcomes the issues associated with currently used catalyst nanomaterials. The PB codoping in the activated NiFePB (a-NiFePB) delocalizes both Fe and Ni at Fermi energy level and enhances p-d hybridization as simulated by density functional theory calculations. The harmonized electronic structure and unique porous framework of the a-NiFePB consequently improve the OER activity. The activated NiFePB thus exhibits an extraordinarily low overpotential of 197 mV for harvesting 10 mA cm(-2) OER current density and 233 mV for reaching 100 mA cm(-2) under chronopotentiometry condition, with the Tafel slope harmoniously conforming to 34 mV dec(-1). Impressive long-term stability of this new catalyst is evidenced by only limited activity decay after 1400 h operation at 100 mA cm(-2). This work strategically directs a way for heading up a promising energy conversion alternative.									43	2	0	0	1	0	43			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000477931100003	31148404

Pure-water anion-exchange-membrane (AEM) electrolyzers in principle offer the advantages of commercialized proton-exchange-membrane systems (high current density, low cross over, output gas compression, etc.) while enabling the use of less-expensive steel components and nonprecious metal catalysts. AEM electrolyzer research and development, however, has been limited by the lack of broadly accessible materials that provide consistent cell performance, making it difficult to compare results across studies. Further, even when the same materials are used, different pretreatments and electrochemical analysis techniques can produce different results. Here, we report an AEM electrolyzer comprising commercially available catalysts, membrane, ionomer, and gas-diffusion layers operating near 1.9 V at 1 A cm(-2) in pure water. After the initial break in, the performance degraded by 0.67 mV h(-1) at 0.5 A cm(-2) at 55 degrees C. We detail the key preparation, assembly, and operation techniques employed and show further performance improvements using advanced materials as a proof-of-concept for future AEM-electrolyzer development. The data thus provide an easily reproducible and comparatively high-performance baseline that can be used by other laboratories to calibrate the performance of improved cell components, nonprecious metal oxygen evolution, and hydrogen evolution catalysts and learn how to mitigate degradation pathways.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000718271300012	34374278

Here, cationic vacancies on nickel phosphide, as a proof-of-concept to regulate the catalyst's physicochemical properties, are introduced for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis. The as-fabricated Ni cationic vacancies (V-Ni)-enriched Ni2-xP-V-Ni electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable 2e ORR performance with H2O2 molar fraction of >95% and Faradaic efficiencies of >90% in all pH conditions under a wide range of applied potentials. Impressively, the as-created V-Ni possesses superb long-term durability for over 50 h, suppassing all the recently reported catalysts for H2O2 electrosynthesis. Operando X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and synchrotron Fourier transform infrared (SR-FTIR) combining theoretical calculations reveal that the excellent catalytic performance originates from the V-Ni-induced geometric and electronic structural optimization, thus promoting oxygen adsorption to the 2e ORR favored "end-on" configuration. It is believed that the demonstrated cation vacancy engineering is an effective strategy toward creating active heterogeneous catalysts with atomic precision.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000768812700001	35191113	
J	Helling, C.; Tootill, D.; Woitke, P.; Lee, G.								Dust in brown dwarfs and extra-solar planets V. Cloud formation in carbon- and oxygen-rich environment [arXiv]								arXiv								14 pp.	14 pp.						6 Dec. 2016	2016	Context. Recent observations indicate potentially carbon-rich (C/O>1) exoplanet atmospheres. Spectral fitting methods for brown dwarfs and exoplanets have invoked the C/O ratio as additional parameter but carbon-rich cloud formation modeling is a challenge for the models applied. The determination of the habitable zone for exoplanets requires the treatment of cloud formation in chemically different regimes. Aims. We aim to model cloud formation processes for carbon rich exoplanetary atmospheres. Disk models show that carbon-rich or near-carbon-rich niches may emerge and cool carbon planets may trace these particular stages of planetary evolution. Methods. We extend our kinetic cloud formation model by including carbon seed formation and the formation of C[s], TiC[s], SiC[s], KCl[s], and MgS[s] by gas-surface reactions. We solve a system of dust moment equations and element conservation for a pre-scribed DRIFGamma-PHOENIX atmosphere structure to study how a cloud structure would change with changing initial C/O0=0.43 ... 10.0. Results. The seed formation efficiency is lower in carbon-rich atmospheres than in oxygen-rich gases due to carbon being a very effective growth species. The consequence is that less particles will make up a cloud for C/O0>1. The cloud particles will be smaller in size than in an oxygen-rich atmosphere. An increasing initial C/O ratio does not revert this trend because a much greater abundance of condensible gas species exists in a rich carbon environment. Cloud particles are generally made of a mix of materials: carbon dominates if C/O0>1 and silicates dominate if C/O0<1. 80-90% carbon is reached only in extreme cases where C/O0=3.0 or 10.0. Conclusions. Carbon-rich atmospheres would form clouds that are made of particles of height-dependent mixed compositions, sizes and numbers. The remaining gas-phase is far less depleted than in an oxygen-rich atmosphere. Typical tracer molecules are HCN and C2H2 in combination with a featureless, smooth continuum due to a carbonaceous cloud cover, unless the cloud particles become crystalline.									0	0	0		0	0	0						INSPEC:16849343

We report here the first isolation of an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant with a defect in one of the genes for the 33-kDa proteins, psbO, and an intact gene (psbO2). This mutant showed considerable growth retardation, suggesting that there is a functional difference between psbO and psbO2. (C) 2002 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

J	Jwa, Nam-Soo; Hwang, Byung Kook								Convergent Evolution of Pathogen Effectors toward Reactive Oxygen Species Signaling Networks in Plants								FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE				8						1687	10.3389/fpls.2017.01687				SEP 29 2017	2017	Microbial pathogens have evolved protein effectors to promote virulence and cause disease in host plants. Pathogen effectors delivered into plant cells suppress plant immune responses and modulate host metabolism to support the infection processes of pathogens. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as cellular signaling molecules to trigger plant immune responses, such as pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity. In this review, we discuss recent insights into the molecular functions of pathogen effectors that target multiple steps in the ROS signaling pathway in plants. The perception of PAMPs by pattern recognition receptors leads to the rapid and strong production of ROS through activation of NADPH oxidase Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homologs (RBOHs) as well as peroxidases. Specific pathogen effectors directly or indirectly interact with plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors to induce ROS production and the hypersensitive response in plant cells. By contrast, virulent pathogens possess effectors capable of suppressing plant ROS bursts in different ways during infection. PAMP-triggered ROS bursts are suppressed by pathogen effectors that target mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. Moreover, pathogen effectors target vesicle trafficking or metabolic priming, leading to the suppression of ROS production. Secreted pathogen effectors block the metabolic coenzyme NADP-malic enzyme, inhibiting the transfer of electrons to the NADPH oxidases (RBOHs) responsible for ROS generation. Collectively, pathogen effectors may have evolved to converge on a common host protein network to suppress the common plant immune system, including the ROS burst and cell death response in plants.									76	3	1	0	59	0	78			1664-462X			WOS:000411928100002	29033963

The permanent porosity and the evenly distributed metal components make these porous crystals ideally suited for the synthesis of alloy nanoparticles. Using a laser, these MOFs are converted in air to alloy nanoparticles of binary (FeNi, FeCo), ternary (FeCoNi) and high-entropy-alloys with quinary (MnFeCoNiCu, MnFeCoNiZn) metals. One member, FeNi alloy nanoparticles with a narrow particle size distribution around 7 nm, shows a low overpotential of 282 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), better than those of the single metal counterparts. This demonstrates the possibility of using MOFs to produce alloy nanoparticles with multiple metal components by a laser.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2052-1537		WOS:000842255800001

The adsorbed species after various adsorption times were examined by analyzing the evolution of NO, NO2, CO, CO2, and O-2 during thermal desorption. Emission of NO but not NO2 was observed during the early stage of NO2 adsorption. From the nitrogen and oxygen balance data, we conclude that NO2 adsorption involves the reduction of NO2 to NO driven by oxidation of the carbon surface. The formed NO is either adsorbed on the carbon surface or released as exhaust gas depending on the surface conditions. The adsorbed NO species are released along with O-2 and a small amount of CO2 and CO at temperatures below 150 degrees C during heating. NO2 becomes stable when the carbon surface has been extensively oxidized.									49	4	0	0	10	0	53			0888-5885			WOS:000257150000009

We report a facile and simple route for the preparation of a pure phase nickel phosphide (Ni2P) and phase transformations in the nickel sulfide (NiS) system through a solvent-less synthetic protocol. Decomposition of different sulfur-based complexes (dithiocarbamate, xanthate, and dithiophosphonate) of nickel(II) was investigated in the presence and absence of triphenylphosphine (TPP). The optimization of reaction parameters (nature of precursor, ratio of TPP, temperature, and time) indicated that phosphorus- and sulfur-containing inorganic dithiophosphonate complexes and TPP (1:1 mole ratio) produced pure nickel phosphide, whereas different phases of nickel sulfide were obtained from dithiocarbamate and xanthate precursors in the presence or absence of TPP. A plausible explanation of the sulfide or phosphide phase formation is suggested, and the performance of Ni2P was investigated as an electrocatalyst for supercapacitance and overall water-splitting reactions. The performance of Ni2P with the surface free of any capping agents is not well explored, as common synthetic methods are solution-based routes; therefore, the electrocatalytic performance was also compared with metal phosphides, prepared by other routes. The highest specific capacitance of 367 F/g was observed at 1 A/g, and the maximum energy and power density of Ni2P were calculated to be 17.9 Wh/kg and 6951 W/kg, respectively. The prepared nickel phosphide required overpotentials of 174 and 316 mV along with Tafel slopes of 115 and 95 mV/dec to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000682991300053	34260204

Density functional theory (DFT) study was performed to uncover the evolution mechanism of SOx formation during pyrite oxidation. The results show that chemisorption mechanism is responsible for O-2, SO2 and SO3 adsorption on FeS2 surface. The presence of formed oxidation layer (Fe2O3) weakens the interaction between O-2 molecule and FeS2 surface. The adsorbed O-2 molecule easily dissociates into active surface O atom for SOx formation. The dissociation reaction of O-2 is activated by 77.38 kJ/mol, and exothermic by 138.46 kJ/mol. Compared to the further oxidation of SO2 into SO3, SO2 prefers to desorb from FeS2 surface. The dominant reaction pathway of SO2 formation from the oxidation of the outermost FeS2 surface layer is a three-step process: surface lattice S oxidation, SO2 desorption and replenishment of S vacancy by activated surface O atom. The elementary reaction of surface lattice S oxidation has an activation energy barrier of 197.96 kJ/mol, and is identified as the rate-limiting step. SO2 formation from the further oxidation of bulk FeS2 layer is controlled by a four-step process: bulk lattice S migration, lattice S oxidation, SO2 desorption and surface O atom deposition. Migration of lattice S from bulk position to the outermost surface shows a high activation energy barrier of 175.83 kJ/mol.

J	AGRAWAL, S; MIDKIFF, KC								MODEL PREDICTIONS OF THE EXTENT OF HETEROGENEOUS COAL COMBUSTION DURING RAPID EVOLUTION OF VOLATILES								ENERGY				17	7			669	678		10.1016/0360-5442(92)90074-A				JUL 1992	1992	Two relatively simple, single-particle coal combustion models are developed and used to predict the extent of heterogeneous combustion during rapid devolatilization. The first model uses the flame sheet approximation while the second employs finite gas-phase reaction rates. Both models predict that small particles (< 10-mu-m diameter) bum heterogeneously and large particles (> 100-mu-m diameter) bum homogeneously, but heterogeneous mass loss is severely underestimated by the simpler flame-sheet model in comparison to the more realistic finite-rate-chemistry model for intermediate sized particles typical of a utility grind. Small particle size, high oxygen concentration and low devolatilization rate, in that order of importance, yield more extensive heterogeneous combustion, while temperature, volatiles composition, gas-phase kinetics, and surface reaction rates have negligible impact.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0360-5442			WOS:A1992HV96300005

The chargeability is the most critical in various industrial applications such as smart portable device, electric vehicle, and power storage system. Thus, it is necessary to reduce large overpotential of oxygen reduction/evolution reaction, the irreversibility of Zn anode, and carbonation in alkaline electrolyte.

Temperature-programmed hydrogenation (TPH) was performed to investigate the reactivity of coke deposition after the catalyst was exposed to CH4/He at 1070 K. Coke on Pt/Al2O3 could be hydrogenated around 873 K, while for Pt/ZrO2 this was above 1073 K. The results indicate that the reactivity of coke with hydrogen was higher on Pt/Al2O3 than on Pt/ZrO2, which was different from the reactivity of coke towards CO2. Thus, the reactivity of CO2 was studied and compared on these catalysts by several technics. The amount of CO evolution was measured during CO2 flow at 1070 and 875 K. Rate and amount of converted CO2 were higher on Pt/ZrO2 than on Pt/Al2O3. Pt/ZrO2 was proven to react with CO2 to produce CO and active oxygen (CO2 --> CO + O) (probably on its oxygen defect site) more easily than Pt/Al2O3.									53	0	0	0	2	0	53			1011-372X			WOS:000168585300003

However, it is still a huge challenge to manufacture electrocatalysts with durable and high electrocatalytic performance from biomass. Here, a convenient method of delignification was used to transform natural balsa wood into a layered porous carbon material, FeCo alloy supported on a N, S-doped wood-based carbon aerogel (FeCo@NS-CA) as the cathode in rechargeable flow ZAB. The obtained FeCo@NS-CA with the porous lamellar architecture exhibits superior bifunctional electrocatalysis, including excellent electrochemical activities and superior stabilities. For ORR, relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode, the onset potential of FeCo@NS-CA is 0.97 V, and the half-wave potential is 0.85 V, which is consistent with the potential of commercial Pt/C. For OER, FeCo@NS-CA obtained an overpotential of 450 mV, which is very similar to the overpotential of the benchmark RuO2. The superior performance could be owing to the alloy carrier interaction between the FeCo alloy and the wood-based carbon aerogel co-doped with N and S. Moreover, the bifunctional air cathode in a flow ZAB assembled with the FeCo@NS-CA catalyst at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2); the power density is 140 mW cm(-2), and the specific capacitance is 760 mA h g(Zn)(-1), with a remarkable long-term stability of 400 h better than ZAB of benchmark Pt/C + RuO2. This research lays the foundation for transforming abundant biomass resources into high environmental protection materials for energy-related applications.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000691785200050	34433254

Hitherto, water splitting has been generally achieved using several oxynitrides, oxysulfides, and nitrides, and only a few studies report water splitting using cadmium sulfide (CdS) as a photocatalyst. A major reason for this is that CdS undergoes photocorrosion. In this study, we achieved an overall water splitting under visible light using a CdS/WO3/CdWO4 tricomposite photocatalyst. In the process, photocorrosion of CdS was suppressed by covering it with WO3 and CdWO4, and the oxidation reaction progressed in WO3 by the Z-scheme type photocatalytic reaction.									29	2	0	0	4	0	29			2574-0962			WOS:000458706800009

For the reaction steps involving singlet triplet crossing, transition states were located within the broken-symmetry approach by use of a Becke three-parameter Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP)/triple-zeta phis polarization (TZVP) calculation scheme. For the conceivable attack by O-2 molecule, topologically different inplane, free edge, zigzag, bay, armchair., and C-H site of the coronene molecule and its derivatives were considered. Energetic pro-files of the oxidation cascade revealed that the reaction occurs by a sequence of oxidation and fragmentation steps. For the ekey Steps, the influence of the evolution of free energy with temperature as assessed and discussed. The most demanding stage is the primary dioxygen attack, and the preferred locus is the coronene free-edge site. The key intermediates appearing during the reaction progress feature C=O, C-OH, and COOH moieties, redistribution of the carbon rings, and formation of new carbon oxygen rings, as confirmed additionally by corroborative spectroscopic measurements. The obtained results are discussed in the broader context of the molecular mechanism of soot oxidation.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000351970800013

This enables nanotextured silicon as an effective oxygen-evolution photoanode for water splitting with saturation current density measured near 35 mA cm(-2) under 100 mW cm(-2) (1 sun) illumination. Our approach builds upon simple and scalable processing techniques with silicon to develop corrosion resistant electrodes that can benefit a broad range of catalytic and photocatalytic applications.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000362662100027	26400265

Focusing on the working principal of solar water splitting, including photon absorption and exciton generation in semiconductor, exciton separation and transfer to the surface of semiconductor, and respective electron and hole reactions with absorbed surface species to generate hydrogen and oxygen, this review covers the comprehensive efforts and findings made in recent years on the improvement for the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (STH) determined by a combination of light absorption process, charge separation and migration, and catalytic reduction and oxidation reactions. Critical evaluation is attempted on the strategies for improving solar light harvesting efficiency, enhancing charge separation and migration, and improving surface reactions. Towards the end, new and emerging technologies for boosting the STH efficiency are discussed on multiple exciton generation, up-conversion, multi-strategy modifications and the potentials of organometal hybrid perovskite materials.

What remains debatable is the underlying mechanism leading to the OH center dot generation reactions. Using a comprehensive approach combining X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ab initio calculations, we investigated binding energies and valence band structures of defective pyrite surfaces in an attempt to interrogate pyrite-mediated H2O dissociation in the presence and absence of crystal defects. The results show that, while energetically inhibited on perfect crystal faces, H2O dissociation is thermodynamically favored at defective sites. Furthermore, the formation of surface defects can lead to an energy shift in valence bands and thereby forming two defect states. Simultaneously, interaction between both defect states and water molecules makes the hydroxylation energetically favored on the pyrite surface. The hydroxylation occurs through proton transfer from water to a defective S monomer, resulting in an equivalent to Fe-O(H)center dot center dot center dot H-S equivalent to structure. These findings provide new insight into pyrite-assisted OH center dot formation processes in anaerobic conditions and may be important for understanding prebiotic chemistry and the evolution of early Earth.

However, despite the recent emerging of atomic resolution techniques, there is still a lack of understanding of the precise configuration of the M-N-x single site. For example, metal porphyrins are known to act as catalysts for O-2 and they are indeed good model systems for mimicking M-N-4 sites. In particular, it would be of interest to gain more information on the precise dynamic of the catalytic process at atomic scale, especially in an electrochemical environment, i.e., at electrode/electrolyte interphase. An approach that is becoming more and more consolidated is to combine the information coming from electrochemistry and scanning tunneling microscopy techniques in electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (EC-STM) and the result is that a precise dynamic of the catalytic site at atomic scale can be investigated. This review aims to emphasize the main results and advances of EC-STM in investigating small molecule electrocatalysis and specifically O-2 reduction at metal porphyrins M-N-4 model system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2366-7486			WOS:000803730700001

The obtained catalysts with active Co sites distributed in highly graphitized mesoporous N-doped carbon hollow spheres exhibited outstanding ORR activity with an onset potential of 0.940 V, a half-wave potential of 0.851 V, and a small Tafel slope of 45 mV decade(-1) in 0.1 m KOH solution, which was comparable to that of the Pt/C catalyst (20%, Alfa). More importantly, they showed superior durability with little current decline (less than 4%) in the chronoamperometric evaluation over 60 000 s.

But goethite suffers from an inferior catalytic activity like other iron-based oxides. To enhance its catalytic performance, doping has been applied universally. However, due to the lack of a systematic approach to doping, the choice of dopant element has been carried out without standards. Herein, we provide a comprehensive study on a critical factor to evaluate the activity of an introduced dopant at the goethite surface based on both theoretical investigation and experimental verification. For the pristine goethite, the most dominant surface for OER is determined. To enhance the catalytic property of pristine goethite, transition metals (TM = Cr, Mn, Co, and Ni) are substituted with the surface layer iron atom, and substituted dopants are all confirmed to be the active site of OER The Co-doped goethite has the oxygen-adsorbed state (O*) formation energy near the optimal value. Lowered overpotential in doped goethite mainly originates from the O* formation energy, which is proportional to the occupied p-band center of adsorbed oxygen. To verify the calculation result, pristine and TM-doped goethite is synthesized. The measured overpotential value has the same tendency as the calculated overpotential value.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2574-0962			WOS:000516665300045

In this work, we initially synthesize silver permanganate, AgMnO4 (AMO), nanoparticles (NPs) with Pd-0 through NaBH4 reduction. Subsequently, their surface is further modified using PdOx (x = 1, 1.5, 2) via annealing the AMO/Pd nanocomposite (NComp-1). For the optimization of catalytic properties, the chemical state of oxidic Pd delta+ is modulated by changing the annealing temperature from 160 to 360 degrees C. The electrocatalytic activity of NComp-1 is observed to improve gradually on increasing the temperature, and it reaches a maximum at 260 degrees C. This increase in temperature leads to an increase in the chemical state of Pd delta+ species produced at the AMO-Pd interface. Moreover, a temperature of 260 degrees C provides mixed-valence Pd (0, 2+, 3+), which strongly contributes to excellent OER/HER activities of AMO/PdOx/Pd-260 NComp (NComp-3). However, a temperature of 360 degrees C converts all Pd to Pd4+, which in turn decreases its activity, implying the intrinsic benefit of mixed-valence Pd(delta+ )toward OER/HER. The optimized NComp-3 features enhanced bifunctional properties, exhibiting extremely low overpotentials (eta(10)) (160 mV for OER, 58 mV for HER at 10 mA cm(-2)) with small Tafel slopes (64.9 mV dec(-1) for OER, 37.8 mV dec(-1) for HER). Inspired by the superior bifunctionality, a symmetric alkaline electrolyzer is assembled with NComp-3, which needs only 1.50 V to reach a water-splitting current of 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits remarkable long-term stability. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance may be due to the synergetic effect among AMO, PdOx, and Pd, which distinctively improves the adsorption of reaction intermediates, surface area, electrical conductivity, charge-mass transport, and also stability. Therefore, our work highlights the importance of surface engineering through regulating the surface electronic status and also offers a feasible strategy for synthesizing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for renewable energy applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000631434600044

Nevertheless, the existing synthesis approaches meet issues in terms of time/energy consumption as well as the use/production of toxic materials, so it is highly desired to explore a more facile and controllable green approach for metal sulfide synthesis. Herein, we demonstrated a formamide-assisted approach for the synthesis of six monometallic sulfides (CdS, CuS, NiS2, ZnS, Ag2S, and PbS) and one iron-doped NiS2 (NixFe1-xS2) in nanoscale, offering an ecofriendly, fast, and general strategy in the concepts of green chemistry.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2574-0970		WOS:000635462900007

The experimental results revealed that the electro-chemical processes on the surface of the electrode were apparently influenced by the applied potentials. The electrochemical oxidation rate of Ni( I ) to Ni( I ) increased remarkably with the applied potential at a range of 0.10-0.40 V(vs. Ag/AgCl(1 mol/L KCL)). When the applied potential was higher than 0.4 V, the oxygen evolution reaction occurred simultaneously. The AC impedance measurements on a nickel bulk electrode and a nickel nanowire electrode under the same conditions showed the latter had much greater electrochemical activity and much faster reaction rate in the surface processes.			用交流阻抗法研究了一种新型电极－镍纳米线电极在碱性溶液中的电化学行为，给出了相应的等效电路和拟合效果。实验结果表明，外加电位对电极表面化学反应速度和类型有显著影响。在外加电位不高时，Ni（Ⅱ）氧化成Ni(Ⅲ)的电化学过程随着电位的升高而明显加速；当外加电位高于0．40V以后，电极表面同时发生电化学析氧反应。相同条件下，镍纳米线电极的表面电化学反应速度远远高于镍块体电极。						1	1	0	0	0	0	1			1000-0518			CSCD:1135811

Because of conflicting past reports, the catalytically active metal redox state of the catalyst has remained under debate. Here, we report an in operando quantitative deconvolution of the charge injected into the nanostructured Ni-Fe oxyhydroxide OER catalysts or into reaction product molecules. To achieve this, we explore the oxygen evolution reaction dynamics and the individual faradaic charge efficiencies using operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). We further use X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) under OER conditions at the Ni and Fe K-edges of the electrocatalysts to evaluate oxidation states and local atomic structure motifs. DEMS and XAS data consistently reveal that up to 75% of the Ni centers increase their oxidation state from +2 to +3, while up to 25% arrive in the +4 state for the NiOOH catalyst under OER catalysis. The Fe centers consistently remain in the +3 state, regardless of potential and composition. For mixed Ni100-xFex catalysts, where x exceeds 9 atomic %, the faradaic efficiency of O-2 sharply increases from similar to 30% to 90%, suggesting that Ni atoms largely remain in the oxidation state +2 under catalytic conditions. To reconcile the apparent low level of oxidized Ni in mixed Ni-Fe catalysts, we hypothesize that a kinetic competition between the (i) metal oxidation process and the (ii) metal reduction step during O-2 release may account for an insignificant accumulation of detectable high-valent metal states if the reaction rate of process (ii) outweighs that of (i). We conclude that a discussion of the superior catalytic OER activity of Ni-FeOOH electrocatalysts in terms of surface catalysis and redox-inactive metal sites likely represents an oversimplification that fails to capture essential aspects of the synergisms at highly active Ni-Fe sites.									675	22	0	0	43	0	678			0002-7863			WOS:000375521100026	27031737

To find out coatings with reasonable service life for application in electrolysis devices, changes in the firing temperature, heating time and supporting electrolyte have been investigated. Surface morphology and microstructure have been investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). SEM data show that the mud-crack structure is progressively lost with the substitution of titanium by lead oxides. EDS results suggest that lead segregates, forming islands with a high content of Pb. Changes in crystallinity have been obtained with an increase in the lead content. Electrochemical analyses have been carried out in acid medium (HClO4 1.0 mol dm(-3) and H2SO4 0.5 mol dm(-3)). Cyclic voltammetric data and quasi-steady-state polarization curves have been recorded and accelerated life tests have been performed with an anodic current of 400 mA cm(-2). High coating stability has been obtained with the electrode fired at 550degreesC.

Therefore, the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts to be used in urine-mediated electrolyzers for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is required. In this work, nitrogen-doped iron phosphorus trisulfide (FePS3) nanosheets were prepared, which performance surpassed platinum on carbon electrocatalysts at large current densities above 140 mA cm(-2), exhibiting excellent HER performance. A low overpotential of 756 mV was observed for UOR to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). When configured for hydrogen production, the urea electrolysis cell delivered a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.26 V, which is about 0.28 V lower than in conventional water electrolysis. The development of FePS3-based materials as bifunctional electrocatalysts provides a new approach enabling energy-saving hydrogen production.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000809300600001

Recent studies have demonstrated that H-accreting white dwarfs (WDs) in a binary system exploding as type Ia supernovae could be an efficient p-process source beyond iron. However, both observational evidence and stellar models challenge the required frequency of these events. In this work, we calculate the evolution and nucleosynthesis in slowly merging carbon-oxygen WDs. As our models approach the Chandrasekhar mass during the merger phase, the 22Ne(alpha,n)25Mg neutron source reaction is activated in the external layers of the primary WD, where the carbon-rich material accreted from the secondary WD is burned via the 12C+12C reaction, which provides the necessary alpha-particles via the 12C(12C,alpha)20Ne channel. The resulting neutron capture abundance distribution closely resembles a weak s-process one and peaks at Zr, which is overproduced by a factor of 30 compared to solar. The mass of the most external layers enriched in first-peak s-process elements crucially depends on the 12C+12C reaction rate, ranging between 0.05 Modot and ~0.1 Modot. These results indicate that slow white dwarf mergers can efficiently produce the lightest p-process isotopes (such as 74Se, 78Kr, 84Sr, 92Mo and 94Mo) via gamma-induced reactions if they explode via a delayed detonation mechanism, or eject the unburned external layers highly enriched in first peak s-process elements in the case of a pure deflagration. In both cases, we propose for the first time that slow WD mergers in binary systems may be a new relevant source for elements heavier than iron.					16th International Symposium on Nuclei in the Cosmos (NIC-XVI)16th International Symposium on Nuclei in the Cosmos (NIC-XVI)	21-25 Sept. 202121-25 Sept. 2021		Chengdu, ChinaChengdu, China	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2100-014X			INSPEC:21617809

The sample merges the LNA survey and that by Koppen et al. Average oxygen sulfur, and argon abundances are derived from different age groups of the progenitors. Sulfur and argon have increasing abundances following the metallicity. However, the oxygen abundance seems to be 0.2 dex lower than the solar value of type I planetaries, whose progenitors are not older than 1-2 Gyr. This oxygen deficiency in type I nebulae agrees with abundance determinations in H II regions, intermediate-mass supergiants, and B stars in young associations. We suggest two possible scenarios to explain these data: (1) recent infalling gas from the halo, have abundance ratios similar to those expected from Type I supernovae; or (2) a relative increase in the last 5-6 Gyr of Type I supernova frequency with respect to massive type II events.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			0004-637X			WOS:A1993KJ46800023

Here, a novel metal-organic framework assisted approach to synthesize 3D hierarchical porous NiFe-oxides nanoflowers modified with amorphous carbon network (NiFeOx@C) is reported. In the first step, NiFe-LDH-MOF nanoflowers with tunable Ni/Fe ratios are formed via facile solvothermal methods. Subsequently, a simple annealing treatment is adapted to prepare 3D hierarchical porous NiFeOx@C nanoflowers. Due to the advantages of composition, exclusive structure and synergetic effect, the as-derived porous NiFeOx@C nanoflowers catalysts exhibit small overpotential of 227 and - 186 mV for the reaction of oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution to drive +/- 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Most significantly, NiFeOx@C parallel to NiFeOx@C water splitting electrolyzer reaches a lower cell potential of 1.59 V than that of noble metal electrolyzer RuO2 parallel to Pt/C (1.64 V) at 50 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the electrocatalytic principle is investigated with particular emphasis on the synergetic effects of nickel and iron as well as active species during water splitting process. This study suggests a promising tactics for designing high active and durable bifunctional catalysts for energy conversion utilization. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The synthesized NiCoB@C catalyst exhibited porous and partially amorphous metallic structure depending on its composition, as analysed by XRD, XPS, and TEM; thus, NiCoB@C catalyst showed a high catalytic activity for urea oxidation reaction as well as hydrogen evolution reaction. The required cell voltage in the electrolysis cell with NiCoB@C as anode and cathode was as low as 1.34 V for the current densities 10 mA cm(-2). Similar performance of the urea electrolysis for H-2 production using 0.33 M urea and a fresh urine in 1 M KOH was observed. The result indicated that NiCoB could be incorporated on to carbon felt by electroless plating, and it could be used as freestanding bifunctional electrodes for urea electrolysis using urea as well as urine.

It is catalyzed by the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) and the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. Whereas PFOR reduces ferredoxin, the PDH complex utilizes NAD(+). Anaerobes rely on PFOR, which was replaced during evolution by the PDH complex found in aerobes. Cyanobacteria possess both enzyme systems. Our data challenge the view that PFOR is exclusively utilized for fermentation. Instead, we show, that the cyanobacterial PFOR is stable in the presence of oxygen in vitro and is required for optimal photomixotrophic growth under aerobic and highly reducing conditions while the PDH complex is inactivated. We found that cells rely on a general shift from utilizing NAD(H)- to ferredoxin-dependent enzymes under these conditions. The utilization of ferredoxins instead of NAD(H) saves a greater share of the Gibbs-free energy, instead of wasting it as heat. This obviously simultaneously decelerates metabolic reactions as they operate closer to their thermodynamic equilibrium. It is common thought that during evolution, ferredoxins were replaced by NAD(P)H due to their higher stability in an oxidizing atmosphere. However, the utilization of NAD(P)H could also have been favored due to a higher competitiveness because of an accelerated metabolism.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			2050-084X			WOS:000765659400001	35138247

Herein, we prepared uniformly distributed ultra-small PtPd alloyed nanoparticles (PtPd ANPs, similar to 5 nm) within a robust three-dimensional nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (3D-N-rGO) under hydrothermal conditions. L-Hydroxyproline was employed as reductant, N-doping and swelling agent for 3D-N-rGO. The size and shape of graphene hydrogels were easily adjusted by controlling the reaction temperature, and the formation mechanism was discussed in details. Then, the product was explored for ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The catalytic activity of PtPd ANPs/3D-N-rGO towards HER is close to the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst, and better than that of Pt/C in the case of EGOR. This study has shed some lights on the universal approach to develop next-generation catalysts, which is of great significance for direct alcohol fuel cells. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The scarcity of noble metals impedes the practice of such technology at a commercial scale. To replace noble metal electrocatalysts with non-expensive and abundant materials is critical for the practical application of this technology. Herein, we report a novel approach to fabricate 1D nitrogen-doped carbon coated ternary NiCo2O4 nanorods (NiCo2O4@NC) derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which display a low overpotential (eta approximate to 296 mV @10 mA cm(-2)), a small Tafel slope (53 mV dec(-1)) and excellent durability for OER in an alkaline medium, which is higher than for a commercially available Ir/C electrocatalyst (eta approximate to 350 mV @10 mA cm(-2)). Such higher electrochemical properties can be primarily attributed to the high electrochemical surface area, the synergistic effect from chemical compositions and the unique mesoporous architecture with a support of nitrogen-doped carbon species. The proposed strategy for the controlled design and fine-tuning of MOF derived functional materials provides projections for producing remarkably active and stable electrocatalysts in electrochemical energy devices. This work presents a meaningful approach to understanding the effect of morphological engineering on electrocatalytic OER activity.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2052-1553			WOS:000669577600001

Gas phase uranium, aluminum, and iron atoms were cooled from 5000 K to 1000 K over short-time scales (Delta t < 30 ms) at atmospheric pressures in the presence of excess oxygen. In-situ emission spectroscopy is used to measure the variation in monoxide/atomic emission intensity ratios as a function of temperature and oxygen fugacity. Condensed oxide nanoparticles are collected inside the reactor for ex-situ analyses using scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM) to determine their structural compositions and sizes. A chemical kinetics model is also developed to describe the gas phase reactions of iron and aluminum metals. The resulting sizes and forms of the crystalline nanoparticles (FeO-wustite, eta-Al2O3, UO2, and alpha-UO3) depend on the thermodynamic properties, kinetically-limited gas phase chemical reactions, and local redox conditions. This work shows the nucleation and growth of metal oxide particles in rapidly-cooling gas is closely coupled to the kinetically-controlled chemical pathways for vapor-phase oxide formation.									11	0	0	0	3	0	11			2045-2322			WOS:000438190200028	29992989

Herein, we deposited catalytically active MoS2 flakes onto black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets to construct the MoS2-BP interfaces. In this case, electrons flew from BP to MoS2 in MoS2-BP nanosheets because of the higher Fermi level of BP than that of MoS2. MoS2-BP nanosheets exhibited remarkable HER performance with an overpotential of 85 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Due to the electron donation from BP to MoS2, the exchange current density of MoS2-BP reached 0.66 mA cm 2, which was 22 times higher than that of MoS2. In addition, both the consecutive cyclic voltammetry and potentiostatic tests revealed the outstanding electrocatalytic stability of MoS2-BP nanosheets.

Notwithstanding, the explicit use of strain to affect the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is rarely reported. In this Perspective, we highlight the opportunity to use strain to affect the activity and selectivity of CO2RR electrocatalysts. We summarize the existing challenges in isolating the influence of strain from convoluting factors (e.g., size, shape, electronic, and surfactant effects) that result from typical methods of inducing strain. We also propose ways to isolate strain effects using the application of mechanical strain to thin-film CO2RR catalysts. We designed this Perspective to motivate the use of joint empirical and computational studies to investigate CO2RR strain-activity-selectivity relationships.									63	3	0	0	2	0	63			2380-8195			WOS:000464889300026

Simultaneous co-doping of nitrogen and fluorine heteroatoms to porous carbon matrix derived from spent coffee grounds is synthesized and studied for their structural and electrochemical properties. Microscopic analysis of N-F co-doped coffee carbon (N-F/CC) undergoes morphological evolution in its textural properties includes geometrical surface area, pore structure and defects associated with them, features responsible for creating active sites toward ORR activity. N-F/CC catalyst exhibits excellent ORR catalytic activity, methanol and carbon monoxide tolerance in both acidic and alkaline media which makes it highly potential as metal-free oxygen reduction reaction catalyst for polymer electrolyte fuel cell. The developed catalyst is subjected to 10,000 repeated potential cycles in both media and is stable with no degradation in ORR activity. XPS analysis of N-F/CC catalyst revealed the presence of N in the forms of pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N, active species and F in the forms of C-F ionic and C-F semi-ionic active forms. Co-existence of all these active species induces the maximum C-C bond polarization, charge re-distribution and high spin densities in the carbon matrices and synergistically ORR activity.

This paper introduces a facile method to fabricate bifunctional photocatalysts toward the water splitting by doping nano CdS with S vacancies on Ni@NiO nano-spheres. A serious of photocatalytic catalysts were developed and subsequently characterized, the two half-reactions of photocatalytic water splitting were studied in detail by using sacrificial agents, the hydrogen output at 41699 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) (AQE 28.5%, lambda = 420 nm) while the evolution of O-2 is as high as 55120 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) (AQE 35.7%, lambda = 450 nm). It is a strategy that the presence of Ni@NiO can trigger the S vacancy in CdS to act as an effective electron trap, the p-n junction of NiO-CdS, as well as the Schottky barrier between NiO and Ni, can change the dynamic characteristics of photogenerated electrons and prolong their life. These prolonged photogenerated electrons can initiate stable and effective photocatalytic redox reactions.									30	2	0	0	2	0	30			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000537151400004

Herein, a new synthetic process is proposed to prepare Ni3S4 particles embedded in N,P-codoped honeycomb porous carbon aerogels (Ni3S4/N,P-HPC) through a hydrogel approach. The preparation of Ni3S4/N,P-HPC begins with the sol-gel polymerization of tripolyphosphate, chitosan, and guanidine polymer that contains metal-binding sites, allowing for the uniform incorporation of Ni ions into the gel matrix, freeze-drying, and subsequent carbonization under an inert atmosphere. This synthesis resolves difficulties in synthesizing the pure Ni3S4 phase caused by the instability of Ni3S4 at high temperature, while affording good control of the porous structure and N,P-doping of carbon aerogels. The synergy between the structural advantages of N,P-carbon aerogels (such as easily accessible active sites, high specific surface area, and excellent electron transport) and the intrinsic electrochemical properties of Ni3S4 result in the outstanding OER performance of Ni3S4/N,P-HPC, with overpotentials as low as 0.37 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The work outlined herein offers a simple and effective method for the development of carbon-based electrocatalysts for renewable energy conversion.									31	0	0	0	3	0	31			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000470787200023	30969448

Herein, we report for the first time the growth of crystalline Cu3P phosphide nanosheets on conductive nickel foam (Cu3P@NF) for electrocatalytic and visible light-driven overall water splitting. Our results show that the Cu3P@ NF electrode can be used as an efficient Janus catalyst for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For OER catalysis, a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) requires an overpotential of only similar to 320 mV and the slope of the Tafel plot is as low as 54 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH. For HER catalysis, the overpotential is only similar to 105 mV to achieve a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, overall water splitting can be achieved in a water electrolyzer based on the Cu3P@NF electrode, which showed a catalytic current density of 10 mA/cm(2) under an applied voltage of similar to 4.67 V. The same current density can also be obtained using a silicon solar cell under similar to 1.70 V for both the HER and the OER. This new Janus Cu3P@NF electrode is made of inexpensive and nonprecious metal based materials, which opens new possibilities based on copper to exploit overall water splitting for hydrogen production. To the best of our knowledge, such high performance of a copper-based water oxidation and overall water splitting catalyst has not been reported to date.									183	5	0	0	6	0	183			1944-8244			WOS:000392909500029	28008761

Hydrogen-bonded water-containing networks are often found in enzymes to assist proton transfer, but similar strategy has been rarely presented by synthetic catalysts. We herein report the Co corrole 1 with an appended crown ether unit and its boosted activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Crystallographic and H-1 NMR studies proved that the crown ether of 1 can grab water via hydrogen bonds. By using protic acids as proton sources, the HER activity of 1 was largely boosted with added water, while the activity of crown-ether-free analogues showed very small enhancement. Inhibition studies by adding 1) external 18-crown-6-ether to extract water molecules and 2) potassium ion or N-benzyl-n-butylamine to block the crown ether of 1 further confirmed its critical role in assisting proton transfer via grabbed water molecules. This work presents a synthetic example to boost HER through water-containing networks.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000738000300001	34913230

Herein, we report the synthesis of an N-enriched hierarchically porous carbon electrocatalyst, which demonstrated excellent overall oxygen electrode activity (Delta E = E-OER,E-10 - E-ORR,E-1/2 of 0.770 V) and impressive durability in 0.1 M KOH. The activity of our material integrates a high BET surface area (1547.13 m(2) g(-1)), accessible N dopant and suitable porous architectures. The material is formed by mixing cicada sloughs with ZnCl2, as the inorganic pore-fabricating agent, with ball milling followed by annealing treatment. Unexpectedly, the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) with excellent production yield (NH3: 15.7 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) cat., faradaic efficiency: 1.45%) and selectivity is achieved at -0.2 V vs. RHE under ambient conditions. The present trifunctional catalytic activities are markedly better than leading results reported in recent literature. These results highlight the significance of deliberate structural engineering in the preparation of multifunctional electrocatalysts for versatile electrochemical reactions.									93	9	0	0	5	0	95			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431621700049

On each step of the light-driven oxygen evolving reaction, YZ radical is formed by a chlorophyll cation radical. YZ radical is then reduced by a Mn4CaO5 cluster in a proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction. YZ is hydrogen bonded to His190-D1 and to water molecules in a hydrogen-bonding network, involving calcium. This network is sensitive to disruption with ammonia and to removal and replacement of calcium. Only strontium supports activity. Here, we use electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to define the influence of ammonia treatment, calcium removal, and strontium/barium substitution on YZ radical PCET at two pH values. A defined oxidation state of the metal cluster (S-2) was trapped by illumination at 190 K. The net reduction and protonation of YZ radical via PCET were monitored by EPR transients collected after a 532 nm laser flash. At 190 K, YZ radical cannot oxidize the Mn4CaO5 cluster and decays on the seconds time scale by recombination with Q(A)-. The overall decay half-time and biexponential fits were used to analyze the results. The reaction rate was independent of pH in control, calcium-reconstituted PSII (Ca-PSII). At pH 7.5, the YZ radical decay rate decreased in calcium-depleted (CD-PSII) and barium/strontium-reconstituted PSII (Ba-PSII, Sr-PSII), relative to Ca-PSII. At pH 6.0, the YZ radical decay rate was not significantly altered in CD-PSII and Sr-PSII but decreased in Ba-PSII. A two-pathway model, involving two competing proton donors with different pKa values, is proposed to explain these results. Ammonia treatment decreased the YZ decay rate in Ca-PSII, Sr-PSII, and CD-PSII, consistent with a reaction that is mediated by the hydrogen-bonding network. However, ammonia treatment did not alter the rate in Ba-PSII. This result is interpreted in terms of the large ionic radius of barium and the elevated pKa of barium-bound water, which are expected to disrupt hydrogen bonding. In addition, evidence for a functional interaction between the S-2 protonated water cluster (W-n(+)) and the YZ proton donation pathway is presented. This interaction is proposed to increase the rate of the YZ PCET reaction.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1520-6106			WOS:000400534200009	28409634

This anode shows high overvoltage for oxygen evolution, long service lifetime and excellent electrocatalytic degradation efficiency. The influence of several operating parameters on the conversion paired electrocatalytic degradation of p-DNB and COD removal efficiency has been examined. The results showed that the degradation and COD removal of p-DNB reached up to 100% and 98%, respectively. The most important part of this study is to propose a novel mechanism for electrochemical degradation of p-DNB. We discovered that both anodic and cathodic reactions are responsible for mineralization of p-DNB. Accordingly, we propose a convergent paired electrocatalytic degradation mechanism based on the reduction of p-DNB at the cathode and oxidation of cathodically generated p-diaminobenzene at the anode surface for electrochemical mineralization of p-DNB.									82	0	0	0	21	0	82			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000496897000017

The stress-induced surface strain effect can alter binding strength between the surface active sites and reactants as well as their intermediates, and the electrochemical performance of bimetallic NCs can be significantly facilitated by the lattice-strain modification via their morphologies, sizes, shell-thickness, surface defectiveness as well as compositions. In this review, an overview of fundamental principles, characterization techniques, and quantitative determination of the surface lattice strain is provided. Various strategies and synthesis efforts on creating lattice-strain-engineered bimetallic NCs, including the de-alloying process, atomic layer-by-layer deposition, thermal treatment evolution, one-pot synthesis, and other efforts are also discussed. It is further outlined how the lattice strain effect promotes electrochemical catalysis through the selected case studies. The reactions on oxygen reduction reaction, small molecular oxidation, water splitting reaction, and electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reactions are focused. In particular, studies of lattice strain arisen from core-shell nanostructure and defectiveness are highlighted. Lastly, the potential challenges are summarized and the prospects of lattice-strain-based engineering on bimetallic nanocatalysts with suggestion and guidance of the future electrocatalyst design are envisioned.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000682472500001	34363320

Co-3(PO4)(2) displays an ultralow overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with 48.5 mV dec(-1) Tafel slope that outperforms the state-of-the-art Ir/C in OER due to its high intrinsic activity. Meanwhile, Co9S8 exhibits the highest HER performance known to the authors among the synthesized Co-based catalysts, showing the lowest overpotential of 361 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with 95.8 mV dec(-1) Tafel slope in the alkaline medium and producing H-2 gas with approximate to 500 mmol g(-1) h(-1) yield rate under -0.45 V versus RHE. The identified surface reactive intermediates over in situ electrochemical-Raman spectroscopy reveal that cobalt(hydr)oxides with higher oxidation states of Co-cation forming under oxidizing potentials on the electrode-electrolyte surface of Co-3(PO4)(2) facilitate the OER, while Co(OH)(2) facilitate the HER. Notably, the fabricated two-electrode electrolyzers using Co-3(PO4)(2), Co3O4, and Co9S8 electrocatalysts deliver the cell potentials approximate to 2.01, 2.11, and 1.89 V, respectively, at 10 mA cm(-2).

Such design involves simple synthetic process of using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as sacrificial precursor. The uniform cubic-shaped H-Co2P/Co-NC/CNT hybrid is investigated with several intriguing advantages, including improved structural integrity, superior electronic conductivity, hollow architecture and large specific surface area and so on. The as-synthesized H-Co2P/Co-NC/CNT displays excellent lithium storage behaviour in terms of long cycle life (> 500 cycles), remarkable rate performance (up to 5 A g(-1)), high reversible capacity (601 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1)) and high pseudocapacitance behavior. Besides, it also delivers a superior catalytic property for OER with a small Tafel slope of 45.3 mV dec(-1) and overpotential of 256 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)). The excellent performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect between Co2P/Co and NC/CNT, leading to enhanced conductivity through high pseudocapacitance contribution. This present work demonstrates that MOF-derived H-Co2P/Co-NC/CNT hybrid is a promising candidate for high-performance multifunctional energy systems.

Nevertheless, to combine a polymer electrolyte water electrolyzer (PEMWE) and a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEMFC) is still a big challenge. Here, it is necessary to overcome several practical and structural features. For instance, the oxygen reduction (ORR) and the water oxidation (OER) are the limiting reaction steps at the oxygen electrode for PEMFC or PEMWE, respectively. Therefore, its high-efficiency depends on the type of electrocatalysts and the capability of the oxygen electrode to operate under the PEMFC or PEMWE conditions. As a consequence, a broad research is focused on developing a new design for the oxygen electrode in URFCs. In this work, several bifunctional electrodes for OER and ORR were designed by mixing electrocatalysts of Pt and IrO2 or Pt and RuO2 supported on Ebonex (R). Electrochemical characterization by CV, LV and EIS in aqueous 0.5 M H2SO4 reveals that IrO2-Pt and RuO2-Pt supported on Ebonex (R), exhibit high electrocatalytic properties for ORR and OER showing up a possible use in URFCs. In addition, IrO2 based electrodes display a higher stability than those based on RuO2.					10th International Congress of the Mexican-Hydrogen-Society10th International Congress of the Mexican-Hydrogen-Society	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Mexican Hydrogen SocMexican Hydrogen Soc	Toluca, MEXICOToluca, MEXICO	19	0	0	0	0	0	19			1480-2422	2292-1168		WOS:000282999200011

However, their low specific surface area is the main obstacle to realizing a high mass-specific activity that is required to be competitive against the state-of-the-art precious metal-based catalysts. We report the enhanced performance of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-(delta) (BSCF) for the OER with intrinsic activity that is significantly higher than that of the benchmark IrO2, and this result was achieved via fabrication of an amorphous BSCF nanofilm on a surface-oxidized nickel substrate by magnetron sputtering. The surface nickel oxide layer of the Ni substrate and the thickness of the BSCF film were further used to tune the intrinsic OER activity and stability of the BSCF catalyst by optimizing the electronic configuration of the transition metal cations in BSCF via the interaction between the nanofilm and the surface nickel oxide, which enables up to 315-fold enhanced mass-specific activity compared to the crystalline BSCF bulk phase. Moreover, the amorphous BSCF-Ni foam anode coupled with the Pt-Ni foam cathode demonstrated an attractive small overpotential of 0.34 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for water electrolysis, with a BSCF loading as low as 154.8 mu g cm-(2).									150	8	0	0	10	0	150			2375-2548			WOS:000406370700038	28691090	
J	Shi, Hongwei; Yin, Xiong; Hua, Yani; Gao, Zhan								MnO nanoparticles loaded on three-dimensional N-doped carbon as highly efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				47	47			20507	20517		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.04.171				JUN 1 2022	2022	It is very important to develop non-noble metal electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to replace noble metal electrocatalysts to promote the large-scale application of fuel cells. Here, three-dimensional (3D) N-doped carbon supported MnO nanoparticles (MnO/NC) are prepared by two-step pyrolysis method. The MnO/NC performs excellent catalytic activity comparable to 20% Pt/C for ORR, for instance, a positive onset potential (0.92 V), half-wave potential (0.82 V) and peak potential (0.76 V). The MnO/NC shows a strong tolerance to methanol and long-term stability in an alkaline media. The high ORR activity of MnO/NC owes to its unique property of fast electron transport, high specific surface areas and the synergistic effect between MnO and 3D NC support. This study projects an innovative strategy to construct electrocatalysts of 3D structure composites, which is expected to offer efficient non-noble metal electrocatalysts for ORR.

In this work, three-dimensional (3D) beta-PbO2/Ta2O5 and Pt/Ta3N5 samples with a rod-like morphology were successfully fabricated and coupled to carry out electrochemical ozone production (EOP) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Moreover, the results on the in-situ electrodegradation of dimethoate also indicate that the beta-PbO2/Ta2O5 NRs show a great potential to be used in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) applications. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the excellent EOP performance of the beta-PbO2/Ta2O5 NRs can be attributed to the adsorption energy of the O species, which can be modulated via the synergic effect between beta-PbO2 and Ta2O5. This work provides a reference for the development of stable electrocatalysts with high efficiency for the simultaneous production of O-3 and H-2 in environmental applications and energy conversion.									17	0	0	0	4	0	17			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000517665200038

Therefore, it is of great strategic significance to study new food sterilization technology. An acidic electrolyzed water (AEW) disinfectant is an electrochemical sterilization technology which has the characteristics of wide adaptability, high efficiency, and environmental friendliness. However, since the sterilization efficiency of AEW for biofilrns is not ideal, it is necessary to increase the available chlorine content (ACC) in AEW. A feasible method to increase the ACC is by increasing the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) selectivity of the electrode for AEW preparation. In this paper, the RuO2@TiO2 electrode was prepared by thermal decomposition combined with high-vacuum magnetron sputtering. Compared with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of an ordinary RuO2 electrode, the OER activity of the RuO2@TiO(2 )electrode is significantly reduced. However, the CER activity of the RuO2@TiO2 electrode is close to the OER activity of RuO2. The CER mechanism of the RuO2@TiO2 electrode is the second electron transfer, and the OER mechanism is the formation and transformation of OHads. The potential difference between the CER and OER of the RuO2@TiO2 electrode is 174 mV, which is 65 mV higher than that of the RuO(2 )electrode, so the selectivity of the CER of the RuO2@TiO2 electrode is remarkably improved. During the preparation of AEW, the ACC obtained with the RuO2@TiO2 electrode is 1.7 times that obtained with the RuO2 electrode. In the sterilization experiments on Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis biofilms, the logarithmic killing values of AEW prepared the by RuO2@TiO2 electrode are higher than those of AEW prepared by the RuO2 electrode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-1343			WOS:000820004500001	35847312

Accordingly, a simple and effective strategy is developed to synthesize layered NixCo2x(OH)(6x) nanosheets using dual three-dimensional Ni as structural and conductive support system. Owing to highly electrical conductivity, rich of interconnected ion/electron transport pathways, and robust structure stability, NixCo2x(OH)(6x)@Ni electrode exhibits remarkably high specific capacitance, excellent rate capability, and superior cycle stability. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor assembled by NixCo2x(OH)(6x)@Ni and activated carbon/carbon nanotube achieves a large working voltage window of 1.5 V, a high energy density ( approximate to 44.2 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 750 W kg(-1)) and outstanding long-term cycle ability (remaining 100% of the initial C-sp after 5000 cycles). Furthermore, the NixCo2x(OH)(6x)@Ni as an oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst shows small onset overpotential (263 mV), low Tafel slope (78 mV dec(-1)), large anodic current density of 30 mA cm(-2) at a low over potential of 336 mV and prominent electrochemical durability.

In addition to low Tafel slope (32.6 mV per decade), the Co7Se8 OER electrocatalyst also exhibited very low overpotential to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) (0.26 V) which is lower than other transition metal chalcogenide based OER electrocatalysts reported in the literature and significantly lower than the state-of-the-art precious metal oxides. A low Tafel slope (59.1 mV per decade) was also obtained for the HER catalytic activity in alkaline electrolyte. The OER catalytic activity could be further improved by creating arrays of 3-dimensional rod-like and tubular structures of Co7Se8 through confined electrodeposition on lithographically patterned nano electrodes. Such arrays of patterned nanostructures produced exceptionally high mass activity and gravimetric current density (similar to 68 000 A g(-1)) compared to the planar thin films (similar to 220 A g(-1)). Such high mass activity of the catalysts underlines reduction in usage of the active material without compromising efficiency and their practical applicability. The catalyst layer could be electrodeposited on different substrates, and an effect of the substrate surface on the catalytic activity was also investigated. The Co7Se8 bifunctional catalyst enabled water electrolysis in alkaline solution at a cell voltage of 1.6 V. The electrodeposition works with exceptional reproducibility on any conducting substrate and shows unprecedented catalytic performance especially with the patterned growth of catalyst rods and tubes.									127	4	0	0	8	0	127			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000379794100034	27309595

FPO contains both monomer and polymer compounds which rich in oxygen, giving high acidity and low stability. Hydrogen demanding reaction of depolymerization and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), often called upgrading, is required to improve FPO properties by converting these compounds to hydrocarbon monomers. APR reaction of glycerol where glycerol is reacted with water to produce hydrogen is one of the renewable choices to obtain hydrogen. Prior to upgrading of FPO, catalyst screening and reaction optimization were studied using phenol as a model compound. Upgrading of FPO with in situ glycerol APR was conducted with Pt/C, facilitating hydrogen production (APR) and utilization (hydrogenation), and HZSM-5, facilitating dehydration reaction. n-Decane was added to the reaction as a co-solvent to prevent the condensation of the non-polar fragments of FPO which led to coke formation. Upon upgrading the weight average molecular weight (Mw), polydispersity index (PDI), and oxygen to carbon (O/C) ratio of FPO decreased. The highest hydrocarbon yield (7.7% FPO basis or 34.6% lignin basis) was obtained by combining Pt/C and HZSM-5 catalysts with n-decane as a co-solvent. Evidence of progressive depolymerization and sequential demethoxylation, hydrogenation, and deoxygenation during upgrading were observed in the products.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000809727200002

This ability, combined with a tremendous number of accepted substrates, makes P450s powerful biocatalysts. Sixty years after their discovery, P450 systems are recognized as essential bio-bricks in synthetic biology approaches to enable production of high-value complex molecules in recombinant hosts. Recent impressive results in protein engineering led to P450s with tailored properties that are even able to catalyze abiotic reactions. The introduction of P450s in artificial multi-enzymatic cascades reactions and chemo-enzymatic processes offers exciting future perspectives to access novel compounds that cannot be synthesized by nature or by chemical routes.									134	7	0	0	66	0	139			0167-7799	1879-3096		WOS:000474720000011	30739814

Herein, a series of modifications to a nanorod structure hematite, to be used as anode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting reactions is designed. Ti doping, oxygen vacancy formation by N-2 treatment, TiO2 passivation, and FeOOH cocatalyst decoration are explored for their roles and contributions to the improvement of the PEC water oxidation performance. It is found that Ti doping and N-2 treatment can greatly increase the charge carrier density, which has boosted the photocurrent. TiO2 passivation enhances the photovoltage, resulting in a cathodic shift in the onset potential (approximate to 170 mV with respect to prepassivation). Further, the FeOOH cocatalyst decoration improves the reaction kinetics, thereby improving the overall photoassisted water oxidation performance.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000686925800001

However, the phase which is more NRR active still remains a puzzle. This work presents a theoretical study on the NRR activity of the (001), (100), (101), and (110) surfaces of both anatase and rutile TiO2. We found that perfect surfaces are not active for NRR, while the oxygen vacancy can promote the reaction by providing excess electrons and low-coordinated Ti atoms that enhance the binding of the key intermediate (HNN*). The NRR activity of the eight facets can be unified into a single scaling line. The anatase TiO2(101) and rutile TiO2(101) surfaces were found to be the most and the second most active surfaces with a limiting potential of -0.91 V and -0.95 V respectively, suggesting that the TiO2 NRR activity is not very phase-sensitive. For photocatalytic NRR, the results suggest that the anatase TiO2(101) surface is still the most active facet. We further found that the binding strength of key intermediates scale well with the formation energy of oxygen vacancy, which is determined by the oxygen coordination number and the degree of relaxation of the surface after the creation of oxygen vacancy. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the activity of TiO2 surfaces. The results should be helpful for the design of more efficient TiO2-based NRR catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000874126000001	36195557

It is well established that oxidation of organics at BDD anodes takes place in the potential region of oxygen evolution, through reaction steps in which OH radicals are involved: these radicals can react with organic compounds to give more oxidised substances, or with water to give oxygen. Because of the high reactivity of OH radicals these reactions are confined to a thin film adjacent to the electrode surface. A mathematical model was implemented, which accounts for chemical and electrochemical reactions, as well as for the transport phenomena involved in the process: the parameters of the model were derived from experimental data. The model allowed calculation of the trend with time of reactant concentration, reaction intermediates and oxidisable agents: their space profiles in the reactor were also obtained. The numerical predictions of the model were compared with experimental results obtained from galvanostatic electrolyses of different organic compounds: (a) 2,4,6-trihydroxy-1,3,5 triazine also known as cyanuric acid (CA), which is well known to be refractory to oxidation with OH; (b) atrazine (ATR) the most oxidisable precursor of CA, and (c) phenol which is considered as an OH scavenger because of its high reactivity. The agreement between experimental and model predicted data was good in all the examined conditions.					7th European Symposium on Electrochemical Engineering7th European Symposium on Electrochemical Engineering	OCT, 2005OCT, 2005		Toulouse, FRANCEToulouse, FRANCE	59	2	0	0	26	0	59			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000243046600011

Despite the advances in electrocatalysts, how to combine active sites to synergistically promote both steps and understand the underlying mechanism remain largely unexplored. Here, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations predict that NiO accelerates the Volmer step while metallic Ni facilitates the Heyrovsky/Tafel step. A facile strategy is thus developed to control Ni/NiO heterosurfaces in uniform and well-dispersed Ni-based nanocrystals, targeting both reaction steps synergistically. By systematically modulating the surface composition, we find that steering the elementary steps through tuning the Ni/NiO ratio can significantly enhance alkaline HER activity, and Ni/NiO nanocrystals with a Ni/NiO ratio of 23.7% deliver the best activity, outperforming other state-of-the-art analogues. The results suggest that integrating bicomponent active sites for elementary steps is effective for promoting alkaline HER, but they have to be balanced.									101	5	0	0	7	0	103			2095-5138	2053-714X		WOS:000519816200009	34692014

Herein, the iron phthalocyanine (FePc)-based nanostructures are synthesized via the graphene-assisted colloid chemical reaction for the first time. Compared to the commercial Pt/C for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the optimal FePc/graphene nanostructure exhibits not only more positive onset potential (E-onset, 1.000 vs 0.973 V) and half-wave potential (Delta E-1/2 = 100 mV), but also better stability and durability in alkaline solution. The corresponding zinc-air battery also shows better the maximum power density. The systematical characterizations prove the axial coordination between FePc and graphene via Fe-O-C bond and the formation of Fe(II) Pc/Fe(III) Pc/graphene nanostructures. The comprehensive analysis and simulated calculation reveal the synergistic ORR catalysis of four-and five-coordinated Fe atoms in these samples. This work provides a new insight into the synthesis and application of metal-organic complex for metal single-atom catalysis.									90	3	0	0	8	0	90			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000427924000041		
J	Wen, Wei; Du, Xiaoqiang; Zhang, Xiaoshuang								Controlled synthesis of M doped N-Ni3S2 (M = Cu, Fe, Co and Ce) on Ni foam as efficient electrocatalyst for urea oxidation reaction and oxygen evolution reaction								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				918						165739	10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.165739				OCT 15 2022	2022	Replacing fossil fuels by electrocatalytic water splitting for producing hydrogen and oxygen is one of the most promising ways to solve the energy crisis and environmental pollution. In this work, a series of M doped N-Ni3S2 (M = Cu, Fe, Co and Ce) material was firstly synthesized and in situ grown on nickel foam substrate by a typical two-step hydrothermal synthesis method. Two probe reactions, water oxidation and urea oxidation, were selected to investigate the catalytic performance of these materials. What is note-worthy is that the Fe doped N-Ni3S2 material exhibits superior water oxidation properties with requiring only 270 mV of overpotentials to drive current densities of 100 mA cm & minus;2, which is one of the best activities reported so far. After a long time of durability measurement, the current density of the Fe doped N-Ni3S2 material will be attenuated, suggesting that the surface of the material will be in situ oxidized to oxide or hydroxide, which is the true active species. For urea oxidation, the Co doped N-Ni3S2 material shows su-perior catalytic performance with requiring only 1.36 V potentials to drive 100 mA cm & minus;2 current densities. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that different adsorption energy of water for N-Ni3S2, N-Cu-Ni3S2, N-Fe-Ni3S2 and N-Co-Ni3S2 leads to the different catalytic activity. Experimental results de-monstrate that the improved catalytic performance is assigned to faster electron transfer rates, exposure of abundant active center and better conductivity due to N and cation doping. This work provides new lessons for doping engineering for water splitting reactions. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, the complexity of bifunctionality increases difficulties for effective material design, thus hindering the large-scale hydrogen generation. Herein, we present the rationally designed synthesis of superhydrophilic Ni-based multicomponent arrays (Ni NCNAs) composed of 1D nanorod-confined-nanoflakes (2D), which only needs -26 mV of working potential and 47 mV of overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for HzOR and HER, respectively. Impressively, this Ni NCNA electrode exhibits the top-level bifunctional activity for overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) with an ultralow voltage of 23 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a record-high current density of 892 mA cm(-2) at just 0.485 V, also achieves the high-speed hydrogen yield driven by a waste AAA battery for OHzS.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000632821200001	33768679

Hydrogen energy is recognized as one of the clean energy sources. Water is considered as the largest potential supplier of hydrogen energy. However, artificial catalytic water splitting for hydrogen and oxygen evolution has not been widely used due to its high energy consumption and high cost during catalytic cracking. Therefore, the exploitation of photocatalysts, electrocatalysts, and photo-electrocatalysts for rapid, cost effective, and reliable water splitting is essentially needed. Polyoxometalates (POMs) are regarded as the potential candidates for water splitting catalysis. In addition to their excellent catalytic properties and reversibly redox activities, POMs can also modify semiconductors to overcome their shortcomings, and improve photoelectric conversion efficiency and photocatalytic activity, which has attracted more and more attention in the field of photoelectric water splitting catalysis. In this review, we summarize the latest applications of POMs and semiconductor composites in the field of photo-electrocatalysis (PEC) for hydrogen and oxygen evolution by catalytic water splitting in recent years and take the latest applications of POMs and semiconductor composites in photocatalysis for water splitting. In the conclusion section, the challenges and strategies of photocatalytic and PEC water-splitting by POMs and semiconductor composites are discussed.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				2073-4344		WOS:000642877600001

Taking inspiration from the mechanistic selectivity of reactions such as the 2e(-) versus 4e(-) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), we explore how to fine-tune catalysts for hydrazine synthesis through the 4e(-) electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) over the popular 6e- NRR used for ammonia synthesis. Optimal 4e(-) NRR performance requires sufficient activity as well as selectivity over 6e(-) NRR, other mechanistic NRR branching points, and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, we perform first-principles calculations in conjunction with uncertainty quantification on various monometallic and single-atom alloy surfaces to study the activity and selectivity of 4e(-) NRR. Through free energy diagrams, estimation of scaling relations, and a theoretical activity volcano, we observe that catalysts exhibiting low activity due to weak binding for NH3 favor hydrazine synthesis. We also find that single-atom alloys follow the same scaling relations as monometallic surfaces. Through uncertainty quantification, we form distributions of limiting potentials and establish a correlation between the activity of a catalyst with the skewness of its limiting potential distribution. We further quantify the uncertainty of first-principles calculations for branching points within 4e(-) NRR. Reaction branching point analysis reveals the difficulty of overcoming the HER for weakly binding catalysts and the affinity toward 6e(-) NRR for stronger binding catalysts. This underlines the significant challenges of pushing NRR toward hydrazine synthesis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000834340600001

Herein, Ag@MxFe3-xO4 (M = Co, Mn) core-shell nanoparticles were firstly synthesized through a seed-mediated method. These particles were then loaded onto carbon catalyst supports to form Ag@MxFe3-xO4/C. Then, hollow-MxFe3-xO4/C was prepared with the diffusion of Ag from Ag@MxFe3-xO4/C in saturated NaCl solution at room temperature. As a result, Ag@MxFe3-xO4/C demonstrates better oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity than Ag@Fe2O4/C and other Ag@MxFe3-xO4/C with various Mn/Fe ratios. Moreover, Ag@MxFe3-xO4/C shows superior ORR catalytic activities over hollow-MxFe3-xO4/C, which can be due to electronic coupling between Ag core and MFe2O4 shell. Furthermore, Ag@MxFe3-xO4/C catalysts demonstrate high durability for the ORR in alkaline media and insensitivity to methanol. These findings will provide helpful guidance for design and fabrication of carbon-supported core-shell catalysts for ORR in the future. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The activity of these materials was extremely enhanced when a platinum counter electrode was used instead of a graphite rod and reached the level of commercial Pt/C electrodes. Postreaction scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of electrode surfaces revealed that incorporation of even extremely low amounts of Pt resulted in this considerable gain of HER activity. High resolution XPS analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that pyridinic nitrogen atoms act as active sites for Pt coordination and deposition. The Pt can be incorporated in both molecular (Pt2+) and metallic (Pt-0) form. This study shows that great caution must be taken when designing metal-free HER catalysts based on N-doped carbons.									41	1	0	0	1	0	42			1944-8244			WOS:000382179400048	27441591

The photoinduced production of H2O2 in subchloroplast PS II particles is suppressed by inhibitors of electron transfer between the primary (Q(A)) and secondary (Q(B)) quinone accepters of PS II (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea, o-phenanthroline) or scavengers of O-2 (nitroblue tetrazolium or cytochrome c). The rate of photoinduced production of H2O2 in subchloroplast PS II particles depends on pH and is maximal at pH 8.5 (4.5 mu moles H2O2/mg Chl per hour). The photoinduced production of H2O2 in isolated reaction center complexes is 0.1 H2O2 molecule per reaction center per saturating flash. This reaction is suppressed by K-15, an inhibitor of electron transfer in PS II, which accelerates the charge recombination in the ion-radical pair [P680(+)Pheo(-)]. The photoinduced production of H2O2 at the acceptor side of PS II is a result of the interaction between molecular oxygen and reduced electron accepters of PS II (pheophytin and plastoquinone Q(B)).									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			0006-2979			WOS:A1997WZ83700003

The electrolyte may have critical amounts of dissolved metal ions that can decrease the hydrogen production overvoltage, increasing water loss and decreasing its electrical performance. In the present work, the influence of Cu2+, Mn2+ and Fe3+ ions present in reused electrolytic solutions on the hydrogen evolution potential in the negative electrode was investigated. An assumption of the physicochemical action of these contaminants was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance. The results showed that all the metal ions displace the potential of hydrogen evolution to less cathodic values, indicating that these species must have their concentrations minimized to allow acid solution reuse in lead-acid batteries without significant loss of performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000582095500001

In this study, a highly efficient electrocatalysts of metal ferrites (MFe2O4, M = Co, Ni, Zn, Cu) with superior activity and durability are successfully fabricated on copper substrate through a facile co-precipitation method followed by doctor-blading deposition. The electrocatalytic performance of CoFe2O4, NiFe2O4, ZnFe2O4 and CuFe2O4 electrodes for hydrogen evolution reaction is studied in alkaline media using polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Among them, CoFe2O4 presented the best electrocatalytic activities for HER with extremely low overpotentials of 270 mV (vs. RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. The electrocatalytic activity of MFe2O4 (M = Co, Ni, Zn, Cu) for HER to generate current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with low overpotential followed the order of CoFe2O4 > CuFe2O4 > NiFe2O4 > ZnFe2O4. The highly improved HER performance of CoFe2O4 is mainly due to a large number of exposed active sites, high electrical conductivity and low apparent activation energy, which are confirmed by a remarkable electrochemically active surface area (ECSA = 53.17 cm(2)), Nyquist plots analysis and Arrhenius plots measurement, respectively. Moreover, the CoFe2O4 electrode showed outstanding electrocatalytic stability even after 1000 cyclic voltametry tests. These results provide a promising avenue for developing cost-effective and high-efficiency electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant transition metal ferrite as advanced electrodes for large-scale energy conversion processes.

Compared with water electrolysis, urea electrolysis presents a more promising prospect in the way that it could carry out sewage treatment as well as energy-efficient hydrogen production at the same time. Herein, highly porous pomegranate like Ni/C was synthesized from multivariate metal-organic frameworks and exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution activity with an unprecedented low overpotential of 40 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, ranking among the best earth abundant electrocatalysts deposited on glassy carbon electrodes reported to date. In addition, it also displays superb anodic urea oxidation activity with an onset potential of 1.33 V vs RHE. Furthermore, a two-electrode urea electrolyzer with Ni/C as both the cathode and anode electrocatalyst was fabricated and generates 52 times more hydrogen than the water electrolyzer under the same conditions.									94	2	0	0	4	0	94			1944-8244			WOS:000424851600042	29308870

Herein, a class of composite FeNi@MXene (Mo2TiC2Tx)@nickel foam (NF) has been synthesized through introducing Fe2+ ions and in-situ combining with surface nickel atoms on nickel foam. The obtained FeNi@Mo2TiC2Tx@NF exhibited high activity with overpotentials of 165 and 190 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), respectively. The synergetic effects of Mo2TiC2Tx and FeNi nanoalloys lead to increasing catalytic activities, where MXene provides high active surface area and rich active sites for HER, and FeNi nanoalloys promote the OER. Theoretical simulation of electron exchange capacity between FeNi and MXene in FeNi@Mo2TiC2Tx catalyst shows that electrons transferred from surface Mo atoms to the interface between FeNi and MXene, indicating that the electrons are accumulated near the FeNi nanoparticles. This kind of electronic distribution facilitates the formation of intermediate of NiOOH. Correspondingly, (H+ + e(-)) is more inclined onto Mo-Ni interfaces for HER. The Gibbs free energy changes for H* to HER and potential-limiting step for -OOH intermediate in OER over FeNi@Mo2TiC2Tx are much less than those on bare MXene. The catalyst can be further used for overall water splitting in alkaline solution, realizing a current density of 50 mA.cm(-2) at 1.74 V. This work provides a facile strategy to achieve efficient and cheap catalysts for new energy production.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000669798300004

Cells produce ROS during normal metabolism reactions, but ROS production increases under stressful conditions. Improving the antioxidant system in cultivated plants will increase their tolerance to abiotic stresses, such as salinity, drought and cold. However, the biochemical components of the system are redundant, for each reaction is catalyzed by a series of enzymes encoded by different genes. Choosing the most perspective components of this system will help speed up evaluating the optimal breeding strategy for improving abiotic stress tolerance in economically valuable plants. In the present research article, we present the results of an integrative analysis of evolution- and expression-related characteristics. The work was carried out on a series of genes that belong to 4 functional groups (APX, GPX, SOD and CAT) of enzymatic components of the antioxidant defense system in six species of C-3 cereal plants and 3 species of C-4 cereal plants. As a result, 25 groups of orthologous genes were evaluated and described. The highest gene expression level and the greatest pressure of purifying selection were found to characterize six groups. These genes were chosen for further verification and use in breeding. Because these genes undergo the most conservative evolution and have the highest level of mRNA expression, we may assume that they contribute a lot to the antioxidant system functioning of the C-3 and C-4 cereal plants studied. We have shown that the integration of evolutionary characteristics and expression data represents a promising approach to predict target genes for plant breeding.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			2500-0462	2500-3259		WOS:000432214800016

Considering that mixing can influence the RCCE state, the key objective is to assess the accuracy and numerical performance of the method in simulations involving both reaction and mixing. The RCCE formulation includes rate equations for constraint potentials, density and temperature, which allows taking account of mixing alongside chemical reaction without splitting. The RCCE is a dimension reduction method for chemical kinetics based on thermodynamics laws. It describes the time evolution of reacting systems using a series of constrained-equilibrium states determined by RCCE constraints. The full chemical composition at each state is obtained by maximizing the entropy subject to the instantaneous values of the constraints. The RCCE is applied to a spatially homogeneous constant pressure partially stirred reactor ( PaSR) involving methane combustion in oxygen. Simulations are carried out over a wide range of initial temperatures and equivalence ratios. The chemical kinetics, comprised of 29 species and 133 reaction steps, is represented by 12 RCCE constraints. The RCCE predictions are compared with those obtained by direct integration of the same kinetics, termed detailed kinetics model ( DKM). The RCCE shows accurate prediction of combustion in PaSR with different mixing intensities. The method also demonstrates reduced numerical stiffness and overall computational cost compared to DKM.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0340-0204	1437-4358		WOS:000386265800001

Identifying design principle that links material properties to the catalytic activity can accelerate the search for highly active and abundant transition-metal-oxide catalysts to replace platinum. Here, we demonstrate that the ORR activity for oxide catalysts primarily correlates to sigma*-orbital (e(g)) occupation and the extent of B-site transition-m covalency, which serves as a secondary activity descriptor. Our findings reflect the critical influences of the sigma* orbital and metal-oxygen covalency on the competition between O-2(2-)/OH- displacement and OH- regeneration surface transition-metal ions as the rate-limiting steps of the ORR, and thus highlight the importance of electronic structure in controlling oxide catalytic activity.									1962	95	0	0	114	1	1992			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000291979700013	21697876

Herein, we show that cobalt pentlandite (Co9S8) nanoparticles can serve as an electrochemically active, noble-metal-free material toward hydrogen evolution reaction, and they work stably in neutral solution (pH 7) but not in acidic (pH 0) and basic (pH 14) media. We, therefore, further present a carbon-armoring strategy to increase the durability and activity of Co9S8 over a wider pH range. In particular, carbon-armored Co9S8 nanoparticles (Co9S8@C) are prepared by direct thermal treatment of a mixture of cobalt nitrate and trithiocyanuric acid at 700 degrees C in N-2 atmosphere. Trithiocyanuric acid functions as both sulfur and carbon sources in the reaction system. The resulting Co9S8@C material operates well with high activity over a broad pH range, from pH 0 to 14, and gives nearly 100% Faradaic yield during hydrogen evolution reaction under acidic (pH 0), neutral (pH 7), and basic (pH 14) media. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a transition-metal chalcogenide material is shown to have all-pH efficient and durable electrocatalytic activity. Identifying Co9S8 as the catalytically active phase and developing carbon-armoring as the improvement strategy are anticipated to give a fresh impetus to rational design of high-performance noble-metal-free water splitting catalysts.									280	16	0	0	15	0	283			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000348085200118	25535924

Here, we employ ab initio density functional theory calculations to investigate how the selectivity and reactivity of SnO2 surfaces toward the CO2RR change at varying surface stoichiometry (i.e., reduction degree). Our results show that SnO2(110) surfaces are not catalytically active for the CO2RR or hydrogen evolution reaction, but rather they reduce under an applied external bias, originating surface structures exposing few metal tin layers, which are responsible for formic acid selectivity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000848107000001

We also followed the Al distribution within individual NCA particles by X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The progression of these phases as a function of distance from the edge shows simultaneous evolution of crystal structures and chemistry from rocksalt to layered, forming a complete solid solution. We have also observed an extended disordered phase with rocksalt (Fm (3) over barm) symmetry in which quantitative electron energy loss spectroscopy reveals it to be an oxygen deficient cation disordered phase with chemical characteristics, as determined by EELS, similar to spinel. The formation of these disordered phases with cation and oxygen vacancies has been driven by surface oxygen loss caused by reactions with the electrolyte followed by cation migration from the octahedral 3a M (M = Ni, Co, Al) layer to the octahedral 3b Li layer. These surface rocksalt phases are not fully dense as they contain Al and Li as well as a high concentration of cation and oxygen vacancies. After discharge, Li is detected within these phases indicative that Li transport has occurred through these rocksalt phases. At 60 degrees C and 4.75 V a very large impedance rise is observed leading to complete cell irreversibility which is caused by significant metal dissolution from the cathode and formation of surface porosity. In the near surface region of some particles, a phase transformation from R (3) over barm (03) to P (3) over bar m1 (O1) is also observed which has become thermodynamically stable from complete delithiation as well as from local Al surface depletion.									31	6	0	0	0	0	33			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000453489300005

Herein, flower-like MoSe2 has been employed as the co-catalyst to couple with cubic CdS nanoparticles for the in-situ construction of MoSe2/CdS heterojunction photocatalysts. Experimental investigations suggest that the photogenerated electrons can transfer across a space charge region between the MoSe2/CdS through the SeMoeSe bonding, resulting in faster charge carriers separation and hence more long-lived electrons to participate in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). These insights are also supported by density functional theory (DFT)-based theoretical calculation. The dynamics of the photo-excited electrons was also investigated by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, MoSe2 can afford more active sites for absorbing the protons for H-2-evolution reactions, thereby accelerating the sluggish hydrogen evolution kinetics. Therefore, under visible-light irradiation, a remarkably enhanced photocatalytic H-2 generation has been achieved in the MoSe2/CdS heterojunction (4.7 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) compared to mechanically mixed sample (3.3 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) and Pt-decorated CdS (1.3 mmol g(-1) h(-1)). The external quantum efficiency of the MoSe2/CdS heterojunction toward HER has been determined to be 15.6% at 450 nm. This work not only provides a rational design for utilizing abundant elements to develop high-performance photocatalysts, but also pave the way to understand the photogenerated carriers transfer dynamics.

By chemical analysis method, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy spectrum analysis (EDS), the reaction rules between simulated CO_2 and the aluminum liquid were studied; the diffusion transfer of generated aluminum oxide (Al_2O_3) in the aluminum liquid and the effect law of the precipitation process of aluminum liquid with Al_2O_3; the morphology and distribution of alumina inclusion in aluminum were also analyzed. Molecular dynamics method was used to simulate the process of reaction of CO_2 and aluminum liquid generating Al_2O_3, and the energy that CO_2 and aluminum liquid reaction and diffusion of oxidation products needed and the key point influencing dispersion were calculated; the corresponding structure and dynamic properties were obtained; the law of interaction between CO_2 and aluminum liquid was revealed from the microscopic mechanism brought. The obtained results of the test of CO_2 and aluminum liquid reaction and mass transfer showed that adding CO_2 to aluminum liquid brings aluminum liquid alumina inclusion, and inclusion was the basis of hydrogen dissolution and hydrogen evolution in the aluminum liquid; the path of CO_2 and aluminum reaction: CO_2 molecule was finally dissolved into CO molecule and oxygen atom, and oxidized aluminum crystal by oxygen atom.

However, its evolution is not. We focus here mainly on some of the history of its biophysical aspects. We have arbitrarily divided here the 1941-2016 period into three sub-periods: (a) Origin of the concept of two light reactions: first hinted at, in 1941, by James Franck and Karl Herzfeld; described and explained, in 1945, by Eugene Rabinowitch; and a clear hypothesis, given in 1956 by Rabinowitch, of the then available cytochrome experiments: one light oxidizing it and another reducing it; (b) Experimental discovery of the two light reactions and two pigment systems and the Z-scheme of photosynthesis: Robert Emerson's discovery, in 1957, of enhancement in photosynthesis when two light beams (one in the far-red region, and the other of shorter wavelengths) are given together than when given separately; and the 1960 scheme of Robin Hill & Fay Bendall; and (c) Evolution of the many versions of the Z-Scheme: Louis Duysens and Jan Amesz's 1961 experiments on oxidation and reduction of cytochrome f by two different wavelengths of light, followed by the work of many others for more than 50 years.

The convex shape of the bubble focuses the shock and generates regions of high pressure and temperature, which are sufficient to ignite the diluted stoichiometric H-2-O-2 gas mixture inside the bubble. We study the interaction between hydrodynamic instabilities and shock-induced reaction waves at a shock Mach number of Ma = 2.83. The chosen shock strength ignites the gas mixture before the shock-focusing point, followed by a detonation wave, which propagates through the entire bubble gas. The reaction wave has a significant influence on the spatial and temporal evolution of the bubble. The misalignment of density and pressure gradients at the bubble interface, caused by the initial shock wave and the subsequent detonation wave, induces Richtmyer-Meslikov and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The growth of the instabilities is highly affected by the reaction wave, which significantly reduces mixing compared to an inert shock-bubble interaction. A comparison with two-dimensional simulations reveals the influence of three-dimensional effects on the bubble evolution, especially during the late stages. The numerical results reproduce experimental data in terms of ignition delay time, reaction wave speed and spatial expansion rate of the bubble gas. We observe only a slight divergence of the spatial expansion in the long-term evolution. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Several versatile characterization techniques including spectroscopic and electrochemical methods were used to investigate the nanocomposite. The behavior of the electrocatalysts with respect to supercapacitor application and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were investigated in acetic acid solution (pH 4.8) and alkaline media, respectively using voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and chronoamperometry methods. Results showed that the [PW11MO39](5-)@ Ru-rGO (M: Co, Ni, and Cu) electrodes towards supercapacitor application have a high specific capacitance (705, 624 and 568 F g(-1) for Cu, Co and Ni, respectively), highest energy density of 99.05 relating to power density of 294.93, highest power density of 2400 corresponding to energy density of 28.13 and long life cycling.

Density functional theory calculations were used to systematically explore the potential of O-terminated V2C MXene (V2CO2)-supported transition metal (TM) SAs, including a series of 3d, 4d, and 5d metals, as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts. The combination of TM SAs and V2CO2 changes their electronic structure and enriches the active sites, and consequently regulates the intermediate adsorption energy and catalytic activity for ORR and HOR. Among the investigated TM-V2CO2 models, Sc-, Mn-, Rh-, and Pt-V2CO2 showed high ORR activity, while Sc-, Ti-, V-, Cr-, and Mn-V2CO2 exhibited high HOR activity. Specifically, Mn- and Sc-V2CO2 are expected to serve as highly efficient and cost-effective bifunctional catalysts for fuel cells because of their high catalytic activity and stability. This work provides theoretical guidance for the rational design of efficient ORR and HOR bifunctional catalysts. (C) 2021, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

With an average diameter of 10-30 nm, the CNCs are composed of graphene layers encapsulating a hollow core. A gas diffusion electrode (GDE) made of CNCs revealed a much enhanced i-V polarization response than that of Vulcan XC72. However, its performance was moderately lower than that of Black Pearls 2000. In addition, the CNCs were impregnated with nanoparticles of Ag, MnOx and CoOx . The i-V and galvanostatic results of the catalyzed CNCs indicated significant improvements over that of noncatalyzed CNCs. For example, a Ag-CNC derived GDE was capable of delivering 1.03 and 0.88 V at current densities of 100 and 200 mA cm(-2), respectively. Our study offers direct evidence that the CNCs not only exhibit unique electrocatalytic abilities but also function superbly as an electrocatalyst support.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000254089800011

The deposited AgCat is composed of mixed valence crystalline Ag oxides with the presence of particle aggregates whose size is similar to 1 mu m. This catalyst, coupled with TiO2 and hematite, and under photoelectrochemical conditions, substantially increases photocurrents in a wide range of applied potentials compared with bare and Co-Pi-modified photocatalysts. AgCat can sustain current densities comparable with other water oxidation catalysts. Dark bulk electrolysis demonstrated that AgCat is stable and can sustain high turnover number in operative conditions. Oxygen evolution from water occurs in mild conditions: pH = 2-13, room temperature and pressure, and moderate overpotentials (600 mV) compatible with the coupling with semiconducting oxides as sensitizers. Using hematite in sustained electrolysis O-2 production is significant, both in the dark and under irradiation, after an initial slow induction time in which modification of surface species occurs.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1944-8244			WOS:000406172700056	28660756

Therefore, the design and synthesis of highly active, low-cost, and stable electrocatalysts for the OER is the greatest challenge in electrochemical water splitting. Here, an amorphous heterogeneous NiFe-LDH@Co(OH)(2)@NF with abundant active sites is fabricated by a step-wise electrodeposition technique. Firstly, Co(OH)(2) is directly deposited onto nickel foam (NF) substrate by a electrodeposition technique. Secondly, NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) is further covered on the surface of Co(OH)(2) to obtain the heterogeneous NiFe-LDH@Co(OH)(2)@NF electrocatalyst. The thickness of NiFe-LDH can be controlled by changing the time of electrochemical deposition. Benefiting from the amorphous structure and the positive synergies between NiFe-LDH and Co(OH)(2), the optimized NiFe-LDH@Co(OH)(2)@NF-300 shows high electro-catalysis activity. In the 1 M KOH solution, the overpotential for OER is only 130 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)). Remarkably, serving as a bifunctional electrode in alkaline electrolyzer, it only needs 1.6 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The work provides a simple and viable technical solution for fabricating non-noble electrocatalysts with excellent performance for electrochemical water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000705777400003

Herein, we develop a novel vapor-phase hydrothermal growth strategy for in situ synthesis of ultrathin cobalt-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67)nanosheets grown on the surface of Co(OH)(2) nanosheets vertically aligned on electrochemically exfoliated graphene (EG) foil. Ultrathin ZIF-67 nanosheets with a thickness of similar to 5 nm are uniformly coated on the surface of a Co(OH)(2) nanosheet array to form a 2D core-shell structure. Benefitting from the strong coupling and synergistic effects, the resulting EG/Co(OH)(2)/ZIF-67 hybrid exhibits excellent catalytic activity for the OER in alkaline electrolytes, which only requires an overpotential of 280 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a low Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1) and high stability. Such high OER performance for the EG/Co(OH)(2)/ZIF-67 hybrid is superior to that of commercial Ir/C catalysts and even better than that of all previously reported ZIF-based OER electrocatalysts. In situ Raman analyses demonstrate that under OER conditions, the Co-O species are converted into Co-OOH groups, which are responsible for the excellent catalytic activity of EG/Co(OH)(2)/ZIF-67 in the OER.									71	4	0	0	4	0	71			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448412000017

A recent analysis of 7Li observations in halo stars, using significantly higher surface temperature for these stars, found a higher Li plateau abundance. These results go a long way toward resolving the discrepancy with BBN. Here we examine the implications of the higher surface temperatures on the abundances of Be and B that are thought to have been produced in galactic cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis by spallation of CNO together with Li ( produced in alpha+alpha collisions). While the Be abundance is not overly sensitive to the surface temperature, the derived B abundances and more importantly the derived oxygen abundances are very temperature-dependent. If the new temperature scale is correct, the implied increased abundances of these elements pose a serious challenge to models of galactic cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis and galactic chemical evolution.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000228445500038

Part 2. - Electrochemically grown hydrous iridium oxide								JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				774				102	110		10.1016/j.jelechem.2016.05.015				AUG 1 2016	2016	Hydrous iridium oxide is a well-known material for its electrochromism and electrocatalytic activity, e.g. in oxygen and chlorine evolution reactions ( OER) and (CER). Poor durability during the OER is, however, usually considered as a major drawback. In the current work dissolution of hydrous oxide, prepared from metallic iridium by applying a potential cycle protocol of different number of cydes, has been investigated using a scanning flow cell (SFC) inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) based setup. It is shown that in the potential region preceding the OER, dissolution behavior of such electrodes. is very similar to that of metallic iridium discussed in Part I. It is suggested that at anodic potentials the process is controlled by oxidation of metallic iridium underneath a hydrous oxide, with formation of a thin compact anhydrous oxide layer sandwiched between metal and hydrous oxide. The application of a reductive potential results in the reduction of the compact oxide layer and also leads to dissolution. At these potentials some dissolution of hydrous oxide itself is postulated. Decomposition of iridium (V) oxyhydroxide with formation of molecular oxygen and Ir(III) complexes is suggested at higher anodic potentials during OER. We hypothesize that formation of the soluble Ir(III) complex or complexes and their dissolution is responsible for the observed variation of dissolution with potential in the whole studied potential window. Based on the experimental results and an extended literature overview, a new mechanism of OER triggered dissolution is proposed. The difference in activity and stability of electrochemically prepared hydrous oxides and, usually more stable, "dry" oxides is suggested to be a consequence of different OER mechanisms on these materials.

Nevertheless, efficient and straightforward methodologies to obtain superior and stable electrodes need to be implemented to approach this technology to real applications. Recently, self-supported catalysis emerged as a promising solution. However, catalyst design is still limited by the low chemical tunability and elevated preparation times and costs. Herein, a solution combustion (SC) methodology is described to produce designed self-supported electrocatalysts that excel in the OER and mitigate previous limitations. M-doped NiO-based electrocatalysts (with M = Fe, Co, Mn, and Zn) were self-supported by the SC method on nickel foam, and overperformed analogous benchmarked catalysts prepared by other methods. Notably, in Fe-doped NiO, the overpotential required to drive the OER at 10 mA cm(-2) was found to be 190 mV, the lowest reported so far for metal oxide electrocatalysts at pH 13. By the combination of spectroelectrochemical (SEC) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), we studied the role of the metal dopant cation, showing that dopant metals assist the formation of the active species responsible for the high (electro)catalytic activity. We envision that the presented simple, cost-time efficient methodology would stimulate the preparation and study of effective self-supported metal-oxide catalysts for a broad range of applications.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000651514200001

Ultra-small PtNi nanoparticles of several nanometers in size are densely dispersed on every CNF, along with a few larger nanoparticles with sizes of several decades of nanometers. The as-prepared catalysts can be directly used as an electrode and act as high-efficiency materials for water splitting, including HER and OER. For HER activity, the PtNi/CNFs reach 10 mA cm(-2) current density at low overpotentials of 34 mV and exhibit a small Tafel slope of 31 mV dec(-1) in acidic electrolytes of 0.5 M H2SO4, which is close to that of commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) electrocatalytic catalysts. In 1 M KOH solution, the PtNi/CNFs also exhibit excellent HER activity with a low overpotential of 82 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 34 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the PtNi/CNFs also show good activity for OER in alkaline electrolyte of 1 M KOH with a Tafel slope of 159 mV dec(-1) and a small overpotential of 151 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, the OER performance of the PtNi/CNFs in acid media is also favorable, with a 198 mV dec(-1) Tafel slope. The decent activity of the PtNi/CNFs for water splitting originates from the synergistic effects of using Pt and Ni, large amounts of ultra-small nanoparticles densely dispersed on the CNFs, high conductivity of the support materials and interconnected three-dimensional structures of the carbon nanofiber mats.									35	3	0	0	4	0	36			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000408320100010

This study reports that tin oxide (SnOx) layers applied to n-Si wafers after forming a thin chemically oxidized SiOx layer can passivate the Si surface while producing approximate to 620 mV photovoltage under 100 mW cm(-2) of simulated sunlight. The SnOx layer makes ohmic contacts to Ni, Ir, or Pt films that act as precatalysts for the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 m KOH(aq) or 1.0 (M) H2SO4(aq). Ideal regenerative solar-to-O-2(g) efficiencies of 4.1% and 3.7%, respectively, are obtained in 1.0 m KOH(aq) with Ni or in 1.0 m H2SO4(aq) with Pt/IrOx layers as OER catalysts. Stable photocurrents for >100 h are obtained for electrodes with patterned catalyst layers in both 1.0 (M) KOH(aq) and 1.0 m H2SO4(aq).									25	1	0	0	3	0	25			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000442731100015

About 10 nm-sized carbon shell and a 5 nm-sized Pd catalyst over an MTOx-3DG support is established by the facile green chemical approach. The C-Pd-MTOx-3DG nanoarchitectured catalyst possesses excellent electrocatalytic activity with the peak current density of 23.8 mA/cm(2) for ethylene glycol electrooxidation. In addition, MTOx-3DG support material helps to remove the poisonous intermediates formed during the ethylene glycol electrooxidation. We addressed this point by suitable method in which about 80% of the poisonous compounds are removed, with the help of a supporting material at higher forward potential regions. In addition to that the formation of Pd adatoms and synergism of mixed metal atoms helped to effectively oxidize the fuel. The physical and chemical analyses show that the prepared C-Pd-MTOx-3DG electrocatalyst is nanostructured, with excellent catalytic activity, better intermediate tolerance, and sound long-term stability of the catalyst, attributed to the uniform dispersion of the Pd QDs and excellent interaction between the noble metal catalyst and the support.

Herein, we report the synthesis of robust cobalt phosphate nanoparticles (NPs) decorated with nitrogen-doped carbon layers (denoted as Co-3(PO4)(2)@N-C) using O-phospho-DL-serine as both phosphate and carbon sources by hydrothermal treatment. The obtained Co-3(PO4)(2)@N-C catalyst exhibits a remarkable electrocatalytic performance for the OER in alkaline media. A current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is generated at a overpotential of only 317 mV with a small Tafel slope of 62 mV per decade in 1 M KOH electrolyte, which is even superior to those of state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts such as benchmark IrO2 catalysts. Notably, the Co-3(PO4)(2)@N-C electrode shows excellent stability evaluated by 1000 potential cycles and operation with a high current density at a fixed potential for 8 h, which is highly desirable for a promising electrocatalyst The excellent activity can be attributed to the unique network structure of materials, a large number of active sites and good conductivity under catalytic conditions. Our findings imply the possibility for the development of robust and cost-efficient cobalt phosphate as a promising candidate to replace high-cost and scarce noble metal catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.									185	5	0	0	12	0	185			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000378102400021

In order to utilize this process effectively, new catalysts are required that are cheap, non-toxic and efficient. In this context, 2D materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides ( e.g., MoS2) should offer the desired properties but have so far proven difficult to manufacture into useful devices. In this work, liquid | liquid interfaces are used for the assembly and testing of the catalytic efficiency of a number of 2D materials and their composites, exploiting the ability of the materials to self-assemble at these interfaces and be tested electrochemically in situ. MoS2, WS2, and graphene were developed for hydrogen evolution at the water |1,2-dichloro-benzene ( DCB) interface. The exfoliation process was carried out in DCB and resulted in multi-layer MoS2, few-layer WS2 and graphene; when assembled at the water |DCB interface, these materials acted as efficient HER catalysts. HER was investigated using voltammetry, with bulk reaction kinetics monitored by in situ UV-visible spectroscopy at a constant potential. MoS2 exhibited the highest performance of the catalysts examined, with an average rate constant of 0.0132 +/- 0.063 min(-1) at an applied Galvani potential of + 0.5 V. This is ascribed to the sulfur edge sites of MoS2, which are known to be active for hydrogen evolution predominantly.									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			2199-692X			WOS:000403299800012

In this study, highly dispersed bimetallic CuCo2O4 nanoclusters decorated g-C3N4 heterojunction photocatalyst was produced by in-situ deposition of 0D CuCo2O4 spinel on the 2D g-C3N4 surface. Compared with CuO or Co3O4 modified g-C3N4, the optimal composite exhibits a significantly higher H(2)( )evolution rate of 4187.6 mu mol.g(cat)(1).h(-1) with an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 4.57% under the irradiation of monochromatic light (400 +/- 7.5 nm) in the absence of noble metal. As suggested from the results of the photoelectrochemistry characterizations and NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) analysis, CuCo2O4/g-C3N4 exhibited faster HER kinetics and considerable surface acidity sites, and it facilitated triethanolamine (TEOA) chemisorption and H-2 evolution, further highlighting the merits of such mixed-metal compounds.

Herein, an effective strategy is designed to improve the electrochemical performance of Co3O4 nanoflowers, so as to solve the dilemma that the energy storage device cannot work normally due to too low temperature. Note that the incorporation of point defects (oxygen vacancies) into the primitive lattice of Co3O4 nanoflowers provide additional electrochemical active sites and greatly shorten the ion diffusion distance. The defect-type Co3O4 (DCo3O4) nanoflowers exhibit enhance specific capacitance of 1630 mF cm(-2) at 1 mA cm(-2) and conspicuous cycle stability of 91% up to 5000 cycles, as well as outstanding low temperature performance. The assemble symmetrical supercapacitor (SSC, D-Co3O4||D-Co3O4) device offer a wider voltage window of 1.4 V and obtain the maximum volume energy density of 0.94 mW h cm(-3) and the power density of 3.5 mW cm(-3). Meanwhile, the DCo3O4 nanoflowers has good electrocatalytic activity in basic solution for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and display the lowest initial potential and small overpotential. Therefore, this work highlights the role of the design defects of materials for building di-functional electrode materials for energy storage and conversion.									32	1	0	0	0	0	33			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000620365300001

Particularly, it can produce significant spin-polarized electrons from Co electronic states to run efficient hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). In this work, we focus attention on double-anionic CoPS nanocrystals (NCs) and explore electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Theoretical calculations indicate that phosphorus introduction into CoS2 shifts the d-band of Co atom towards the Fermi surface, making the surface activation barrier of CoPS (0.98 eV) far lower than that of CoS2 (1.41 eV). By growing the rod-like Co3(PO4)2 with surface decoration of CoPS NCs on the CoS2 wrapped carbon fiber paper as electrochemical cathode, we show that such a composite structure can effectively improve the escape efficiency of H2 due to large specific surface area. The current density reaches 10 mA cm-2 at 47 mV. The tafel slope is only 52 mV dec-1, which is far smaller than that of CoS2. Spectroscopic characterization suggests that the modified electronic states of CoPS NCs and good charge transport kinetics in the compound are responsible for the observed high-efficiency HER performance.

The results show that the oxygen pre-coverage strongly influences the cleavage of the C-Cl bond. At low coverages, C-Cl scission of chloro-t-butoxide intermediates begins at 200 K and isobutylene oxide (IBO) appears with a peak temperature of 235 K; at higher coverages, the onset of C-Cl scission is shifted upward by 50 K and the IBO peak by 80 K. Quantitative models for the surface reaction kinetics were developed from the experimental data. These show that the reaction of adsorbed intermediates does not occur by an S(N)2 process that releases IBO directly into the gas phase. Instead, C-Cl scission deposits organic intermediates or products on the surface, and the appearance of IBO in the gas-phase lags the appearance of atomic chlorine on the surface. For the lower temperature channel, the rate of IBO evolution in TPD is influenced by the kinetics of both C-Cl scission and molecular IBO desorption. At higher temperatures, surface diffusion processes to open surface sites limit the rate of IBO production. Comparison with results for chlorine diffusion into silver suggests that this is the relevant diffusion process.									16	2	0	0	0	0	16			1520-6106			WOS:000187279200033

However, the promotional role of Mn and its interaction with Co remain unclear and controversial. In situ characterization of the structural change of FTS catalysts is a powerful way to reveal the reaction mechanisms. Nevertheless, there are significant difficulties because of the harsh reaction conditions. Here, the microstructure evolution of Co/MnO catalysts during FTS is monitored by in situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy under real FTS atmosphere up to 6 bar for the first time. Combined with in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), ex situ high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and H-2 chemisorption characterizations, we reveal that the metallic Co liberated from Mn1-xCoxO during FTS leads to activity enhancement. The presence of Mn improves the Co dispersion. However, an initial association of Mn with the Co phase hampers the cobalt reducibility. We also find that increasing the reaction pressure enhances the oxygen dissociation on the Mn surface, which leads to an increased number of exposed Co sites and consequent FTS activity improvement.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000466800400018

In this work Rh was incorporated in Fe-doped Ni3S2 nanosheets with the assistance of hydrogen plasma to significantly enhance the HER/OER catalytic activity. The resultant catalyst, p-Rh/Fe-Ni3S2/NF, was composed of Rh/Rh2S3 heterostructured clusters embedded in Fe-Ni3S2 nanosheets; it needs overpotentials of only 108 and 237 mV to achieve HER and OER currents of 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, and drives overall water splitting at 1.79 V with a current of 100 mA cm(-2) as a bifunctional catalyst. Post-characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveal its operando evolution behavior and a unique Janus catalytic mechanism for the HER and OER. For the HER, a Rh/Rh2S3 heterointerface with strong H2O adsorption energy and optimal H adsorption energy is the active site; in the OER, it experiences surface transformation under operando conditions; an in situ formed Rh/Fe-doped NiOOH layer with strengthened binding of *O facilitates the rate determining step of *O formation to accelerate the OER process. Hydrogen plasma treatment not only helps partially reduce Rh to form HER-active Rh/Rh2S3 heterostructures but also induces rich defects/vacancies to facilitate surface reconstruction/phase transformation to form an active co-doped NiOOH phase under OER conditions. This work may shed light on the promotive role of noble metals on NiFe-based catalysts for water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000869117300001

Herein, we report a counterintuitive phenomenon of this general paradigm when the size of Pt decreases to an atomic level, namely, the CO-promoting Pt electrocatalysis toward hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). Compared to pristine atomic Pt catalyst, reduction current on a CO-modified catalyst increases significantly. Operando mass spectroscopy and electrochemical analyses demonstrate that the increased current arises due to enhanced H-2 evolution, not additional CO reduction. Through structural identification of catalytic sites and computational analysis, we conclude that CO-ligation on the atomic Pt facilitates H-ads formation via water dissociation. This counterintuitive effect exemplifies the fully distinct characteristics of atomic Pt catalysts from those of bulk Pt, and offers new insights for tuning the activity of similar classes of catalysts.									52	6	0	0	5	0	52			0002-7863			WOS:000451933100030	30383962

The magma was continuously decompressed from 100 MPa to 10-50 MPa at rates of 10 and 100 MPa h(-1). The evolution of the ferric to total iron ratio (Fe3+/Fe-total) during decompression was investigated using XANES, and redox evolution was determined based on a thermodynamic calculation and measured Fe3+/Fe-total. Before decompression, the sample was buffered from NNO to NNO+1, and the pre-exsolved fluid phase and sulfide crystal coexisted. Sulfide crystals were found in all decompressed samples, and Fe3+/Fe-total showed a slight decrease with decompression. It was confirmed that the sample in a gold capsule was not influenced by the change in redox conditions outside of the capsule for the timescale of the decompression experiments; thus, the decompressed sample reflected the redox evolution in magma during decompression.Our experiments indicated that magma decompression causes a slight reduction when it includes water and sulfur. This evolution is qualitatively explained by sulfur degassing and fluid-melt redox equilibria. During the fluid-melt redox equilibria, magma is reduced if the existence of a pre-exsolved fluid phase is assumed, while the model calculation shows that magma is oxidized when it contains only water or no pre-exsolved fluid phases. This is because sulfur buffers the oxidation of magma through a reaction with oxygen in the fluid phase. Therefore, we inferred that the redox condition of magma is not oxidized during explosive volcanism with a pre-exsolved fluid phase and closed-system degassing. In contrast, if magma experiences open-system degassing, it may be oxidized, resulting in the breakdown of sulfide crystals as observed in some pyroclasts and lavas.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0003-004X	1945-3027		WOS:000613919300006

The preparation is based on an assembly process, with evaporation of an ethanol water solution containing melamine formaldehyde resin (MF resin) as carbon source, nitrogen source, and chelating agent. Moreover, F127 and Co(NO3)(2) are used as template and metallic precursor, respectively. The Co nanoparticles embedded, N-doped mesoporous carbon annealed at 800 degrees C (denoted as MFCo800) shows high electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with high current density and low overpotential, which has the ability to operate in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes.

Polyoxometalates (POMs) can be regarded as model compounds of transition metal oxides, and cobalt-containing POMs (Co-POMs) have received significant interest as candidates. Nanocomposites based on Co-POMs have been reported to show high OER activities due to synergistic effects among the components; however, the role of each component is unclear due to its complex structure. Herein, we utilize porous ionic crystals (PICs) based on Co-POMs, which enable a composition-structure-function relationship to be established to understand the origin of the synergistic catalysis. Specifically, a Keggin-type POM [alpha-CoW12O40](6-) and a Cr complex [Cr3O(OOCCH2CN)(6)(H2O)(3)](+) are implemented as PIC building blocks for the OER under nonbasic conditions. The potentially OER-active but highly soluble [alpha-CoW12O40](6-) was successfully anchored in the crystalline PIC matrix via Coulomb interactions and hydrogen bonding induced by polar cyano groups of the Cr complex. The PIC exhibits efficient and sustained OER catalytic activity, while each building block is inactive. The Tafel slope of the linear sweep voltammetry curve and the relatively large kinetic isotope effect value suggest that elementary steps closely related to the OER rate involve single-electron and proton transfer reactions. Electrochemical and spectroscopic studies clearly show that the synergistic catalysis originates from the charge transfer from the Cr complex to [alpha-CoW12O40](6-); the increased electron density of [alpha-CoW12O40](6-) may increase its basicity and accelerate proton abstraction as well as enhance electron transfer to stabilize the reaction intermediates adsorbed on [alpha-CoW12O40](6-).									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000749997100001	35040654

Researchers have carried out many types of investigations on MXenes as HER and OER electrocatalysts. So far, great progress has been made in screening MXenes as HER and OER electrocatalysts, in which the theoretical calculation method plays an important role. In the present study, we briefly summarize the progress regarding theoretical calculations of MXenes as HER and OER electrocatalysts. First, we introduce the standard computational methods and basic mechanisms of HER and OER. We then present some recent studies of theoretical calculations and experiments combined with theoretical calculations. Finally, some specific perspectives are provided for the future development of MXenes as excellent HER and OER electrocatalysts. We believe theoretical computational studies of MXenes as HER and OER electrocatalysts may flourish by considering the natural reaction environment and electrochemical kinetic processes, the proposal of more activity descriptors, close integration of theory and experiments, and the development of advanced calculation methods.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000860236000001

Replacing sluggish OER with thermodynamically favorable urea oxidation reaction holds great promise for energy-efficient H2 generation while also addressing the issue of urea-rich water contamination. In this paper, novel hollow nanorod arrays made of NiCoP nanosheets (denoted as NiCoP NSs@HNRAs) are created using an environmentally friendly and simple template-assisted electrodeposition and subsequent phosphorization method. The distinct HNRAs enable fast transport and short diffusion paths for electroactive species, as well as the high catalysts availability. Because of these structural advantages, NiCoP NSs@HNRAs have excellent electrocatalyst activity, requiring only a potential of 1.35 V (vs. RHE) to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm-2 with robust durability. Furthermore, an overall urea electrolysis system is constructed using commercial Pt/C as the cathode and NiCoP NSs@HNRAs as the anode, with an outstanding activity of 1.43 V and excellent stability at 50 mA cm-2. This paper presents a novel structural strategy for designing an electrocatalyst for urea-assisted energy-efficient H2 generation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000831672100002

It thus remains a challenge to achieve a monodispersion of tiny intermetallics. In the current work, ultra-small monodisperse intermetallic NiZn nanoparticles were synthesized based on a low-temperature solution chemistry route involving the chemical conversion of metal nanoparticles into an ordered alloy using an organometallic zinc precursor. During the transformation of single metal nanoparticles into the corresponding alloy, the particles retained their morphology. The resulting ordered alloy made up of earth-abundant materials demonstrated high electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a low overpotential of 283 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 73 mV dec(-1), along with excellent stability and durability. The prepared intermetallic NiZn exhibited outstanding OER efficacy, better than those of a Ni0.7Zn0.3 alloy, pure Ni nanoparticles and even state-of-the art RuO2. The atomic ordering as well as the modification of the electronic structure of Ni upon becoming alloyed with Zn, together with an atomic-scale synergistic effect produced from Ni and Zn, led to the enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity. The present findings point to a general route to produce nanoscale tiny alloys and also provide excellent electrocatalysts having exceptional energy conversion efficiency.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2516-0230			WOS:000508943100034	36133978

Hence during water oxidation under illumination, pinholes in protection layers on Si photoanodes result in the local formation of a protective, stabilizing passive oxide on the Si surface. However, operation under natural diurnal insolation cycles additionally requires protection strategies that minimize the dark corrosive etching rate of Si at pinholes. We show herein that addition of [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) to 1.0 M KOH(aq) results in a self-healing process that extends the lifetime to >280 h of an np(+)-Si(100) photoanode patterned with an array of Ni catalyst islands operated under simulated day/night cycles. The self-healing [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) additive caused the exposed Si(100) surface to etch >180 times slower than the Si etch rate in 1.0 M KOH(aq) alone. No appreciable difference in etch rate or facet preference was observed between Si(100) and Si(111) surfaces in 1.0 M KOH(aq) with [Fe(CN)(6)](3-), indicating that the surface conformally oxidized before Si dissolved. The presence of [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) minimally impacted the faradaic efficiency or overpotential of p(+)-Si/Ni electrodes for the oxygen-evolution reaction.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000589801000016

Cobalt-based hydroxides and oxides have been considered as ideal OER electrocatalysts and have been intensively studied; however, their catalytic activity is still unsatisfactory. It is known that the interfacial electron and structure engineering of composite electrocatalysts often results in synergistically enhanced catalytic performance. Herein, a self-supported binary heterogeneous catalyst composed of CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se nanosheet arrays vertically grown on carbon cloth has been reported. The heterostructure electrocatalyst exhibits excellent activity for the OER in alkaline electrolyte, requiring an overpotential of only 241 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1). These performances are significantly better than those of the bare CoFe LDH and Co0.85Se catalysts. Moreover, the composite electrodes exhibit outstanding durability within 40 h of testing. Our further electrochemical results show that the excellent activities of the heterostructure electrodes should be ascribed to the interfacial coupling effect, increased number of activity sites, accelerated electron transfer, and strong structural stability. This work paves an interesting route for boosting the OER performance of oxide-based electrocatalysts by the regulation of electronic structure through introducing non oxide electrocatalysts for various applications.									28	1	0	0	1	0	28			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000490981500017

Here, detailed comparisons at both laboratory and industrial scales show that Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O2+delta appears to be the most active and stable perovskite catalyst under alkaline conditions, while PrBaCo2O5+delta reveals thermodynamic instability described by the density-functional theory based Pourbaix diagrams highlighting cation dissolution under OER conditions. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy is used in parallel to monitor electronic and structural changes of the catalysts during OER. The exceptional BSCF functional stability can be correlated to its thermodynamic meta-stability under OER conditions as highlighted by Pourbaix diagram analysis. BSCF is able to dynamically self-reconstruct its surface, leading to formation of Co-based oxy(hydroxide) layers while retaining its structural stability. Differently, PBCO demonstrates a high initial OER activity while it undergoes a degradation process considering its thermodynamic instability under OER conditions as anticipated by its Pourbaix diagram.

However, an effective and rational pathway to stepwise change of the bandgap of an organic/polymeric photocatalyst is still very challenging. An efficient strategy is demonstrated to tailor the bandgap from 2.7 eV to 1.9 eV of organic photocatalysts by carefully manipulating the linker/terminal atoms in the chains via innovatively designed polymerization. These polymers work in a stable and efficient manner for both H-2 and O-2 evolution at ambient conditions (420 nm < lambda < 710 nm), exhibiting up to 18 times higher hydrogen evolution rate (HER) than a reference photocatalyst g-C3N4 and leading to high apparent quantum yields (AQYs) of 8.6%/2.5% at 420/500 nm, respectively. For the oxygen evolution rate (OER), the optimal polymer shows 19 times higher activity compared to g-C3N4 with excellent AQYs of 4.3%/1.0% at 420/500 nm. Both theoretical modeling and spectroscopic results indicate that such remarkable enhancement is due to the increased light harvesting and improved charge separation. This strategy thus paves a novel avenue to fabricate highly efficient organic/polymeric photocatalysts with precisely tunable operation windows and enhanced charge separation.									111	6	0	0	12	0	111			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000442731100013

In this work, the evolution kinetics of electro-generated hydrogen bubbles are recorded in situ on three (i.e. smooth, nanoporous, and nanoarray) Pt electrodes to identify the geometry dependence. The bubble radius shows a time-dependent growth kinetic, which is tightly-connected to the electrode geometry. Among the three electrodes, the smooth one shows a typical time coefficient of 0.5, in consistence with reported values; the nanoporous one shows a time coefficient of 0.47, less than the classic one (0.5); while the nanoarray one exhibits fastest bubble growth kinetics with a time coefficient higher than 0.5 (0.54). Moreover, the nanoarray electrode has the smallest bubble detachment size and the largest growth coefficient (23.3) of all three electrodes. Based on the experimental results, a growth model combined direct bottom- injection with micro-convection is proposed to illustrate the surface geometry dependent coefficients, i.e., the relationship between geometry and bubble evolution kinetics. The direct injection of generated gas molecules from the bottom of bubbles at the three phase boundaries are believed the key to tailor the bubble wetting states and thus determine the bubble evolution kinetics.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000607002400001

In this study, a MIL-88A/Ni(OH)(2) heterostructure was directly grown on carbon cloth (denoted as MIL-88A/Ni(OH)(2)-CC) for the first time by using a generic two-step hydrothermal method. The results showed that using carbon cloth as a three-dimensional self-supporting electrode could improve the conductivity of the catalyst, while the edges of the Ni(OH)(2) layer can provide abundant active sites to synergistically boost the OER performance with MIL-88A. Impressively, the as-prepared MIL-88A/Ni(OH)(2)-CC catalyst delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 250 mV in 1 M KOH and 352 mV in 0.1 M KOH, exhibiting small Tafel slope values of 36.4 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH and 46.1 mV dec(-1) in 0.1 M KOH, respectively. The MIL-88A/Ni(OH)(2)-CC catalyst also demonstrates a long-lasting stability superior to that of the RuO2/CC catalyst for the OER. Such intriguing OER properties can be attributed to the unique heterostructure at the interface between MIL-88A and Ni(OH)(2), while density functional theory calculations also confirm that OH- has a very low adsorption energy at the interface of the heterostructure.									29	1	0	0	2	0	29			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521938400037

The surface characterization of the electrode was characterized by scanning electron microscopy(SEM) and the element composition of layers was analyzed with X-ray Diffraction(XRD). The electrode electrochemical properties were analyzed with Cyclic Voltammogram (CV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopic (EIS). The influence of Y doping on the service life of the electrode in strong acid solution was emphatically studied. The results indicated that the semiconductive solid solution was formed between Y2O3 and SnO2, which maked the service life of electrode reaching 70 h in high electric density(4 A/cm(2)); At the same time the oxygen evolution reaction(OER) potential of this electrode reached 2.1 V. The rougher of the surface was, the better its electric catalytic properties were Ti/SnO2+Y2O3+MnOx/PbO2 electrode is an ideal acid-proof anode material.									5	10	0	0	0	0	12			1002-185X			WOS:000266835500016

The elemental distribution of sulfur (S) corresponded well to the Mo distribution, and both Mo and S elements distributed evenly in the Mo3S13@rGO-CNTs aerogels. Results indicated that [Mo3S13](2-) nanoclusters inherently exposed a high number of active edge sites, which greatly improved the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The new peak at 168.8 eV corresponded to the characteristic S-O binding in the S 2p region of Mo3S13@rGO-CNTs, indicating that the [Mo3S13](2-) clusters were bond onto the rGO-CNTs aerogels through S-O binding. The strong support of rGO-CNTs aerogels suppressed the aggregation of [Mo3S13](2-) nanoclusters, exposing more active surface and electrons diffusions on the surface of Mo3S13@rGO-CNTs aerogels. Mo3S13@rGO-CNTs aerogels laden with 20 mg of [Mo3S13](2-) exhibited close hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance as compared with that of [Mo3S13-120]@rGO-CNTs aerogels laden with 120 mg of [Mo3S13](2-) nanoclusters. This indicated the extremely high HER performance of [Mo3S13](2-) even at low mass. As a result, Mo3S13@rGO-CNTs aerogels enabled remarkable electrochemical performances showing a low overpotential (0.179 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) with a small Tafel slope, reduced transfer resistance, and excellent stability.									25	0	0	0	3	0	25			2168-0485			WOS:000412382700048

Utilizing the electrochemical instability of some metal organic framework ligands is a promising strategy to solve the problem of difficulty in controlling the degree of electrochemical self-reconstruction and obtaining high-performance water oxidation catalysts. Here, a monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell was used for highly efficient standalone solar water splitting. A self-reconstructed NiCoFe-based hydroxide nanosheet electrocatalyst was shown to exhibit remarkable oxygen evolution reaction performance with an overpotential of 191 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Upon pairing with the reported state-of-the-art hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst NiMo4/MnO3-X and a monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell, an unprecedented STH efficiency of 21.32% was achieved for the unbiased solar water splitting system. This low-cost high-efficiency solar water-splitting system will contribute to realizing the practical applications of PEC hydrogen production technology.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000661179100001

Herein, we demonstrate an extremely durable catalyst prototype that combines structurally ordered intermetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with mesoporous carbon. With ZIF-8 derived mesoporous carbon supported Pt3Co intermetallic NPs (Pt3Co/DMC-F) as an example, we illustrate its synthetic details, electrocatalytic performance and durability enhancement mechanism. The Pt3Co/DMC-F catalyst exhibited significant enhancement in activity and durability. More importantly, its extraordinary performance was observed/verified in a H-2/air PEM single cell test. The confinement of mesoporous carbon not only efficiently controls the particle size of Pt3Co and hampers their aggregation during thermal annealing and electrochemical reactions, but also significantly suppresses detachment. Beyond offering an advanced electrocatalyst, this study provides a solution to the durability issue of cathodes that has prevented practical application of proton exchange membrane fuel cells.									33	8	0	0	1	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000560225400038

However, the study of the interaction of RuO2 surfaces with water has been confined largely to the ultrahigh vacuum environment and to the thermodynamically stable (110) surface. In this work, we combine ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ surface diffraction, and density functional theory calculations to investigate how four different facets of RuO2 interact with water under humid and electrochemical environments. The vacant coordinatively unsaturated Ru site (CUS) allows for the adsorption and dissociation of water molecules. Different surfaces exhibit unique binding energetics for -H2O and -OH and can allow for different degrees of hydrogen bonding between the adsorbates. Consequently, the degree of water dissociation is found to be sensitive to the surface crystallographic orientation-being maximum for the (101) surface, followed by the (110), (001) and (100) surfaces. This study identifies crystallographic orientation as an important parameter to tune not only the density of active sites but also the energetics for water dissociation; this finding is of great significance for many catalytic reactions, where water is a key reactant, or product.									35	1	0	0	3	0	36			1932-7447			WOS:000441484600024

The preparation starts with a deposition of metallic Ir at room temperature followed by a post-oxidation step performed in an oxygen atmosphere of 10(-4) mbar at 700 K. On this surface, additional Ir can be deposited at 700 K in an oxygen atmosphere of 10(-6) mbar to produce a IrO2(110) layer with variable thicknesses. To improve the crystallinity of the resulting IrO2(110) layer, the final film was post-oxidized in 10(-4) mbar of O-2 at 700 K for 5 min. The surface-sensitive techniques of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) are employed to characterize the morphology, crystallinity, and electronic structure of the prepared ultrathin IrO2(110) films and how these films decompose upon annealing under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions. STM provides evidence that the IrO2(110) films start already to reduce at 465 K under UHV conditions. Upon annealing to 605 K under UHV the reduction of IrO2 intensifies (XPS), but the oxide film can readily be restored by re-oxidation in 10(-4) mbar of O-2 at 700 K. Thermal decomposition at 725 K leads, however, to severe reduction of the IrO2(110) layer (XPS, STM) that cannot be restored by a subsequent re-oxidation step. The utility of the IrO2(110)-TiO2(110) system as model electrodes is exemplified with the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction in an acidic environment.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0743-7463			WOS:000472682600013	31124679

The results showed that: 1) Within the oxygen concentration of 0-10%, the increase of oxygen concentration slightly influenced the process of volatile component evolution, but significantly improved the semi-coke combustion process of tobacco. 2) The increase of heating rate caused the mass loss profile of tobacco shifted towards a higher temperature region, it was not beneficial to the ignition and burnout of tobacco. 3) The variation curves of apparent activation energy E*(alpha) along with the cause of reaction and the distribution function of activation energy f(E) of middle leaves at the oxygen concentrations of 0, 5% and 10% were obtained; E. (a) first increased and then decreased in mass loss process generally, and f (E) did not present obvious gaussian distribution characteristics. The distribution of activation energy of tobacco differed in different atmospheres, and a remarkable kinetic compensation effect was observed at the second stage (volatile non-polymeric component release and partial tobacco polymer decomposition) and the fourth stage (semi-coke combustion) of tobacco combustion process.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1002-0861			INSPEC:17195567

Unlike traditional preparation methods, this work induces a cost-effective biosorption strategy employing bacteria as precursors to obtain Fe2P@carbon nanoparticles decorated on N and P co-doped carbon (Fe2P@CNPs/NPC) materials, which fully employs the self-screening and self-healing abilities of membranes as well as the easy-controllable cultivation of bacteria. Moreover, copper ions are innovatively selected for catalyzing ferric ion soaking in bacteria for the first time. The obtained hierarchical Fe2P@CNPs/NPC show union of porous structures guaranteeing ion infusions: P and N element doped carbon nanomaterials improve the wettability and conductivity, and Fe2P crystals enhance the active sites, delivering current densities of 10, 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 266, 301 and 313 mV in 1.0 M KOH electrolytes, respectively, and robust stabilities without a decrease in the long-term j-t operations for 15 h for the OER. Thus, this work not only offers an efficient, green and largescale fabrication method to construct an OER catalyst, but also lays the foundation for the deep research of ferric phosphides in the electrochemical fields.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2052-1553			WOS:000632570300001

However, direct observation of the electrocatalytic behavior of MOF-based electrocatalysts remains extremely challenging, which is of great significance to understand their electrocatalytic mechanism. Herein, we developed a vertically oriented Ni-based MOF nanosheet array doped with 2.09 wt% Ce (denoted as Ce-NiBDC/OG). Ce-NiBDC/OG displayed a low overpotential of 265 mV to deliver a 10 mA cm(-2) current density for the OER. In situ spectroscopy and operando microscopy visualized the phase transformation behavior of Ce-NiBDC/OG to Ce-doped NiOOH induced by electrochemical activation, which was regarded as the real active site. Mechanistic studies revealed that, for the Ce-NiBDC/OG-derived catalyst, the doping of Ce species in NiOOH significantly increased the adsorption of *OH, and further reduced the energy barriers of the rate-determining step (*OH ->*O).									40	3	0	0	1	0	40			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000618243600012	34821271

Although there are extensive reports in the literature about the application of these catalysts in water oxidation (the limiting step for hydrogen evolution), some limitations must be overcome in terms of improving the turnover frequency, oxygen production, long term stability, and elucidation of the mechanism. Another important feature to consider is the industrial processability of electrolytic cells for water splitting. For these reasons, we have reported herein a comparison of the electrochemical and chemical properties of three catalysts produced from cobalt-Prussian blue. Co-Co PBA 60 refers to cobalt-Prussian blue heated up to 60 degrees C with a high content of water. Co-Co PBA 200 is the same starting material but heated up to 200 degrees C with a low water content. Finally, Co3O4 is a thermal decomposition product obtained from heating cobalt-Prussian blue up to 400 degrees C. Although Co-Co PBA 60 has a higher overpotential for water oxidation than Co-Co PBA 200, this catalyst is kinetically faster than Co PBA 200. It is suggested that the water coordinated to Co2+ in Co-Co PBA 60 can accelerate the reaction and that there is a balance between the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics for determining the final properties of the catalyst at pH = 7. Another important observation is that the Co3O4 catalyst has the best performance among the considered catalysts with the highest TON and TOF. This suggests that the different mechanisms and surface effects demonstrated by the Co3O4 catalyst are more conducive to efficient water oxidation than those of Prussian blue. Further studies concerning the effect of water and surface on these catalysts under mild conditions are essential to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of water oxidation and to advance the development of new catalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000592685600047	33150900

In this work, combinational modulations of metallic NiSe2 nanodendrites by phase engineering and heteroatom doping are achieved to promote the OER. A series of marcasite NiSe2 (m-NiSe2) and Fe-doped marcasite NiSe2 (m-Ni1-xFexSe2) nanodendrites with various dopant contents have been controllably synthesized. On the one hand, phase engineering to synthesize m-NiSe2 nanodendrites offers a better intrinsic electronic conductivity than the pyrite phase. On the other hand, heteroatom Fe doping in m-NiSe2 nanodendrites further gains electronic benefits and simultaneously provides more electrochemical active sites owing to heteroatom displacement defects. Consequently, an optimized catalyst of m-Ni0.94Fe0.06Se2 nanodendrites with a moderate dopant content is developed, exhibiting significantly improved OER performance with a low overpotential of 279 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1) and long operational stability for 35 h in 1.0 M KOH. In situ surface oxidation of the m-Ni0.94Fe0.06Se2 nanodendrites to form amorphous Fe-doped NiOOH/Ni(OH)(2) shells during the OER process is demonstrated, which contributes to their superior activity and outstanding stability. This work provides valuable insights into the design of advanced OER electrocatalysts by means of combinational modulations of phase engineering and heteroatom incorporation.									37	0	0	0	1	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000530495500058

Carbon monoxide, acetone, propene, and hydrogen are the only gaseous products, while carbon and oxygen remain on the surface after temperature-programmed reaction up to 760 K. The acetone and CC) production increase whereas propene and propane production decrease as the Co coverage is increased from 0 to 1.5 monolayers (ML). This is consistent with independent reactions occurring on both Co and Mo, since 2-propanol is known to produce propene and propane on Mo(110). The C-O bond retention products (acetone and CO) are attributed to reaction on the Co overlayer. Infrared and temperature-programmed reaction studies confirm that the evolution of CO is desorption limited and that decomposition to CO competes with acetone formation at 330 K. Acetone is produced via selective cleavage of the beta C-H bond (adjacent to the oxygen), as shown by selective isotopic labeling experiments. The observed C-O bond retention on Co is consistent with the intermediate strength of the Co-O bond compared to other M-O bonds for transition metals. There is no evidence for aggregation of the Co overlayer induced by 2-propoxide, and therefore the observed reactivity is that of the dispersed Co overlayer.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0022-3654			WOS:A1996VR07600031

Group VIII 3d metals and their compounds are the often chosen catalysts for the same. Herein, we have demonstrated an easy way to synthesize one such efficient catalyst from beta-Ni(OH)(2), which has a petal-like morphology as a result of the formation of a 3D hierarchical array of interwoven ultra-thin beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets decorated with beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanoburls. The electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the hierarchical array of ultra-thin beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets decorated with beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanoburls displayed an unusual enhancement as a consequence of surface faceting of diffraction planes from (001) to (101) and (111) in addition to the formation of oxyhydroxide upon potential cycling. The solvothermally synthesized petal-like 3D hierarchical array of beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets and nanoburls activated by faceting and the formation of oxyhydroxide exhibited a lower overpotential (eta = 0.300 +/- 0.003 V @ j = 10mA cm(-2)), a minimum Tafel slope (0.043 V de(c-)1), and very high turnover frequency (TOF = 47.14 s(-1) @ 1.53 V vs. RHE) with very high faradaic efficiency when compared to earlier studies on beta-Ni(OH)(2). Regardless of the type of polymorph, our catalyst have performed better than the state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst under the same experimental conditions.									86	1	0	0	1	0	86			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000395881300011

Improving the intrinsically catalytic activity of earth-abundant metals based electrocatalysts for HER is still a huge challenge. Herein, we put forward a dual phosphorus/sulfur (P/S) doped nickel-cobalt bimetallic material that was grown on nickel foam (S-n-NiCoPx-NF, n = 1-4, NF stands for nickel foam) through a facile one-step phosphorization/sulfuration reaction. Those catalysts represent a novel kind of electrocatalysts with vastly optimized catalytic activity for HER. The S-2-NiCoPx/NF with optimal P/S ratio achieves unexpectedly highly efficient catalytic activity for HER in alkaline medium. The overpotential at the current density of 50 mA cm(-2) is only 144 mV, which is almost 190 mV less than that of pristine nickel-cobalt bimetallic phosphide catalyst (NiCoPx-NF). In addition, the S-2-NiCoPx/NF also has fast reaction kinetics with the smallest Tafel slope of 66 mV/dec and exhibits high stability for HER. This work experimentally demonstrates the advantages of a dual anion modification strategy on improving catalytic activity. Our method offers a new approach to design highly efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion devices. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

After geometry optimization, the calculated structural parameters evince a satisfactory agreement with the reported experimental results indicating that the used method and conditions are suitable. The electronic structures demonstrate that both photocatalysts possess favorable band gaps (2.31 and 2.52 eV) and appropriate band edge positions for oxygen evolution reaction under solar radiation. The relatively light effective masses at the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum are expected to result in enhanced photocatalytic activity due to lower recombination probability of the photogenerated electrons and holes. The analysis of electronic density of states reveal that the higher coordination number of vanadium in ZnV2O6 with respect to Zn2V2O7 causes more delocalisation of bands owning to lower V-V and O-O distances in conduction and valence bands, respectively. Moreover, the origins of features that appear in solar energy harvesting characteristics (dielectric function and optical absorption coefficient) have been discussed for solar water splitting in detail.									28	1	0	0	1	0	28			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000427215100105

The effect of heat treatments on the non-ohmic behaviors and dielectric properties were investigated. EDS analysis results indicate that the percent of oxygen at grain boundaries of CCTO ceramics heat-treated in oxygen-rich atmosphere increases markedly with the rise of temperature and approaches saturation state at about 850 degrees C. The breakdown voltage and nonlinear coefficient also exhibit an increase trend with the rise of temperature. In addition, the calculated results manifest that the height of Schottky potential barrier is closely related to the oxygen content at the grain boundaries. The permittivity and dielectric loss of samples heat-treated present a relatively intense decrease with the rise of temperature. But the permittivity has a behavior just reverse to the non-ohmic characteristics, which can be explained by the Schottky potential barrier theory. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report a facile synthesis of Ni nanocubes and cuboctahedra with controlled shapes and high yields via a wet-chemistry strategy. The key to success relies on the use of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), formaldehyde (HCHO) and a specific reaction temperature, which could effectively cap the desired surface and tune their growth rate. Specifically, nanocubes switched to cuboctahedra and octahedra with an increased reaction temperature due to gradual CO desorption from the surfaces of NCs. Meanwhile, it should be worth noting that CTAB and the generated CO molecules through HCHO decomposition would co-adsorb on the {100} facets of Ni NCs. As a proof-of-application, the obtained Ni NCs exhibited high activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with over-potentials of 383 mV and 402 mV for nanocubes and cuboctahedra at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, demonstrating that the {100} facets are more favorable toward OER. These results suggested that their performance is strongly shape dependent and is derived from different surface energies and active sites.									2	1	0	0	0	0	3			1466-8033			WOS:000459740000005

Herein, a boron-based ternary W3CoB3 electrode is designed for the water splitting electro-catalyzer for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The optimum W3CoB3 electrode demonstrates low overpotentials of 84 and 271 mV for the HER and OER at 60 mA/cm2 in 1 M KOH in a threeelectrode system. Then, the W3CoB3 electrode demonstrates 1.52 V in 1 M KOH by a two-electrode configuration, which ranks the W3CoB3 electrode as one of the best transition-metal-based compound electrodes for the water splitting. In addition, the W3CoB3 electrode demonstrates a comparable water splitting performance to the standard benchmark electrodes of Pt/C || RuO2 in the 1M PBS in the twoelectrode system, which indicates that the W3CoB3 electrode can demonstrate comparable performance in the natural water. The incorporation of boron atoms promotes the electron supply to the transitionmetal atoms, which tunes the reaction kinetics to acquire the enhanced electrocatalytic performance.

Herein, molybdenum polysulfide (MoSx) anchored on a porous Zr-metal organic framework (Zr-MOF, UiO-66-NH2) by chemical interactions is fabricated by a facile and one-pot solvothermal method for HER application. The distinctive design of the Zr-MOF stabilized MoSx composite enables remarkable electrochemical HER activity with a Tafel slope of 59 mV.dec(-1), a lower onset potential of nearly 125 mV, and a cathode current of 10 mA.cm(-2) at an overpotential of 200 mV, which also exhibits excellent durability in an acid medium. The superior HER performance should ascribe to the fast electron transport from the less conducting MoSx nanosheets to the electrode, high effective surface area, and number of active sites, as well as the favorable delivery for local protons in the porous Zr-MOF structure during the electrocatalytic reaction. Thus, this work paves a potential pathway for designing efficient Mo-based HER electrocatalysts by the combination of molybdenum polysulfide and versatile proton-conductive MOFs.									61	4	0	0	5	0	63			1932-7447			WOS:000378196200024

One of the main reasons is that the performance of current catalysts is limited by a 'volcano plot', which defines the relationship between the activities of a family of catalysts and a series of specific descriptors (e.g., adsorption ability of reaction intermediate(s)). Here, using the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction as an example, we propose a strategy to break such activity limits. By building up volcano plots for a group of Pt alloys, we found that some "unique" samples did not follow the trend and possessed higher activities beyond the volcano top. Our thermodynamic and kinetic measurements revealed that dealloying can break the poorly known scaling relationship between the binding energies of *H and *OH, and thus, selectively optimize the adsorption properties toward *H and *OH reaction intermediates on Pt surfaces and boost the overall activity. This provides a new insight into the aforementioned activity limits, which can be avoided by regulating the adsorption behaviors of two or more intermediates.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000470928800019

The present investigations focus on the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pyrene as representative of the aromatic compound class. Experimental results are supported by computational methods: simple kinetic models are used to estimate the temporal evolution of the concentrations of reactants, intermediates, and final products, whereas density functional theory (DFT) energy calculations are carried out to further elucidate the proposed reaction pathways. The neutral radicals are generated upon photolysis of background water and oxygen always present in appreciable mixing ratios in typical API sources. Substantial amounts of oxygenated analyte product ions are observed using both techniques. In contrast, upon atmospheric pressure laser ionization (APLI) with 248 nm radiation, oxygenated products are virtually absent. In addition, kinetic data evaluation yielded a bimolecular rate constant of k = (1.9 +/- 0.9) x 10(-9) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) for the reaction of the pyrene radical cation with OH radicals.

The process includes oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER); the OER is kinetically unfavourable. Studies have shown that nickel (Ni)- iron (Fe) catalysts enhance activity towards OER, and cerium oxide (CeO2) supports have shown positive effects on catalytic performance. This study covers the preliminary evaluation of Ni, Ni90Fe10 (at%) and Ni90Fe10/CeO2 (50 wt%) nanoparticles (NPs), synthesized by chemical reduction, as OER catalysts in AEMWE using commercial membranes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the Ni-based NPs indicate NPs roughly 4-6 nm in size. Three-electrode cell measurements indicate that Ni90Fe10 is the most active non-noble metal catalyst in 1 and 0.1 M KOH. AEMWE measurements of the anodes show cells achieving overall cell voltages between 1.85 and 1.90 V at 2 A cm(-2) in 1 M KOH at 50 degrees C, which is comparable to the selected iridium-black reference catalyst. In 0.1 M KOH, the AEMWE cell containing Ni90Fe10 attained the lowest voltage of 1.99 V at 2 A cm(-2). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the AEMWE cells using Ni90Fe10/CeO2 showed a higher ohmic resistance than all catalysts, indicating the need for support optimization.									42	0	0	0	1	0	42				2073-4344		WOS:000498266100030

At least in some cases, these adsorbed impurities may alter the electronic nature of nanoparticles and thus alter the electrocatalytic activity. In this work, we report the synthesis of AuPt/C bimetallic nanoparticles (BNPs) supported on Vulcan carbon using the polyol method in the presence of different concentrations of polyvinylpyrrolidone (0.01, 0.1, and 1 %) as a capping agent and electrocatalytic activity of the synthesized AuPt/C BNPs. We found that the PVP adsorbs on the AuPt BNPs through C = O functional group, but not through the Natom. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and the methanol tolerance were evaluated on those PVP adsorbed AuPt/C BNPs catalysts. Remarkably, AuPt/C BNPs catalyst with 0.1 % PVP showed a balance of ORR electrocatalysis and methanol tolerance when compared to the PVP free AuPt BNPs. The adsorbed PVP on AuPt BNPs alters the electronic properties of the Pt through electronic interaction with Pt and also controls the surface geometry suitable to ORR, but not the methanol adsorption.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000374710100030

Modeling these measurements allows us to constrain the origins of the exospheric O and, as a consequence, to estimate Mars' present oxygen escape rate. We here propose an analysis of three periods of MAVEN observations based on a set of three coupled models: a hybrid magnetospheric model (LATmos HYbrid Simulation (LatHyS)), an Exospheric General Model (EGM), and the Global Martian Circulation model of the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique (LMD-GCM), which provide a description of Mars' environment from the surface up to the solar wind. The simulated magnetosphere by LatHyS is in good agreement with MAVEN Plasma and Field Package instruments data. The LMD-GCM modeled upper atmospheric profiles for the main neutral and ion species are compared to Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer/MAVEN data showing that the LMD-GCM can provide a satisfactory global view of Mars' upper atmosphere. Finally, we were able to reconstruct the expected emission brightness intensity from the oxygen exosphere using EGM. The good agreement with the averaged measured profiles by Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph during these three periods suggests that Mars' exospheric nonthermal component can be fully explained by the reactions of dissociative recombination of the O-2(+) ion in Mars' ionosphere, limiting significantly our ability to extract information from MAVEN observations of the O exosphere on other nonthermal processes, such as sputtering.Plain Language Summary The first measurements of the emission brightness of the oxygen atomic exosphere by Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission have clearly shown that it is composed of a thermal component produced by the extension of the upper atmosphere and of a nonthermal component. Modeling these measurements allows us to constrain the origins of the exospheric O and, as a consequence, to estimate Mars' present oxygen escape rate. The good agreement between HELIOSARES set of models and the averaged measured profiles by IUVS during three periods of MAVEN measurements suggests that Mars' exospheric nonthermal component can be fully explained by the reactions of dissociative recombination of the O-2(+) ion in Mars' ionosphere, limiting significantly our ability to extract information from MAVEN observations of the O exosphere on other non-thermal processes, such as sputtering.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			2169-9097	2169-9100		WOS:000419993400002

However, the phase separation in these composites during water oxidation remains a critical issue that often results in degradation of electrochemical performance and debate on the mechanism and the active intermediates. In this study, we show that the introduction of Cr can efficiently transform the crystalline multiphase NiFe and CoFe oxides/hydroxides into homogeneous amorphous nanodots with sharply reduced nanoparticle size from tens of nanometers to merely 2-3 nm. Serving as an OER catalyst, the ternary NiFeCr and CoFeCr catalysts exhibit a smaller onset potential of similar to 1.51 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a stable OER performance during long-term water electrolysis. The impact of Cr on the NiFe and CoFe catalysts for OER kinetics was systematically investigated by operando electrochemical Raman spectroscopy. It is found that, for the NiFeCr compound, Cr can promote the generation of a more active beta-NiOOH phase than that of the NiFe composite during water oxidation. For the CoFe and CoFeCr systems, the introduction of Cr only disturbs the lattice crystallization. However, active CoOOH is spontaneously present on the surface of the composites upon making contact with KOH electrolyte, even without applying a potential. Thus, Co-based catalysts can easily achieve the "ready-to-serve" state for high-performance water oxidation without preactivation.									65	2	0	0	4	0	65			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000537657500020

Herein, we report the preparation of a series of trimetallic uniform MnxFeyNi-MOF-74 films in-situ grown on nickel foam, which can be utilized as bifunctional electrocatalysts towards overall water splitting in alkaline media. The introduction of Mn can simultaneously regulate the morphology of MOF-74 to form uniform film and modulate electronic structure of Fe to form more Fe(II)-O-Fe(III) motifs, which is conducive to the exposure of active sites and stabilizing high-valent metal sites. The optimized Mn0.52Fe0.71Ni-MOF-74 film electrode showed excellent electrocatalytic performance, affording a current density of 10 mA. cm(-2)at an overpotential of 99 mV for HER and 100 mA. cm(-2)at an overpotential of 267 mV for OER, respectively. Assembled as an electrolyser, Mn0.52Fe0.71Ni-MOF-74 film electrode exhibited excellent performance towards overall water splitting, with ultralow overpotential of 245 and 462 mV to achieve current density of 10 and 100 mA. cm(-2), respectively.

Within this context, four free-base porphyrins were studied as heterogeneous catalysts for the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER) in alkaline aqueous solutions. TEM and STEM analyses of samples obtained by drop-casting the porphyrins from different organic solvents on TEM grids revealed a rich variety of aggregates due to the self-assembling property of the porphyrin molecules. Modified electrodes were manufactured by applying the four tetrapyrrolic macrocycles from various solvents on the surface of graphite supports, in one or more layers. Experiments performed in 0.1 M and 1 M KOH electrolyte solutions allowed the identification of the most electrocatalytically active electrodes for the OER and HER, respectively. In the first case, the electrode was manufactured by applying three layers of 5-(4-pyridyl)-10,15,20-tris(4-phenoxyphenyl)porphyrin on the graphite substrate from N,N-dimethylformamide solution was identified as overall catalytically superior. In the second case, the electrode obtained by applying one layer of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-allyloxyphenyl)-porphyrin from benzonitrile solution displayed an HER overpotential value of 500 mV at i = -10 mA/cm(2) and a Tafel slope of 190 mV/dec.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2227-9717		WOS:000774713900001

The CoFe2O4 nanomesh arrays own numerous pores and large specific surface area, which is in favor of exposing more active sites. In consideration of the structural preponderances and versatility of the materials, the CoFe2O4 nanomesh arrays have been researched as the binder-free electrode materials for electrocatalysis and supercapacitors. When the CoFe(2)O(4)nanomesh arrays on nickel foam (CoFe2O4 NM-As/Ni) directly act as the free-binder catalyst toward catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of electrochemical water splitting, CoFe2O4 NM-As/Ni exhibits an admirable OER property with a low onset potential of 1.47 V(corresponding to the onset overpotential of 240 mV), a minimal overpotential (eta(10) = 253 mV), a small Tafel slope (44 mV dec(-1)), large anodic currents and long-term durability for 35 h in alkaline media. In addition, as an electrode of supercapacitors, CoFe2O4 NM-As/Ni obtains a desired specific capacitance (1426 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g), remarkable rate capability (1024 F/g at the current density of 20 A/g) and eminent capacitance retention (92.6% after 3000 cycles). The above results demonstrate the CoFe2O4 NM-As/Ni possesses great potential application in electrocatalysis and supercapacitors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In the fabrication, CNT-rGO is first prepared on VTP by roll coating, following which the vertically aligned MoS2 nanosheets are synthesized on the surface of CNT-rGO/VTP through a simple hydrothermal reaction. The catalyst exhibits excellent HER electrocatalytic activity including a low onset potential of 190 mV, Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(-1), and excellent stability in an acidic electrolyte solution. The excellent catalytic performance can be attributed to the abundant active edges provided by the vertically aligned MoSx nanosheets, as well as the effective electron transport provided by the CNT-rGO conductive substrate. Therefore, our study demonstrates an inexpensive and simple method to facilitate the large-scale application of non-noble catalysts. In addition, the method can be extended to the development of other transition metal dichalcogenide composite structures for electrochemical applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

PsbP induces conformational changes around the catalytic Mn cluster required for Ca2+ and Cl- retention, and the N-terminal region of PsbP is essential for this reaction. It was reported that PsbQ partially restores the functional defect of N-terminal truncated PsbP [Ifuku and Sato (2002) Plant Cell Physiol. 43, 1244-1249]; however, the mechanism of this restoration is yet to be clarified. In this study, we demonstrate that PsbQ is able to restore the functional binding of mutated PsbPs. In the presence of PsbQ Delta 15-PsbP, a truncated PsbP lacking 15 N-terminal residues, was able to specifically bind to NaCl-washed spinach PSII membranes and significantly restore the oxygen evolving activity. Furthermore, PsbQ was also able to compensate for the impaired ion-retention of H144A-PsbP, in which a conserved histidine at position 144 in the C-terminal domain was substituted with an alanine. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy showed that PsbQ restored the ability of Delta 15- and H144A-PsbP to induce proper conformational changes during S-1 to S-2 transition. These data suggest that the major function of PsbQ is to stabilize PsbP binding, thereby contributing to the maintenance of the catalytic Mn cluster of the water oxidation machinery in higher plant PSII.

Herein, three triazine-based CMPs (Ta-CMPs) with the same polymer backbone and different terminal groups (Ta-CMP, Ta-CMP-N, and Ta-CMP-CN) are synthesized via Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction using different end-capping agents. Although the Ta-CMPs show similar porous structure and comparable band gaps, Ta-CMP-CN with electron-withdrawing terminal group exhibits the highest hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 698 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) under visible light, while Ta-CMP-N with electron-donating terminal group exhibits the lowest HER of 99 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). It is found that the addition of electron-withdrawing terminal group can facilitate photoinduced charge separation, thus improving photocatalytic HER performance of the CMPs.									8	1	0	0	1	0	9			1022-1352	1521-3935		WOS:000485102500001

These oxides form the so-called Ruddlesden-Popper structure, comprising bilayer stacks of MnO6 octahedra, where Ca/Sr/La occupy the spaces within and between the stacks. The change in ionic radius from Ca2+ (1.18 angstrom) to Sr2+ (1.31 angstrom) results in a change in structural symmetry in these systems. Ca2LaMn2O7 has an orthorhombic structure with Cmcm space group, whereas Sr2LaMn2O7 features a tetragonal, I4/mmm, structure. The higher symmetry results in a signif-icant variation of electrical, magnetic and electrocatalytic properties. Sr2LaMn2O7 shows significantly greater charge transport in the entire temperature range of 25-800 degrees C, owing to a larger angle of Mn-O-Mn conduction pathway. In addition, the electrocatalytic properties of Sr2LaMn2O7 for hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) are enhanced as compared to Ca2LaMn2O7. This is manifested in the improved overpotential for both HER and OER, as well as enhanced reaction kinetics. The improved OER/HER activity is also a function of structural features that produce greater electrical conductivity, which in turn affects the electrocatalytic properties.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000870360000004

Incubation of the PSII membrane with Triton X-100 reduced the oxygen-evolving rate, modified the variable chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics, changed the protein secondary structures, altered the chlorophyll binding state to proteins and decreased the excitonic interaction of chlorophyll molecules. Phosphatidylcholine addition did not change the protein secondary structures, but could partially reactivate the reduced oxygen-evolving rate, and partly reversed the variable fluorescence parameters, the chlorophyll binding state and the excitonic interaction of the chlorophyll molecules. The results indicate that the phosphatidylcholine environment can optimize the tertiary structures of PSII.

Unfortunately, only Iridium (Ir)-based electrocatalysts show efficient and stable activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic medium, which seriously hampers the large-scale utilization of PEM water splitting electrolyser as a result of high cost and scarcity of the Ir. Here, we report synthesis of Ir nanoparticles on 3D graphite foam (Ir/GF) upon a heat treatment of Ir3+/polyaniline complex that were beforehand prepared on the GF. Benefiting from low content of Ir (5.91 wt%) and excellent resistance of 3D graphite foam against oxidative corrosion, the resultant Ir/GF functionalizes as a novel bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Noticeably, the HER and OER overpotentials of the Ir/GF at 10 mA/cm(2) are only similar to 7 mV and similar to 290 mV, respectively, which are much lower than those of commercial Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts as well as reported Pt or Ir-based electrocatalysts. Significantly, an acidic water-splitting electrolyser with a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) is steadily driven by the Ir/GF at a cell voltage of only similar to 1.55 V, which is substantially lower than 1.65 V for commercial Pt/C and Ir/C couple.									98	3	0	0	4	0	99			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000411687800004

The effects of heat-treatment (calcination) on the chemical, physical and electrochemical characteristics of the electrocatalyst are studied. Changes in the physical and chemical structure of the electrocatalyst due to heat-treatment were investigated using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, nitrogen physisorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrocatalysts were also electrochemically characterized using cyclic and linear sweep voltammetry measurements. The results showed that the IrOx(OH) y electrocatalyst synthesized with the polyol method had an amorphous structure with a particle size distribution of 1-5 nm. Calcination at temperatures higher that 500 degrees C increased the particle size of the iridium species to approximately 30 nm, decreased the surface area by 50%, and altered the structure of iridium based materials from amorphous iridium-hydroxyoxide (IrOx(OH)(y)) to crystalline iridium oxide (IrO2). Furthermore, the oxidation charge measured from the cyclic voltammograms decreased by roughly 80% and the Tafel slope increased by 25%. The amorphous IrOx(OH)(y) electrocatalyst had higher activity and better performance (more than 90%) compared to the crystalline IrO2. (C) 2017 The Electrochemical Society.

Previous studies suggested the possibility that the red-edge position for habitable exoplanets around M-dwarfs may be shifted to a longer wavelength than that for Earth. We investigated plausible red-edge position in terms of the light environment during the course of the evolution of phototrophs. We show that phototrophs on M-dwarf habitable exoplanets may use visible light when they first evolve in the ocean and when they first colonize the land. The adaptive evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis may eventually also use NIR radiation, by one of two photochemical reaction centers, with the other center continuing to use visible light. These "two-color" reaction centers can absorb more photons, but they will encounter difficulty in adapting to drastically changing light conditions at the boundary between land and water. NIR photosynthesis can be more productive on land, though its evolution would be preceded by the Earth-type vegetation. Thus, the red-edge position caused by photosynthetic organisms on habitable M-dwarf exoplanets could initially be similar to that on Earth and later move to a longer wavelength.									9	0	0	0	3	0	9			2045-2322			WOS:000407180200062	28790357

The Ru/C catalyst obtained from a mixed solvent of H2O and CH3CH2OH (Ru/C-H2O/CH3CH2OH), featured a chain-like porous structure, provides Pt-like catalytic properties with low overpotentials at -10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) within a wide range of pH values, i.e., 35 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, 53 mV in 1.0 M KOH, and 93 mV in 3.5 wt% NaCl. Ru/C is also an efficient hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalyst at all pH values. In the alkaline media, Ru/C-H2O/CH3CH2OH achieves a mass activity of 41.1 mA mg(-1) at an overpotential of 50 mV and a high exchange current density (0.65 mA cm(-2)). The work provides a facile strategy to synthesize highly active Ru/C catalysts for bifunctional HER and HOR electrocatalysis.									72	5	0	0	4	0	72			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000487570000007

The morphology of nanowires was investigated by SEM analyses. The contact angle of the nanowires was compared with that of planar film, which indicated higher hydrophilicity and surface energy of nanowires. Cyclic voltammetric and real-time Fourier transform electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (FTEIS) experiments were employed to study the anodic reaction on the surface. The cyclic voltammetric data showed the overpotential of nanowire array electrode decreased by more than 100 mV compared to that of the planar film electrode at an anodic current density of 400 A/m(2). A large body of impedance data acquired from the two electrodes as a function of scanned potential by running combined staircase cyclic voltammetry and FTEIS experiments led to systematic comparative analysis on the electrode/electrolyte interface. The changes in solution resistances, film resistances and capacitances, double layer capacitances, and polarization resistances observed during oxygen evolution process were compared and explained by corresponding electrochemical reactions. The nanowires of PbO2 showed a large active surface area led to higher capacitance than that of the planar electrode. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, manganese-modified cobalt phosphide (Mn-CoP) with a multi-hierarchical porous structure is prepared by phosphorizing a CoMn layer double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheet precursor, which is deposited on phosphorized nickel foam (NF-P) via a unipolar pulse electrodeposition (UPED) method at first. Herein, the NF-P endows a large porous frame structure, whereas the Mn-CoP layer is composed of reticular nanoplate arrays with a macropore structure and the Mn-CoP nanoplate is built by nanosheet arrays with a mesoporous structure. This multi-hierarchical porous structure benefits the diffusion of reactants and intermediate, as well as the generated gas. Consequently, the Mn-CoP/NF-Pbased electrode exhibits an ultra-low overpotential of 69 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 84 mV dec(-1). Moreover, it maintains a constant performance curve for at least 1000 cycles and shows an extreme long duration of at least 100 h even under a high current density (e.g., 100 mA cm(-2)).									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2574-0962			WOS:000733843200001

Through CoMo-MOF and NF sulfuration together, NF surface participates in the reaction and grows uniform needle-shaped Ni3S2 nanorods, while CoMo-MOF transforms into CoMoS, hollow polyhedral particles, which are attached to the surface of Ni(3)S(2 )rods and formed Ni3S2-CoMoSx/NF composite. It was found that there is an obvious synergistic effect between CoMoSx, Ni3S2 and NF, thus obtaining excellent catalytic activity for both OER and HER. The overpotential of Ni3S2-CoMoSx /NF catalyst at 10 mA cm(-2) is only 234 and 90 mV for HER and OER. In addition, Ni3S2-CoMoSx/NF also exhibits excellent performance in the process of overall water splitting. It can reach 10 mA cm(-2) at only 1.52 V and the catalytic performance remain stable for 65 h. Therefore, the self-supporting Ni3S2-CoMoSx /NF can become a highly efficient and long-term durable bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Developing active and robust HER-GOR bifunctional electrocatalysts is of vital significance for constructing a water-glycerol co-electrolysis system. Herein, Ru-doped heterostructured nickel phosphide/nitrogen-doped carbon (Ru-NixPy/N-C) hybrid nanosheet arrays were fabricated by controlled phosphorization of NiRu-based metal-organic framework nanosheet array precursors. With the synergism of the hetero-phase Ni2P-Ni12P5 interface effect and Ru-doping induced strain effect, the Ru-NixPy/N-C arrays grown on Ni foam (Ru-NixPy/N-C/NF) could efficiently electrocatalyze both the HER (-10 mA cm(-2)@ -0.031 V vs. RHE) and GOR (10 mA cm(-2) @1.32 V vs. RHE). Remarkably, the Ru-NixPy/N-C/NF||Ru-NixPy/N-C/NF two-electrode system could enable simultaneous efficient H-2 generation and formate electrosynthesis from a 1 M KOH solution containing 0.1 M glycerol, deriving a 10 mA cm(-2) current density at a low cell voltage of 1.36 V.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000851576700001

Further improvements aim at increasing its activity and selectivity toward either of these value-added species, while reducing the amount of hydrogen produced as a side product. With this motivation, in this work, we synthesized a range of unsupported, bimetallic PdPt aerogels and pure Pt or Pd aerogels and extensively characterized them using various microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. These revealed that the aerogels' porous web consists of homogenous alloys of Pt and Pd, with palladium and platinum being present on their surface for all compositions. The subsequent determination of these aeorgels' CO2RR performance unveiled that the high activity of these Pt surface atoms toward hydrogen evolution causes all PdPt alloys to favor this reaction over CO2 reduction. In the case of the pure Pd aerogel, although, its unsupported nature leads to a suppression of H-2 evolution and a concomitant increase in the selectivity toward CO when compared to a commercial, carbon-supported Pd-nanoparticle catalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000830931600001

Electrochemical hydrogen production has been regarded as a viable and promising strategy. The overall water splitting is currently the predominant electrochemical hydrogen production method, which could be driven by renewable energy to achieve sustainable production. However, the current challenges are the intrinsically sluggish and energy-intensive oxygen evolution reduction (OER) at the anode and the expensive noble metal-based catalysts for overall water splitting, which limit the practical applications. Extensive efforts have been made to develop bifunctional non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts to boost hydrogen production efficiency and lower the cost. Meanwhile, alternative oxidation reactions with faster kinetics and less energy requirement than OER are being explored as the anodic reaction to couple with the hydrogen evolution reaction for energy-saving hydrogen production. In this review, the non-noble metal-based bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting, as well as other novel energy-saving hydrogen productions have been introduced and summarized. Current challenges and outlooks are commented on at the end of the article.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000773863800002		
J	AYRE, CR; MADIX, RJ								THE ADSORPTION AND REACTION OF 1,2-PROPANEDIOL ON AG(110) UNDER OXYGEN LEAN CONDITIONS								SURFACE SCIENCE				303	3			279	296		10.1016/0039-6028(94)90776-5				FEB 20 1994	1994	The adsorption and reaction of 1,2-propanediol CH3CH(OH)CH2OH(g) on clean and oxygen-activated Ag(110) has been studied using temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS), isotopic labelling experiments, and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). On the clean surface the diol adsorbs reversibly, desorbing with an activation energy of approximately 16 kcal mol-1 at 265 K from a monolayer state and at 215 K from a multilayer state. Vibrational spectra at both 1,2-propanediol coverages are in good agreement with those for liquid 1,2-propanediol. On oxygen-activated Ag(110) 1,2-propanediol reacts with O(a) by 215 K to form adsorbed 1,2-propanedioxy OCH(CH3)CH2O(a) and water. 1,2-propanedioxy is stable up to 285 K, at which temperature C-H bond scission begins. A mixture of acetol CH3C(=O)CH2OH and, most probably, lactaldehyde CH3CH(OH)CH=O evolves between 285-380 K, with the maximum rate of formation occurring at 340 K. 1,2-propanediol, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and water evolve at 350 K Results of isotopic labelling experiments indicate that pre-adsorbed O-18(a) atoms are incorporated only into the carbon dioxide and water products. These data suggest that oxygen atoms remain adsorbed to temperatures above 300 K at which they oxidize adsorbed 1,2-propanedioxy. Pyruvaldehyde CH3C(=O)CH=O and one or more m/q 74 products, tentatively identified as a mixture of acetol and lactaldehyde, evolve at 390 K Additional carbon dioxide is produced at 410-450 K and 550 K, and residual carbon due to incomplete combustion of 1,2-propanedioxy remains adsorbed after the surface is heated to 700 K. The evolution of a mixture of acetol and lactaldehyde, rather than only the more stable product, acetol, is attributed to the small difference in C-H bond strengths of the C-H bonds at carbon-1 (primary C-H) and carbon-2 (secondary C-H) coupled with the possible effect of steric hindrance due to the methyl substituent at carbon-2. The reaction of 1,2-propanediol with O(a) to yield 1,2-propanedioxy and the subsequent decomposition of this intermediate with heating emphasizes that O-H bond activation and C-H bond scission are general mechanisms for the partial oxidation of diols on Ag(110).									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			0039-6028			WOS:A1994NA60600005

Here, we report a unique two-dimensional (2D) "Egg Waffle"-like heterostructure, i.e., gold nanoparticles intercalated in a palladium nanosheet (AuNP-in-PdNS), effectively interfacing Au NPs with 2D Pd for greatly enhancing electrocatalytic activity under light illumination. A considerable electrocatalytic enhancement, i.e., a small overpotential of 19 mV (i.e., 4-fold decrease) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction and an improved oxygen reduction reaction with a half-wave potential of 0.882 V, is achieved on the 2D AuNP-in-PdNS heterostructure due to excitation of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The unique heterostructure and strongly enhanced localized field intensity under LSPR excitation could result in hot electrons concentrated on the surface of Pd NSs and direct transfer of plasmonic energy to metal-adsorbate complexes, manifesting as a reduction of the apparent activation barrier in the electrocatalysis. This study provides insight into both the design of efficient electrocatalysts and the distinct role of LSPR excitation in plasmon-enhanced electrocatalysis.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000716773800081

Although tremendous efforts have been devoted to the search of alternative materials, Pt/C is still the most efficient electrocatalyst for the HER. Nevertheless, decreasing the loading of Pt in the designed eletrocatalysts is of significance. However, with low Pt loading, it is challenging to maintain excellent catalytic performance. Herein, a new catalyst (Pt/NPC) was prepared by dispersing Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs) with an average diameter of 1.8 nm over a three-dimensional (3D) carbon network co-doped with N and P. Because of the high electronegativity of the N and P dopants, PtNPs were uniformly dispersed on the carbon network via high electronic affinity between Pt and carbon, affording a Pt/NPC catalyst; Pt/NPC exhibited superior HER activity, attributed to the down-shift of the Pt d-band caused by the donation of charge from N and P to Pt. The results show that Pt/NPC with an ultralow Pt loading of 1.82 wt.% exhibits excellent HER performance, which corresponds to a HER mass activity 20.6-fold greater than that observed for commercial 20% Pt/C at an overpotential of 20 mV vs. RHE.									75	4	0	0	2	0	75			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000390066000020

The role of the redox-inactive ion in the cluster has not yet been fully clarified, although several experimental data are available on Ca2+-depleted and Ca2+-substituted PSII complexes, indicating Sr2+-substituted PSII as the only modification that preserves oxygen evolution. In this work, we investigated the structural and electronic properties of the PSII catalytic core with Ca2+ replaced with Sr2+ and Cd2+ in the S-2 state of the Kok Joliot cycle by means of density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics based on a quantum mechanics/ molecular mechanics approach. Our calculations do not reveal significant differences between the substituted and wild-type systems in terms of geometries, thermodynamics, and kinetics of two previously identified intermediate states along the S-2 to S-3 transition, namely, the open cubane s(2)(A) and closed cubane S-2(B) conformers. Conversely, our calculations show different pK(a) values for the water molecule bound to the three investigated heterocations. Specifically, for Cd-substituted PSII, the pK(a) value is 5.3 units smaller than the respective value in wild type Ca-PSII. On the basis of our results, we conclude that, assuming all the cations sharing the same binding site, the induced difference in the acidity of the binding pocket might influence the hydrogen bonding network and the redox levels to prevent the further evolution of the cycle toward the S-3 state.									20	0	0	0	12	0	20			0006-2960			WOS:000362243700018	26346422

The transformation process of the tungsten species loaded on CdS together with the junctions formed between WS2 and CdS are clearly demonstrated with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Photocatalytic H-2 production on WS2/CdS catalysts under visible light (lambda > 420 nm) shows that WS2 cocatalyst plays a crucial role in H-2 production. Under optimum conditions, the rate of H-2 evolution can be increased by up to 28 times when CdS was loaded with only 1.0 wt % WS2, and WS2 demonstrates a catalytic performance comparable or even superior to those of noble metals. Photocatalytic reaction results and electrochemical measurements indicate that the significantly enhanced H-2 evolution of WS2/CdS catalyst mainly owns to the junctions formed between WS2 and CdS and the excellent performance of WS2 as a cocatalyst in catalyzing H-2 evolution.									337	28	1	0	23	0	347			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000291709600041

Herein, an effective precursor modulated active sites engineering strategy of N, S co doped graphene nanosheets (NSG) were developed by one step pyrolysis of 5-aminouracil (ANA) as N-containing precursor, ammonium persulfate (AP) and 2, 5-dithiobiurea (DBA) as S source, respectively. The results indicate that the specific N doping species in NSG and their synergetic effect with S dopants is strongly dependent on the S sources, which induces huge divergence of electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of NSG nanosheets for ORR and OER. The NSG prepared by ANA and AP as precursors with dominant graphitic N dopant coordinated with S possess the best ORR performance with half-wave potential, E-1/2 of 0.87 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M KOH and poor OER performance with a high potential of 1.67 V at 10.0 mA cm(-2), E-j=10. On the other hand NSG derived from ANA and DBA with dominant pyridinic N and pyrrolic N dopants exhibits the highest bifunctional activity for both OER and ORR with & UDelta;E (& UDelta;E = E-j=10-E-1/2) of 0.73 V and the performance has been verified on a rechargeable ZnAir battery fabricated by NSG with a peak power density of 146 mWGreek ano teleiacm(-2), specific capacity of 796 mAhGreek ano teleia(gZn)(-1), higher than that with state-of-the art Pt/C and IrO2 (1:1 wt%) air electrode at the same catalyst loading. These excellent performance fundamentally originates from the optimized intermediates energy of ORR or/and OER via the constructed configuration of S and different N species in graphene nanosheets prepared by the specific N and S precursors. The dependence of electrocatalytic selectivity and activity for ORR or/and OER on different N, S configurations revealed in this study provides a facile strategy to achieve specific active sites configurations for developing bifunctional metal-free electrocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000770328100003

Annealing produces shifts in asymmetric vs. symmetric CF2 stretch intensities, as well as initiating of CH stretches. In the 1400-2000 cm(-1) range, a systematic change from carbon-carbon double bonding structures to carbon-oxygen bonding structures results. These variations may be due to either additional oxygen absorption after annealing or reaction between oxygen and fluorocarbon network sites that were previously unavailable due to the steric hindrance. In most films, the thermal stability was dominated by oxygen and hydrogen uptake. The film with the highest oxygen and hydrogen content after annealing also had the lowest thermal stability. Thus, minimizing both CF3 and susceptibility to oxygen and water uptake by the deposited films would appear to be a valid strategy for increasing film thermal stability.

Herein, porous carbon-supported PtNi alloy catalysts were fabricated by ion beam sputtering and ultrasonic-assisted electrochemical corrosion dealloying methods, and their performances toward the catalysis of HER were evaluated. The effects of corrosion dealloying on the hydrogen evolution activity, as well as stability, phase structure, surface composition, and active sites of PtNi alloys were analyzed by various analytical methods combined with orthogonal experiments. The results showed increased catalytic activity of HER by 51.39% after corrosion of the material in 0.2 mol/L H2SO4 at 40 degrees C for 0.5 h. The hydrogen evolution deteriorated as Pt-loading decreased by 25.83%, and corrosion temperature displayed significant influence. The pore structure of the catalyst surface raised the relative content of the exposed Pt element, and the zero-dimensional defect generated by the Ni atom deletion led to promotion in reaction area and active sites on the catalyst surface. The interplanar spacing of alloys (NiPt) was below 3%-6% of the standard value, and the lattice compressive strain of Pt was the reason that led to improved catalytic performance of PtNi alloy catalysts. The binding energy of the Pt 4f7/2 decreased by 0.74 eV, leading to enhanced electrochemical active sites and promoted hydrogen release. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, molecular scaffolds providing multimetallic sites are increasingly being exploited to develop cooperative redox catalysts. Herein, we report a multicopper complex based on a peptide antibiotic, daptomycin (dap), which mediates O-O bond formation and activation reactions. In alkaline media, UV-vis and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy showed that dap stabilized up to four Cu(ii) ions (Cu-n-dap, n = 1-4) in a square planar Cu-N-4 geometry, with an axially bound H2O or OH ligand. Cooperative rate enhancement was observed for the O-2 activation, H2O2 disproportionation, and O-2 evolution reactions, only in the presence of the multimetallic Cu complex. In situ Raman spectroscopy was used to study the intermediate species involved in the electrochemical O-2 evolution reaction and understand the catalytic mechanism behind the O-O bond formation. The observed Cu-O species related to the Cu2O2 core suggested a possible radical coupling pathway for the O-O bond formation. This study provides a strategy to repurpose natural calcium-binding peptide antibiotics as ligands, to create multimetallic sites for cooperative catalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000830665900001

The surface of the stainless steel was further chemically treated with an etching solution to expose the grain boundaries. The grain boundary enriched surface resulted in more active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in additively manufactured treated (AM-T) 316L stainless steel. AM-T sample manifests enhanced catalytic activity for OER with an overpotential of 310 mV to draw a 10 mA/cm(2) current density, along with a lower Tafel slope of 42 mV/dec compared to AM and wrought samples. These features were validated from the increased double-layer capacitance of AM-T and approximately 1.5 times larger electrochemically effective surface area of AM-T due to etching treatment compared to the wrought sample. Furthermore, AM-T also possesses stable activity retention for 100 h at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we report that a mixed-polymorph film comprising maghemite and hematite, prepared using spray pyrolysis deposition followed by low-temperature annealing, showed a sustained OER rate (>24 h) corresponding to a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an initial overpotential of 650 mV, with a Tafel slope of only 56 mV dec(-1) and near-100% Faradaic efficiency in 0.5 M H2SO4 (pH 0.3). This performance is remarkable, since iron (III) oxide films comprising only maghemite were found to exhibit a comparable intrinsic activity, but considerably lower stability for OER, while films of pure hematite were OER-inactive. These results are explained by the differences in the polymorph crystal structures, which cause different electrical conductivity and surface interactions with water molecules and protons. Our findings not only reveal the potential of iron (III) oxide as acid-stable OER catalyst, but also highlight the important yet hitherto largely unexplored effect of crystal polymorphism on electrocatalytic OER performance.

Archaeal superoxide dismutases in the protection of intra- and extracellular oxidative stress								FRONTIERS IN BIOSCIENCE-LANDMARK				5				D768	D779		10.2741/cannio				SEP 1 2000	2000	Both "environmental chemistry" and metabolic biochemical reactions can constantly generate in vivo free radicals and other oxygen-derived species that can cause severe damage to almost all biomolecules, especially to DNA, proteins, and lipids. The superoxide anion has been shown to be the most readily generated and spread radical among organisms and it is a common intermediate of oxidative stress processes in the cells. The antioxidant defense system of superoxide dismutases (SOD) scavenges and minimizes the formation of this radical, and thus plays a major role in reducing cumulative oxidative damage in different cell compartments both in aerobic and anaerobic cells. In the cell, cytosol SODs are constitutively present and induced by many oxidative agents able to raise the superoxide concentrations. Presence of SODs, however, in extracellular cell-associated locations demonstrates how valuable they are in maintaining the integrity of cells against oxidative stress generated by the cell environment, particularly upon increased oxygenation. Because SODs have recently been found in Archaea, which are prokaryotes, sometimes living in extreme environments, even in anaerobic ones, these enzymes can be considered essential: they may have allowed the evolution of aerobic respiration starting from an ancient form of oxygen-insensitive life.									46	1	2	0	38	2	50			1093-9946	1093-4715		WOS:000089686200003	10966869

This sintering aid highly improved the sintering efficiency of ZrB2 ceramics at medium temperature (1000-1600 degrees C), which showed a different service temperature range from that of traditional crystal additives. The microstructure and densification behavior of ZrB2-SiBCN samples were mainly studied. The polymer structural evolution including construction, rearrangement, and crystallization of the amorphous SiBCN network, made a large contribution to the densification of ZrB2 ceramics. The carbothermal reduction of pyrolysis carbon with oxide impurities could not only decrease the oxygen content, but also develop the activity of chemical bonds in SiBCN network. Diffusions and reactions at the interface also benefited the microstructure and consolidation of ZrB2-SiBCN ceramics.									13	2	0	0	0	0	13			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000459937200031

As a robust integrated 2D hydrogen-evolving cathode catalyst, the Pd3.02Te NWs/rGO shows a low onset potential of -7 mV and maintains its catalytic activity for at least 48 h in alkaline media. It requires overpotentials (eta) of 97 and 355 mV to afford current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively.

Herein, a facile strategy to synthesize Ti3C2Tx MXene by ultrasonication with controlled N-doping is reported. The surface modification of MXene can be achieved by the formation of Ti-N chemical bonds at an optimized ultrasonic temperature, which will further enhance the HER activity. Specifically, at the ultrasonic temperature of 35 degrees C, the N-doped MXene (N-MXene-35) exhibits the highest concentration of Ti-N bond, delivering an extraordinary HER activity with an overpotential of 162 mV (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acid media, which is 3.5 times lower than that of the pristine MXene (578 mV vs. RHE). As expected, the obtained N-MXene-35 affords the best HER electrocatalytic performance among the MXene or N-doped MXene electrode as so far reported. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The catalytic system represented by metal-supported catalysts is an important process of upgrading the hydrogen source in industry. Single-atom catalysts (SACs), which inherit the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, provide a broad prospect for low-cost H-2 production technology. This review focuses on the potential mechanisms in the rational design of SACs, including active sites, coordination configuration, mass loading, heteroatom-doping, and metal-support interaction. The design strategies of single metal atoms on different supports are reviewed to give a proposal on how to immobilize the atomic active sites and modulate the geometric/electronic structures of SACs. Subsequently, the synergistic effect in SACs and the dynamic evolution of the atomically dispersed heterometal catalysts are introduced, aiming to provide further guidelines for H-2 evolution SACs. H-2 generation from the water-gas shift reaction and electro-/photocatalytic water splitting are the main research directions at present. The latest progress of SACs employed in these applications is thoroughly reviewed. At the end of this review, personal perspectives on the prospects and challenges of H-2 evolution SACs are put forward, hoping to promote the rapid development of SACs toward superior H-2 evolution performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000804487700001

Oxide electrodes were characterized electrochemically by cyclic voltammetry and steady-state current-potential curves in aqueous H2SO4. Integration of voltammetric curves gave the surface charge which is proportional to the surface concentration of active sites. A maximum was observed for a calcination temperature around 430degreesC. A hump is visible close to 500degreesC, indicating a second transition. O-2 evolution was found to take place on Ti/RhOx electrodes with a Tafel slope close to 80 mV and a reaction order with respect to H+ slightly <vertical bar-1 vertical bar. The mechanism did not depend appreciably on the calcination temperature. The layer of RhOx was found to resist to O-2 evolution, as indicated by the stability of the voltammetric charge in the course of the experiments. The activity is dominated by surface area effects, true electrocatalytic factors being marginal. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a hierarchical spongy electrocatalyst with active NiFe Prussian blue analogues and nickel carbides interface (NiFe-PBA/Ni3C(B)) is proposed and fabricated by a borate-assisted strategy. The unique structure and matchable interface benefit from the desorption of borate ligands in-situ during the pyrolysis and carbonization process. The optimal electrocatalyst composing of metal-organic framework (NiFe prussian blue analogues) in conjunction with a metallic transition carbide phase (nickel carbide) exhibits an ultra-low overpotential of only 196 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 30.1 mV dec(-1) for OER in KOH. The robust water oxidation performance can be ascribed to the abundant adsorption sites and effective interfacial interaction. In addition, computational simulations further confirm that NiFe-PBA/Ni3C(B) is favorable for OER since the optimized electronic distribution and metal-3d orbitals interact around Fermi level at the interface. This research provides a new insight into rationally designing efficient electrocatalysts via morphology engineering and integrating different functional phase with complementary advantages for catalysis application.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000772952100001

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) circumvents permeation difficulties, but relies on gas-surface reactions to initiate growth. Our work demonstrates that modified surfaces within vertically aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays, from plasma and molecular precursor treatments, can lead to improved catalyst deposition. Gas phase functionalization influences the number of ALD nucleation sites and the onset of ALD growth and, in turn, affects the uniformity of the coating along the length of the CNTs within the aligned arrays. The induced chemical changes for each functionalization route are identified by X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopies. The most effective functionalization routes increase the prevalence of oxygen moieties at defect sites on the carbon surfaces. The striking effects of the functionalization are demonstrated with ALD Pt growth as a function of surface treatment and ALD cycles examined by electron microscopy of the arrays and the individual CNTs. Finally, we demonstrate applicability of these materials as fuel cell electrocatalysts and show that surface functionalization affects their performance towards oxygen reduction reaction.

In addition, the effect of refining process and utilization of different slags on the evolution of inclusions, titanium yield, and oxygen content was systematically investigated by experimental and thermodynamic analysis. The results reveal that the total oxygen content (TO) and inclusion density decreased during the refining process. The spherical CaO-SiO2-Al2O3-MgO inclusions existed in the 321 stainless steel after the AOD process. Moreover, prior to the Ti addition, the spherical CaO-Al2O3-MgO-SiO(2)inclusions were observed during LF refining process. However, Ti addition resulted in multilayer CaO-Al2O3-MgO-TiO(x)inclusions. Two different samples were prepared by conventional CaO-Al2O3-based slag (Heat-1) and TiO2-rich CaO-Al2O3-based slag (Heat-2). The statistical analysis revealed that the density of inclusions and the TiO(x)content in CaO-Al2O3-MgO-TiO(x)inclusions found in Heat-2 sample are much lower than those in the Heat-1 sample. Furthermore, the TO content and Ti yield during the LF refining process were controlled by using TiO2-rich calcium aluminate synthetic slag. These results were consistent with the ion-molecule coexistence theory and FactSage (TM) 7.2 software calculations. When TiO2-rich CaO-Al2O3-based slag was used, the TiO(2)activity of the slag increased, and the equilibrium oxygen content significantly decreased from the AOD to LF processes. Therefore, the higher TiO(2)activity of slag and lower equilibrium oxygen content suppressed the undesirable reactions between Ti and O.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			1006-706X	2210-3988		WOS:000543322300002

Co3O4-based electrocatalysts have been of particular interests due to high OER activity. In the present work, a series of transitionmetal-doped Co3O4 electrocatalysts have been prepared for systematic investigation of impact of dopants on the activity and durability. For the OER, the addition of dopant improves activity of catalysts, with Sn-doped Co3O4 (Sn-Co3O4) showing the best electrocatalytic activity followed by Ni-Co3O4, Fe-Co3O4, and Co3O4 (in the order of activity). Highly active Sn-Co3O4 and Ni-Co3O4 reach 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 0.354 V and 0.360 V, respectively, which is close to Ir/C (0.373 V). The addition of transition metal invokes change of crystallite size of Co3O4 and the overpotential of each catalyst shows a linear relationship with the crystallite size and geometric surface area. The Ni-Co3O4 catalyst exhibits significantly enhanced durability compared to the pure Co3O4 catalyst. Raman spectra and transmission electron microscopy after cycling tests reveal that the incorporation of multivalent Ni cations on the octahedral and tetrahedral sites of spinel structure Co3O4 effectively mitigates surface amorphization of catalysts, thereby enhancing the durability.

J	Liu, Yu; Sun, Shichao; Zheng, Xinyu; Li, Di; Zhu, Jianjun; Zhang, Mingmei; Jiang, Deli								Synergizing Cobalt Ruthenium Alloy with Chromium Oxyhydroxide for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Splitting.								Inorganic chemistry											10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c02560				2022-Oct-24	2022	Constructing a coupling interface of multicomponents with different functions is of considerable importance for designing an advanced bifunctional water splitting electrode. Particularly, designing and developing alloy/oxyhydroxide-integrated electrodes have emerged as a tendency yet remain a considerable challenge. In this work, a novel 3D nanostructure electrocatalyst assembled from CoRu nanoalloy and CrOOH nanosheets (denoted as CoRu-CrOOH/NF) was directly grown on nickel foam via a successive hydrothermal method. The unique synergy in CoRu-CrOOH/NF heterostructures is not only conducive to strengthening charge transfer capability and accelerating the reaction kinetics but also favors the redistribution of charge within the interface, thus improving the electrocatalytic performance. In view of the above-mentioned points, the resultant CoRu-CrOOH/NF displays outstanding catalytic performance with overpotentials of 26 and 272 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 50 mA cm-2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Remarkably, the symmetrical two-electrode cell using CoRu-CrOOH/NF only acquires 1.47 V at 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH, which is superior to many other state-of-the-art overall water-splitting electrocatalysts. This holistic work provides a new insight to designing alloy/oxyhydroxide-integrated electrodes for high-efficiency overall water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1520-510X		MEDLINE:36280894	36280894

The synthesized oxide powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), BET, and electrical conductivity measurements. The morphology of the powders was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results revealed that the use of propanol led systematically to the formation of homogeneous oxides with a single perovskite-structure phase, larger surface area, and higher conductivity values compared with those prepared using water. Such features, which seem to be directly related to the properties of the solvent of the starting solution, are undoubtedly favorable for a higher electrocatalytic activity of these oxides in oxygen electrode reactions.

J	Bukhov, NG; Boucher, N; Carpentier, R								Aftereffect of short-term heat shock on photosynthetic reactions in barley leaves								RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				44	4			526	532						JUL-AUG 1997	1997	Effects of preheating 8- to 10-day-old barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) leaves at 40-46 degrees C on oxygen evolution, chlorophyll fluorescence, and photoacoustic signals were examined. Preheating of leaves at 40 degrees C led to a threefold decrease in the initial slope of the light-response curve of photosynthesis and a marked enhancement of the nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence, which indicates a drastic increase in the nonradiative dissipation of absorbed light quanta. The maximum photosynthetic activity attained at saturating light and elevated CO2 concentration was suppressed by this heat treatment by no more than 30%. The photochemical activity of PS LT reaction centers in dark-adapted leaves also decreased to the same extent after the heat treatment. In preheated leaves, strong light pulses increased the photobaric component of the photoacoustic signal (measured at 35 Hz) instead of suppressing the signal. The magnitude of the rise-phase of the photoacoustic signal increased with the preheating temperature. An enhancement of the photoacoustic signal induced by strong light pulses was also observed in leaves in which the normal photosynthetic process was disturbed by feeding them methylviologen. It is concluded that the short-term heating of leaves impairs photochemical conversion of light quanta in reaction centers of PS II due to an increase in the magnitude of the proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. This indicates that dark reactions of photosynthesis in preheated leaves cannot efficiently use the ATP and reduced NADP formed in the course of photosynthetic electron transport.

To synthesize four kinds of CPs, two donor units (phenylene and fluorene) and two acceptor groups (benzothiadiazole and bisthienylbenzothiadiazole) were cross combined. The cyclic voltammograms of the CPs showed their generation ability for ROS, in which the ROS generation efficiency would depend on the main chain structure. Because the CPs are inherently hydrophobic, they were fabricated in nanoparticle (NP) form for convenient use in an aqueous solution. The CP NPs showed excellent dye degradability under visible light. In addition, CPs were incorporated in a filter paper to provide repeated uses after simple washing. The ROS generation from CPs played an important role in dye degradation, as well as in H-2 evolution of up to 8.4 mmol/g under visible-light irradiation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0032-3861	1873-2291		WOS:000713697100006

The TOS process includes cyclization, oxidation and tautomerization, as characterized by the evolution of the overlapping peaks of cyclic C=C, C=N, N-H and C=O vibrations in FT-IR. The second derivatives of the spectra facilitate the identification of the position of each contributing structure. The following peak-fitting operations and the determination of the molar absorption coefficients using model compounds allow the quantitative tracking of the extent of the TOS process. PAI containing approximately 3 mol % IA exhibits the most efficient TOS process in terms of cyclization, oxygen uptake and dehydrogenation reactions. A quantitative investigation of the evolution of PAI using FT-IR is an efficient way to determine the optimal structural characteristics of the precursors for carbon materials.									83	2	0	0	0	0	84			0024-9297	1520-5835		WOS:000323193300008

Herein, we propose a solar thermoelectric water electrolysis system using multifunctional iron foam-supported iron sulfide nanosheet arrays (FeS/IF) as the photothermal conversion unit in solar thermoelectric generator (STEG) and electroactive electrode in water electrolysis. The photothermal FeS/IF rapidly converts solar light to localized heat, supplying the desirable temperature difference for thermoelectric power generation. Meanwhile, the FeS/IF acts as a bifunctional electrode to effectively catalyze the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline media. As a prototype integrated system, four series-connected FeS/IF-STEG are applied to self-power water splitting with the production rate of 10.7 and 5.3 mmol h(-1) for hydrogen and oxygen, respectively. The present study offers new opportunities for rational design of integrated energy systems from renewable solar to sustainable hydrogen. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Anodizing was conducted in 2 M H2SO4 solution with the addition of 0, 10, 20, and 30% EG at a constant current 300 A/m(2) at 10 degrees C. The cross-sectional morphology was studied by FE-SEM and the elemental composition was analyzed by EDX. The mechanical hardness was measured by a Vickers Hardness machine. The results indicated that the addition of EG improved the films adherent on the substrates by preventing the founation of cracks and the enrichment of the inteunetallic phases at the film-substrate interface. The presence of EG accelerated oxidation reaction of the inteunetallic phase. The competing oxidation reactions led to the significant decrease in film thickness from 38 mu m down to below 20 mu m with the addition of EG. The film found in EG containing electrolyte composed not only aluminum oxide but also copper and zinc oxides. The film folined in EG containing electrolytes exhibited microvoids as a result of oxygen gas evolution which accompanied the oxidation reaction of the intermetallic phase. As a consequence, the mechanical hardness decreased with increasing EG concentration.					4th International Symposium on Frontier of Applied Physics (ISFAP)4th International Symposium on Frontier of Applied Physics (ISFAP)	NOV 01-02, 2018NOV 01-02, 2018	Indonesian Inst Sci, Res Ctr PhysIndonesian Inst Sci, Res Ctr Phys	Tangerang Selatan, INDONESIATangerang Selatan, INDONESIA	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1742-6588	1742-6596	*****************	WOS:000471653200033

The method is applied to dark cloud cores along the TMC-1 ridge, using the abundance ratios between DCO+ and (HCO+)-C-13 combined with the new standard model network of gas-phase chemical reactions. The difference in deuterium fractionation between the ammonia peak and the cyanopolyyne peak, though its error transferred from the observed data is relatively large, is explained by a time difference in the evolutionary age of more than 10(5) yr, or by a small change in the depletion factor of carbon and oxygen, which also indicates the degree of core evolution. The method of determining the evolutionary age of dark cloud cores is somewhat free from the details of chemical reaction not directly related to deuterium fractionation. The present result is compared with those from other methods.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0004-637X			WOS:000174989900024

In this work, MoSe2- CoSe2@CoAl-LDH composite was synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method. Compare with the CoAlLDH catalyst, the prepared MoSe2-CoSe2@CoAl-LDH composite exhibits an excellent OER performance with a low overpotential (320 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2)), a small Tafel slope (71 mV.dec(-1)). The prominent OER performance of the MoSe2-CoSe2@CoAl-LDH composite can be mainly attributed to the fast electron transfer from the CoAl-LDH to MoSe2-CoSe2 and the catalytic activity promoted by the energy change of Co2+ due to the introduction of Se, which can be confirmed by EIS and XPS results, respectively. The strategy of this work may provide a low-cost and facile way for large-scale synthesis of non-precious metal modified hydrotalcite composite. (C) 2021 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

Owing to the exposure of more dangling bonds, amorphous structure is the ideal precursor to convert into the actual active phase in the process of electrocatalysis. Herein, amorphous cobalt phosphosulfide electrocatalysts are fabricated by a facile electrodeposition method on nickel foams as efficient bifunctional electrodes for overall water splitting. And benefited from the introduction of phosphorus and sulfur, the quantities of precursor sites are increased and the electronic state around cobalt is reconstructed, which provides more active phases and facilitates the transport efficiency of electrons. Electrochemical test results reveal that, the as-prepared cobalt phosphosulfide electrodes require overpotentials as low as 58 and 283 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Tafel slopes and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy further illustrate a favorable kinetic during electrolysis. Meanwhile, it only requires a low cell voltage of 1.6 V for cobalt phosphosulfide electrodes to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting.									37	5	0	0	1	0	36			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000474500700021

Nonetheless, its potential ineven small proteins is inherently limited by the astronomical number of possible amino acid sequences. Sampling the complete sequence space of a 100-residue protein would require testing of 20100 combinations, which is beyond any existing experimental approach. In practice, selective modification of relatively few residues is sufficient for efficient improvement, functional enhancement and repurposing of existing proteins5. Moreover, computational methods have been developed to predict the locations and, in certain cases, identities of potentially productive mutations6-9. Importantly, all current approaches for prediction of hot spots and productive mutations rely heavily on structural information and/or bioinformatics, which is not always available for proteins of interest. Moreover, they offer a limited ability to identify beneficial mutations far from the active site, even though such changes may markedly improve the catalytic properties of an enzyme10. Machine learning methods have recently showed promise in predicting productive mutations11, but they frequently require large, high-quality training datasets, which are difficult to obtain in directed evolution experiments. Here we show that mutagenic hot spots in enzymes can be identified using NMR spectroscopy. In a proof-of-concept study, we converted myoglobin, a non-enzymatic oxygen storage protein, into a highly efficient Kemp eliminase using only three mutations. The observed levels of catalytic efficiency exceed those of proteins designed using current approaches and are similar with those of natural enzymes for the reactions that they are evolved to catalyse. Given the simplicity of this experimental approach, which requires no a priori structural or bioinformatic knowledge, we expect it to be widely applicable and to enable the full potential of directed enzyme evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1476-4687		MEDLINE:36198791	36198791

Herein, a facile and stabilizer-free strategy was exploited to decorate of ultrafine and well-dispersive Pd nanoparticles (similar to 2.8 nm) on mesocellular graphene network (MGN) that was templated by zeolite MCM-22. It was found that optimal oxygen defects in MGN templated by zeolite framework Al sites were contributed to the ultrafine structure. The as-prepared Pd/MGN not only inherited the nanosheet structure of zeolite MCM-22 with hierarchical pores, large surface area and high conductivity, but also exhibited plentiful and accessible catalytic active sites. In comparison with the commercial platinum-carbon (Pt/C) catalyst (20 wt %), Pd/MGN demonstrated lower onset potential (positive shift 9 mV), significantly enhanced mass activity (up to 3.6 fold) and much longer durability for cathodic oxygen reduction reaction. It is believed that this work promises a straightforward method to develop carbon-supported ultrafine nanoparticles for low-cost and highly efficient catalytic applications.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000457952600098

Unfortunately, there are still limitations in the current research on the characteristics of HEA, which can't satisfy the wide application of HEAs. Therefore, it is critical to focus the research on the functional aspects of HEAs to achieve their maximum potential. It is exciting that the complex surface chemistry and flexibility of HEAs in shaping unique functions, have been proven to be excellent materials for catalysts in recent years. The superior functionality of HEAs has led to a rapidly growing demand for them. In particular, HEAs as electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) have become a hot spot for research. However, the applicability of the HEA as catalysts is affected by various factors such as elemental composition, preparation method, surface morphology. The limited research work and unclear catalytic mechanism of HEA electrocatalysts result in the widespread high overpotential, which hinders the application of high entropy electrocatalysts. This paper summarizes the morphological engineering, derived compositional engineering, synthetic methods, electrical properties of the HEA and their derivatives, and applicability as catalysts. Moreover, the paper highlights the challenges and perspectives for the development of high entropy electrocatalysts in order to provide valuable guidance for future research on HEA and its derivatives in the field of OER.

Herein, a facile H2O2 etching strategy is proposed to design Fe and N co-doped carbon catalysts (Fe-N-C/H2O2). Thanks to the etching of C, the defective carbon (DC) is endowed with robust anchoring ability, which is conducive to the modulation of active sites and microstructures, and further improvement of their ORR performances. Due to the supporting effect, the effective 3D nanostructures can be constructed. Integrated with the composition and morphology features, the resultant Fe-N-C/H2O2 achieves remarkable ORR performance with onset potential of 0.93 V and super stability with a subtle negative shift of 13.1 mV after 20 000 cycles in 0.1 M HClO4. Meanwhile, superior ORR performances are also revealed in alkaline and neutral electrolytes. This work provides an effective strategy for the design of advanced electrocatalysts towards fuel cells.									79	5	0	0	3	0	79			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000510526000059

Herein, a simple one-step method for producing an anodized nanoporous gold (NPG) electrode with a controlled contribution of atomic surface orientations is reported. Anodization of a conventional Au electrode in 35 and 500 mM HCl solutions produced nanoporous structures with a considerable amount of Au(111) and Au(100) surfaces, respectively. The former exhibited remarkably efficient electrocatalysis for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The obtained results show that the present method is valuable for the development of effective catalysts for various applications utilizing nanoporous structures. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

J	Tsui, Lok-Kun; Xu, Yin; Dawidowski, Damian; Cafiso, David; Zangari, Giovanni								Efficient water oxidation kinetics and enhanced electron transport in Li-doped TiO2 nanotube photoanodes								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				4	48			19070	19077		10.1039/c6ta08834a				2016	2016	TiO2 nanotubes are a promising system to implement photoelectrochemical water splitting for the production of hydrogen fuel from sunlight. Besides the limited absorption spectrum, their performance is limited by the presence of trap states, which facilitate recombination, and the sluggish kinetics of the water splitting reaction. Long TiO2 nanotubes can potentially capture more light, but photogenerated charges are more prone to being lost to recombination as they must travel a longer path length. We demonstrate here that the use of Li doping extends the optimum nanotube length from 7 to 15 microns, yielding a photocurrent of 1.5 mA cm(-2) under simulated sunlight at 1.65 V-RHE. To identify the conditions under which photocurrent conversion is limited by the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the OER efficiency of TiO2 nanotubes was quantified by measuring photocurrent in the presence of a hole scavenger. TiO2 nanotubes doped with Li exhibited up to 78% efficiency towards water splitting under an anodic bias above 1.2 V-RHE. Under conditions where water oxidation was a limiting factor, addition of a CoOx OER catalyst yielded up to a twofold improvement in the photocurrent under a small applied bias of 0.4 V-RHE.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000390433700047

Herein, we report the implementation and unraveling of the photothermal effect of spinel nanoparticles (NPs) on promoting dynamic active-sites generation to markedly enhance their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity via an integrated operando Raman and density functional theory (DFT) study. Specifically, NiFe2O4 (NFO) NPs are first synthesized by capitalizing on amphiphilic star-like diblock copolymers as nanoreactors. Upon the near-infrared light irradiation, the photothermal heating of the NFO-based electrode progressively raises the temperature, accompanied by a marked decrease of overpotential. Accordingly, only an overpotential of 309 mV is required to yield a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2), greatly lower than recently reported earth-abundant electrocatalysts. More importantly, the photothermal effect of NFO NPs facilitates surface reconstruction into high-active oxyhydroxides at lower potential (1.36 V) under OER conditions, as revealed by operando Raman spectroelectro-chemistry. The DFT calculation corroborates that these reconstructed (Ni,Fe)oxyhydroxides are electrocatalytically active sites as the kinetics barrier is largely reduced over pure NFO without surface reconstruction. Given the diversity of materials (metal oxides, sulfides, phosphides, etc.) possessing the photo-to-thermal conversion, this effect may thus provide a unique and robust platform to boost highly active surface species in nanomaterials for a fundamental understanding of enhanced performance that may underpin future advances in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, solar-energy conversion, and renewable-energy production.									47	1	0	0	1	0	47			0027-8424			WOS:000621748600059	33558243

Theoretical and experimental results show that these N-vacancies of GCN create singly-occupied defect states within the band gap acing as a trap for photogenerated electrons and act as the reaction sites for H+ reduction. Compared with the intra-triazine N-vacancy, the inter-triazine N-vacancy exhibits stronger electron localization leading to a more efficient H-2 evolution. The photocatalytic reaction rate of GCN with inter-triazine N-vacancies is 9 times higher than that of "defect free" GCN, and 2.2 times higher normalized reaction rates than GCN with intra-triazine N-vacancies. The catalysis mechanism and the method to prepare melon with inter-triazine N-vacancies can be extended to explore new photocatalysts with high activities.									35	3	0	0	4	0	36			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000463344800027

The chars were characterized by ultimate analysis, field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), N-2 isothermal adsorption/desorption method and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results indicate that with the development of gasification, the H/C atomic ratio always increases, but the O/C atomic ratio and oxygen content decrease firstly, then increase and decrease finally. As the conversion increases, the K, Ca, Na and Mg contents in rice husk chars first increase then decrease and the conversion values corresponding to their maximum peaks are different. The change trend of the micropore volume is similar to that of the surface area during gasification. As the degree of gasification reaction deepens, biomass chars become more ordered.

Here, the synthesis of a novel RuAu single-atom alloy (SAA) by laser ablation in liquid is reported. The SAA exhibits a high stability and a low overpotential, 24 mV@10 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than that of a Pt/C catalyst (46 mV) in alkaline media. Moreover, the turnover frequency of RuAu SAA is three times that of Pt/C catalyst. Density functional theory computation indicates the excellent catalytic activity of RuAu SAAs originates from the relay catalysis of Ru and Au active sites. This work opens a new avenue toward high-performance SAAs via fast quenching of immiscible metals.									168	14	0	0	13	0	169			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000468796000002

Therefore, new concepts and strategies have to be devised to develop electrocatalysts that are based on earth-abundant materials. Herein, we report a hierarchical architecture that consists of ultrathin graphene shells (only 1-3 layers) that encapsulate a uniform CoNi nanoalloy to enhance its HER performance in acidic media. The optimized catalyst exhibits high stability and activity with an onset overpotential of almost zero versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an overpotential of only 142 mV at 10 mAcm(-2), which is quite close to that of commercial 40% Pt/C catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the ultrathin graphene shells strongly promote electron penetration from the CoNi nanoalloy to the graphene surface. With nitrogen dopants, they synergistically increase the electron density on the graphene surface, which results in superior HER activity on the graphene shells.									915	50	0	0	54	0	924			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000349391000013	25565666

Platinum efficiently catalyzes the hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic environments, but is a rare and expensive metal. The activity achieved per metal atom can be increased if small Pt particles are dispersed onto electrically conductive, highly accessible and stable support materials. However, the addition of Nafion, a typical binder material used in the manufacture of electrode coatings, can decrease catalytic activity by the blocking of pores and active surface sites. A new approach is reported for the direct synthesis of highly active Nafion-free Pt/C catalyst films consisting of small Pt nanoparticles supported in size-controlled mesopores of a conductive carbon film. The synthesis relies on the co-deposition of suitable Pt and C precursors in the presence of polymer micelles, which act as pore templates. Subsequent carbonization in an inert atmosphere produces porous catalyst films with controlled film thickness, pore size and particle size. The catalysts clearly outperform all Nafion-based Pt/C catalysts reported in the literature, particularly at high current densities.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2196-0216			WOS:000394144300030

Hydroxyl radical formation via water discharge was used as a test system. Microelectrolysis studies confirm that hydroxyl radicals are formed at potentials between 2.3 V <= E <= 2.75 V vs. SHE and that at higher potentials oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurs. Primary current distribution is more uniform away from the curved corners of the cell, originated by the spacer between electrodes; however, the current distribution values at the corners and near to them, differ with a magnitude order of 1 x 10(-5); hence, primary current distribution at BDD anode in the FM01-LC reactor can be considered uniform. Secondary current distribution at different over potential values of 1.7, 1.9 and 2.15 V, respectively, did not show border effects. Attenuation of secondary current distribution is associated to kinetic parameters of water discharge on BDD and appropriate cell design. The importance of secondary current distribution for the production of hydroxyl radicals on BDD anode, to avoid OER, is discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

For the water oxidation reaction at a photoanode in a solar water splitting cell, there are multiple reaction steps that produce surface adsorbed reaction intermediates, such as OH center dot and H2O2. Little is known about how the reaction intermediate surface concentrations evolve during the water oxidation reaction. Here we use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to track the time-dependent surface concentration of Ti-OH center dot species on TiO2 photoanodes under chopped light illumination. We correlate the reaction intermediate surface concentration with the net rate of photoelectrochemical water oxidation (i.e., the photocurrent). The reaction intermediate dynamics follow different time scales in its temporal evolution from the photocurrent dynamics. By fitting the temporal evolutions of Ti-OH center dot species and photocurrent over a range of light on/off conditions and applied potentials, we observed that the rate constants for interfacial hole transfer and O-O bond formation depend on the applied potential under illumination. The variation in the rate constants could be attributed to the presence of surface states and/or a change in the chemical nature of Ti-OH center dot species on the photoanode surface. Our findings provide insight into water oxidation kinetics under intermittent solar irradiation conditions. The Author (C) 2019.

The ODH experiments of propane were conducted in a fluidized bed at 500 degrees C-600 degrees C under 0.1 Mpa. The prepared catalyst was characterized by N-2 adsorption-desorption measurements, H-2-temperature-programmed reduction, O-2-temperature-programmed desorption, NH3-temperature-programmed desorption, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction. The change in the selectivity of propylene resulted from the thermal cracking of the propane and the competition for lattice oxygen in the catalyst between propylene formation and propane and propylene combustion. Therefore, to achieve higher propylene yield in the industry, the reaction temperature should be 550 degrees C-575 degrees C for the 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al catalyst. The results of H-2-TPR (from 0.2218 mmol/g-0.3208 mmol/g) revealed that the addition of CeO2 can enhance the oxygen capacity of CrOy. Compared with that for 17.5Cr/Al, the conversion can be enhanced from 22.4% to 28.5% and the selectivity of propylene can be improved from 72.2% to 75.9% for the 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al catalyst. In addition, CeO2 can inhibit the evolution of lattice oxygen (O2-) to electrophilic oxygen species (O-2(-)), causing the average COx (CO and CO2) selectivity to decrease from 9.64% to 6.31%.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0008-4034	1939-019X		WOS:000601114100014

Enhanced OER activity for mixed-metal spinel-type sulfide (CuCo2S4) nanorods is generally done by blending the material that has high conductive supports together with those having a high surface volume ratio, for example, graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4). Here, we report a noble-metal-free CuCo2S4 nanorod-based electro-catalyst appropriate for basic OER and neutral media, through a simple one-step thermal decomposition approach from its molecular precursors pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate-copper(II), Cu[PDTC](2), and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate-cobalt(II), Co[PDTC](2) complexes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images as well as X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns suggest that as-synthesized CuCo2S4 nanorods are highly crystalline in nature and are connected on the g-C3N4 support. Attenuated total reflectance-Fouriertransform infrared (ATR-FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectroscopy studies affirm the successful formation of bonds that bridge (Co-N/S-C) at the interface of CuCo2S4 nanorods and g-C3N4. The kinetics of the reaction are expedited, as these bridging bonds function as an electron transport chain, empowering OER electrocatalytically under a low overpotential (242 mV) of a current density at 10 mA cm(-2) under basic conditions, resulting in very high durability. Moreover, CuCo2S4/g-C3N4 composite nanorods exhibit a high catalytic activity of OER under a neutral medium at an overpotential of 406 mV and a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000687044700069	34320803

For example, metal impurities can be introduced with the lead and lead oxides used in the manufacture of the active material, lead grids, alloying agents, electrolyte and water. Metals from the positive grid, such as antimony, nickel and silver can be liberated by corrosion mechanisms and eventually deposit on be negative active material. Once deposited on the negative plate, metals can have the undesirable effect of increased self-discharge hydrogen evolution, diminished recharging efficiency and water loss. Metal impurities can be particularly detrimental in valve regulated lead acid batteries (VRLA) operating on the oxygen recombination principal. A number of metal impurities can exert a deleterious effect on the performance of VRLA batteries by affecting one of more of the performance requirements of the VRLA batteries such as by increasing oxygen evolution at the positive electrode, increasing hydrogen evolution at the negative electrode, inhibiting full recharge of the negative electrode, increasing negative plate self discharge and increasing the amount off water lost by the battery in this electrolyte limited system. Typical examples of metals that are particularly deleterious in VRLA batteries are arsenic, antimony, cobalt, chromium, nickel, iron silver, platinum and tellurium. Furthermore, by enhancing oxidative degradation, trace metals may also have an adverse effect on the life of the negative plate expander.The control of these adverse effects has been approached through the use of metal control additives in the negative plate and in polymeric separators. The metal control additives have shown significant improvement for minimizing the adverse effects of metal deposition on the negative plate. The additives have been designed with the ability to irreversibly bind to certain metals including antimony, iron and silver at the different acid molarities and voltage potentials that occur during the charge and discharge reactions in a lead acid battery. Results are presented in both the negative active material and in different polymeric separators for the ES-A4 metal control additive which is capable of 99%; weight percent uptake of certain metals at both 8 and 38 weight percent sulfuric acid concentrations with less than 1% release. Results are presented showing the additive's low binding efficiency for trace amounts of soluble lead ion and ifs superiority over other metal control approaches. Further results with metal control additives used in concert with porosity additive in the negative active material are reviewed to show enhanced electrolyte diffusion to the metal control additive resulting in a shift of equilibrium and rate to improved binding efficiency.					16th Annual Battery Conference on Applications and Advances16th Annual Battery Conference on Applications and Advances	JAN 09-12, 2001JAN 09-12, 2001	Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut; Electrochem Soc Inc; Los Angeles City, Dept Water & Power; Independent Battery Manufacturers Assoc Inc; Int Cadmium Assoc (N Amer); Int Battery Technol Inc; SO Calif Edison Co; IEEE; Aerosp & Electr Syst Soc; Calif State, Dept Elect EngnAmer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut; Electrochem Soc Inc; Los Angeles City, Dept Water & Power; Independent Battery Manufacturers Assoc Inc; Int Cadmium Assoc (N Amer); Int Battery Technol Inc; SO Calif Edison Co; IEEE; Aerosp & Electr Syst Soc; Calif State, Dept Elect Engn	CALIF STATE UNIV LONG BEACH, LONG BEACH, CACALIF STATE UNIV LONG BEACH, LONG BEACH, CA	2	0	0	0	0	0	2					0-7803-6545-3	WOS:000166855600014

These fascinating features make BC an ideal candidate for fabricating highly versatile three-dimensional carbon nanomaterials and serving as a tunable flexible scaffold material. This review presents a comprehensive and systematic summary of the current developments of BC in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. We first briefly introduce the source, natural properties and microstructural features of BC and give the reason why it is suitable as a candidate material for energy storage and conversion. Then, we summarize the production processes of various BC-derived carbon nanofibers and their hybrids, including porous carbon nanofibers, doped carbon nanofibers, and carbon nanofiber-derived hybrid materials with carbon materials, metal oxides/hydroxides and conducting polymers.

However, to date, no SACs have been reported for the HER electrocatalysis in neutral media. We demonstrate a potential-cycling method to synthesize a catalyst comprising single Pt atoms on CoP-based nanotube arrays supported bya Ni foam, termed PtSA-NT-NF. This binder-free catalyst is centimeter-scale and scalable. It is directly used as HER cathodes, whose performances at low and high current densities in phosphate buffer solutions (pH 7.2) are comparable to and better than, respectively, those of commercial Pt/C. The Pt mass activity of PtSA-NT-NF is 4 times of that of Pt/C, and its electrocatalytic stability is also better than that of Pt/C. This work provides a large-scale production strategy for binder-free Pt SAC electrodes for efficient HER in neutral media.									330	27	0	0	21	0	336			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000413314800025	28787544

Co(II) was introduced into the RTIL via Co-metal anodization or the addition of CoSO4, respectively, while NaH2PO2 was used as the H2PO2- source. A single redox couple of Co(II)/Co was observed in the RTIL containing Co(II). Although elemental phosphorus (P) cannot be directly electrodeposited from NaH2PO2, CoP was successfully obtained via potentiostatic electrodeposition from [BMP][DCA] containing both CoSO4 and NaH2PO2. The obtained Co and CoP electrodeposits were both characterized to study the effects of electrodeposition potential on their surface morphology, elemental composition, crystallinity, and electrocatalytic activity. The as-deposited Co and CoP both showed amorphous features in X-ray diffraction analysis, and crystalline diffraction signals were observed after they were annealed at 623 K for 2 hours. The crystalline structures of the as-deposited CoP, however, were observed using high-resolution TEM, indicating a nanometer-domain crystal size. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was studied at the Pt electrode, Co-, and CoP-coated copper electrodes, of which the Co similar to 70P30 similar to electrode showed the best electrocatalytic activity toward OER.

The disposal cells will be initially aerated and the ventilation will renew oxygen at their front edge for years to decades. Excavation damaged zones (Edz) along underground works (tunnels, drifts) may promote oxygen migration. The diffusion and reactivity of oxygen within such zones is still poorly known despite that steel corrosion is significantly enhanced in the presence of oxygen. With this respect, four tests were implemented in the Tournemire Underground Research Laboratory, France. In each test, the oxygen partial pressure and the total pressure within a chamber isolated from the atmosphere by a packer were recorded over 90-150 days. Oxygen was never completely depleted in the chambers, likely due to oxygen diffusion through the Edz, whereas pyrite oxidation within the Edz was the main oxygen sink. The four in situ tests are different in terms of geometries (volume and surface of chambers) and drilling modes (compressed air flushing vs. pressurized argon flushing). A sequential global optimization of the relevant parameters (diffusion and reaction) has been developed, aiming at reproducing as closely as possible the measured four in situ tests data by modelling. The key controlling parameters are shown to be the Edz thickness and the ratio D-e/k(re) (effective diffusion coefficient over oxygen consumption first-order effective rate), whose optimum was found between 23 m(2) and 45 m(2). The Edz extent active for oxygen diffusion ranges between 0.6 and 1.0 borehole radius, with mean water saturation of 0.7, a mean D-e of 6 x 10(-7) m(2).s(-1) and a mean k(re) of 2 x 10(-8) s(-1) (or k(r) = 6 x 10(-7) s(-1) per equivalent pore volume). With respect to the safety assessment of radioactive waste disposals, any plug system that would not intercept the Edz could not ultimately prevent oxygen entry into the structure, which could have an impact on dimensioning carbon steel components of disposal concepts. The proposed optimization methodology could be used to quantify diffusion and reaction kinetics in other contexts where pyrite reactivity and/or oxygen diffusion in water unsaturated media play a key role, such as the leaching of mining ores and acid mine drainage.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0883-2927			WOS:000450301100040

The oxygen-deficient Li2MnO3-delta exhibits improved electrochemical reactivity toward Li+ ions without significant loss of structural stability. The oxidation of O during Li+ ion extraction can be suppressed by the enhanced redox reaction of Mn in this material. Furthermore, the inevitable phase transformation of Li2MnO3 can be impeded by the increased kinetic barriers to Mn migration in Li2MnO3-delta (Delta E-barrier = 1.0-2.5 eV), which disfavors the formation of stable intermediate coordination geometries due to the oxygen vacancies. These findings reveal the underlying mechanism on the role of the oxygen vacancies in changing phase transformation and electrochemical activity in inactive Li2MnO3, and provide a scientific insight to the electrochemical reactivity and sustainability of Li-rich oxide cathode materials in Li-ion batteries.									30	1	0	0	3	0	30			2196-0216			WOS:000380045400015

This work firstly examined the electro-catalytic (EC) degrading the NIT in synthetic wastewater by using the modified Ti/SnO2-Sb anode, which was characterized by scanning electronic microscopy, X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electrochemical measurement. The NIT removal and total organic carbon removal are monitored. The NIT EC treatment was found to obey the pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics within 60 min electrolysis and was controlled by the mass transport, the chemical reaction, and the oxygen evolution. Stable degradation intermediates were detected through electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. Experiments indicated that several pyridine derivatives form during the EC process. Furthermore, the cleavage of pyridine ring could be demonstrated, which took place after the hydroxylation of the ring, leading to the complete mineralization of a NIT molecule.[GRAPHICS]and H2O2 played the dominant role in the EC degradation of NIT. The in situ-generating H2O2 was attributed to the reaction between dioxygen and alpha-amino radical.									17	1	0	0	8	0	17			1944-3994	1944-3986		WOS:000352873300006

This means that carbon neutral methods for H2 production are of vital importance. Chemical looping allows for H2 production with inherent carbon separation, making it an ideal system to produce low carbon H2. This work generates insights into the production of high purity H2 using a chemical looping packed bed reactor system containing an oxygen carrier of variable oxygen non-stoichiometry. Such a system has been shown to achieve 95% conversion of H2O to H2 at 1073 K outperforming the maximum theoretical conversions of 50% achieved by a conventional water gas shift reactor at that temperature. A numerical model was developed from theoretical consideration, with no fitted parameters and used to simulate the working reactor. Operando measurement of gas conversions and changes in solid oxygen capacity, through synchrotron X-ray diffraction, were used to validate the numerical model and confirmed that the reaction was thermodynamically limited. The model the model was shown to reproduce the conversion of the oxygen carrier, the reactant conversion and the product evolution. Sensitivity analysis showed that the relationship between the oxygen carrier material oxygen content and the chemical potential of oxygen in the carrier was the key consideration for the design and operation of a packed bed chemical looping reactor using an oxygen carrier of variable non-stoichiometry.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000683024400002

The graphene nanoribbons framework exhibits a three-dimensional intersected structure and a large specific surface area, leading to a higher capacity than multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The RuO2 introduced via a facile dropping method enhances the oxygen evolution reaction kinetics and obviously reduces the charge overpotential. More importantly, the Li-O-2 battery with RuO2 decorated graphene nanoribbons cathode presents an excellent cycling stability of 424 cycles at a curtailed capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1), which can be attributed to the synergistic effect between the intersected band-like graphene and highly effective RuO2 particles. The Li2O2 deposited on graphene nanoribbons shows a totally different surface morphology compared with that on multi-walled carbon nanotubes due to the different structures of carbon substrates. This work provides a promising design of highly efficient air electrodes for high-performance Li-O-2 batteries.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000469907700013

Exploring the dominant role of atomic- and nano-ruthenium as active sites in acidic and alkaline media is very necessary for optimizing the performance. Herein, an electrocatalyst containing both Ru SAs and NPs anchored on defective carbon (RuSA+NP/DC) has been synthesized via a Ru-alginate metal-organic supramolecules conversion method. RuSA+NP/DC exhibits low overpotentials of 16.6 and 18.8 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. Notably, its mass activities are dramatically improved, which are about 1.1 and 2.4 times those of Pt/C at an overpotential of 50 mV in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. Theoretical calculations reveal that Ru SAs own the most appropriate H* adsorption strength and thus, plays a dominant role for HER in acid electrolyte, while Ru NPs facilitate the dissociation of H2O that is the rate-determining step in alkaline electrolyte, leading to a remarkable HER activity.									24	2	0	0	3	0	24				2198-3844		WOS:000657692600001	34085783

Silicon, which is earth-abundant and has a narrow band gap, is an attractive material for photoelectrochemical water splitting.

Herein, we have fabricated a metalinsulatorsemiconductor structure of NiOx/Ni/n-Si photoanodes for highly efficient water splitting. NiOx/Ni nanoparticles, which act as well-known oxygen evolution catalysts, are deposited on the surface of silicon by facile pulsed electrodeposition. Light absorption and catalytic activity are greatly affected by the coverage of Ni nanoparticles, and the highly efficient NiOx/Ni catalyst structure is induced by simple annealing. The NiOx/Ni nanoparticles show highly enhanced charge separation and transport efficiency, which are vital factors for photoelectrochemical water splitting, leading to similar to 100% Faradaic efficiency and incident photon-to-current efficiency. A low onset potential of 1.08 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode for 1 mA/cm(2) and a high photocurrent density of 14.7 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V are obtained.									57	1	0	0	0	0	57			2155-5435			WOS:000441112400046

Designing and synthesizing some materials, with novel and specific morphology, may hopefully relieve the present puzzle. Herein, a novel sandwich-like CoP/C nanocomposite was developed by a low-temperature phosphorization method using a carbon-encapsulated Co-based nanosheet as a precursor. The cross-section images directly show that the monodispersed CoP nanoparticles are sandwiched between two thin carbon layers. The outer coating of CoP nanoparticles serves as an efficient protective layer and conductive medium in the process of water electrolysis. Remarkably, the sandwich-like CoP/C obtains a small overpotential of only 330 mV (1.56 V vs. RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is favorably compared with the commercial IrO2/C (400 mV), sandwich-like CoO/C (450 mV) and macroporous CoP (610 mV) catalysts we prepared. This CoP/C nanocomposite also presents better stability in alkaline solution than that of CoO/C and macroporous CoP. What is important is that this excellent OER performance has exceeded most Co-based materials reported thus far. The sandwich-like CoP/C material we obtained affords the possibility of the pursuit of robust, low-cost and high-effective OER catalysts.									66	6	0	0	1	0	68			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000378947200018

In this work, three oil shale kerogen from Huadian Dachengzi (DCZ), Gonglangtou (GLT) and Gonghe (GH) are studied by TG-FTIR-MS and fixed bed pyrolysis system to analyze evolution characteristics of gas and shale oil. Typical gaseous products, CH4, H-2, CO2 and CO, were analyzed by deconvolving their evolution curves. GCMS was employed to analyze the distribution of components in shale oils. Results show that studied four gases are related to several precursor structures and shale oil is mainly obtained from cracking of aliphatic structure in kerogen. Structural characteristics of kerogen affects its product distribution, resulting in higher yields of oil and hydrocarbon gases from kerogen DCZ and GH, while higher yields of char, aromatics and oxygen-containing products from kerogen GLT. Evolution behaviors of oil and gas products at different temperatures are related to cleavage of chemical bonds in kerogen. Labile C-al-O bonds crack below 350 degrees C causing removal of oxygen-containing functional groups and formation of CO2 and CO. Cleavage of C-al-C-al/H bonds at 400-500 degrees C causes acute decomposition of kerogen and formation of abundant products. Incomplete decomposition of kerogen at low temperature results in low yields of oil and gas. At high temperature above 500 degrees C, cleavage of C-ar-C-al/O/H bonds occurs and secondary reactions of oil products are intensified, causing reduction of oil yield and increases of gas yield.									20	3	0	0	1	0	22			0165-2370	1873-250X		WOS:000457854800022

The performance of BiVO4 is restricted by fast charge recombination and slow oxygen evolution reaction kinetic. To address these issues, hierarchical SnO2 (HSN) mesoporous support is developed via a novel sol-electrophoretic approach, and BiVO4 film is decorated with silver nanorods (Ag NRs). The photocurrent density of HSN/BiVO4 photoanode is 3.98 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and onset potential (V-onset) of 0.5 V vs. RHE. The PEC performance is attributed to the appropriate band alignment between SnO2 and BiVO4, as well as the hierarchical structure of SnO2. Ag-HSN/BiVO4 photoanode shows photocurrent density of 4.30 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE and V-onset of 0.28 V vs. RHE. The enhanced photocurrent and negatively shifted V-onset can be attributed to radiative localized surface plasmon resonance decay and catalytic effect of Ag NRs, respectively.

However, the OER kinetics in neutral electrolytes at present are extremely sluggish, resulting in high overpotentials that greatly limit the energy conversion efficiencies of MECs. Previous studies failed to probe the adsorbates on surface metal sites of catalysts at the atomic scale and elucidate their influence on the catalytic activities, which has impeded the rational design of efficient neutral OER catalysts with optimal surface structures. Here, using in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ low-energy ion scattering studies, we have identified, for the first time, that the electrochemically activated adsorbates on surface metal sites play a critical role in boosting the neutral OER activities of Ru-Ir binary oxide (RuxIryO2) catalysts. The adsorbate-activated RuxIryO2 on a glassy carbon electrode achieved a low overpotential of 324 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in neutral electrolyte, with a 36-fold improvement in turnover frequency compared with that of IrO2 benchmark. Upon application in an MEC system, the resulting full cell showed a decreased voltage of 1.8 V, 200 mV lower than the best value reported to date, facilitating efficient synthesis of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) from bioelectrochemical CO2 reduction. Density functional theory (DFT) studies revealed that the enhanced OER activity of RuxIryO2 catalyst arose from local structural distortion of adjacent adsorbate-covered Ru octahedra at the catalyst surface and the consequently decreased adsorption energies of OER intermediates on Ir active center.									8	3	0	0	1	0	8			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000555354600001

This study reports a significant strategy for the rapid synthesis of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) by pulsed laser irradiation. Two types of intrinsic atomic hollow sites over the surface of HEAs are revealed that enable engaging bifunctional activities for water splitting. In this work, a novel senary HEA electrocatalyst made of FeCoNiCuPtIr facilitates the redox of water at only 1.51 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) and still remains steadily catalytic and durable after being subjected to a 1m KOH solution for more than 20 h. First-principles calculations reveal that the incorporation of Ir and Pt atoms with neighboring elements donate valence electrons to hollow sites weakening the coupling strength between adsorbate and alloy surface and, consequently accelerating both HER and OER. This work delivers a powerful technique to synthesize highly efficient HEA catalysts and unravels the formation mechanism of active sites across the surface of HEA catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000748788900001

Therefore, a layered carbon-covered cobalt tetroxide (Co3O4@C)-reinforced PbO2-coated electrode is fabricated via a facile two-step pyrolysis-oxidation and subsequent electrodeposition process. As a result, the reinforced PbO2-coated electrode exhibits a low OER overpotential of 517 mV at 500 A m(-2) and a Tafel slope of 0.152 V per decade in a zinc electrowinning simulation solution (0.3 M ZnSO4 and 1.53 M H2SO4). The reduced overpotential of 431 mV at 500 A m(-2) compared to traditional Pb-0.76%Ag alloy leads to improved energy savings, which is attributable to the presence of Co3O4@C to refine the grain size and thus increase the effective contact area. Moreover, the reinforced PbO2-coated electrode has a prolonged service life of 93 h at 20 000 A m(-2) in 1.53 M H2SO4. Therefore, an accessible and efficient strategy for preparing a coated electrode to improve OER performance for zinc electrowinning is presented in this research.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2046-2069		WOS:000778499500001	35425018

Therefore, replacing the OER with hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), which requires a lower theoretical potential, has been considered as a more energy-efficient strategy. Herein, a novel bifunctional CoxP@Co3O4 nanocomposite with grass-like and block-like structures was fabricated on Co foam (defined as P-Co3O4/Co) via a facile hydrothermal synthesis for Co3O4 and the sodium hypophosphite-phosphorization method for cobalt phosphides. Compared with the Co3O4 precursor on Co foam, the heterogeneous P-Co3O4/Co, composed of a mixture of CoP, Co2P, and Co3O4, possessed superb electrochemical catalytic activity for both the hydrogen evolution reaction and HzOR in 1.0 M KOH and 0.3 M hydrazine medium. Low overpotentials of 106 and 129 mV were required to deliver current densities of 10 and 200 mA cm(-2), respectively. Meanwhile, potentials of -100 and -83 mV are needed to drive current densities of 10 and 200 mA cm(-2), respectively, which exceed those of almost recently reported catalysts. The excellent performance can be attributed to the fact that the synergistic effect between the presence of multiphase of CoxP/Co3O4 and the three-dimensional porous Co foam substrate makes the as-synthesized catalyst possess a large specific surface area and fast charge/mass transport. Density functional theory calculations unravel that the phosphorization strategy can not only regulate the electronic structure of pristine Co3O4, enhancing the electronic conductivity, but also optimize the adsorption/desorption strength of H* and alter the free energy change of the dehydrogenation kinetics of NH2NH2*. Meanwhile, a low cell voltage of 1 V was achieved to deliver a current density of 948 mA cm(-2) when P-Co3O4/Co behaved as both the cathode and anode simultaneously, which was superior to most of the nonprecious metal-based catalysts.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2168-0485			WOS:000636042800038

Herein, a facile one step glycinenitrate decomposition method has been proposed to synthesize crystalline un-doped and cobalt doped BiPO4. The prepared un-doped and cobalt doped BiPO4 have been evaluated as potential electro-catalysts for OER. The XRD, XPS and ICP-OES results reveal that BiPO4 undergo surface reconstruction during OER and thereby converted into Bi2O3. Thus, the in situ formed Bi2O3 is the real active catalyst to catalyze OER where 5% cobalt doped BiPO4 exhibits excellent OER activity in terms of low overpotential of 328 mV and 394 mV to afford the current density of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) respectively, which is much lower than that of the un-doped BiPO4 (480 mV). Besides, the polarization curves of 5% cobalt doped BiPO4 shows negligible difference in overpotential even after 20 h of continuous electrolysis, demonstrating excellent stability in alkaline KOH. This work demonstrates intrinsic electro-catalytic activity of phosphate based electro-catalyst can be improved by doping with suitable transition metal and through surface reconstruction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1293-2558	1873-3085		WOS:000788847300005

Here, we show active water oxidation catalysis using surface immobilized Co and Ni-based heterogeneous electrocatalytic assemblages, by the conversion of molecular precursors into more efficient heterogeneous phase electrocatalysts. The inorganic nanostructured electrocatalysts are developed by simple low-temperature surface spraying from homogeneous CoPc and NiPc solutions following short time heat treatment at 350 degrees C and 500 degrees C. On NiOx and CoOx based electrocatalysts (CoOx500@FTO, NiOx350@FTO) derived from CoPc and NiPc molecular precursors, oxygen evolution initiates at 1.54 V (vs. RHE) [eta = 310 mV] and 1.55 V (vs. RHE) [eta = 320 mV], respectively. The electrocatalysts also show good stability during repetitive potential scans under alkaline conditions. Each of catalyst under study produces remarkable current densities just at an overpotential of eta = 0.45 V during long-term water electrolysis experiments conducted for 12 hours. It illustrates the high stability of as-deposited catalyst under harsh oxidative conditions. This unique slant provides a simplistic way for transformation of molecular catalyst into nanoscale catalyst using a much lower amount of molecular precursor.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			2365-6549			WOS:000449073200030

They exhibit very promising capacities, up to above 300 mA h g(-1), due to transition metal redox reactions and unconventional oxygen anion redox reaction. However, they suffer from structural degradation and severe voltage fade (i.e., decreasing energy storage) upon cycling, which are plaguing their practical application. Thus, this review will aim to describe the pristine structure, high-capacity mechanisms and structure evolutions of LMROs. Also, recent progress associated with understanding and mitigating the voltage decay of LMROs will be discussed. Several approaches to solve this problem, such as adjusting cycling voltage window and chemical composition, optimizing synthesis strategy, controlling morphology, doping, surface modification, constructing core-shell and layered-spinel hetero structures, are described in detail.									47	18	0	0	2	0	56			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000387664800006

Following results were obtained: (1) Irradiation with ''visible light'' under aerobic conditions affects the PS 2 electron transfer at two different sites: (a) within the PS 2 reaction centre by impairment of primary charge separation (P680 Pheo Q(A) --> P680+Pheo-Q(A)), and (b) on the PS 2 donor side by inhibition of the electron transfer from Y(Z) to P680+. (2) In PS 2 membrane fragments with intact O2-evolution the primary charge separation is the most sensitive target of the photoinhibition by ''visible light''. The UV-B irradiation, however, affects predominantly the oxygen-evolving complex or the electron transfer from the oxygen-evolving complex to Y(Z)ox. (3) Susceptibility of the P680 Y(Z) segment to photoinhibition by ''visible light'' is drastically increased in the samples with lifetimes of Y(Z)ox and P680+ having been significantly prolonged by Tris-treatment. Susceptibility of the primary charge separation to photoinhibition, however, is not dependent on the lifetimes of P680+ and Y(Z)ox.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:A1992LU30000007

Structural analysis by X-ray photoelectron and infrared spectroscopy								ICARUS				162	1			114	124		10.1016/S0019-1035(02)00069-6				MAR 2003	2003	The photochemical flow reactor (D.W. Clarke et al., 2000, Icarus 147, 282-291) has been modified to minimize the incorporation of oxygen and other impurities in the photoproducts. A mixture of gases that approximate their mixing ratios on Titan (N-2, CH4, H-2, C2H2, C2H4, and HC3N) (0.98, 0.018, 0.002, 3.5 X 10(-4), 3 X 10(-4), 1.7 X 10(-5), respectively) was irradiated in the flow photochemical reactor using a 185-nm source to give a Titan haze analog as a solid product. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) gave a composition of 93.3% C, 5.3% N, and 1.4% O. Of the 93.3% carbon, high-resolution XPS revealed that 81.2% was present as C-H, C-C, and C=C groups, 12.1% may be C-O, C-N, C=N, -Cequivalent toN, and/or Cequivalent toN groups, 5.3% as a -Cequivalent toN group. The peak for N was symmetrical and was assigned to the -Cequivalent toN while that for oxygen was assigned to the C=O and/or the C-O group. Some of these assignments were confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. The polymeric product had a C:N ratio of 17.6, which is significantly greater than that for Titan haze analogs prepared in discharge reactions. When the polymer was exposed to air for seven days the oxygen content increased by 6% along with an increase in the infrared absorption at 1710 cm(-1) assigned to the C=O group of a ketone. The oxidation is attributed to the reaction of oxygen with free radicals trapped in the polymer matrix. It is proposed that the photochemical initiation of Titan haze formation from compounds formed from starting materials formed high in Titan's atmosphere is a more plausible model than haze formed in reactions initiated by solely by discharges. These data will be helpful in the interpretation of the data returned from the Huygens probe of the Cassini mission. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

The molecular structure of 1 reveals that it is a tetranuclear assembly where the Co(ii) centers are present in the alternate corners of a cube. The four Co(ii) centers are held together by four di-anionic [L](2-) ligands. The fourth coordination site on Co(ii) is taken by an acetonitrile ligand. Changing the Co(ii) precursor from Co(OAc)(2)4H(2)O to Co(NO3)(2)6H(2)O afforded a mononuclear complex [Co-II(LH)(2)(CH3CN)(2)(MeOH)(2)](MeOH)(2) (2). In 2, the Co(ii) centre is surrounded by two monoanionic [LH](-) ligands and a pair of methanol and acetonitrile solvents in a six-coordinate arrangement. 1 has been found to be an efficient catalyst for electrochemical water oxidation under highly basic conditions while the mononuclear analogue, 2, does not respond to electrochemical water oxidation. The tetranuclear catalyst has excellent electrochemical stability and longevity, as established by chronoamperometry and >1000 cycle durability tests under highly alkaline conditions. Excellent current densities of 1 and 10 mA cm(-2) were achieved with overpotentials of 354 and 452 mV respectively. The turnover frequency of this catalyst was calculated to be 5.23 s(-1) with an excellent faradaic efficiency of 97%, indicating the selective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring with the aid of this catalyst. A mechanistic insight into the higher activity of complex 1 towards the OER compared to that of complex 2 is also provided using density functional theory based calculations.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000527540400026	32219286

The effects of annealing on the microstructure and electrochemical properties of films were systematically investigated. The results show that there are four peaks at 1157, 1346, 1470 and 1555 cm(-1) in Raman spectra of the unannealed sample. When the films were annealed at temperatures above 800 degrees C, there are only two peaks of D and G band, indicating that the hydrogen in grain boundaries significantly decreased. The area-integrated intensity ratio of D band to G band (I-D/I-C) reaches minimum value, revealing that the cluster number or cluster size of sp(2) phase was reduced. The G peak position shifts to lower wave number, indicating an decrease in the ordering of graphitic component. The electrode exhibits the widest potential window and the highest oxygen evolution potential, and the quasi-reversible reaction occurs on the surface of the samples. The D peak is quite sharp and its intensity increases when the sample was annealed at 1000 degrees C. The I-D/I-C value attains to the maximum value and the G peak position clearly shifts to higher value. The electrode exhibits the narrowest potential window and the lowest oxygen evolution potential, and the reversible electrochemical reaction occurs in the surface of the sample. The above results reveal that the cluster number or cluster size of sp(2) phase, the amounts of trans-polyacetylene related to hydrogen in the grain boundaries, the disordering of graphitic components and the boron diffusion in the nanocrystalline diamond films give contributions to the complex change in electrochemical properties of the films with the annealing temperature increasing.									9	7	0	0	0	0	11			1000-3290			WOS:000283406400107

In this work, the nonlinear multi-scale diffusion cancer invasion model that describes the interactions of the tumor cells, matrix-metalloproteinases, matrix-degradative enzymes and oxygen is studied. The conditions under which the cancerous biological system exhibits chaotic behavior were obtained by means of the method based on wandering trajectories analysis. Regions of parameters leading to carcinogenesis in the biological system studied were found in control parameter planes 'number of tumor cells versus diffusion saturation level.' Significant influence of the biological system initial state to carcinogenesis was ascertained and illustrated by regions in phase planes of initial conditions. Evolution of all regions obtained is presented depending on glucose level.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0924-090X	1573-269X		WOS:000480559000006

Herein, the paradigm of electroinactive titania has been surmounted by exploiting defect engineering as a tool, which tailors the local atomic structure of nonconductive titania via electrochemical cathodization strategy. The enhanced electro-conducting properties along with favorable surface energetics for H-ads of reduced titania (TiO1.23) ensures ultrafast HER kinetics. Because of the proximity with the benchmark Pt, the reduced titania exhibits excellent HER catalytic activity in an acidic electrolyte by exhibiting low onset potential of 75 mV versus RHE and a Tafel slope of 88 mV.dec(-1), and it demonstrates 10 mA.cm(-2) at a potential of 198 mV versus RHE. Furthermore, the cathodization process also endows "magic effects" by effectively exposing the (III) close-packed plane with extravagant texture coefficient and makes the structure more thermodynamically stable. The longterm durability studies (5000 cycles of cyclic sweeping, 40 h of static polarization) confirm the extremely stable HER catalytic activity of TiO1.23. These findings suggest that by tuning oxygen vacancies in the lattice and its concomitant cumulative strained configuration, reduced titania can be an effective HER electro-catalyst for electrochemical water splitting.									66	1	0	0	10	0	66			2155-5435			WOS:000373524400012

Recent advances have demonstrated that ternary metal sulfides (TMSs) are very promising alternatives to noble-metals for various electrocatalytic reactions, because of excellent redox reversibility and high electronic conductivity. In this review, the latest developments in various types of TMSs for hydrogen/oxygen-related electrocatalysis are summarized. The corresponding synthesis strategies, electrocatalytic mechanisms and critical issues towards the performance improvement are briefly discussed. Moreover, the potential practical applications of TMS materials are highlighted in prominent energy-related devices (i.e., overall water splitting and rechargeable Zn-air batteries). Some critical challenges and prospects for the future development of TMS electrocatalysts are proposed at the end. It is believed that in-depth understanding of TMS development would be significantly important for designing TMSs with the desired electrocatalytic performance in the future.									151	7	0	0	6	0	152			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000467249200002

Two-dimensional cross sections perpendicular to the propagation direction were imaged using the technique of planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) and, in some cases, compared to simultaneously acquired schlieren images. Images are obtained which clearly show the nature of the disturbances in an intermediate chemical species (OH) created by the variations in the strength of the leading shock front associated with the transverse wave instability of a propagating detonation. The images are compared to 2-D, unsteady simulations with a reduced model of the chemical reaction processes in the hydrogen-oxygen-argon system. We interpret the experimental and numerical images using simple models of the detonation front structure based on the "weak" version of the flow near the triple point or intersection of three shock waves, two of which make up the shock front and the third corresponding to the wave propagating transversely to the front. Both the unsteady simulations and the triple point calculations are consistent with the creation of keystone-shaped regions of low reactivity behind the incident shock near the end of the oscillation cycle within the "cell."
