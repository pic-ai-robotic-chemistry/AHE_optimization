Herein, self-supported Co, Mo2C-carbon nanofiber (CNF) mats constituted by Co and Mo2C nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped CNF are synthesized via a simple electrospinning technology with a subsequent carbonization process. The self-supported structure and the synergistic effect between Co and Mo2C can facilitate the electron transfer, enlarge the exposed active site and tune the electronic structure of the active sites, resulting in the enhanced HER performance in alkaline and neutral medium. As a result, the optimized catalysts need relatively small over-potential of 128 and 206 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline and neutral medium, respectively. Moreover, the Co, Mo2C-CNF also exhibits small Tafel slope and long-term stability, demonstrating potential as high-performance HER electrocatalyst. This facile, rapid and cost-efficiency method provides a novel choice to synthesize self-supported high-performance HER electrocatalysts.									38	1	0	0	3	0	38			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000552025300024

The iodide oxidation reaction (IOR) is a promising alternative to OER due to its low thermodynamic energy and two-electron-involved fast reaction kinetics. Herein, we report a high-performance catalyst-modified Sb2S3 photoanode to drive IOR. A compact thin-film-type Sb2S3 absorber is fabricated via solution processing based on a thorough understanding of the molecular interaction in the precursor ink state. Moreover, the deposition of a multilayered catalyst RuO2 nanosheet and polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride not only efficiently enhances the charge transfer kinetics but also passivates the surface defects of the Sb2S3 absorber. The resulting photoanode exhibits an efficient photocurrent density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 0.54 V compared to the normalized hydrogen electrode in hydroiodic acid. In conclusion, we demonstrate a bias-free PEC tandem device based on a RuO2-modified Sb2S3 photoanode paired with a silicon photocathode, yielding an operation current density of 4 mA cm(-2).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000864346700001

Theoretical calculation results demonstrate that the incorporation of Ru optimizes the Gibbs free energy of adsorption of H2O molecules and intermediates for the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) on metal selenide sites, thus boosting electrocatalytic overall water splitting. Accordingly, ruthenium modified nickel diselenide nanosheet arrays are designed and construct on nickel foam (Ru-NiSe2/NF). The obtained Ru-NiSe2/NF electrode with a stable 3D structure shows greatly improved OER and HER activity in alkaline solution. Particularly, toward OER, it only requires 210 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the formation of the intermediate nickel oxyhydroxide as active center during the OER process is captured by in situ Raman. Moreover, the overall water splitting can be driven by a voltage of merely 1.537 V to obtain 10 mA cm(-2). This work provides an available strategy for selenides to enhance electrochemical properties and inspires more studies to explore highly efficient electrocatalysts toward full water splitting.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000724837900001	34854554

Doping foreign element into intrinsic materials is an effective way to enhance the electrocatalytic activity, thus we design a facile method to synthesize a novel vanadium doped mixture of CoP and Co2P nanoparticles encapsulated in zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) derived nitrogen doped carbon (V-CoxP@NC NPs) in this work for the first time. Benefiting from the protection of carbon shell and regulation of electronic structure through doping vanadium and phase-mixing CoP and Co2P, the V-CoxP@NC NPs show excellent electrocatalytic performance in both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1.0 M KOH. Using V-CoxP@NC NPs to construct overall water splitting (OWS) device, the electrolyzer achieves the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small cell voltage of 1.54 V, exhibiting remarkable activity and continuous work for 20 h without obvious fluctuation.

Herein, a novel heterostructure in the form of Pd4S/Pd3P0.95 is constructed through interfacial engineering, which inherits the intrinsic merits of individual components and exposes active sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the optimized heterostructure not only possesses the largest conductivity and adsorption energy for an oxygen atom, but also can significantly lower the kinetic energy barrier of water molecular dissociation. Accordingly, the optimized Pd4S/Pd3P0.95 heterostructure catalyst is promising for large-current-density HERs, requiring an overpotential of merely 284 and 387 mV to deliver an HER current density as high as 500 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 m H2SO4 and 1 m KOH, respectively, which is superior to the benchmark 20% Pt/C (378 and 482 mV, respectively). Notably, the heterostructure catalyst runs smoothly to the current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential of merely 538 and 486 mV in 0.5 m H2SO4 and 1 m KOH, respectively. Significantly, the heterostructure catalyst also exhibits fast reaction kinetics and remarkable long-term durability. Moreover, the strong surface antioxidative ability is retained after a stability test in alkaline solution.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000770059800012

Herein, a heterostructure electrocatalyst on Ni foam (NF) with CoS nanosheet coupled with NiFe2O4 was synthesized via electrodeposition method with the assistant of thiourea followed by annealing treatment. Because of the unique three-dimension structure, this self-supported catalyst pos-sesses high intrinsic conductivity, abundant active sites and excellent durability, acting as an exceptionally durable and efficient catalyst for HER and OER. The obtained CoS/NiFe2O4-15/NF exhibits HER and OER catalytic performance with overpotentials of 116 mV and 227 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 in 1 M KOH, respectively. For CoS/NiFe2O4-15/NF||CoS/NiFe2O4-15/NF two-electrode system, the electrolyser requires 1.60 V to deliver 10 mA cm -2, and negligible loss of activity is observed after working for 12 h (10 mA cm -2). Moreover, the interface between oxide and sulfide is identified to play a major part in the catalysis of OER and HER. These excellent properties of CoS/NiFe2O4-15/NF electrode advance the electronic water splitting reaction for hydrogen production. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

We have successfully achieved that three-scale ordered porous structures are integrated into one material, and the porous sizes are 400 nm, 5.1 nm and 3.4 nm, respectively. A photo-based electrocatalytic OER catalytic system was designed, and the FeCoNi-MOF@TiO2 as a catalyst exhibits high catalytical activity for OER under the irradiation of UV light. The electrons of macroporous-mesoporous-TiO2 are excited and transferred to the loaded FeCoNi-MOF, when the macroporous-mesoporous-TiO2 absorbs the UV light, which can improve the conductivity of the FeCoNi-MOF. The photo-induced electron of macroporous-mesoporous-TiO2 significantly boosts the electrocatalytic active of FeCoNi-MOF. These results provide a promising route on enhancing the catalytic activity of MOFs in electrocatalytic reaction. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ando, Tadashi; Takahashi, Shunichi; Tamura, Koji								Principles of chemical geometry underlying chiral selectivity in RNA minihelix aminoacylation								NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH				46	21			11144	11152		10.1093/nar/gky909				NOV 30 2018	2018	The origin of homochirality in L-amino acid in proteins is one of the mysteries of the evolution of life. Experimental studies show that a non-enzymatic aminoacylation reaction of an RNA minihelix has a preference for L-amino acid over D-amino acid. The reaction initiates by approaching of a 3 '-oxygen of the RNA minihelix to the carbonyl carbon of an aminoacyl phosphate oligonucleotide. Here, employing molecular dynamics simulations, we examined the possible mechanisms that determine this chiral selectivity. The simulation system adopted a geometry required for the chemical reaction to occur more frequently with L-alanine than that with D-alanine. For L-alanine, the structure with this geometry was formed by a combination of stable dihedral angles along alanyl phosphate backbone with a canonical RNA structure, where the methyl group of alanine was placed on the opposite side of the approaching 3 '-hydroxyl group with respect to the carbonyl plane. For D-alanine, the methyl group and the 3 '-hydroxyl group were placed on the same side with respect to the carbonyl plane, which significantly decreased its ability to approach 3 '-oxygen close to the carbonyl carbon compared to L-alanine. The mechanism suggested herein can explain experimentally observed chiral preferences.									13	0	0	0	11	0	13			0305-1048	1362-4962		WOS:000456710000008	30321374

The performances of electrocatalytic materials have usually been improved by increasing the ratio between the real and the apparent surface area. A less common way of improving the electrocatalytic activity is by modifying the microstructure of the alloys. In this paper we describe the electrocatalytic properties of various amorphous alloys. Among those investigated, amorphous Fe-Ni-Si-B exhibit oxygen potential vs Hg/HgO of around 600 mV at 300 mA/cm(2) in 30 wt.% KOH at 60 degrees C. Polycrystalline nickel was less electroactive, indicating that the amorphous state is a better precursor for the formation of an active surface layer. In the alloys tested, metal-metalloid glasses are chemically unstable for high concentrations of iron and the electrode overvoltage decreases with an increase of iron. Consequently, corrosion resistance and electrode performance were found to have opposite dependence on iron concentration.

Under optimized experimental conditions, the CdS@MoS2 displayed a quantum yield of similar to 24.2% at 420 nm and the maximum H-2 generation rate of similar to 17203.7 umol/g/h using Na2S-Na2SO3 as sacrificial agents (lambda >= 420 nm), which is similar to 47.3 and 14.7 times higher than CdS (similar to 363.8 mu mol/g/h) and 3 wt % Pt/CdS (similar to 1173.2 mu mol/g/h), respectively, and far exceeds all previous hydrogen evolution reaction photo catalysts with MoS2 as co-catalysts using Na2S-Na2SO3 as sacrificial agents. Large volumes of hydrogen bubbles were generated within only 2 s as the photocatalysis started, as demonstrated by the photocatalytic video. The high hydrogen evolution activity is attributed, to several merits: (1) the intimate heterojunctions formed between the MoS2 and CdS can effectively enhance the charge transfer ability and retard the recombination of electron-hole pairs; and (2) the defects in the MoS2 provide additional active S atoms on the exposed edge sites, and the incorporation of O reduces the energy barrier for H-2 evolution and increases the electric conductivity of the MoS2. Considering its low cost and high efficiency, this highly efficient hybrid photocatalysts would have great potential in energy-generation and environment-restoration fields.									159	9	0	0	9	0	159			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000406172700037	28608669

Herein, a controllable hydrolysis strategy is developed to obtain nickel hydroxide electrocatalysts with controllable nickel vacancy (V-Ni) concentrations, as confirmed by advanced spectroscopic characterization. Electrochemical measurements show that the reconstruction can be promoted with the increase of V-Ni concentration to generate true active components, thereby boosting activities for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Density functional theory calculations confirm that the increased V-Ni, concentration yields decreased formation energies of the true active components during reactions. This work provides fundamental understanding of the reconstruction ability of electrocatalysts in anodic oxidation reactions from the view of intrinsic defects.									130	11	0	0	5	0	133			2380-8195			WOS:000435159000022

To find the most suitable OER catalyst among the large number of known manganese oxide compounds, several comparative studies of selected MnxOy materials in water oxidation catalysis were reported in recent years with, in some cases, conflicting results. In this study, nine different manganese oxide powders differing in structure and/or composition were synthesized, characterized and compared regarding their OER activity and stability using a consistent set of experimental parameters. It turned out that the activity generally depends strongly on the manganese oxide compound. alpha-MnO2 manganese oxides of the hollandite-type were found to be more active than those with a lower oxidation state or other crystal structures. The most active catalyst cryptomelane, alpha-(K)MnO2, reached a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at 1.77 +/- 0.02 V in LSV measurements. At a potential of 1.8 V, the current density was approximately 15 mA cm(-2). In contrast, the samples with the lowest activity exhibited values less than 1 mA cm(-2) at the same potential. The stability experiments revealed a fast decrease in activity of all samples within the first minutes of measurement and an almost complete activity loss after 60 min. Conductivity differences are discussed as a likely reason for the observed differences in performance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0044-2313	1521-3749		WOS:000651927600001

Unassisted proton movement can result in kinetic and thermodynamic barriers that inhibit the rate of these reactions, leading to slow and/or inefficient catalysis. These barriers can be circumvented by effective proton management through molecular design. Different strategies for managing proton movement are discussed with examples from biological and synthetic systems. As proton management is particularly important in redox reactions for chemical fuel generation and utilization, the focus will be on catalysts for H-H and O-O bond formation and cleavage. However, we expect the approaches discussed herein will be general to most multi-electron, multi-proton reactions.									25	0	0	0	4	0	25			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000482853900002	31424056

Moreover, only 1.58 V is needed to achieve the overall water splitting at 10 mA cm(-2). The optimized interfacial electrons redistribution that promoting the catalytic performance were proved by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

But its practical applications are severely hindered by the high cost and low abundance. Herein, we proposed a facile strategy to significantly reduce the Pt loadings for HER application. By introducing a Pt counter electrode in electrochemical cycling, trace Pt species were dissolved and redeposited on the working electrode composed of Mo2C nanoparticles anchored on the inner wall of highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2 NTAs). Highly-dispersed Pt species were embedded in the crystal defects of Mo2C nanostructures with high dispersion and ultra-low Pt loading of similar to 13 mu g/cm(2). The as-prepared Pt-Mo2C/TiO2 NTAs exhibit highly electrocatalytic activities towards HER with an overpotential of 67 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2).

Recent work supports a strategy in which a partial reaction, catalyzed by a progenitor, is retained, and the active-site architecture is modified to allow the intermediate generated to be directed to different products.									91	1	0	0	71	0	92			1367-5931			WOS:000076831100009	9818186	
J	Kim, Myeongjin; Ju, Hyun; Kim, Jooheon								Single crystalline thallium rhodium oxide pyrochlore for highly improved round trip efficiency of hybrid Na-air batteries								DALTON TRANSACTIONS				47	42			15217	15225		10.1039/c8dt03217c				NOV 14 2018	2018	The development of bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for electrical energy storage systems (EES). Sodium-air (Na-air) batteries are emerging as a new type of EES, due to their high specific energy density and high sodium ion conductivity. However, the undesirable sluggish kinetics of the ORR and OER limit the practical production of rechargeable Na-air batteries. Although pyrochlore oxides (A(2)B(2)O(7)) exhibit great potential for highly-active bifunctional electrocatalysts, the lack of studies regarding A and B-site cations has hindered the development of new pyrochlore catalysts with a comprehensive understanding of the catalytic activity. Here, we demonstrate the use of a single crystalline thallium rhodium pyrochlore oxide (Tl2Rh2O7) as a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst. The high catalytic activity of Tl2Rh2O7 can be attributed to the oxidation of Tl and Rh ions in Tl2Rh2O7 during the ORR and OER. The oxidized Tl and Rh ions can donate their electrons, which easily migrate to the surface and inner layers, following the low-resistance electron pathway during the electrocatalytic reaction. The hybrid Na-air batteries using the prepared Tl2Rh2O7 achieve greatly improved round-trip efficiency with a high power density for 50 cycles.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000449696200047	30325383

Herein, the synthesis of the bifunctional A(2)B-type cobalt(iii) corrole Co(BAPC)Py-2 having the electron-withdrawing meso-pentafluorophenyl and the basic meso-p-aminophenyl substituents is reported. Cyclic voltammetric studies reveal that Co(BAPC)Py-2 has two oxidation waves at 0.97 V and 1.42 V associated with the Co(iii) -> Co(iv) and Co(iv) -> Co(v) redox couples, respectively, and two reduction waves at 0.45 and -0.21 V corresponding to the Co(iii) -> Co(ii) and Co(ii) -> Co(i) redox couples. The as-synthesized Co(BAPC)Py-2 corrole has been demonstrated to be an efficient catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in homogeneous (acetonitrile) as well as heterogeneous media. In a homogeneous solution, Co(BAPC)Py-2 showed excellent activity towards both the HER, with the first-order rate constant (k(cat)) of 952.0 s(-1), and the OER with the first-order rate constant of 0.2 s(-1). The strong electron -withdrawing pentafluorophenyl group present on the corrole ring shifts the redox process towards the anodic direction and facilitates the HER performance, whereas the aminophenyl group increases the basicity of the catalyst that improves the OER activity.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000477957200017	31276133

In this paper, ultrathin NiMn LDH nanosheets were synthesized by a facile solvent exfoliation method and used to construct alpha-Fe2O3/ultrathin NiMn LDH heterostructures. When these heterostructures were used as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting, significantly improved photoactivity and stability were achieved. Compared to pristine alpha-Fe2O3, 15-fold enhanced applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) was achieved for alpha-Fe2O3/ultrathin NiMn LDH heterostructures. According to the electrical impedance spectroscopic and Mott-Schottky measurements, the enhanced photoelectrochemical performance was ascribed to the presence of ultrathin NiMn LDH nanosheets as oxygen evolution cocatalysts and the strong interfacial interactions between alpha-Fe2O3 and ultrathin NiMn LDH nanosheets. It is expected that this strategy can be extended to other heterostructures for advanced performance in the fields of energy conversion and storage.									33	3	0	0	2	0	33			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000489699700031

We report herein a facile agarose gel-mediated strategy for the selective electrodeposition of MnO2 and Co3O4 onto 3D porous nickel foam, in an attempt to produce a sectionalized MnO2-Co3O4 electrode with low physical interference on catalytic function. The as-prepared agarose hydrogel with metal precursor ions allows the electrochemical deposition only onto the contact area between the gel and the substrate. The resulting electrodes are completely sectionalized by two different catalyst (MnO2 and Co3O4) coating layers within the 3D porous nickel foam. This novel structure enhances both the ORR/OER catalytic activities compared to those of bare metal oxide catalyst electrodes and even after 400 h of operation (equivalent to 100 cycles), the sectionalized MnO2-Co3O4 electrode shows excellent cycling performance and long-term stability in rechargeable Zn-air batteries. As such, this novel sectionalized electrode configuration has potential for wide applications in the fabrication of other electrode structures employing various metal oxides.									53	3	0	0	2	0	55			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000390636100016

The experimental results showed that by prolonging the reaction time up to 26 h, corn stalk could be converted into hydrochar via HTC at a low temperature of 200 degrees C. It was found that hemicellulose was completely dissolved and more amorphous phases of cellulose and soluble lignin were fragmented and dissolved with increase of the reaction time. The ester, furfural and phenolic derivatives underwent a series of reactions in an aqueous solution to form polymerized hydrochar microspheres, whereas the non-dissolved cellulose and lignin went through a heterogeneous pyrolysis-like process to form polyaromatic char with an interconnected porous network structure. The as-prepared hydrochars with oxygen-containing functional groups and unique porous network structures could adsorb a larger amount of Cr(VI) than commercial activated carbon and were an effective and green sustainable adsorbent for the removal of Cr(VI) from an aqueous solution.									35	0	0	0	7	0	35			2046-2069			WOS:000389342400086

Herein, we present a facile strategy for efficiently designing heterostructure electrocatalysts based on density functional theory calculations. The construction of bi-functional electrocatalysis is described by introducing nitrogen to tailor a unique flower-like nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide (N-NiCo-LDH) for accelerating hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HERs and OERs). The electron redistribution at the Ni3N/Co2N heterojunction interface favors the energy barrier for HERs/OERs and, thus, improves the electrocatalytic activity. As such, the N-NiCo-LDH shows an ultra-low overpotential of 35 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HERs and the Tafel slope is 34 mV dec(-1), while it requires only 1.55 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for alkaline overall water splitting without iR compensation, which manifests one of the best non-noble bi-functional electrocatalysts. Moreover, we controllably adjusts the relative concentrations of pyridine nitrogen and metal ions in the N-NiCo-LDH via blocking and complexing experiments, directly verifying that pyridine nitrogen and metal ions as catalytic sites synergistically promote the electrocatalytic process, which will provide an in-depth insight into the corresponding synergistic mechanism.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000639550300001

In this work, an original undecorated Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based carbon fiber was employed as anode material (CF anode) to evaluate its electrochemical performance and feasibility, aiming at fundamentally reducing the energy consumption and pollution emissions for the manganese electrolysis. The results shown that the CF anode exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity and delivered a current density of 350 A m(-2) at an overpotential decreased by 112 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared with commercial lead-based alloy anode (Pb anode). We also found CF anode exhibited favorable performance with average current efficiency increased by 4.30%, energy consumption decreased by 8.36%, and a noteworthy abatement of anode slime by 80% compared with Pb anode in MnSO4 electrolyte. Additionally, the growth of manganese dendrites on the cathode edge which directly affected the electrolytic efficiency has also been effectively controlled and the possible mechanisms were also discussed. This work displayed the excellent electrocatalytic effect of CF anode serviced as a promising candidate for green and efficient electrolysis process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000610088500001

We characterize and compare the island morphologies with scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and valence band spectroscopy, and show that the cobalt oxidation state changes from Co2+ in bilayers to purely Co3+ in trilayers and a mixture of Co2+ and Co3+ in the multilayer morphology. In contrast to bilayers and multilayers, the trilayer structure appears to grow pseudomorphic with the Au(111) substrate, and in addition we reveal the presence of a hydroxyl overlayer on this island type as evidenced by the appearance of a root 3 x root 3R30 degrees superstructure in STM correlated with the fingerprints of OH species in XPS and valence band spectroscopy. The obtained layered morphology consisting of hydroxylated trilayer islands is identical to an exfoliated sheet of the beta-CoOOH which is proposed to be the active phase of the cobalt oxide oxygen evolution reaction catalyst present in the electrochemical environment, and we note that this synthesized structure thus could serve as a valuable model catalyst.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000394426400083	28058415

Thus, exploring a facile and efficient strategy to regulate the active species of electrocatalytic materials during the OER process is critical, but it still remains a challenge. Here, the active species of NiCo2O4 for the OER is found to be NiCo2O4 at room temperature, and Ni(Co) oxyhydroxides at 45 degrees C. In situ Raman and online X-ray absorption spectroscopy data reveal that the reversibly mutual transformation of the active species between NiCo2O4 and oxyhydroxides can be induced by regulating the temperature. Density functional theory calculations suggest that NiOOH has high activity and different rate-limiting steps toward the OER, compared with NiCo2O4. Both the temperature-induced change in the active species and accelerated kinetics lead to the improved activity of NiCo2O4 at 45 degrees C. This work may provide a new insight into both understanding and regulating the active species of OER materials.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000511170800006

In this work, we study the effect of an amorphous water-rich magnesium silicate deposited onto ZnSe windows on the chemical evolution of ultraviolet-irradiated methanol ices. For comparison, we also irradiate similar ices deposited onto bare ZnSe windows. Silicates are produced at relatively low temperatures exploiting a sol-gel technique. The chemical composition of the synthesized material reflects the forsterite stoichiometry. Si-OH groups and magnesium carbonates are incorporated during the process. The results show that the substrate material does affect the chemical evolution of the ice. In particular, the CO2/CO ratio within the ice is larger for methanol ices deposited onto the silicate substrate as a result of concurrent effects: the photolysis of carbonates present in the adopted substrate as a source of CO2, CO, and carbon and oxygen atoms; reactions of water molecules and hydroxyl radicals released from the substrate with the CO formed in the ice by the photolysis of the methanol ice; and changes in the structure and energy of the silicate surface by ultraviolet irradiation, leading to more favorable conditions for chemical reactions or catalysis at the grain surface. The results of our experiments allow such chemical effects contributed by the various substrate material components to be disentangled.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000431458900006

Herein, the cobalt (Co) nanoparticles and molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) heterostructures anchored N doped carbon (Co/Mo2C@NC-800) was designed as bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting via a simple pyrolysis approach for metal organic frameworks (MOFs) precursor. This composite shows a remarkable performance for HER and OER with a small overpotential of 121 mV and 311 mV at 10 mA cm(2), respectively. When the optimized electrocatalyst was employed as both anode and cathode for overall water splitting in a two-electrode system, the electrolyzer achieves a low cell voltage of 1.67 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, as well as a superior and stable long-time operation of 30 h. The promising hybrid material demonstrates excellent electrocatalysis performance due to effective combination of the best of both worlds: Mo2C with remarkable HER performance and Co nanoparticles with excellent OER activity. The Mo2C possesses strong hydrogen binding energy and Co exhibits prominent electrical conductivity, thus the construction of heterostructures achieves more active sites with different functions and significantly boosts HER and OER process. The novel and effective synthesis strategy provides new insights into the design of outstanding non-noble metal bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, ZIF-67 (ZIF = Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks) microcrystals firstly grow on benzoic acid modified covalent organic framework (BFC), resulting in ZIF-67/COF composite. Subsequently, highly dispersed Co3O4/NPC was obtained via the calcination of ZIF-67/COF. Interestingly, high dispersion of supported Co3O4 is dominated by homogeneous distribution of benzoic acid auchoring on nanoporous COF. More notably, largely triggered by the porosity and confining effect of COF, the resultant Co3O4/NPC features highly active crystal plane and a large specific surface area of 228.0 m(2)/g. Furthermore, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) measurement results demonstrated that highly dispersed Co3O4/NPC features good catalytic activity (330 mV overpotential at 10 mA.cm(-2), 79 mV. dec(-1) Tafel slope and mass activity of 130 A.g(-1) at overpotential of 400 mV) and durable stability, superior to currently available counterparts. Moreover, Li-ion battery (LIB) tests also showed high reversible capacity (785 mA.h.g(-1) at 500 mA.g(-1)) as well as excellent cycling stability and rate performance. Furthermore, Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results demonstrated that these superior OER properties can be attributed to the geometrical and electronic effects of Co3O4/NPC on activation and adsorption/desorption of reaction species.									84	7	0	0	6	0	87			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000414083300127

Herein, we have synthesized nitrogen-doped CoMoO4 clusters constituted of nanosheets directly supported on nickel foam (NCoMoO4/NF) by combining a hydrothermal process and low-temperature ammonia annealing treatment. Experimental results reveal that the nitrogen doping can modulate the electronic structure of CoMoO4, in which Mo ions with +6 valence are reduced to a lower state, and thus enhance its catalytic performance for HER. The optimized N-CoMoO4/NF (N-CoMoO4 /NF-1, with the annealing time of 1 h in NH3 atmosphere) exhibits excellent activity toward alkaline HER, requiring an overpotential of 58 mV at 10 mA/cm(2). This work possesses great potential for promoting alkaline HER performance of TMOs by the facile process of nitrogen doping.									22	1	0	0	1	0	22			2168-0485			WOS:000543715400020

As the ball milling time increased, the particle size decreased and the surface area increased. Upon prolonged ball milling up to 48 hours, however, the particle size and surface area got stabilized. HRTEM images revealed formation of crystal defects and dislocations that resulted in the structural change from single to polycrystalline structures due to ball milling. The BM LSC1000 exhibited better electrocatalytic activities on oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) than non-ball milled LSC 1000. Amongst, 24 hours ball milled LSC 1000 performed better in ORR and OER catalytic reactions than other BM LSC 1000. It is considered that the superior catalytic activity is attributed to the structural change and the crystal defects created due to ball milling. When applied as air cathode catalyst, the Li air batteries also showed better performance for BM LSC 1000 samples than non-ball milled LSC 1000. Overall, the 24 hours BM LSC 1000 exhibited the best electrocatalytic performance in terms of ORR and OER as well as superior battery performance with high capacity and reversibility.

Therefore, development of nonprecious metal catalysts for ORR is highly desirable. Herein, precise tuning of the atomic ratio of Fe and Co encapsulated in melamine-derived nitrogen-rich graphitic tube (NGT) is reported. The Co1.08Fe3.34 hybrid with metal. nitrogen bonds (1: Co1.08Fe3.34@ NGT) shows remarkable ORR catalytic activities (80 mV higher in onset potential and 50 mV higher in half-wave potential than those of state-ofthe- art commercial Pt/C catalysts), high current density, and stability. In acidic solution, 1 also shows compatible performance to commercial Pt/C in terms of ORR activity, current density, stability, and methanol tolerance. The high ORR activity is ascribed to the co-existence of Fe-N, Co-N, and sufficient metallic FeCo alloys which favor faster electron movement and better adsorption of oxygen molecules on the catalyst surface. In the alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cell setup, this cell delivers the power density of 117 mW cm(-2), demonstrating its potential use for energy conversion and storage applications.									116	10	0	0	5	0	116			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000443674100007

Herein, we report a new porous carbon-supported Ni/Mo2C (Ni/Mo2C-PC) composite catalyst derived by thermal treatment of nickel molybdate nanorods coated with polydopamine, which efficiently and robustly catalyses the HER and OER with striking kinetic metrics in alkaline electrolyte. The catalyst affords low onset potentials of -60 mV for the HER and 270 mV for the OER, as well as small overpotentials of 179 mV for the HER and 368 mV for the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). These results compare favorably to Mo2C-PC, Ni-PC, and most other documented Ni- and Mo-based catalysts. The high activity of Ni/Mo2C-PC is likely due to electron transfer from Ni to Mo2C, leading to a higher Ni valence and a lower Mo valence in the Ni/Mo2C-PC catalyst, as these are HER and OER active species and thus account for the enhanced activity. Remarkably, our home-made alkaline electrolyser, assembled with Ni/Mo2C-PC as a bifunctional catalyst, can enable a water-splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) to be achieved at a low cell voltage of 1.66 V.									302	13	0	0	16	0	306			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000395428300013	28451234

To understand the characteristics of different single cells at air maldistribution, the effect of the oxygen stoichiometry (OS) on the behavior of a single DMFC in galvanostatic operation is investigated both experimentally and numerically. Special attention is paid to the cell potential dependence on the OS, based on which the OS is characterized into three distinct ranges. The cell potential varies little in range 1, but decreases dramatically with the OS in range 2, and becomes negative in range 3. The cell characteristics in each range are highlighted in detail. The entire cell acts as a normal DMFC in range 1, but turns to bi-functional mode in range 2 with parasitic hydrogen evolution from the negative electrode (NE) due to partial oxygen depletion. Extremely high current density arises near the air inlet when the cell potential approaches zero, which can lead to high electrode potential in the NE and induce serious ruthenium dissolution. When the OS decreases further to range 3, hydrogen evolution starts to occur in the positive electrode (PE), and the evolved hydrogen can be re-oxidized upstream, leading to coexistence of four electrochemical half-reactions in the PE.

In a plane aqueous layer of glucose, the methylene-blue-enabled catalytic oxidation of glucose produces heavier gluconic acid. As the oxygen is supplied through the top surface, the production of gluconic acid leads to an overturning instability. Our results complement earlier experimental and numerical work by Pons et al. First, we extend the model by including the top air layer with diffusive transport and Henry's law for the oxygen concentration at the interface to provide a more realistic oxygen boundary condition. Second, a linear stability analysis of the diffusive basic state in the layers is performed using an optimal perturbation approach. This method is appropriate for the unsteady basic state and determines the onset time of convection and the associated wavelength. Third, the nonlinear evolution is studied by the use of three-dimensional numerical simulations. Three typical parameters sets are explored in detail showing significant differences in pattern formation. One parameter set for which the flow is dominated by viscous forces, displays persistently growing convection cells. The other set with increased reaction rate displays a different flow regime marked by local chaotic plume emission. The simulated patterns are then compared to experimental observations.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1539-3755	1550-2376		WOS:000345313700010	25493878

Here, a novel synthesis of nanocrystalline Ni-Co-Se using ball milling at cryogenic temperature is reported. It is discovered that, by anodizing the Ni-Co-Se structure during OER, Se ions leach out of the original structure, allowing water molecules to hydrate Ni and Co defective sites, and the nanoparticles to evolve into an active Ni-Co oxyhydroxide. This transformation is observed using operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy, with the findings confirmed using density functional theory calculations. The resulting electrocatalyst exhibits an overpotential of 279 mV at 0.5 A cm(-2) and 329 mV at 1 A cm(-2) and sustained performance for 500 h. This is achieved using low mass loadings (0.36 mg cm(-2)) of cobalt. Incorporating the electrocatalyst in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer yields a current density of 1 A cm(-2) at 1.75 V for 95 h without decay in performance. When the electrocatalyst is integrated into a CO2-to-ethylene electrolyzer, a record-setting full cell voltage of 3 V at current density 1 A cm(-2) is achieved.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000697212200001	34541731

We report here a dual-signal electrochemical immunosensor for detecting carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) using multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)-cobalt phosphide (CoP) as an electrocatalytic label. The preparation of MWCNTs-CoP involves the growth of Co3O4 nanoparticles on MWCNTs and low-temperature phosphatization of Co3O4 nanoparticles. The MWCNTs-CoP catalyst shows excellent electrocatalytic activities in a neutral medium toward both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), enabling MWCNTs-CoP as the electrocatalytic label for sensitive immunosensing. The linear range of the sandwich-type immunosensor for detecting CEA based on the HER signal is from 10(-4)-100 ng mL(-1), whereas a linear range for detecting CEA based on the OER signal is achieved from 10(-4) to 10 ng mL(-1). The detection limits for detecting CEA using HER and OER signals are 10 and 12 fg mL(-1), respectively. This work can provide a new double-signal immunosensing platform based on a bifunctional water splitting electrocatalyst.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0039-9140	1873-3573		WOS:000668000500045	34215136

Here, a scalable one-pot approach is designed to achieve Cu/Co/CoS2@S,N-doped carbon using two-phase metal hydroxides (Cu(OH)(2) nanorods/Co(OH)(2) nanosheets) with polypyrrole on their surface as precursors followed by high-temperature carbonization. The introduction of multiphase interfaces affects their charge states and facilitates the charge transport processes. Meanwhile, the embedded structure protects the Cu/Co/CoS2 from self-aggregation and corrosion. As a result, the product performs satisfactory oxygen reduction activity and stability with a half-wave potential of 0.811 V vs. RHE and a current density of 7.03 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, it exhibits an overpotential of 445 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution. The rechargeable Zn-air battery composed of Cu/Co/CoS2@S,N-C as the cathode material achieves a maximum power density of 110.5 mW cm(-2) and a low charge/discharge voltage gap of 0.87 V, even after 80 h at 5 mA cm(-2).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2052-1553			WOS:000791982200001

FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE				8						745	10.3389/fpls.2017.00745				MAY 9 2017	2017	Vicinal oxygen chelate proteins (VOC) are members of the metalloenzyme superfamily, which plays roles in many biological reactions. Some members of the VOC superfamily have been systematically characterized but not in Brassica napus. In this study, 38 VOC genes were identified based on their conserved domains. The present results revealed that most of the BnaVOC genes have few introns, and all contained the typical VOC structure of beta alpha beta beta modules. The BnaVOC genes are distributed unevenly across 15 chromosomes in B. napus and occur as gene clusters on chromosomes C5 and A6. The synteny and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the VOC gene family is a consequence of mesopolyploidy events that occurred in Brassica evolution, and whole-genome duplication and segmental duplication played a major role in the expansion of the BnaVOC gene family. The expression profile analysis indicated that the expression of most Boa VOCs was increased in the leaves and late stage seeds. Further results indicated that seeds of B. napus with a high oil content show higher expression levels under drought stress conditions, suggesting that BnaVOCs not only respond to abiotic stress but may also affect lipid metabolism in drought stress. This present study provides a comprehensive overview of the VOC gene family and provides new insights into their biological function in B. napus evolution.									13	1	0	0	11	0	14			1664-462X			WOS:000400926100001	28536594

Hydrogen binding energy (HBE) has been proposed to be a good descriptor to predict hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in alkaline electrolytes. In this work, we showed that although HBE values could predict the HER activity reasonably well, the oxophilicity of the catalyst surface also played a significant role in water dissociation. To elucidate the role of surface oxophilicity, a series of nonprecious copper-based bimetallic materials were systematically studied for HER activity in alkaline conditions. By alloying copper with small amounts of oxophilic transition metals such as Ti, Co, or Ni, a significant enhancement in HER activity was achieved in comparison to pure copper. However, if the HBE was considered as the sole descriptor, the experimentally measured HER activity trend did not match the theoretical trend as predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Further studies combining both computational efforts and experimental investigation of metal oxide/hydroxide (MO/OH) clusters deposited on Cu surfaces showed that oxygen binding energies (i.e., the oxophilicity of the dopant metal) together with HBEs should be used as descriptors to predict HER activity in alkaline conditions due to the synergistic interactions between copper and the oxophilic metal.									26	0	0	0	2	0	26			2155-5435			WOS:000447224100039

To isolate the strain effect, we have investigated the influence of externally applied elastic strain on the catalytic activity of metal films in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We show that elastic strain tunes the catalytic activity in a controlled and predictable way. Both theory and experiment show strain controls reactivity in a controlled manner consistent with the qualitative predictions of the HER volcano plot and the d-band theory: Ni and Pt I s activities were accelerated by compression, while Cu I s activity was accelerated by tension. By isolating the elastic strain effect from the ligand effect, this study provides a greater insight into the role of elastic strain in controlling electrocatalytic activity.									105	4	0	0	6	0	106			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000377918400005	27079940

Herein, the oxygen vacancy (O-V) engineered V2O5 nanosheet arrays have been demonstrated as bifunctional electrocatalysts, in which cobalt ions are utilized to tailor O-V content and keep steady. The maxmized O-V engineering can render the valance electrons shift to higher binding energy with moderate surface chemical states, optimizing H* adsorption on vanadium center at the electrochemical interface. Consequently, a superlow overpotential of 51 mV is required to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution with 24 h durable stability. The corresponding overpotential is about 277 mV for oxygen evolution. After assembling a two-electrode electrolyzer, it shows a very low voltage of 1.55 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This work provides a viable cationic induced O-V formation strategy for oxides-based electrocatalysts to obtain satisfied catalytic activity and stability. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This work reports the effect of the morphology of nickel oxide (NiO) nanostructures on their catalytic activity toward OER in alkaline medium. 1D hollow nanofibers (NiO-NFBs) synthesized by solution blow spinning are compared with 3D nanoparticles (NiO-NPTs) synthesized by a well-known citrate method. The intrinsic activity of the electrocatalysts was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), turnover frequency (TOF), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Results confirm the superiority of NiO-NFBs, with a remarkable difference of 133 mV versus RHE to generate j = 10 mA cm(-2). The NiO-NFBs showed a TOF value 122 times higher than NiO-NPTs. The Tafel analysis and EIS revealed that the hollow structure favors kinetics through a more efficient process of mass and charge transfer. Overall, results corroborate the thesis that the morphology imposes the main rule on the electrocatalyst performance. The morphology of NiO-NFBs is fully preserved after the electrolysis test, while NiO-NPTs degrade through a nanoparticle coalescence mechanism. This work is a contribution to the state of the art of nanostructured NiO-based electrodes for OER.									23	4	0	0	0	0	24			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000517259100005

These low-energy reactions generally take place in nuclei with an atomic weight that is lower or equal to that of iron (Fe). The experimental evidence, obtained from repeatable measurements of neutron emissions [Strain 45, 2009, 332; Strain (in press); Phys. Lett. A. 373, 2009, 4158], can be also recognised considering the anomalous chemical balances of the major events that have affected the Earths crust, oceans and atmosphere, over the last 4 billion years. These anomalies include (i) abrupt variations in the most abundant elements in correspondence with the formation of tectonic plates; (ii) the Great Oxidation Event (2.72.4 billion years ago), with a sharp increase in atmospheric oxygen and the subsequent origin of life; (iii) the current climate acceleration partially because of carbon pollution.

When cycled in the potential range between the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the electrode undergoes two pairs of reactions. The pair of current peaks close to the OER is attributed to quasi-reversible oxidation of Co(OH)(2) to CoOOH, whereas the pair of current peaks close to the HER is due to quasi-reversible reduction of Co(OH)(2) to Co. The peak current values of both reactions do not show dependence on alkali concentration. Possible mechanisms are proposed for the reactions, in which the diffusion of dissolved Co(OH)(2) prior to the electron-transfer step is considered to be the rate-determining step. Considering the fact that the Co(OH)(2)/CoOOH and Co(OH)(2)/Co reactions are separated by a potential difference of about 1.2 V, a galvanic cell is constructed by using two Co(OH)(2) electrodes in 6 M KOH. On charging, the positive electrode attained a stable potential of about 0.4 V versus Hg/HgO, OH- and the negative electrode attained a stable potential of about -0.8 V versus Hg/HgO, OH-, thus resulting in an open circuit cell voltage of about 1.2 V. By discharging the cell, a capacity of 15 mA h g(-1) of Co(OH)(2) is obtained over about 15 charge/discharge cycles. The charged electrodes are analyzed by powder XRD and IR spectroscopy and the presence of Co and CoOOH in the negative and positive electrodes, respectively, is confirmed. Although the cell is not commercially viable, the concept of a "double hydroxide" is demonstrated akin to the "double sulfate" principle of lead-acid batteries. It is expected that Ni(OH)(2), which is isostructural to Co(OH)(2), may also show a similar behavior. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

We simulated the evolution of massive stars from H burning through Fe-core collapse, followed by a supernova explosion. We found that the production factors of s-process nuclides between Fe-58 and Zr-96 change strongly with changes in the He burning reaction rates; using the Lodders solar abundances rather than those of Anders and Grevesse reduces s-process nucleosynthesis; later burning phases beyond core He burning and shell C burning have a significant effect on post-explosive production factors. We also discuss the implications of the uncertainties in the helium burning rates for evidence of a new primary neutron capture process (LEPP) in massive stars.									43	1	0	0	0	0	44			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000269245000025

CV results revealed the HER underwent two routes with [Co-III-H](-) (EECC pathway) and [Co-II-H](2-) (ECEC pathway) as the intermediates at low acetic acid concentration. While the HER mainly went through the ECEC route at high acetic acid concentration. The HER turnover frequencies of 1 and 2 in neutral aqueous media were 291.8 and 190.6 h(-1), respectively, at an overpotential of 838 mV. Unexpectedly, 1 exhibited significantly better HER activity than 2, showing the factors controlling electrocatalytic HER activity of cobalt corrole are complicated.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0095-8972	1029-0389		WOS:000650571800001

However, the problems for MOFs that need to be solved urgently are poor electrical conductivity and low ion transport. Here we present a facile in situ growth method for the rational synthesis of MOFs@hollow mesoporous carbon spheres (HMCS) yolk-shell-structured hybrid material for the first time. The size of the encapsulated Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-67 (ZIF-67) is well controlled to 100 nm due to the spatial confinement effect of HMCS, and the electrical conductivity of ZIF-67 is also increased significantly. The ZIF@HMCS-25% hybrid material obtained exhibits a highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction activity with 0.823 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) half-wave potential and an even higher kinetic current density (J(K) = 13.8 mA cm(-2)) than commercial Pt/C. ZIF@HMCS-25% also displays excellent oxygen evolution reaction performance and the overpotential of ZIF@HMCS-25% at 10 mA cm(-2) is 407 mV. In addition, ZIF@HMCS-25% is further employed as an air electrode for a rechargeable Zn-air battery, exhibiting a high power density (120.2 mWcm(-2) at 171.4 mA cm(-2)) and long-term charge/discharge stability (80 h at 5 mA cm(-2)). This MOFs@HMCS yolk-shell design provides a versatile method for the application of MOFs as electrocatalysts directly.									63	8	0	0	2	0	63			2095-5138	2053-714X		WOS:000537425800017	34692080

Herein, we present that an ancient chemical reaction of "Pharaoh's snakes" can be a fast and convenient technique to prepare Fe-/N-doped carbon (Fe/N-C) nanosheet/nanotube electrocatalysts with sugar, soda, melamine, and iron nitrate as precursors. The resultant Fe/N-C catalyst has a hierarchically porous structure, a large surface area, and uniformly distributed active sites. The catalyst shows high electrocatalytic activities toward both the oxygen reduction reaction with a half-wave potential of 0.90 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) better than that of Pt/C and the oxygen evolution reaction with an overpotential of 0.46 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) comparable to that of RuO2. The activity and stability of the catalyst are also evaluated in primary and rechargeable Zn-air batteries. In both conditions, three-dimensional Fe/N-C exhibited performances superior to Pt/C. Our work demonstrates a success of utilizing an ancient science to make a state-of-the-art electrocatalyst.									53	6	0	0	5	0	53			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000429625400020	29521498	
J	Kleinhans, Ulrich; Halama, Stefan; Spliethoff, Hartmut					Spliethoff, Hartmut/0000-0003-3743-2731			The role of gasification reactions during pulverized solid fuel combustion: A detailed char combustion model based on measurements of char structure and kinetics for coal and pre-treated biomass								COMBUSTION AND FLAME				184				117	135		10.1016/j.combustflame.2017.05.033				OCT 2017	2017	A detailed char combustion model including gasification reactions with emphasis on char structural evolution is developed and validated using combustion experiments from a lab-scale entrained flow reactor burning a bituminous coal and torriefied wood. The char combustion model is a single film model based on nth order Arrhenius type equations for char reactions. Diffusion through the particle boundary layer and inside the particle interior is considered by an effectiveness factor approach. Char reactivity towards O-2, H2O and CO2 is measured for five different char samples from four different parent fuels, being two bituminous coals and two pre-treated biomasses. Char samples are generated at high heating rates in an entrained flow reactor. Reaction rates and intrinsic reactivity values are quantified using a thermo-gravimetric analyzer. Reaction rates for pre-treated biomass samples are one to two orders of magnitude higher compared with the coal samples. The oxygen reaction is around four to five orders of magnitude faster than gasification reactions in the chemically-controlled reaction regime. The char combustion model is able to accurately describe char conversion and char structural changes. Model results reveal that there might be fragmentation effects in early stages of char conversion, presumably for cenospherical char particles. Particle reaction rates and reaction regimes are shown to vary strongly among different particle sizes and trajectories, and even for a single particle along its profile. Therefore, mean values calculated from CFD results have to be interpreted with care and can be misleading. A parameter study on temperature and stoichiometry shows the importance of gasification reactions. Depending on the conditions, gasification reactions are responsible for 2 up to 60 wt.-% of char conversion. They become relevant in regions of high temperatures and oxygen depletion, e.g. inside the flame. For typical furnace conditions of 1300 degrees C and a slightly over-stoichiometric flame, the Boudouard reaction accounted for approximately 10 wt.-% and the heterogeneous water-gas shift reaction for 4 wt.-% of char conversion. Therefore, gasification reactions cannot be neglected when predicting fuel conversion in PF systems, particularly in modern staged combustion systems with reducing furnace conditions.

Herein, we devised a facile strategy that can form two types of Co introduced NiFe-LDH catalysts, namely CoNiFe-LDH and Co@NiFe-LDH. Multiple techniques disclosed that a heterostructure is formed between Co(OH)(2) and NiFe-LDH for Co@NiFe-LDH, while electronic interactions between Co and NiFe atoms are observed for both samples. Notably, Co@NiFe-LDH exhibited markedly superior OER performance to the RuO2 benchmark in alkaline medium, manifested by a low overpotential of 253 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), an extremely small Tafel slope of 44 mV dec(-1), and the outperformed stability for long-time operation. Further, when employed as an air-cathode catalyst for rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs), the Co@NiFe-LDH modified battery surpassed the Pt/C + RuO2 decorated one, evidenced by a larger power density, a bigger specific capacity, and a superior galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling stability for 90 h. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the Fe site is the active center for the OER, and the formation of the heterostructure can increase the density of states of the active site near the Fermi level hence significantly enhancing the electrical conductivity, while also upshifting the d-band center of the Fe site to increase the adsorption capability of the *OOH intermediate, resulting in the energy barrier of the rate determining step being reduced eventually.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000754752200001

This material was found to catalyze the water oxidation reaction in a stable manner. Mn K-edge and O K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analyses combined with theoretical simulations showed that the catalyst was composed of MnCO3 with slight distortions of the surface structure. Operando UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and linear combination fitting of XAFS spectra established that a portion of the MnCO3 surface was oxidized to MnO2. The MnO2 generated on the surface of this material likely provided active sites for the water oxidation reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0366-7022	1348-0715		WOS:000835311100003

The Cu-(a-NiSex/c-NiSe2)/TiO2 NRs supported by carbon cloth displayed as an effective bifunctional catalyst, which required low overpotentials of 156.9 mV for HER and 339 mV for OER to achieve a current response of 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH medium. An electrolyzer derived from the Cu-(a-NiSex/c-NiSe2)/ TiO2 NRs material allowed an operation voltage of 1.62 V at 10 mA cm-2 along with good long-term stability after 21.5 h operation towards water splitting in alkaline medium. This achievement was resulted from the finetuned 3D porous architecture of the amorphous NiSex-crystalline NiSe2 heterostructures doped by copper, which led to significant modulation of electronic properties as well as large surface of exposed electroactive site/types, thereby effectively promoting the catalytic performance. This study suggested a rational approach of structure and shape engineering to design a potential catalyst for producing green hydrogen via water spitting.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000672570600001

The preparation of anodic oxide films strongly depends on the crystallographic orientation of the substrate grains which can be obtained from anisotropy-micro-ellipsometry and electron back scattering diffraction. Interference colours of the formed oxide films and electrochemical measurements on single grains of titanium prove differences in film thickness and electronic properties. Therefore, the rate of ion transfer reactions (e.g. corrosion), electron transfer reactions (e.g. metal deposition and oxygen evolution), and photo-electrochemical reactions (e.g. laser induced reactions) differ from grain to grain. Examples are discussed for anodic and thermal film formation. metal deposition and laser-induced corrosion. In clear difference to the grains, twins have a much higher activity which can be proved in cyclovoltamograms as well as with metal deposition. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we report the synthesis of cobalt-vanadium (Co-V) bimetal-based catalysts for the effective water splitting. The Co2V2O7 center dot xH(2)O nanoplates containing both Co and V elements were selected as the precursors. After the calcination under NH3 atmosphere, the Co2VO4 and Co/VN could be obtained just by tuning the calcination temperature. Electrochemical tests indicated that the Co-V bimetal-based materials could be used as active hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst by regulating their structure. The Co/VN showed good performance for HER with the onset potential of 68 mV and can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 92 mV. Meanwhile, the Co2VO4 exhibited the obvious OER performance with overpotential of 300 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). When the Co2VO4 and Co/VN were used as the anode and cathode in a two-electrode system, respectively, the cell needed a voltage of 1.65 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) together with good stability. This work would be indicative to constructing Co-V bimetal-based catalysts for the catalytic application.									45	13	0	0	2	0	46			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000428197000010

However, it has been challenging to achieve a precise control over the thickness of the Ir shell from one to several atomic layers and thus optimize the OER performance. Here, we report a facile synthesis of Pd@Ir-nL (n: the number of Ir atomic layers) core-shell nanocubes with the shell thickness controlled from one to four atomic layers. Their OER activities showed a volcano-type dependence on the number of Ir atomic layers, with a maximum point corresponding to n = 3, which can be attributed to Pd-Ir intermixing, and possible ligand and/or strain effects. Owing to the better passivation for the Pd cores and the formation of a more stable phase during electrolysis, the Pd@Ir-nL nanocubes with thicker Ir overlayers exhibited greater OER durability. The Pd@Ir-nL nanocubes delivered the best activity and durability toward OER with eta as low as 245 mV at 10 mA.cm(geo)(-2) and a mass activity of 3.33 A-mg(Ir)(-1) at eta = 300 mV. Both values were much better than those of commercial Ir/C and represent the best set of data among the Ir-based core-shell OER catalysts in acidic media.									36	0	0	0	1	0	36			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000480826900056

Herein, an FeNi2S4@NiFe-LDH heterostructure is constructed by the molten salt method and interfacial corrosion strategy, in which amorphous NiFe-LDH nanosheets grow in situ on the surface of crystalline FeNi2S4 with a nanograss structure. The introduction of amorphous NiFe-LDH can not only optimize the adsorption energy of OER intermediates, but also significantly improve the overall stability and activity of the catalyst by reducing the loss of the S element in FeNi2S4. At the same time, the OH- produced by S ion hydrolysis can also promote the in situ construction of NiFe-LDH. Such an amorphous-crystalline structure gives full contribution to the advantages of each component, modulates the nanostructure, and promotes the electron transfer across the interfaces. Consequently, FeNi2S4@NiFe-LDH achieves large current density values of 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2) for the OER at overpotentials of only 283 and 306 mV in 1 M KOH (25 degrees C) without losing performance for at least 600 h at 500 mA cm(-2). Under the simulated practical industrial test conditions (6 M KOH, 70 degrees C), the same current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2) are delivered at the ultra-low overpotentials of 137 and 155 mV with long-term stability at high and low current densities. Such excellent catalyst performance shows its great industrial application prospects. This work also provides a strategy using Earth-abundant materials for realizing large-scale water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000772919400001

In the present work, the electrochemical surface structure of Ti/IrO2 SiO2 composite electrodes and the reaction kinetics of the OER thereon are investigated in details, to deeper understand the positive role of silica incorporation. Both the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements indicate either "inner" or "outer" active surface area of the mixed oxide electrodes, which is quantified by the voltammetric charge (q*) or by the double-layer capacitance (C-dl), constantly increases when increasing the silica content therein under the investigated range of Ir/Si molar ratio. The "porosity", defined as the ratio of the "inner" to "total" surface area, of the binary oxide films exhibits much higher values than pure IrO2 film. Although the apparent electrocatalytic activity for the OER at composite electrodes is obviously higher than that at IrO2 electrode, the real surface area-normalized activity declines after silica incorporation. The kinetic rate constants of the OER, approximated from the normalized polarization curves, also show dramatically decreased values at silica-doped electrodes. The above-mentioned results suggest that the enhanced apparent electrocatalytical activity of silica-doped IrO2 electrodes might be merely a result of geometric effect.

Herein, a facile strategy is developed for the synthesis of iron phosphide (FeP) nanoparticles protected with an overcoat of multifunctional P-doped graphitic carbon as a cost-effective electrocatalyst. The key point is the utilization of MOF-derived iron nanoparticles embedded in graphitic carbon (Fe@GC), which are synthesized via the pyrolysis of the Fe-MIL-88 template and subsequent phosphorization of Fe and simultaneous doping of P in carbon. Compared to the direct phosphorization of Fe-MIL-88, resulting in Fe2P on amorphous carbon (Fe2P@APC), this strategy gives easier access to phosphorization and P doping through pyrolysis temperature regulation. High-temperature pyrolysis can also yield the graphitic carbon encapsulated nanoparticle structure (FeP@GPC), which increases conductivity and prevents agglomeration as well as dissolution under harsh operating conditions, and thus contributes to enhanced activity and long-time stability. The optimized FeP@GPC exhibits superior activity compared to Fe2P/FeP@GPC and Fe2P@APC, which is attributed to the modified electronic structure of FeP due to its greater P proportion than Fe2P together with the strong synergy between the nanoparticles and graphitic carbon. In detail, FeP@GPC exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 72 mV and 278 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER in acid and OER in alkaline media, respectively, together with negligible degradation after 20 h, which ranks among the best Fe-based electrocatalysts.									67	5	0	0	3	0	67			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000451738900042	30422136

Here, the successful construction of CuO@CoOOH p-n heterojunction (i.e., p-type CuO and n-type CoOOH) nanoarray electrocatalyst through an in situ anodic oxidation of CuO@CoSx on copper foam is reported. The p-n heterojunction can remarkably modify the electronic properties of the space-charge region and facilitate the electron transfer. Moreover, in situ Raman study reveals the generation of SO42- from CoSx oxidation, and electron cloud density distribution and density functional theory calculation suggest that surface-adsorbed SO42- can facilitate the OER process by enhancing the adsorption of OH-. The positively charged CoOOH in the space-charge region can significantly enhance the OER activity. As a result, the CuO@CoOOH p-n heterojunction shows significantly enhanced OER performance with a low overpotential of 186 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The successful preparation of a large scale (14 x 25 cm(2)) sample demonstrates the possibility of promoting the catalyst to industrial-scale production. This study offers new insights into the design and fabrication of non-noble metal-based p-n heterojunction electrocatalysts as effective catalytic materials for energy storage and conversion.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21				2198-3844		WOS:000706548700001	34643068

However, optimizing the surface electron spin state of catalysts remains a challenge. Here, we developed a spin-state and delocalized electron regulation method to optimize oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance by in-situ growth of NiCo2(OH)(x) using Oswald ripening and coordinating etching process on MXene and plasma treatment. X-ray absorption spectroscopy, magnetic tests and electron paramagnetic resonance reveal that the coupling of NiCo2(OH)(x) and MXene can induce remarkable spin-state transition of Co3+ and transition metal ions electron delocalization, plasma treatment further optimizes the 3d orbital structure and delocalized electron density. The unique Jahn-Teller phenomenon can be brought by the intermediate spin state (t(2g)(5)e(g)(1)) of Co3+, which benefits from the partial electron occupied eg orbitals. This distinct electron configuration (t(2g)(5)e(g)(1)) with unpaired electrons leads to orbital degeneracy, that the adsorption free energy of intermediate species and conductivity were further optimized. The optimized electrocatalyst exhibits excellent OER activity with an overpotential of 268 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). DFT calculations show that plasma treatment can effectively regulate the d-band center of TMs to optimize the adsorption and improve the OER activity. This approach could guide the rational design and discovery of electrocatalysts with ideal electron configurations in the future.

In the current work, Ca2+ doped MgFe2O4 NPs are synthesized and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine the crystal structure and particle size. The EC characteristics such as cyclic voltammetry were used to perform the super capacitive (SC) behavior of Ca2+ doped MgFe(2)O(4 )electrodes. The cyclic voltammetry measurements analysis confirmed the prepared electrode's EC activity behavior. The current study was performed to examine the EC behavior of Ca2+ doped MgFe2O4 electrodes in 1 M KOH electrolytes. The Mg0.9Ca0.1Fe2O4 revealed a significant specific capacitance (SP) of 221.57 F g-1 at 0.33 A g(-1) current density (CD). Accordingly, Mg0.9Ca0.1Fe2O4 may be employed as a favorable electrode for super capacitor applications. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of Ca2+ doped MgFe2O4 electrodes was performed as electrocatalysts in 1 M KOH. The Mg1-xCaxFe2O4 (x = 0.1, 0.3 & 0.5) NPs could be significant agents for PEC water splitting applications. The current study may lead to a new insight into the growth of a new class of mixed transition SFs for energy and environmental applications. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, their potential as carriers of ground-state molecular oxygen (O-2, (3)sigma(g)) similar to artificial oxygen carriers remains largely unexplored. This is due to the extreme reactivity and cytotoxic effects of the released singlet oxygen. We now report that a compound with a bimodular design, which incorporates an endoperoxide and an efficient physical quencher of singlet oxygen, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), produces exclusively ground-state molecular oxygen. This result, coupled with the fact that oxygen release rates from endoperoxides are highly amenable to fine-tuning in a very broad range, and open to targeting by ligand attachment, raises the potential of these compounds far above any comparable chemical, or even biochemical sources. In cell culture experiments, we showed that the addition of the endoperoxide-quencher conjugate can enhance and sustain cell proliferation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000793742000001	35417077

Herein, we report the rational design and synthesis of cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube-grafted carbon nanosheets (LDH-R@Co(v-Zn)-NCNTs), via the in situ growth of ZnCo bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZnCo-ZIFs) on the surface of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and their subsequent reductive calcination. The incorporation of volatile zinc spatially isolates the cobalt atoms, thus suppressing the aggregation of cobalt nanoparticles, while the use of LDHs prevents the aggregation of ZnCo-ZIFs. The optimal composite exhibits good catalytic activity toward the OER in alkaline media, with a small overpotential of 344 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 75 mV dec(-1), values that are superior to those of commercial IrO2. The superior catalytic activity is attributed to the highly sufficient exposure of active sites and the enhanced electron conductibility of the composite. This work demonstrates an effective strategy by which to regulate a nanostructure and develop highly efficient OER catalysts.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000599249300036

Thus, the transition metal-based electrocatalysts are developed to achieve efficient water splitting. Here a simple three-step method is adopted to successfully synthesize a type of hollow MOF-derived three-dimensional carbonaceous matrix that is randomly loaded with numerous FeNi3 alloy nanoparticles (NiFeC). In this work, the as-obtained NiFeC-800-5 (carbonization temperature: 800 degrees C; pyrolysis rate: 5 degrees C/min) shows an excellent oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, with a low overpotential of 269 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 72 mV dec(-1). Moreover, it exhibits an ultrastable durability after being electrolyzed continuously for 10 h, which is originated from these fine alloys encapsulated into the hierarchically porous carbonaceous material. Finally, we have proposed morphological and chemical changes for the NiFeC-800-5 sample, in which the solid MOF precursor will be gradually etched into the hollow morphology by the strong hydrolysis of Fe(III) ions at high temperature, and the optimal carbonization temperature and heating rate are also well investigated. Moreover, the above approach can be used to obtain other MOF derived bimetallic alloy nanoparticles encapsulated into carbon materials for the energy conversion and storage applications.

In this study, a simple solvothermal strategy is adopted to synthesize hollow bimetallic cobalt-based selenide templated by cobalt-based bimetallic organic frameworks (BM-ZIFs) with superior water splitting activity and stability, owing to the perfect hollow polyhedral structure with numerous active sites. Moreover, the introduction of a transition metal element not only enhances the electroconductibility of the catalyst, but also further improves the electrocatalytic ability via the Jahn-eller effect. Furthermore, the synthetic method is convenient and low toxic without high temperature carbonization process. The as-synthesized hollow MxCo1-xSe2 polyhedrons exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performances. Particularly, the Zn0.1Co0.9Se2 exhibits low overpotentials of -140 mV and 340 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 49.9 mV dec(-1) and 43.2 mV dec(-1) as well as a high current density with robust catalytic stability for both HER in acidic and OER in basic solutions, respectively. This strategy provides a prospect for preparation of homogenously doped and self-templated hollow structure non-noble metal electrocatalysts with high HER and OER performance.									107	4	0	0	4	0	110			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000408592900028

Their crystal structure consists of alternating tetrahedral and octahedral units that accommodate Fe3+/Fe2+ ions and another divalent ion in their interstices that give them unique electronic properties for (photo) electrocatalysis. Herein, the role of nano-ferrites as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst and counter-electrode catalyst in photovoltaic-electrolysis (PV-E) and photo-electrochemical (PEC) water splitting systems are highlighted. In particular, the recent advances on OER (photo) electrocatalysts based on spinel nano-ferrites and their design strategies such as doping, oxygen/cation defect engineering, as well as supporting and compositing with other materials are discussed and summarized. Finally, their advantages and performance limitations were presented, and future perspectives towards their improvement are suggested.

The as synthesized spinel crystalline nanoporous-NiCo2O4 material enables improved electrocatalytic activity towards both water oxidation and reduction by taking the advantageous of hierarchical nanoporous structure, improved active sites, and electrochemical active surface area, high charge-transfer kinetics and structural durability. The bi-functional NiCo2O4 electrode exhibits augmented current densities and electrode durability with a high mass activity and low overpotential in overall water splitting in alkaline solution, comparable with most of the previously reported Earth-abundant transition metal oxide based catalysts.

In this work, we successfully synthesized a series of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), namely, as Fe2M-MOF (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Mn; H4L = 3,3,5,5'-azoxybenzenetetracarboxylic acid) under a simple and mild condition, in which the Fe3 cluster as a basic building unit was replaced by the second kind of metal center; at the same time, a redox-active organic linker was adopted. The Fe2M-MOF system as a multifunctional catalyst realizes great improvement of the OER and HER performances. Among of them, the Fe2Co-MOF catalyst exhibits an extremely low overpotential of 339 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a very small Tafel slope of 36.2 mV dec(-1) in an alkaline electrolyte for OER. This result has far exceeded the commercial catalyst IrO2. Meanwhile, Fe2Zn-MOF manifests excellent HER activity with a small overpotential of 221 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 174 mV dec(-1). In addition, the good long-term stability for these catalysts can be evaluated under working conditions. Systematic investigations are used to explain the enhanced electrocatalytic mechanism. In conclusion, we provide a simple and effective strategy for the preparation of multifunctional catalysts for energy conversion applications based on a pristine MOF material with redox-active metal centers and organic linkers.									32	1	0	0	1	0	32			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000530668400034	32310645	
J	Haddy, A; Hatchell, JA; Kimel, RA; Thomas, R								Azide as a competitor of chloride in oxygen evolution by photosystem II								BIOCHEMISTRY				38	19			6104	6110		10.1021/bi983075c				MAY 11 1999	1999	Oxygen evolution by higher plants requires chloride, which binds to a site associated with the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II (PSII). In this study, the inhibitory effect of the anion azide was characterized using steady state measurements of oxygen evolution activity in PSII-enriched thylakoid membranes. N-3(-) (7.8 mM) inhibited O-2 evolution activity by 50% when a standard buffer containing chloride was used. By considering Cl- as the substrate in O-2 evolution assays, we found azide to be primarily competitive with Cl- with an inhibitor dissociation constant K-i of about 0.6 mM. An uncompetitive component with a K-i' of 11 mM was also found. Removal of the 17 and 23 kDa polypeptides resulted in a decrease in each inhibition constant. A pH dependence study of O-2 evolution activity showed that the pH maximum became narrower and shifted to a higher pH in the presence of azide. Analysis of the data indicated that an acidic residue defined the low side of the pH maximum with an apparent pK(a) of 6.7 in the presence of azide compared with 5.5 for the control. A basic residue was also affected, exhibiting an apparent pK(a) of 7.1 compared with a value of 7.6 for the control. This result can be explained by a simple model in which azide binding to the chloride site moves negative charge of the anion away from the basic residue and toward the acidic residue relative to chloride. As a competitor of chloride, azide may provide an interesting probe of the oxygen-evolving complex in future studies.									22	0	1	0	20	0	24			0006-2960			WOS:000080500300016	10320336

Transition-metal-based layered double hydroxides (TM LDHs) show great potential as advanced electrocatalysts, but low electrochemical active areas and poor electronic conductivity limit their catalytic activity. Herein, we report a novel secondary growth strategy to synthesize ultrathin NiCoFe LDH nanosheets anchored on nickel foam (NF). By coupling ultrasound-assisted oxidation (UAO) to deposit dense seeds of low-crystalline NiCoFe LDH array on semisacrificial NF, and vapor-phase-transport (VPT) of urea for kinetic control over nanosheet thickness, hierarchical self-supported electrodes with high density of exposed active sites and abundant boundaries have been facilely obtained. The NiCoFe LDH/NF electrodes show an impressive electrocatalytic performance during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with required overpotentials of 217 and 227 mV to achieve current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) respectively, with over 150 h long-term stability, outperforming those synthesized by hydrothermal synthesis (HTT) as well as most state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. The overall water splitting device assembled using the NiCoFe LDH/NF electrode as both anode and cathode shows an ultralow cell voltage of 1.56 V to obtain 10 mA cm(-2). This strategy provides a simple and scalable methodology for synthesizing high-activity catalysts for efficient electrochemical processes.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773071400001

CoNi nanoparticles/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composite was prepared by calcination of the physically well mixed nickel acetate, cobalt acetate and CNTs mixture under inert atmosphere at 850 C-degrees. To ensure good mixing as well as strong adhesion of the metallic nanoparticles with the CNTs, the metals precursors were dissolved in ethanol first before addition of the carbonaceous partner. Due to the good absorbability of the CNTs to ethanol and the abnormal decomposition of the acetates precursors, oxides-free and well distributed CoNi nanoparticles/CNTs composite was obtained. Moreover, the XRD and TEM analyses affirmed formation of the alloy structure. The electrochemical measurements indicated that the proposed composites have very good catalytic activity toward the OER regardless the bimetallic nanoparticles composition. Numerically, the composites having bimetallic nanoparticles containing 0,10 and 20 wt% cobalt revealed Tafel slops of 101,159 and 111 mV dec (-1), and overpotentials of 415, 461 and 485 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density, respectively. However, the best stability in the alkaline medium was observed with the composite contains 10 wt% cobalt, while the other two formulations showed fast dissolution. Overall, the present study opens an avenue for the transition metals alloys to be invoked in the OER cells to overcome the high electron transfer resistance associated with the popularly used oxides-based electrodes.

JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				162	2			181	194		10.1016/j.jplph.2004.06.010				FEB 2005	2005	Leaves of 7-day-old barley seedlings were subjected to heat pulses at 50 degrees C for 20 or 40s to inhibit partially or fully the oxygen evolution without inducing visible symptoms. By means of biophysical techniques, we investigated the time course and mechanism of photosystem II (PSII) recovery. After the heat treatment, the samples were characterized by typical heat stress symptoms: loss of oxygen evolution activity, strong decrease of F-v/F-m, induction of the K-step in the fluorescence induction transient, emergence of the A(T)-thermoluminescence-band and a dramatic increase in membrane permeability.In the first 4h in the light following the heat pulse, the A(T)-band and the K-step disappeared in parallel, indicating the toss of this restricted activity of PSII. This phase was followed by a recovery period, during which PSII-activity was gradually restored in the light. In darkness, no, recovery, except for the membrane permeability, was observed. A model is presented that accounts for (i) the damage induced by the heat pulse on the membrane architecture and on the PSII donor side, (ii) the light-dependent removal of the impaired reaction centers from the disorganized membrane, and (iii) the subsequent tight-independent restoration of the membrane permeability and the de novo synthesis of the PSII reaction centers in the tight.

In nature, water oxidation is done by a tetranuclear manganese cluster in photosystem II. Therefore, the study of water oxidation by Mn complexes is attractive in water splitting systems. In this report, a new mononuclear Mn(II) complex, MnL2 (HL = (E)-3-hydroxy-NMODIFIER LETTER PRIME-(pyridin-2-ylmethylene)-2-naphthohydrazide) was prepared and characterized by spectroscopic techniques and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Crystallographic analysis indicated that the geometry around the Mn(II) ion is distorted octahedral. The MnN4O2 coordination moiety is achieved by bounding of oxygen and two nitrogen donor atoms of two hydrazone ligands. The synthesized complex was also investigated for electrochemical water oxidation using electrochemical techniques, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry, and PXRD analysis. Linear sweep voltammetry experiment showed that the modified carbon paste electrode by the complex displays high activity for water oxidation reaction with an overpotential of 565 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 105 mV dec(-1) in an alkaline solution. It was found that the complex structure finally changes during the reaction and converts to Mn oxide nanoparticles which act as active catalytic species and oxidize the water.[GRAPHICS].									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000817881200001	35763236

Here, metal-organic fragments with adhesive excipient to realize high activity with good durability in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are developed. First, a leaf-like zeolitic-imidazolate framework (ZIF-L) is synthesized. Then, ionized species in hydrogen plasma attack preferentially the organic linkers of ZIF-L to derive cobalt-imidazole fragments (CIFs) as adhesive excipient, while they are designed to retain the coordinated cobalt nodes. Moreover, the vacant coordination sites at cobalt nodes and the unbound nitrogen at organic linkers induce high porosity and conductivity. The CIFs serve to stably impregnate trimetallic FeNiMo electrocatalysts (CIF:FeNiMo), and CIF:FeNiMo containing Fe contents of 22% and hexavalent Mo contents show to enable high activity with low overpotentials (203 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 238 mV at 100 mA cm(-2)) in OER. The near O K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure proves further that high activity for OER originates from the partially filled e(g) orbitals. Additionally, CIF:FeNiMo exhibit good durability, as demonstrated by high activity retention during at least 45 days in OER.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2198-3844		WOS:000631723400001	34105280

The emphasis was laid on the evolution with the annealing temperature of (i) the Er-Si solid-state reaction and (ii) the penetration of oxygen into Ti and its subsequent interaction with Er. For that sake, three categories of specimens were analyzed: asdeposited, annealed at 300 degrees C, and annealed at 600 degrees C. It was found that the presence of residual oxygen into the annealing atmosphere resulted in a substantial oxidation of the Er film surface, irrespective of the annealing temperature. However, the part of the Er film in intimate contact with the Si bulk formed a silicide (amorphous at 300 degrees C and crystalline at 600 degrees C) invariably free of oxygen, as testified by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiling and Schottky barrier height extraction of 0.3 eV at 600 degrees C. This proves that, even if Er is highly sensitive to oxygen contamination, the formation of low Schottky barrier Er silicide contacts on n-Si is quite robust. Finally, the production of stripped oxygen-free Er silicide was demonstrated after process optimization. (C) 2011 The Electrochemical Society.

Characteristics of the mixed oxide catalysts play crucial role in the catalytic activity. Here we tuned the crystalline characteristics of the CeO2-RuO2 mixed oxide by varying calcination temperature. The mixed oxide had rutile RuO2 and fluorite CeO2 of {111} dominant phase. The optimized mixed oxide was characterized thoroughly by Xray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The redox property of cerium ions via oxygen vacancy formation by ruthenium incorporation and the crystalline characteristics were responsible for the catalytic activity. The CeO2-RuO2 mixed oxide was incorporated into Ni-P coating on mild steel. The composition of CeO2-RuO2 mixed oxide in the coating was tuned and was explored as electrode for HER. Optimized surface properties and composition of the electrode facilitated the HER. The catalytic Ni-P electrode incorporated with an optimum content of CeO2-RuO2 (5 g L-1) exhibited very low overpotential as low as 180 mV at 250 mA cm(-2) during hydrogen evolution reaction in 32% (w/v) NaOH. The electrochemical HER mechanism involves Volmer chemical adsorption of H-2 on metal oxide and the chemical desorption of H-2 gas by Heyrovsky. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we develop a self-template strategy to synthesize hollow Fe-doped CoP prisms (Fe-CoP) via ion exchange of cobalt acetate hydroxide with [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) and phosphorization-induced transformation of CoFe-PBA (Co/Fe-containing prussian blue analogue) prisms in N-2 atmosphere. The obtained Fe-CoP not only inherits the hollow prism-like morphology of CoFe-PBA, but also forms rich mesoporous channel. The Fe-CoP prisms exhibit extraordinary OER performances in 1.0 M KOH, with a low overpotential of 236 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 32.9 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the presented electrocatalyst shows good long-term operating durability and activity. The XPS and TEM analysis confirm that Fe-CoP has undergone surface reconstruction in the process of electrocatalytic OER, and the in situ formed oxides and oxyhydroxides are the real active species to boost OER. This work provides a promising pathway to the design and synthesis of efficient and robust electrocatalysts with hierarchical hollow structure for boosting OER.

Here, ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulations combined with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were employed to provide atomic-level insights into the carbonation reaction of CaO with CO2. Results showed that two fast kinetic stages appear when the temperature increases. To understand this phenomenon, the diffusion, structural evolution as well as the carbonates accumulation were analyzed. It was found that the recovery of the initial fast reaction rate largely stems from the formations of pyrocarbonate anion. On CO2-CaCO3 interface, the solid product molecules are continuously propagated and joined in the existing C2O52- phase with multiple instances of formation and dissociation. Furthermore, surface carbonates can combine with crystal oxygen in the form of metastable corner-linked CO44- tetrahedron to diffuse inward the CaO particle. The increase of temperature greatly accelerates the formation of outer polymeric phases of CO2-CO32- and diffusion of inner CO32-, causing more CO2 molecules to be adsorbed and the carbonation reaction rate rises sharply.									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000573270000007

Transition metal oxides are desirable alternatives to replace benchmark Pt-based HER electrocatalysts because of their cost effectiveness, facile synthesis, versatile compositions, and easy electronic structure tuning. However, most available transition metal oxides show poor performance for HER catalysis. Here, it is reported that the anatase TiO2 can be efficiently developed into a superior HER electrocatalyst with comparable activity to Pt-based electrocatalysts in alkaline solution through simultaneous morphology control, proper lattice doping, and surface active sites engineering. Specifically, the obtained cobalt-doped TiO2 nanorod arrays (Co-TiO2@Ti(H-2)) show a low overpotential of only 78 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel plot of 67.8 mV dec(-1), and excellent stability even at an ultralarge current density of approximate to 480 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 m KOH solution. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the introduction of Co with rich oxygen vacancies can efficiently lower the energy barrier for water adsorption/dissociation and H intermediate desorption. This work uncovers the potential of the low-cost transition metal oxides as alternative HER electrocatalysts in alkaline water electrolysis.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			2366-9608			WOS:000649787100001	34927904

Herein, homogeneous Co9S8 nanoparticles anchored on nitrogen and sulfur co-doped porous carbon nanomaterials (CoS@NSCs) are fabricated by pyrolysis of natural soybean treated with cobalt nitrate. The unique porous structures of the soybean are utilized to provide space for the oxidation and complexation reactions for cobalt compounds, thus leading to in situ generation of homogenously dispersed cobalt sulfide nanoparticles that anchored on the N,S co-doped carbon framework. Because of the coupling effect of cobalt sulfide and doping heteroatoms, CoS@NSC-800 not only displays excellent electrocatalytic performances with low overpotential and high current density toward both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst and IrO2, catalyst, but also might be a promising candidate for high-performance supercapacitors. The method for the preparation of the multifunctional hybrids is simple but effective for the formation of uniformly distributed metal sulfide nanoparticles anchored on carbon materials, therefore providing a new perspective for the design and synthesis of multifunctional electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy conversion and storage at a large scale.									49	3	0	0	4	0	49			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000432753800024	29613758

Doping of P and B over alpha-CN modifies its electronic properties and reduces band gap (3.78 eV) of alpha-CN to the required band gap for HER and OER activities. The modification of electronic properties is discussed by the analysis of partial density of states, Lowdin charge and charge density plot. To understand HER and OER activities better, we computed Gibbs free energy change after adsorption of H/O in various doped alpha-CN systems. We observe that the P doping at C site and B doping at N site of alpha-CN are best suited for HER and OER respectively. The HER (OER) activity increases by 88.33% (29.35%) for P doped at C site (B doped at N site) of alpha-CN in comparison to pristine alpha-CN. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, alpha-Fe(2)O(3)photoanode with morphology of highly interconnected and aligned nanorod arrays have been successfully grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide, and its PEC activity toward water oxidation was facilely optimized by controlling the electrodeposition time. And then, this photoanode was modified with a Co(II) salophen complex with pyrene moiety via a hydrophobic interaction to construct a hybrid photoanode. The obtained photoanode manifests remarkable enhanced PEC performance relative to pristine alpha-Fe2O3, affording a remarkable photocurrent response of 0.7 mA cm(-2)at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and a low catalytic onset potential of 0.93 V in a neutral aqueous solution under simulated sunlight illumination (100 mW cm(-2)). Furthermore, the durability test indicates that this hybrid photoanode possesses good stability and a Faradaic efficiency of nearly 100% for oxygen evolution. The superior PEC performance is mainly due to the synergistic contribution of the Co(II) salophen co-catalyst and the alpha-Fe(2)O(3)nanorod arrays, in which the co-catalyst greatly suppresses the surface holes/electrons recombination and accelerates the surface oxygen evolution reaction kinetics. Graphic abstract One novel hybrid photoanode integrating alpha-Fe(2)O(3)nanorod arrays semiconductor with Co(II) salophen co-catalyst is facilely fabricated and demonstrates remarkable photoelectrochemical performance toward water oxidation.[GRAPHICS].									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000542110300007

Compared to conventional approaches, other than the avoidance of an end-capping procedure, the current protocol is remarkably advanced in the aspect of eco-friendliness, step-and cost-economy, and, of special significance, the purity of polymer products. As illustrative examples, six 5,5'-bithiazole-based polymers are synthesized using this new method, demonstrating higher number-average molecular weight (M-n up to 33700) in better yields (up to 93%) through only one step. The evolution of C-H/C-H-type DArP from heavy metal salts to O-2 alone as the oxidant could solve the problem of metal residues in polymers, which is considered harmful to the performance of devices.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000386952000006	27553577

Impairment of donor and acceptor side components								BIOCHEMISTRY				35	27			8964	8973		10.1021/bi9530595				JUL 9 1996	1996	Inhibition of photosystem II electron transport by UV-B radiation has been studied in isolated spinach photosystem II membrane particles using low-temperature EPR spectroscopy and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, UV-B irradiation results in the rapid inhibition of oxygen evolution and the decline of variable chlorophyll fluorescence, These effects are accompanied by the loss of the multiline EPR signal arising from the S-2 state of the water-oxidizing complex and the induction of Signal IIfast originating from stabilized Tyr-Z(+), The EPR signals from the Q(A)(-)Fe(2+) acceptor complex, Tyr-D+, and the oxidized non-heme iron (Fe3+) are also decreased during the course of UV-B irradiation, but at a significantly slower rate than oxygen evolution and the multiline signal. The decrease of the Fe3+ signal at high g values (g = 8.06, g = 5.6) is accompanied by the induction of another EPR signal at g = 4.26 that arises most likely from the same Fe3+ ion in a modified ligand environment. UV-B irradiation also affects cytochrome b-559, The g = 2.94 EPR signal that arises from the dark-oxidized form is enhanced, whereas the light inducible g = 3.04 signal that arises from the photo-oxidizable population of cytochrome b-559 is diminished. UV-B irradiation also induces the degradation of the D1 reaction center protein, The rate of the DI protein loss is slower than the inhibition of oxygen evolution and of the multiline signal but follows closely the loss of Signal IIslow, the Q(A)(-)Fe(2+) and the Fe3+ EPR signals, as well as the release of protein-bound manganese, It is concluded from the results that UV-B radiation affects photosystem II redox components at both the donor and acceptor side. The primary damage occurs at the water-oxidizing complex. Modification and/or inactivation of tyrosine-D, cytochrome b-559, and the Q(A)Fe(2+) acceptor complex are subsequent events that coincide more closely with the UV-B-induced damage to the protein structure of the photosystem II reaction center.									126	9	0	0	118	1	138			0006-2960			WOS:A1996UW43000020	8688433

The ultra-small Fe, Co, and Ni co-catalysts on the TiO2(B) nanosheets exhibit remarkably enhanced photo activities, compared to that with the best N loading. It is found that the oxygen bridge vacancies act as the colour centres locating at the position adjacent to the O-1-Ti-1 sites on the TiO2(B) (0 0 1) surface. The photo-colouration and photo-bleaching have significantly impact on the nucleation and growth of the metallic clusters. The high density and uniform dispersion of the sub-nano-sized transition metal clusters benefits for the photo reduction under light irradiation, as well as efficient carrier separation, leading to a great improvement of the photo activity.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000517883800014

In this work, we use a rational design method for the synthesis of ultrasmall and highly dispersed bimetallic CoMo carbide/oxide particles deposited on graphene oxide. Thermal conversion of the molecular precursors [H3PMo12O40], Co(OAc)(2)4 H2O and melamine in the presence of graphene oxide gives the mixed carbide/oxide (Co6Mo6C2/Co2Mo3O8) nanoparticle composite deposited on highly dispersed, N,P-doped carbon. The resulting composite shows outstanding electrocatalytic water-splitting activity for both the oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reaction, and superior performance to reference samples including commercial 20 % Pt/C & IrO2. Electrochemical and other materials analyses indicate that Co6Mo6C2 is the main active phase in the composite, and the N,P-doping of the carbon matrix increases the catalytic activity. The facile design could in principle be extended to multiple bimetallic catalyst classes by tuning of the molecular metal oxide precursor.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000510042400001	31840848

A minimal set of 13 reactions is developed that adequately describes the time evolution of the major chemical constituents of a COIL device. A characteristic time for the dissociation of molecular iodine by singlet oxygen is established in terms of iodine fraction, water content, yield of singlet oxygen, and rate parameters. Finally, an approximate analytic solution to the iodine dissociation problem is established for a broad range of reagent concentrations. The current study is Limited in applicability due to the exclusion of chemical heat release and reactive mixing phenomenon.

However, how to uniformly disperse and firmly fix Pt nanoparticles (NPs) on carbon support with optimal particle size for catalysis is still a big challenge. Herein, by taking advantage of the isolating effect of the cobalt (Co) single atom site to Pt, strong interaction between Co single atoms and Pt, and the confinement of the porous carbon matrix derived metal organic frameworks, we successfully evenly immobilize Pt NPs on ZnCo-ZIF originated porous nitrogen-doped carbon matrix with rich cobalt single atoms (Co SAs-ZIF-NC) as multiple active sites. Compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst, Pt@Co SAs-ZIF-NC, with ultralow Pt loading and ideal particle size, not only increases the active center, but also promotes the catalysis kinetics, greatly improving the ORR and HER catalytic activity. Under acidic conditions, its half-wave potential (0.917 V) is superior to com-mercial Pt/C (0.868 V), and the mass activity (0.48 A per mgPt) at 0.9 V is 3 times that of Pt/C (0.16 A per mgPt), surpassing the U.S. DOE target of 0.44 A per mgPt. Besides, it also shows outstanding HER performance. At 20 and 30 mV, its mass activity is even 4.5 and 13.6 times that of Pt/C. When further employed for HER in seawater, its mass activity is about 4 times as high as that of Pt/C, demonstrating the great potential applications.									45	3	0	0	3	0	46			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000702538600004

Herein, MnO2 nanotubes (NTs) are prepared as both templates and oxidants to grow polypyrrole (PPy) nanotubes (NTs), on which a zeolite imidazole framework-67 (ZIF-67) is grown. Following that, a single calcination step transforms MnO2, PPy and ZIF-67 into MnO nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and Co-N doped carbon materials (Co-N/C), respectively to form a one-dimensional (1D) hierarchical ternary nanocomposite. In this composite, the CNTs encapsulate the MnO particles to effectively prevent their further agglomeration. The separated MnO particles possess a mixed valence of Mn2+/4+ inside the CNTs, which can greatly facilitate electrolyte diffusion and electron transfer during the redox reactions. Furthermore, the Co-N/C and micro-CNTs formed on the CNT provide multiple catalytic active sites (Co-N-x, Co-O, and C-N moieties). At the optimized calcination temperature of 700 degrees C, MnO@CNT@Co-N/C exhibits excellent ORR/OER catalytic performance with a Delta E value of 0.81 V while maintaining structural and compositional stability. Remarkably, the rechargeable Zn-air battery fabricated with MnO@CNT@Co-N/C as the air electrode catalyst displays a higher peak power density (200.8 mW cm(-2)) and improved cyclability (300 h) at 5 mA cm(-2) compared to a precious metal commercial catalyst, indicating the potential application of this composite in energy storage and conversion technology.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000701046300001

However, its wide implementation is hampered by expensive electrocatalysts and photovoltaic apparatus. Herein, we designed a low-cost overall water splitting system combining flexible catalyst electrodes and one novel organic solar cell. The flexible electrodes contain carbon fabric functionalized with nitrogen-doped carbon encased iron-cobalt bimetallic phosphide and sulfide nanohybrids as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. The electrolyzer for overall water splitting can realize a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.60 V and remain stable in long-time durability test in alkaline media. Moreover, when driven by one organic solar cell, our system yields a record high water-splitting current density of 7.5 mA cm(-2) with a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 9.2%. The above results demonstrate its potential as a real-life solar-powered hydrogen production system.									41	2	0	0	2	0	41			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000455264600009

Herein, 3D self-supported Fe-doped Ni2P nanosheet arrays are synthesized on Ni foam by hydrothermal method followed by in situ phosphorization, which serve as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. The as-synthesized (Ni0.33Fe0.67)(2)P with moderate Fe doping shows an outstanding OER performance, which only requires an overpotential of approximate to 230 mV to reach 50 mA cm(-2) and is more efficient than the other Fe incorporated Ni2P electrodes. In addition, the (Ni0.33Fe0.67)(2)P exhibits excellent activity toward HER with a small overpotential of approximate to 214 mV to reach 50 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, an alkaline electrolyzer is measured using (Ni0.33Fe0.67)(2)P electrodes as cathode and anode, respectively, which requires cell voltage of 1.49 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) as well as shows excellent stability with good nanoarray construction. Such good performance is attributed to the high intrinsic activity and superaerophobic surface property.									377	30	0	0	12	0	379			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000412324200008

Herein, we report the fabrication of hierarchical copper phosphide nanoarrays (Cu3P) on three-dimensional (3D) nickel foam (NF) through a template-directed synthetic strategy as electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Specifically, the Cu3P/NF electrode demonstrates a remarkably low overpotential of similar to 331 mV to approach the current density of 50 mA cm-2 in the OER, and an overpotential of similar to 115 mV to achieve -10 mA cm(-2) current density in the HER. Meanwhile the Cu3P/NF catalyst could hold a great stability for both reactions in alkaline condition, reflected in 37 h for OER and 24 h for HER of consistent galvanostatic electrolysis. As revealed by TEM, STEM and XPS characterizations, the high catalytic OER activity can be ascribed to the 3D open structure of Cu3P/NF and the abundant CuO active sites in hierarchical CuO/Cu3P/NF structure after in-situ activation. Furthermore, the overall water splitting is con-ducted in a two-electrode cell, which requires only a cell voltage of 1.63 V to approach 10 mA cm(-2) with a good stability of 20 h. This protocol of Cu3P/NF electrode affords a general strategy to construct hierarchically structured metal phosphides for clean energy-related application.

In this short review, we briefly introduce the recent theoretical progress in photocatalysis carried out in our research group. Extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with the periodic continuum solvation model have been utilized to compute the electronic structure of extended surfaces, nanoparticles in aqueous solution and provide the reaction energetics for the key elementary reaction. It is demonstrated that the equilibrium shape of nanoparticle is sensitive to its size from 1 to 30 nm, and the sharp crystals possess much higher activity than the flat crystals in oxygen evolution of water splitting, which in combination lead to the morphology dependence of photocatalytic activity.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			1005-281X			WOS:000306379200007

The primary step in this process-the conversion of sunlight into chemical energy-is driven by four multi-subunit membrane protein complexes named photosystem 1, photosystem 11, cytochrome b(6)f complex and F-ATPase. Photosystem I generates the most negative redox potential in nature and thus largely determines the global amount of enthalpy in living systems. The recent structural determination of PSI complexes from cyanobacteria and plants sheds light on the evolutionary forces that shaped oxygenic photosynthesis. The fortuitous formation of our solar system in a space plentiful of elements, our distance from the sun and the long time of uninterrupted evolution enabled the perfection of photosynthesis and the evolution of advanced organisms. The available structural information complements the knowledge gained from genomic and proteomic data to illustrate a more precise scenario for the evolution of life systems on earth.

Rh(210) surface is annealed in oxygen at temperature >= 550 K, the surface completely covered with nanometre-scale facets. The annealing temperature is found to be one of the responsible factors for the nucleation and growth of faceted surface which is characterised as three-sided nanoscale pyramids exposing one reconstructed (110) and two {731} faces on each pyramid. STM measurements confirm that the average size of the nanopyramids depends upon the annealing temperature. Our experimental results revealed that the fine structure of the Rh nanopyramids is influence by the change in the oxygen coverage. Nanopyramidal faceted Rh(210) could be used as a potential template for studies of structure sensitive reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1475-7435	1741-8151		WOS:000309703400007

Here we uncover, investigate, and discuss previously unaddressed effects of conductive supports and the electrolyte pH on the Ni-Fe(OOH) catalyst redox behavior and catalytic OER activity, combining in situ UV-vis spectro-electrochemistry, operando electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), and in situ cryo X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Supports and pH > 13 strongly enhanced the precatalytic voltammetric charge of the Ni-Fe oxyhydroxide redox peak couple, shifted them more cathodically, and caused a 2-3-fold increase in the catalytic OER activity. Analysis of DEMS-based faradaic oxygen efficiency and electrochemical UV-vis traces consistently confirmed our voltammetric observations, evidencing both a more cathodic O-2 release and a more cathodic onset of Ni oxidation at higher pH. Using UV-vis, which can monitor the amount of oxidized Ni+3/+4 in situ, confirmed an earlier onset of the redox process at high electrolyte pH and further provided evidence of a smaller fraction of Ni+3/+4 in mixed Ni-Fe centers, confirming the unresolved paradox of a reduced metal redox activity with increasing Fe content. A nonmonotonic super-Nernstian pH dependence of the redox peaks with increasing Fe content-displaying Pourbaix slopes as steep as -120 mV/pH-suggested a two proton-one electron transfer. We explain and discuss the experimental pH effects using refined coupled (PCET) and decoupled proton transfer-electron transfer (PT/ET) schemes involving negatively charged oxygenate ligands generated at Fe centers. Together, we offer new insight into the catalytic reaction dynamics and associated catalyst redox chemistry of the most important class of alkaline OER catalysts.									360	12	0	0	30	0	363			0002-7863			WOS:000393848400058	28080038

In this paper, we report the design and synthesis of a novel and highly efficient electrode of NiCo2O4 nanoneedles decorated with FeCoNi layered ternary hydroxides supported on carbon cloth (FeCoNi-LTH/NiCo2O4/CC) by a facile and efficient two-step approach. It exhibits superior bifunctional catalytic activities for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media, due to the special structure and strong synergies. The FeCoNi-LTH/NiCo2O4/CC obtains an onset overpotential of 240 mV and an overpotential of 302 mV at the current density of SO mA cm(-2) for OER, which is superior to RuO2. It also efficiently catalyzes HER with onset overpotential of 96 mV and overpotential of 151 mV to achieve a current density of 20 mA cm(-2). Serving as both cathode and anode in a two-electrode water splitting system, FeCoNi-LTH/NiCo2O4/CC only requires an overpotential of 1.65 V at current density of 50 mA cm(-2).

Developing an efficient catalyst which can be applied to both HER and OER is crucial. Here, a bifunctional catalyst, CFP/NiCo2O4/Co0.57Ni0.43LMOs, has been successfully fabricated. It exhibits remarkable performance for OER in 0.1 M KOH producing a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 0.34 V (1.57 V vs. RHE), better than that of the commercial Ir/C (20%) catalyst. Simultaneously, it also exhibits good catalytic performance for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 producing a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 52 mV and a Tafel slope of 34 mV dec(-1), approaching that of the commercial Pt/C (20%) nanocatalyst. Particularly, CFP/NiCo2O4/Co0.57Ni0.43LMOs present better durability under harsh OER and HER cycling conditions than commercial Ir/C and Pt/C. Furthermore, an H-type electrolyzer was fabricated by applying CFP/NiCo2O4/Co0.57Ni0.43LMOs as the cathode and anode electrocatalyst, which can be driven by a single-cell battery. This bifunctional catalyst will be very promising in overall water splitting.									149	13	0	0	4	0	151			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000368040200019	26671685

Heteroatom doping has been an efficient approach to boost the intrinsic OER activity of the active sites by modifying the electronic structure. Here, a simple anion substitution strategy is reported that increases the OER activity of nickel selenides via a one-step hydrothermal treatment of a metal-organic framework precursor. The resulting S-substituted Ni3Se4 nanoparticles display distortion of their crystal lattice. As expected, the sulfur substitution modifies the electronic structure of Ni3Se4 and leads to outstanding electrocatalytic activity. All the S-substituted Ni3Se4 catalysts exhibit higher OER activities than the original Ni3Se4. The optimized catalyst achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 275 mV with a Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH. In addition to its electrochemical activity, the S-Ni3Se4-2 catalyst also exhibits good stability with only a 7.5% increase in overpotential at 50 mA cm(-2) after 100 hours. This work demonstrates one strategy to modify the electronic structure of transition metal compounds by anion regulation.

Here, we demonstrate an improved round-trip efficiency of similar to 80% by means of a mesoporous carbon electrode, which directs the growth of one-dimensional and amorphous lithium peroxide. Morphologically, the one-dimensional nanostructures with small volume and high surface show improved charge transport and promote delithiation (lithium ion dissolution) during recharge and thus plays a critical role in the facile decomposition of lithium peroxide. Thermodynamically, density functional calculations reveal that disordered geometric arrangements of the surface atoms in the amorphous structure lead to weaker binding of the key reaction intermediate lithium superoxide, yielding smaller oxygen reduction and evolution overpotentials compared to the crystalline surface. This study suggests a strategy to enhance the decomposition rate of lithium peroxide by exploiting the size and shape of one-dimensional nanostructured lithium peroxide.									51	3	0	0	4	0	51			2041-1723			WOS:000424989600001	29445206

The evolution of the size and shape of these defects were studied as a function of time, of surface misorientation and of oxygen/neutral gas ratio. The association of the Burton Cabrera and Frank (BCF) model developed for ultra high vacuum conditions with the Deal and Groves (DG) law for oxidation allows to explain the influence of the studied parameters on the defect evolution. This shows that the oxidation step proceeds with the help of diffusion along the interface rather than with a localized reaction, at least in the conditions of the experiment. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

A marked decrease in overvoltage for the oxygen evolution reaction was observed on the hydrophobic-modified PTFE/PbO2 anode when compared with a PbO2 anode. The smaller electrochemically active area was indicated by the smaller value of both the electrochemically active surface area (charge Q*) and the capacitance C-dl of the working electrode present on the hydrophobic PTFE/PbO2 than on the PbO2 electrode. Additionally, a smoother topology was also observed from the AFM to be present on the hydrophobic PTFE/PbO2 than on the PbO2 electrode. A higher relative rate for the oxygen evolution in 1 M H2SO4 on hydrophobic PTFE/PbO2 than on PbO2 was ascribed to both the bubble-removing effect caused by the hydrophobic centers and the fact that lower electrochemically active surface area for the anodic composite electrodeposition of PTFE/PbO2 is compensated by the higher electrocatalytic activity of active sites under a high applied overvoltage. The electrochemical stability of the hydrophobic PTFE/PbO2 anode was inferred to be substantially enhanced when compared with the unmodified PbO2 anode. PbO2 modified with the hydrophobic PTFE center via anodic composite electrodeposition resulted in a marked improvement in the electrocatalytic activity of the electrochemically active sites. An alteration of the surface structure of hydrophobic-modified PTFE/PbO2 was also inferred from the observation of AFM image to be exhibited when compared with PbO2.									40	5	0	0	1	1	44			0022-0728			WOS:A1994PM62900019

To date, Dend-NPs have been pointed out as well-organized and effective catalysts in the most popular electrochemical technologies, such as fuel cells, batteries, supercapacitors and water electrolyzers. Different strategies and technological progresses targeting efficient power and energy productions with excellent durability and performance retentions in such systems are emphasized. Dend-NPs action in electrochemical energy systems thrived by cathodic catalytic reactions, particularly, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in electrolyzers and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells, and electrochemical (Faradaic and non-Faradaic) processes in batteries and supercapacitors are summarized. The metal NPs produced within the dendrimer by various approaches, conditions for obtaining zero-valent metals and synthesis methods for different types of metal NPs are discussed. Advancing knowledge of Dend-NPs synthesis, difficulties and their solutions and the best practice recommended for readers are explained in brief. Besides, stability, role of dendrimer, generation effects, terminal group effects and mechanisms to encapsulate each transition and precious metal NPs such as copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), silver (Ag), gold (Au) and bimetallic within the cavity of PAMAM dendrimers are highlighted. Moreover, PAMAM dendrimer and its generation are classified bearing in mind their viable use in energy technologies and applications where possible. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, an Fe-doped NiSe (a mixture of hexagonal NiSe and orthorhombic NiSe) nanorod/nanosheet hierarchical array on Ni foam was synthesized through a one-step solvothermal reaction, which exhibits high and stable catalytic activity for both the OER and HER in alkaline solution. The optimal Fe7.4%-NiSe only requires a small overpotential of 231 mV to drive 50 mA cm-2, and can provide a large current density of 500 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of 269 mV, and 1000 mA cm-2 at 291 mV for the OER. Moreover, it can afford 10 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of 163 mV, and 500 mA cm-2 at 296 mV toward the HER. A water electrolyzer with two Fe7.4%-NiSe electrodes only needs a low cell potential of 1.585 V to reach 10 mA cm-2, and 1.74 V to reach 100 mA cm-2 with great stability. The rich active sites and high conductivity of the Fe-doped NiSe nanorod/nanosheet hierarchical array contribute to its high catalytic performance. This work develops an alternative and simple synthetic approach for bimetal selenides with a hierarchical structure and provides an attractive low-cost electrocatalyst toward overall water splitting applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488			INSPEC:19498674

Herein, an electrocatalyst comprising Bi-CoP composite nanoparticles supported on an N, P co-doped defective graphene aerogel (Bi-CoP/NP-DG) was fabricated via a facile and scalable hydrothermal method, followed by a low temperature pyrolysis process. The graphene aerogel acting as a carbon matrix provided abundant channels and avoided the aggregation of catalyst nanoparticles. Moreover, the defects on graphene could not only enhance the catalytic performance but also anchor the catalyst nanoparticles to improve the stability of the designed electrocatalyst. Benefiting from the above merits, the as-prepared Bi-CoP/NP-DG catalyst presented excellent catalytic performances for ORR (half-wave potential, E-1/2 = 0.81 V) and OER (overpotential, eta(10) mA cm(-2) = 0.37 V) in an alkaline electrolyte. Moreover, the designed Bi-CoP/NP-DG catalyst with its bifunctional catalytic activities could endow the home-made zinc-air (Zn-air) battery with high power density (122 mW cm(-2)), specific capacity (752 mA h g(Zn)(-1)) and cycling stability. Interestingly, the Zn-air battery can be utilized to drive the overall water-splitting reaction with the designed catalyst functioning as both anode and cathode. This study paves a new strategy to design non-precious electrocatalysts for highly efficient rechargeable metal-air battery setups.									30	0	0	0	3	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000489727600034

Extending cycle life of the soluble lead redox flow battery with an auxiliary gas-diffusion electrode: a proof-of-concept study								IONICS				27	8			3403	3414		10.1007/s11581-021-04127-5		JUN 2021		AUG 2021	2021	Development and demonstration of soluble lead redox flow battery (SLRFB) is hindered due to its limited cycle life caused by the formation of lead dendrites, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and accumulation of PbO2 sludge. OER leads to an imbalanced deposition of Pb metal at anode and PbO2 at cathode. As a result, complete oxidation of Pb is stalled during discharge of SLRFB. Besides, sluggish kinetics of cathode reaction results in accumulation of PbO2. Due to incomplete dissolution and accumulation of both active materials, concentration of Pb2+ decreases continuously in the electrolyte. Under such conditions, repeated charge-discharge cycling leads to the failure of SLRFB. In this study, we propose and demonstrate a novel route of using an auxiliary gas-diffusion electrode to obviate these problems to help in extending the cycle life of SLRFB. The auxiliary electrode is operated either as an air electrode or a hydrogen electrode. When the auxiliary electrode is an air electrode, it is used as positive electrode, and on coupling with anode of SLRFB, it forms a galvanic Pb-air flow cell that on discharge helps in oxidizing Pb metal to Pb2+ ions. When the auxiliary electrode is a hydrogen electrode, it is used as negative electrode, and on coupling with cathode of SLRFB, it forms a galvanic H-2-PbO2 flow cell which on discharge reduces PbO2 to Pb2+ ions and mitigates the adverse effect of sludge accumulation in SLRFB.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000665686300001

Moreover, engineering the site activity and the number of active sites of LDHs is an efficient approach to advance the OER activity, as the thickness and stacking structure of the LDHs layer limit the catalytic activity. This work presents an interesting in situ approach of tuning the site activity and number of active sites of NiMn-LDHs, which exhibit the superior OER performance (onset overpotential of 0.17 V and overpotential of 0.24 V at 10 mA cm(-2)). The fundamental mechanistic insights and active phases during the OER process are characterized by in operando techniques along with the computational density functional theory calculations, revealing that the Ni site constitutes the OER activity and the dynamically generated NiOOH moiety is the active phase. We also prove that Ni sites undergo a reversible oxidation state under the working conditions to create active NiOOH species which catalyze the water to generate oxygen. These findings suggest that the Ni(III) phase in NiMn-LDHs is the OER active site and Mn promotes the electronic properties of Ni sites. Utilizing in situ/in operando techniques and theoretical calculation, we find that the in situ intercalation of guest anions allows the expansion of the LDH layers and keeps the active NiOOH species under the oxidation state of +3 via electron coupling, which ultimately tunes the site populations and site activity toward the superior OER activity, respectively. This work thus targets to provide insight into strategies to design the next generation of highly active catalysts for water electrolysis and fuel cell technologies.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000703553600095	34515484

However, the composition and morphology of surfaces of real samples are often poorly characterized, and thus our understanding of the influence of these factors on the surface exchange reactions is rudimentary. In this work, we apply low energy ion scattering (LEIS) spectrometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate the evolution of the surface composition and morphology of two layered perovskite type materials, showing the dynamic nature of these surfaces even at room temperature.

The oxygen dissociation rate constants were obtained for thermal equilibrium conditions as well as for thermal non-equilibrium ones. The expression for the thermal equilibrium dissociation rate constant was obtained at temperatures near the front 6000-11000K. The simulation of high-temperature oxygen flow behind the front of the shock wave was performed in quasi-one-dimensional approximation. The empirical model of high-temperature dissociation is proposed for the description of the temperature evolution behind the front of shock wave, and the calculated profiles of vibrational and translational temperatures were compared with the measured ones.					28th International Symposium on Rarefied Gas Dynamics (RGD)28th International Symposium on Rarefied Gas Dynamics (RGD)	JUL 09-13, 2012JUL 09-13, 2012	Minist Econ & Competitividad; Govt Aragon, Dept Ind & Innovat; Aragoneese Agcy Res & Dev (ARAID); Univ Zaragoza; Zaragoza Sci Ctr Adv Modeling (ZCAM); Inst Biocomputat & Study Complex Syst (BiFi); Parallel Interface Direct Simulat Monte Carlo (PIDSMC) Software IncMinist Econ & Competitividad; Govt Aragon, Dept Ind & Innovat; Aragoneese Agcy Res & Dev (ARAID); Univ Zaragoza; Zaragoza Sci Ctr Adv Modeling (ZCAM); Inst Biocomputat & Study Complex Syst (BiFi); Parallel Interface Direct Simulat Monte Carlo (PIDSMC) Software Inc	Zaragoza, SPAINZaragoza, SPAIN	8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0094-243X		978-0-7354-1115-9	WOS:000312411200144

Therefore, we developed an approach which allows the direct simulation of such data based on microkinetic modeling. This approach allows us to assess the influence of various input parameters on the EIS and on the current voltage curves and, hence, the overall performance of electrochemical cells. We develop our approach for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) taking place at the semiconductor electrolyte interface. At this interface, the microkinetic equations, that is, electrochemical reactions, for the multiple steps in OER are formulated and the resulting set of equations are modeled in a state-space form. As an input to the state-space model, we use the theoretical reaction rates calculated using density functional theory and Gerischer theory for semiconductors. Then, the electrochemical data are simulated as a function of applied potential. Next to the theory and the model development, a case study on the hematite-electrolyte interface which is a typical interface in photoelectrochemical cells is presented. Current voltage curves and EIS data for the hematite interface are simulated from the electrochemical model. The data are compared to experimental measurements. Apart from the current density and the EIS, the model can simulate the coverage of intermediate species as a function of applied potential which is highly demanded for identifying the limiting processes at the interface, but not available from experimental studies. This approach is generic and can be used for other electrochemical interfaces, such as present in fuel cells, electrolysers, or batteries.									8	1	0	0	1	0	9			1932-7447			WOS:000465488600040

Oxygen discharge was investigated on those electrodes in 40 wt % KOH solution at temperatures ranging between 40 and 80-degrees-C. Up to a cobalt loading of 12 mg cm-2, the larger the loading, the larger the electrode/solution interface, which resulted in improved electrocatalytic activity with the loading. The electrocatalytic activity was also largely temperature-dependent.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0021-891X			WOS:A1993KX70900015

About 2000 laser shots at 10(10) W cm(-2) were delivered into a sealed reaction chamber. The chamber with a long capillary was designed to measure absorption of O-3, NO, and NO2 as a function of the number of laser shots. The light source for absorption measurements was the continuum radiation emitted by the plasma during the first 0.2 mus of its evolution. A kinetic model was developed that encompassed the principal chemical reactions between the major atmospheric components and the products of laser breakdown. In the model, the laser plasma was treated as a source of nitric oxide and atomic oxygen, whose rates of production were calculated using measured absorption by NO, NO2, and O-3. The calculated concentration profiles for NO, NO2, and O-3 were in good agreement with measured profiles over a time scale of 0-200 s. The steady-state concentration of ozone was measured in a flow cell in air. For a single breakdown in air, the estimated steady-state yield of ozone was 2 X 10(12) molecules, which agreed with the model prediction. This study can be of importance for general understanding of laser plasma chemistry and for elucidating the nature of spectral interferences and matrix effects that may take place in applied spectrochemical analysis.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			0003-7028			WOS:000187943100019	14658160

Topological insulator materials, including robust surface states and excellent carrier mobility, are suitable for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts. Topological materials usually have a strong contribution to the density of states close to the Fermi level and high carrier mobility, which is a prerequisite for designing highly efficient catalysts. The binding energy of hydrogen (G(*H)) is almost zero and is a promising candidate for producing hydrogen from water. A linear scaling relationship was established depending upon the binding strengths of ORR intermediates. The limiting potential diagram could modulate the catalytic efficiency by Delta G(*OH) between different activity sites on MoTe2, and a volcano plot for the ORR overpotential as a function of Delta G(*OH) was found. According to our analysis, the best system is 1T'-MoTe2 with a. site for the ORR and an alpha' site for the HER, which are predicted to have an overpotential of 0.20 V for the HER and 0.33 V for the ORR with spin-orbit coupling calculation. HER and ORR occur along the most favorable paths on the same phase MoTe2 but at different sites, which can be considered promising candidates for both ORR and HER. Specifically, spin-orbit coupling in a metal insulator tends to interact with oxygen molecules to contribute to the ORR process, and localized electron spin coupling can guarantee the moderate binding strength of *OH intermediates. This study may provide guidance to explore new and efficient catalysts based on the theory predictions, which has been proven to be feasible for catalyst design.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000648878900093

The redox behaviour of ICE molecule, fouling of electrodes and generation of oxygen was studied by cyclic voltammetry. The studies on cyclic voltammetry reveals that the ICE oxidation takes place directly on electrode surface at the potential region above 0.3 V vs. SCE by direct electron transformation and oxygen evolution from anode. The effect of the electrolyte, pH of the aqueous medium and applied current density on the mineralization behaviour of ICE is also investigated. The degradation of ICE is monitored in terms of TOC and ICE concentration with electrolysis time and corresponding chloride evolution. The complete mineralization of ICE is achieved using Na2SO4 as supporting electrolyte. Conversely, the mineralization of the ICE molecule was observed to be poor because of the electrode fouling in the presence of NaNO3. The dechlorination of ICE is found to increase with electrolysis time and the complete dechlorination is observed at all I-appl studied. The kinetics of ICE degradation was found to follow pseudo-first order reaction whose rate constant was calculated to be 0.0081 cm s(-1) at I-appl value of 13.39 mA cm(-2). The performance of Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5 anode was proved to be better compared to Pt under similar experimental conditions. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The obtained molybdenum carbide-carbon hybrid catalysts (MoC@NCS) exhibit extraordinarily electrochemical hydrogen evolution activity with a small overpotential of 89 and 81 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline (1.0 M KOH) and acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) medium, respectively, even comparable to noble-metal Pt/C benchmark. Specially, MoC@NCS also shows excellent long-term durability in alkaline or acidic electrolyte. Furthermore, the obtained carbon matrix (NCS) featuring high content of N dopants and hierarchically porous architecture exhibits high catalytic efficiency for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte. For a further step, the obtained NCS coupled with the MoC@NCS, working as anodic and cathodic electrodes, in a two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer for overall water splitting, which can obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.69 V, along with robust operation durability. The synergistic effect of the porous carbon matrix of high nitrogen content and the molybdenum carbide nanoparticles of uniform distribution, together with hierarchically porous structure, should be responsible for the outstanding electrocatalytic HER performance.

Unfortunately, the hierarchical structure inevitably induces intergranular cracks and parasitic reactions at the cathode-electrolyte interphase, aggravating chemomechanical instability and seriously hindering their practical application. Here, we propose a nanowelding strategy to build consolidation points at the grain boundary of the primary particles, which dramatically enhances the capacity retention and chemomechanical stability. Meanwhile, the oxygen vacancies in the ceria-based solid electrolyte possessing oxygen adsorbing and storage capability can restrain the active oxygenates in the surficial lattice to avoid oxygen evolution. Experimental characterization further confirms that this unique architecture can effectively prevent the liquid electrolyte from penetrating into the active material along the grain boundary and consequently eliminate the adverse effects, including intergranular cracks, cathode electrolyte interface formation and growth, and the layered structure-rock salt phase irreversible transition. This finding provides a promising approach to realize the rapid commercialization of highly stabilized nickel-rich cathode materials for high-performance lithium-ion batteries.									13	2	0	0	0	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000623228500045	33576597

However, developing electrocatalysts with high activity and excellent stability for an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media is still a big challenge. Herein, a Ce-x-IrO2 catalyst supported on N-doped porous carbon (NPC) was developed via doping Ce into IrO2 nanoparticles. The Ce-x-IrO2 nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on NPC due to the high surface area. The optimized Ce-0.2-IrO2 @NPC delivers a low overpotential of 224 mV and excellent stability of 100 h in 0.5 M H2SO4 at 10 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the introduction of Ce could modify the electronic structure of IOr(2), decreasing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step for OER and enhancing the electrochemical OER performance. Our work opens up a new way of developing anodic electrocatalysts, which can be stably applied in acidic media.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000563074900018	32709192

We show that annealing and plasma post-treatments improve significantly the photoelectrochemical properties for the OER. Annealing steps lead to a reorganization of the crystal structure and thereby to a pronounced shift of the photocurrent to negative potentials. Surface photovoltage measurements (SPV) indicate an enhanced separation of charge carriers originated from the band gap photoabsorption. Nevertheless a more pronounced effect on the catalytic efficiency was gained by a surface-treatment in oxygen plasma. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis reveals an oxygen enriched surface layer with new oxygen species which might be responsible for the improved electrochemical activity. SPV measurements identify an increased fraction of transferred charge carriers from this newly produced surface defects. The combination of these post-treatments leads finally to an efficient hematite photoanode for the OER.					221st Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society (ECS)221st Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society (ECS)	MAY 06-10, 2012MAY 06-10, 2012	Electrochem Soc; Fullerenes, Nanotubes, & Carbon Nanostructures; Energy Technol; SensorElectrochem Soc; Fullerenes, Nanotubes, & Carbon Nanostructures; Energy Technol; Sensor	Seattle, WASeattle, WA	4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1938-5862	1938-6737	978-1-60768-388-9; 978-1-62332-036-2	WOS:000325396600014

ILs have been described as designer solvents as their properties and behaviour can be adjusted to suit an individual reaction need. In the framework of this study we applied a conceptually similar design approach and showed that a simple parameter such as the concentration of a Li+ dopant dramatically affects the reaction yields of Li/O-2 based energy storage devices. We studied the effect of Li+ concentration from 0.1 to 1 M in a LiTFSI: PYR14TFSI ionic liquid electrolyte on the kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and on the formation rate of different Li-O species at two different temperatures, finding that the discharge capacity, rates and product distribution change in a non-linear way. At 60 degrees C, the highest rates and up to one order of magnitude larger capacities were observed at intermediate LiTFSI concentrations, implying a complete mechanism switch from surface to volume phase mediation for Li2O2 precipitation. At room temperature the same evolution was observed, even if in this case the surface mediation remained predominant at all concentrations. These results suggest the possibility to optimise the ionic liquid based Li/O-2 battery performances in terms of discharge capacity and lithium use, by tuning the temperature and alkali cation concentration.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2398-4902			WOS:000424001700011

Herein, we produce efficient NiFe-based OER electrocatalysts with rich oxygen vacancies and abundant transport channels by an argon plasma-engraving strategy. Compared with pristine NiFe, the obtained best NiFe-plasma catalyst yields a 12.5-fold increased current density (from 80 to ~ 1,000 mA cm(-2)) at an overpotential of 300 mV, surpassing most OER catalysts in alkaline solution. Density functional theory calculations disclose that the introduction of oxygen vacancies improve the intrinsic activity and electronic conductivity, while finite element method calculations demonstrate that the construction of catalytic interface and the creation of nanoscale transport channels facilitates mass transfer.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2666-3864		WOS:000805775600005

The corresponding adsorption energies for the different intermediate reactions up to strains dictated by the mechanical stability limits were previously obtained by means of density functional theory calculations. It was found that the elastic strains can be used to tune the catalytic activity of different metals by reducing the energy barrier of the rate limiting step and even to reach the cusp of the volcano plot. The largest changes in catalytic activity with strain for the HER were found in Pt, Au, and Ir while Co and Ni were very insensitive to this strategy. In the case of the ORR, the catalytic activity of Au could be enhanced by the application of tensile strains while that of Cu, Ni, Pt, Pd, Rh, Co, Ru, and Os was improved by the application of compressive strains. However, the catalytic activity of Ir was rather insensitive to mechanical deformations. Elastic strains were able to modify the rate limiting reaction in Au, Pt, Ag, and Os and it was possible to achieve the cusp of the volcano plot in these metals. Final, mechanical instabilities were attained at small strains in Zn and Cd, which did not lead to significant changes in the catalytic activity for the HER and the ORR. These results provide a framework to systematically investigate the application of elastic strains in the design of new catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000756203700001	35156676

The well-controlled solvent-free deposition of the carbonaceous material onto cordierite monolith substrates ensures experimental studies in the absence of diffusion limitations, temperature gradients, and hot zones. These critical aspects are supported also by theoretical considerations. Temperature-programmed oxidation and isothermal oxygen step-response experiments in a continuous gas-flow reactor using a homogeneous synthetic carbon-black material demonstrate excellent reproducibility, and the conversion profiles agree well with previously reported data. An independent set of global kinetic parameters was estimated for each 5% subconversion interval using linear regression such that the conversion dependence of each parameter could be analyzed separately and compared to previously published data. The results show that the evolution of reactive carbons cannot be described with a single global reaction order. This is supported by intermittent ex situ measurements of the specific surface area of the carbon-black material during the course of isothermal oxidation, which reveals a developing microporous structure at high conversions. Physically the changes in carbon reaction order are interpreted as changes in fraction of accessible reactive carbon atoms during progressing oxidation. Moreover, at high conversions, the carbon reaction order approaches 0.7 implying not only that the evolution of the concentration of reactive carbon atoms is proportional to the external surface area of shrinking spheres but also that these spheres have approximately the same size.									28	1	0	0	2	0	28			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000293758700047

Cross-linked nanosheets of organic-inorganic nanohybrids (BSeF/Ni(OH)(2)) were fabricated by one-step reductive electrosynthesis and subsequently applied for electrocatalytic water electrolysis. The organic-inorganic nanohybrids consist of benzo [2,1,3] selenadiazole-5-carbonyl phenylalanine (BSeF) cross-linked with nickel ions (Ni-BSeF) and nickel hydroxides (Ni(OH)(2)), which provide abundant active sites and feasible charge transfer at the electrocatalytic interface. The resulting electrodeposited nanohybrid BSeF/Ni(OH)(2) exhibits bifunctional electrocatalytic performance with 240 and 401 mV of overpotential at +100 and -100 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. The BSeF/Ni(OH)(2) offers a longer electrocatalytic activity of 20 h for OER and HER at applied high current densities of +400 and -200 mA cm(-2). Coupled with the high OER and HER activity, the two-electrode-based system of BSeF/Ni(OH)(2) shows a low cell potential of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The electrocatalytic performance of Ni-BSeF and Ni(OH)(2)-based organic-inorganic nanohybrids provides an efficient way to develop a nanohybrid-based catalytic system for energy conversion.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000538336400012	32396344

CSNs feature abundant active sites and large surface areas. In addition, their size, shape, and morphology can be tailored to be uniform and controlled. The catalytic activity and performance of CSNs can be significantly improved by heteroatom doping to CSNs, which makes them even more advantageous for ECS applications. In addition to various noble metals, transition metals have been used in the cores and shells of nanostructures featuring heteroatoms. Such materials are inexpensive and exhibit excellent catalytic activity and stability. Likewise, heteroatom-doped nanomaterial and core-shell nanostructure (HCSN) based electrocatalysts serve as bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as well as the ORR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These bifunctional electrodes are highly suitable for fuel cell and battery applications. In this review article, we exclusively focus on the important role of HCSNs in various types of fuel cells and batteries. In particular, we discuss the important roles and applications of HCSNs in proton exchange membranes (PEMs), anion exchange membranes (AEMs), direct methanol, microbial, and other types of fuel cells as well as metal ion batteries such as lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K)-ion batteries. The applications of HCSNs in Li-sulfur (S) batteries and metal-air batteries, such as Li, zinc (Zn), and Na-air batteries, have also been addressed. Finally, we have discussed the technical advancements related to the applications of HCSNs in fuel cells and batteries along with their disadvantages, scope, and future prospects. This review will benefit researchers working in the ECS field as well as those investigating various other applications, such as drug delivery, sensors, and adsorption.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2633-5409		WOS:000823961000001

In this work, we report hydrous cobalt-iridium oxide two-dimensional (2D) nanoframes exhibit higher oxygen evolution activity and similar stability compared with commercial IrO2; however, the bimetallic Co-Ir catalyst undergoes a significantly different degradation process compared with the monometallic IrO2 catalyst. The bimetallic Co-Ir 2D nanoframes consist of interconnected Co-Ir alloy domains within an unsupported, carbon-free, porous nanostructure that allows three-dimensional molecular access to the catalytically active surface sites. After electrochemical conditioning within the OER potential range, the predominately bimetallic alloy surface transforms to an oxide/hydroxide surface. Oxygen evolution activities determined using a rotating disk electrode configuration show that the hydrous Co-Ir oxide nanoframes provide 17 times higher OER mass activity and 18 times higher specific activity compared to commercial IrO2. The higher OER activities of the hydrous Co-Ir nanoframes are attributed to the presence of highly active surface iridium hydroxide groups. The accelerated durability testing of IrO2 resulted in lowering of the specific activity and partial dissolution of Ir. In contrast, the durability testing of hydrous Co-Ir oxide nanoframes resulted in the combination of a higher Ir dissolution rate, an increase in the relative contribution of surface iridium hydroxide groups and an increase in specific activity. The understanding of the differences in degradation processes between bimetallic and monometallic catalysts furthers our ability to design high activity and stability acidic OER electrocatalysts.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			2516-0230			WOS:000637218000016	36133093

A photothermal oxidation reaction is responsible for fullerene cage opening, and oxygen is also bounded to the final products of the coalescence process; Under inert atmosphere C-60 clusters retain their structure even under very high laser fluence. The structure of the new carbon phase has been characterized by Raman scattering and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. A disordered amorphous carbon phase is observed.

Activation of the electrode by absorption of hydrogen takes place after prolonged cathodic polarization in the potential range of HER. Prior to activation, the open-circuit potential is about -0.4 V vs Hg/HgO, OH-, at which the alloy electrode tends to undergo corrosion with oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) as the conjugate reaction, The corrosion-current density measured from Tafel polarization of ORR is found to be independent of KOH concentration and has an average value of about 30 mu A cm(-2). Subsequent to activation, the open circuit potential of the electrode is shifted to about -0.93 V vs Hg/HgO, OH-, which is equal to the reversible potential of HER. The exchange current density values measured from Tafel polarization of HER are marginally higher in relation to the values obtained before the electrode is activated. Alternating-current impedance spectra in the Nyquist form contain two overlapped semicircles. The high-frequency semicircle is attributed to the electrode geometry, while the low-frequency semicircle is due to the charge-transfer reaction and double-layer capacitance. The impedance data are analyzed by a non-linear least square curve fitting technique and impedance parameters are evaluated.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0250-4707	0973-7669		WOS:000089794700008

The kinetic parameters of oxygen evolution, corrosion potential and corrosion current of the composite inert anodes were obtained in a synthetic zinc electrowinning electrolyte of 50 g/L Zn2+ and 150 g/L H2SO4 at 35 degrees C, by measuring the anodic polarization curves, Tafel polarization curves and cyclic voltammetry curves. The results show that Pb-0.3wt%Ag/Pb-WC composite inert anodes obtained under forward pulse average current density of 3 A/dm(2) and WC concentration of 30 g/L in an original acid plating bath, possess higher electrocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution, lower overpotential of oxygen evolution, better reversibility of electrode reaction and corrosion resistance in [ZnSO4 + H2SO4] solution. The overpotential of oxygen evolution of the composite inert anode is 0.926 V under 500 A/m(2) in [ZnSO4 + H2SO4] solution, and 245 mV lower than that of Pb-1%Ag alloy; the corrosion current of the composite inert anode is 0.95x10(-4) A which is distinctly lower than that of Pb-1%Ag alloy, showing the excellent corrosion resistance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1000-2413	1993-0437		WOS:000385034600016

The control of morphology and microstructure on micrometer and nanometer scales has been widely applied as one of the most promising approaches for upgrading the catalytic abilities of electrocatalysts. Herein, novel CoMnFe layered triple hydroxide (LTH) arrays with a unique nanosheet-nanowire structure grown directly on 3D Ni foam (NF) have been first synthesized by controlling the incorporation of Fe. According to the morphology evolution with the key factors of hydrothermal treatment time and Fe addition, a possible formation mechanism of the nanosheet-nanowire microstructure has been proposed. Remarkably, this nanosheet-nanowire nanostructure of Co4Mn1Fe3 LTH/NF can effectively lead to an intricate transportation network, uniform active site distribution at the nanoscale, electronic conductivity increase and open-channels for fast gas release, and thus significantly enhances the electrocatalytic activity of the material in the alkaline medium. The Co4Mn1Fe3 LTH/NF can reach a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at an ultralow overpotential of 226 mV with a small Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1) and exhibit strong durability for at least 100 h. Such superior OER activity is comparable to that of reported state-of-the-art OER catalysts. This work may greatly advance the research towards designing efficient electrocatalysts for the OER.									50	4	0	0	1	0	50			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000471010900019

In addition to the fast evolution of the emerging C-C bond, very early in the reaction, a long range, weak interaction between a lone pair in the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group and an empty p orbital in the phosphorous atom, resulting from the polarization of the P=C bond in the ylide (n(O) -> pi(P=C)*) clamps the P=C and C=O bonds to the positions required for the subsequent formation of oxaphosphetanes, thus explaining the formation of cyclic intermediates rather than betaines. Each step of the Wittig reaction is a highly asynchronous process.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			0022-3263	1520-6904		WOS:000497259900027	31625741

Particular attention was focused on the evolution of pi MOs along the reaction coordinate. The importance of HOMO-HOMO interaction between the lone pair electrons of the bromine molecule and pi MOs of thieno[3,2-b]benzofuran has been emphasized.									15	0	0	0	3	0	15			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000330145200013	23905753

Herein, we introduce asymmetrical gradient effect into NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) at nano scale via a simple nanoarray construction strategy on Ni foam substrate. The electron energy loss spectroscopy, extended X-Ray absorption fine structure and other characterizations together revealed the concentration and valence states gradients in NiFe-LDH nanoarrays. Subsequently, the gradient effect leads to distinctly optimized binding strength of active sites to oxygen evolution intermediates, better electron transfers and boosted oxygen evolution performances, which are absent in non-gradient NiFe-LDH catalysts. Such long-range gradient effects in nanoarray materials provide new opportunities to understand their boosted catalytic performances and to rationally design better catalytic materials.									39	2	0	0	3	0	39			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000467774100073

To address such issues, for the first time, a novel nonprecious hybrid electrocatalyst-a self-assembled CoFe nanoparticle-embedded porous carbon nanowires (CoFe@CNWs)-is designed and synthesized via a facile hydrothermal reaction and subsequent annealing process. This hybrid electrocatalyst demonstrates an outstanding performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a very small Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1) and an ultralow onset overpotential of 170 mV; particularly, when the hybrid is used for overall water splitting, the cell voltage is as low as 1.69 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The excellent electrocatalytic performance of CoFe@CNWs is attributed to its unique porous nanoarchitecture, constructed by ultrasmall conductive CoFe nanoparticles homogenously embedded in highly conductive CNWs, which would not only guarantee abundant catalytic sites and structural stability but also facilitate electron transportation, resulting in a significant improvement in the electrocatalytic performance. This work provides a strategy to rationally design and synthesize a nanostructured transition metal-based hybrid to be used as a highly effective and stable nonprecious electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000474269800025

This reaction not only has an important influence on modern environments but has also played an important role in the evolution of the early Earth. Under anoxic conditions, the ROS produced at pyrite-water interface is a type of strong oxidants and theoretically has the ability to oxidize pyrite. However, the fact that the ROS produced at the pyrite-water interface can oxidize pyrite itself(i.e., self-oxidation of pyrite)has been overlooked. To reveal this reaction process, we used in-situ diffuse infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy(DRIFTS), quasi in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS), and density functional theory(DFT)calculations to study the initial reaction processes of the self-oxidation of pyrite under anaerobic conditions. The results indicated that:(1)self-oxidation of pyrite occurs at pyrite-water interface under anaerobic conditions, resulting in the formation of high-valent sulfur species and iron oxides;(2)the self-oxidation reaction at pyrite-water interface is accompanied by the formation and consumption of interfacial hydroxyl groups;and(3)the hydroxyl groups at the pyrite-water interface are derived from the dissociation of water molecules at the defective sites on pyrite and could be a source for ROS. These findings revealed the hydroxylation and self-oxidation processes of pyrite surfaces, providing a fundamental understanding of the importance of the reactions at the pyrite-water interface in the evolution of early Earth.			过去20年里,无氧条件下黄铁矿-水界面产生活性氧是黄铁矿表面反应性的重要发现之一。这一反应不仅对现代环境有重要影响,而且在早期地球环境演化中也扮演着重要角色。无氧条件下黄铁矿-水界面产生的活性氧具有极强的氧化性,理论上有氧化黄铁矿自身的能力。然而,无氧条件下黄铁矿-水界面产生的活性氧对其自身是否有氧化作用(即黄铁矿自氧化)及其反应机制还不得而知。本研究采用原位漫反射红外傅里叶变换光谱(in-situ DRIFTS)和准原位X射线光电子能谱(quasi-in-situ XPS)结合密度泛函理论(DFT)计算,探究了无氧条件下黄铁矿-水界面的自氧化初始反应过程。结果表明:(1)无氧条件下黄铁矿-水界面会发生自氧化反应,生成高价态的硫物种和铁氧化物;(2)黄铁矿-水界面的自氧化反应伴随着羟基的生成和消耗;(3)黄铁矿-水界面的羟基源于水分子在黄铁矿表面缺陷位点的解离作用,可为活性氧的产生提供物源。这些发现不仅揭示了黄铁矿-水界面的羟基化和自氧化过程,还为深入理解黄铁矿-水界面反应在早期地球环境演化中的重要作用提供了认知基础。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0379-1726			CSCD:7250685

The cobalt-based mixed-valence oxides have attracted great attention due to their facile synthesis, low cost, and excellent electrochemical performance. However, less attention is paid to investigating the effect of different substitutions on the physico-chemical properties of TTMO. In this study, nanoparticles (NPs) decorated ultrathin Ni1-xMnxCo2O4 nanoflakes (NPs@NFs) are synthesized by tuning the molar ratio between Mn and Ni via facile deep eutectic solvents (DESs) method. Unique and highly porous NPs@NFs nanostructures aid to increase the overall surface area of the materials, whereas Mn, Ni, and Co ions participate in their redox-active capacity, improving the electrochemical activity of the material. This Ni0.8Mn0.2Co2O4 hybrid nanostructure exhibited excellent supercapacitive performance with a high specific capacity (Cs) of 761 mAh g(-1) at a higher current density of 30 mA cm(-2) and superior cycling retention of 92.86% after 10 000 cycles. Further, a hybrid asymmetric supercapacitor (Ni0.8Mn0.2Co2O4//AC) device exhibited an extended potential window of 1.5 V, which results in an ultrahigh energy density of 66.2 W kg(-1) by sustaining a power density of 1519 Wh kg(-1). The electrocatalytic activity of the optimized Ni0.8Mn0.2Co2O4 shows the outstanding performance toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (150 mV/ 161 mV dec(-1)) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (123 mV/47 mV dec(-1)) with a lower voltage of 1.51 V (@10 mA cm(-2)) for overall water splitting, with outstanding stability up to 25 hours. These results indicate that chemically synthesized ultrathin NPs@NFs-like nanostructure is a capable electrode for multiple applications, such as supercapacitors, and overall water splitting.

Herein, a simple three-step strategy is reported to construct cobalt-iron nitride/alloy nanosheets on nickel foam (CoFe-NA/NF) as a bifunctional catalyst for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrocatalyst with optimized composition (CoFe-NA2/NF) can achieve ultralow overpotentials of 73 mV and 250 mV for HER and OER, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH. Notably, the electrolyzer based on this electrocatalyst is able to boost the overall water splitting with a cell voltage of 1.564 V to deliver 10 mA cm-2 for at least 50 h without obvious performance decay. Furthermore, our experiment and theoretical calculation demonstrate that the combination of cobalt-iron nitride and alloy can have low hydrogen adsorption energy and facilitate water dissociation during HER. In addition, the surface reconstruction introduces metal oxyhydroxides to optimize the OER process. Our work may pave a new pathway to design bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting.

This constrained-orbital DFT (CO-DFT) approach can be used to tackle two prevalent shortcomings of DFT: the lack of transparency with regard to the governing electronic structure in large (planewave based) DFT calculations and the limitations of semilocal DFT in describing systems with localized electrons or.a large degree of static correlation. CO-DFT helps to address the first of these issues by decomposing complex orbital transformations occurring during elementary chemical processes into simpler and more intuitive transformations. The second issue is addressed by using the CO-DFT method to generate configtiration states for multiconfiguration Kohn Sham calculations. We demonstrate-both: of these applications for elementary reaction steps involved in the oxygen evolution reaction.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1549-9618	1549-9626		WOS:000407522100011	28657733

Due to the synergistic effect of the ultra-small size of Ru nanoclusters and defective CNTs with oxygen-containing groups, the Ru nanoclusters directly grown on defective carbon (O-Ru NCs/CNTs) catalysts exhibited superior hydrogen evolution activity in the whole pH window. An overpotential of only 37, 13, and 50 mV was needed to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1.0 M KOH and 1.0 M PBS, respectively. Moreover, this catalyst has shown higher stability.

Here, PEC efficiency of BiVO4 electrode is enhanced by constructing a NiCo-LDH/BiVO4 heterojunction. Under the synergistic effect of NiCo-LDH and BiVO4, the photocurrent, incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency and hydrogen production of NiCo-LDH/BiVO4 electrode have been significantly improved, which are mainly attributed to the enhancement of internal light absorption, photogenerated carriers transfer and separation.									88	9	0	0	6	0	88			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000510526000002

Titania hollow sphere particles were synthesized using poly(styrene-methacrylic acid) latex as template material, and various amount of nickel were doped over the sphere using nickel (II) sulfate as the precursor of nickel. The presence of rutile TiO2 and NiO phases were revealed during XRD analysis, indicating the critical growth of nickel on the surface of the hollow sphere catalysts. BET surface area results also shown the 166.76 m(2) g(-1) value for 30 wt% Ni/TiO2 hollow sphere sample. The SEM and TEM images were confirmed the hollow sphere structure of the catalysts with diameter of 0.8-0.9 mu m. The cyclic voltammetric studies proved the presence of both hydrogen and oxygen evolution peaks for all the hollow sphere samples. The anodic peak current density value, which usually represents the oxygen evolution phenomenon, was revealed as 13 mA cm(-2) for 25 wt% Ni-loaded sample; whereas, the hydrogen evolution peak was most intense for 30 wt% Ni/TiO2 material with cathodic peak current density of 32 mA cm(-2). The average value of -1.42 were determined as the reaction order of the system irrespective of the nickel loading and heating duration in the synthesis of hollow sphere materials. During photocatalytic water splitting, 30 wt% Ni/TiO2 hollow sphere sample yielded the highest amount of hydrogen in all irradiation time span.									22	1	0	0	0	0	23			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000314683800005

The initial reaction forms a peroxide, Delta H = -135 kJ mol(-1). If the graphene edge is pre-oxidised, the dangling peroxy atom can (E-a = 91 kJ mol(-1)) migrate across contiguous ketone groups until finding another vacant site and stabilizing as a ketone. However, if no further vacant sites are available, the peroxy oxygen has a number of other possibilities open to it, including desorption of an oxygen atom (E-a = 140 kJ mol(-1)), migration via the basal plane to form a lactone (E-a = 147 kJ mol(-1)), and direct interaction with an adjacent oxide to form the lactone or a carbonate (E-a = 146 kJ mol(-1)). The combination of thermal energy and the heat released in the initial formation of the peroxy adduct is likely to be sufficient to overcome these secondary barriers at modest temperatures.Transfer of the dangling peroxy O to the basal plane produces an epoxide that is mobile on the basal surface (E-a = 40-80 kJ mol(-1)) but that is transferred back to the edge upon coming into proximity of either a vacant edge site or ketone. The instability of the edge epoxide structure implies that it cannot play a significant role in carbon gasification through promoting the reactivity of ketones, contrary to earlier suggestions.The desorption of an oxygen atom creates a very active species capable of reacting with basal or edge sites as well as with oxygen complexes. The reaction of ketone + O has been reported to yield a five-membered ring + CO2, leading to an overall stoichiometry which is consistent with the observed oxyreactivity of carbon surface oxides identified in isotopic labelling studies in which one O atom is gasified and the other forms a new surface oxide.

The reoxidation of highly dispersed VOx species with gas phase oxygen is investigated in detail and is described by an empirical kinetic model. It is observed that the reoxidation of reduced VOx/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst is strongly affected by the presence of water. The proposed kinetic model includes a distinct coverage of VOx species with water or hydroxyl groups in the investigated temperature range of 479-712 K. Hydrated surface species are oxidized under release of water. Best fits of the experimental data can be achieved with first order rate laws with respect to oxygen concentration. Experiments are performed in an ideally mixed Berty-type reactor using oxygen step-marking over the reduced catalyst. The evolution of oxygen concentration using the kinetic model is in agreement with the experimentally observed behaviour. The signal of water released during the reaction can be modeled only qualitatively, which (presumably) stems from its sorption behaviour on the acidic alumina support. The oxidation of VOx species furthermore depends on the reaction temperature. The oxidation of V+III to V+V cannot be completely achieved at temperatures below 673 K. However, the activation energy of this reaction is low, as suggested by the absence of strong variations of the response shapes with respect to temperature. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the carbonate formation is observed at an unexpected early working state through in-situ Raman measurements. The origin of carbonate formation from carbon corrosion in the alkaline electrolyte is revealed by its distribution near the potassium hydroxide solution via our self-developed multi-point Raman mapping apparatus. More importantly, it is found that during charging, the carbonate formation affects the formation of the zinc oxide byproduct and impedes the oxygen evolution reaction due to its consumption of hydroxyl ions. In comparison, insoluble carbonate precipitation is generated within the porous carbon electrode during discharging, which could block the oxygen throughput and consequently deteriorate the air electrode performance. This in-situ study clarifies the initial state of carbon electrode corrosion in the alkaline electrolyte, providing an insight into the future optimizations towards the air electrode design.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000793797900002

Herein, a three-dimensional hierarchical Co3O4/CuO composite nanowire array was prepared by one-step hydrothermal treatment and annealing treatment on the surface of nickel foam. As a bifunctional electrocatalyst, the efficiency of both two parts of water splitting reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be effectively improved. The special structure of Co3O4/CuO composite nanowire array provides a great many effective reactive sites on the surface of electrode for water splitting and the existence of Co3O4 improves the overall conductivity of electrode, accelerates the charge transfer process. Specifically, the nickel foam electrode modified by Co3O4/CuO composite nanowire array only need the overpotentials of 61.4 and 150 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for the HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively, and the Tafel slope of 66 and 160 mV/dec. The self-assembled two-electrode electrolyzer, with the electrode as the anode and cathode, was used for the full water splitting experiment, and it was found that the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) is driven by only 1.53 V voltage and exhibit long-term stability. Here, a simple method is provided to obtain an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst of water splitting, which has a practical reference for realizing clean energy conversion.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000639814500001

It was found that the catalytic activity is independent of the chalcogenide but strongly dependent on the metal species. The single most active metal center, either the molybdenum in the Mo6 clusters or the intercalated metal, determines the catalytic activity. The trends for the catalytic activity are approximately the same for the two supporting media, carbon paste and Nafion polymer. No significant cooperative phenomena involving two or more atoms could be detected for hydrogen evolution in contrast to the oxygen reduction reaction.

The electrochemical properties of the TNT electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, steady-state polarization and photocurrent response measurements. The results showed that Tin+ (n =0-3) cations and oxygen vacancies existed in the TNT electrode after annealing in CO, leading to a very efficient electron transfer rate of 1.34 x 10(-3) cm/s Steady-state polarization measurement and photocurrent response demonstrated that the electrode potential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reduced by 20% and the photocurrent response increased by 50% for CO-annealed TNT electrode compared with O-2-annealed TNT electrode.

Activation of dark adapted samples by a train of saturating flashes produces oxygen with a yield per flash which oscillates with a periodicity of four. Damping of the oxygen oscillations is accounted for by misses and double hits. The mechanisms hidden behind these parameters are not yet fully understood. The components which participate in charge transfer and storage in PS II are believed to be anchored to the heterodimer formed by the D1 and D2 proteins. The secondary plastoquinone acceptor Q, binds on D1 in a loop connecting the fourth and fifth helices (the Q, pocket). Several D1 mutants, mutated in the Q,binding region, have been studied over the past ten years.In the present report, our results on nine D1 mutants of Synechocystis PCC 6714 and 6803 are analyzed. When oxygen evolution is modified, it can be due to a change in the electron transfer kinetics at the level of the acceptor side of PS II and also in some specific mutants to a long ranging effect on the donor side of PS II. The different properties of the mutants enable us to propose a classification in three categories. Our results can fit in a model in which misses are substantially determined by the fraction of centers which have Q, before each flash due to the reversibility of the electron transfer reactions. This idea is not new but was more thoroughly studied in a recent paper by Shinkarev and Wraight (1993). However, we will show in the discussion that some doubts remain as to the true origin of misses and double hits.									14	0	0	0	13	0	14			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1993MX41700020	24317994

The model consists of a component describing the co-evolution of COD and BOD as a function of ozone dosage and a mass transfer based component describing ozone dosage as a function of time. A multiple zero order reaction concept is used to describe the multicomponent kinetic behaviour. The model has been verified experimentally by comparing stoichiometric ratio and ozone reaction rate of conventional partial zonation processes and partial ozonation processes with intermittent biodegradation. The model is found to effectively describe the change in stoichiometry and reaction rate that typically occurs during ozonation processes. Intermittent biodegradation is found to have no effect on the instantaneous stoichiometric ratio or the instantaneous ozone reaction rate. This implicates that intermittent BOD removal results in an additional decrease in required ozonation time and ozone demand compared to the conventional partial zonation process and in addition to the expected decrease resulting from BOD removal.

The developed electrodes were characterized morphologically by confocal laser scanning microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The activity of the developed electrodes towards the hydrogen evolution reaction was assessed by pseudo-steady-state polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in alkaline solutions at different temperatures. The incorporation of the silver nanoparticles on the surface of the electrode improved the catalytic activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction due to an improvement in the electrochemically active surface area rather than in the intrinsic catalytic activity.					2nd E3 Mediterranean Symposium - Electrochemistry for Environment and Energy2nd E3 Mediterranean Symposium - Electrochemistry for Environment and Energy	SEP 14-16, 2016SEP 14-16, 2016	Univ Studi Milano; Univ Milano Bicocca; Politecnico Milano; Royal Spanish Soc Chem, Grp Electrochemistry; Spanish Network Excellence Environm & Energy Applicat Electrochem Technol; Italian Chem Soc, Board Electrochemistry DivUniv Studi Milano; Univ Milano Bicocca; Politecnico Milano; Royal Spanish Soc Chem, Grp Electrochemistry; Spanish Network Excellence Environm & Energy Applicat Electrochem Technol; Italian Chem Soc, Board Electrochemistry Div	Gargnano, ITALYGargnano, ITALY	6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000423650000054

Herein, MoP-RuP2 encapsulated in N,P-codoped carbon (MoP-RuP2@NPC) with abundant interfaces were prepared via a facile avenue with the low-toxic melamine phosphate as the phosphorous resource. Moreover, the obtained electrocatalyst possessed a porous nanostructure, had abundant exposed active sites and improved the mass transport during the electrocatalytic process. Due to the above merits, the prepared MoP-RuP2@NPC delivered a greater electrocatalytic performance for HERs (50 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) relative to RuP2@NPC (120 mV) and MoP@NPC (195 mV) in 1 M KOH. Moreover, an ultralow potential of 1.6 V was required to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the two-electrode configuration for overall water splitting. For practical applications, intermittent solar energy, wind energy and thermal energy were utilized to drive the electrolyzer to generate hydrogen gas. This work provides a novel and facile strategy for designing highly efficient and stable nanomaterials toward hydrogen production.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2079-4991		WOS:000701513500001	34578662

Herein, we construct a hierarchal structure of NiFe LDH nanosheet-arrays-on-microplates (NiFe NSAs-MPs) to elevate the electrocatalytic activity of NiFe LDHs for the OER by exposing a high-activity plane, such as the (012) edge plane. It is surprising that the NiFe NSAs-MPs show activity of 100 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential (eta) of 250 mV, which is five times higher than that of (003) plane-dominated NiFe LDH microsheet arrays (NiFe MSAs) at the same eta, representing the excellent electrocatalytic activity for the OER in alkaline media. Besides, we analyzed the OER activities of the (003) basal plane and the (012) and (110) edge planes of NiFe LDHs by density functional theory with on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U), and the calculation results indicated that the (012) edge plane exhibits the best catalytic performance among the various crystal planes because of the oxygen coordination of the Fe site, which is responsible for the high catalytic activity of NiFe NSAs-MPs.									26	0	0	0	2	0	26			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000609233100017	34163796

In this study, composite Pdx/Co-nanofilms/C electrocatalysts of Pd nanoparticles implanted onto Co nanofilms were synthesized on an immiscible ionic liquid (IL)/water interface for ORR. The Pd nanoparticles implanted onto Co nanofilms show a marked distortion of crystal lattice and surface roughness. These Pdx/Co-nanofilms/C electrocatalysts exhibit enhanced activity for ORR compared with Pd/C and PdxCo/C catalysts in both acid and alkaline solutions, in which the Pd3/Co-nanofilms/C catalyst displays the highest ORR mass activity. The superior ORR mass activities of the fabricated Pdx/Co-nanofilms/C catalysts may be mainly attributed to their larger catalytic areas, which are conferred by the rough surface of Pd nanoparticles with a distorted crystal lattice, and the synergistic effect between the surface Pd atoms and the 2D Co nanofilm substrate. The relationship between ORR mass activity and Pd/Co atom ratio varies in different electrolytes. Furthermore, by using proper heat-treatment methods, the Pdx/Co-nanofilms/C catalysts exhibit improved cycling stability compared with pure Pd/C catalyst after extended potential cycling.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2296-2646			WOS:000451634800001	30555821

NaO2 as the main discharge product is unstable in the cell environment and chemically degrades, which triggers side products' formation and charging potential increment. In this study, RuO2 nanoparticles dispersed on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are used as the catalyst for Na-O-2 batteries to elucidate the effect of the catalyst on these complex electrochemical systems. The RuO2 CNT contributes to the formation of a poorly crystalline and coating-like NaO2 structure during oxygen reduction reaction, which is drastically different from the conventional micron-sized cubic NaO2 crystals deposited on the CNT. Our findings demonstrate a competition between NaO2 and side products' decompositions for RuO2/CNT during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We believe that this is due to the lower stability of a coating-like NaO2 because of its noncrystalline nature and high electrode/electrolyte contact area. Although RuO2/CNT catalyzes the decomposition of side products at a lower potential (3.66 V) compared to CNT (4.03 V), it cannot actively contribute to the main electrochemical reaction of the cell during OER (NaO2 -> Na+ + O-2 + e(-)) because of the fast chemical degradation of the film NaO2 to the side products. Therefore, tuning the morphology and crystallinity of NaO2 by a catalyst is detrimental for the Na-O-2 cell performance and it should be taken into account for the future applications.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000443923500040

Herein, we demonstrate a facile strategy to prepare CoP nanoparticles (NPs) loaded on N, P dual-doped carbon (NPC) electrocatalysts with high concentration N and P dopants through a pyrolysis-deposition-phosphidation process. The great bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for both HER (the overpotential of 98 mV and 86 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in both 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH electrolytes, respectively) and OER (the overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH electrolyte) were achieved. When CoP@NPC hybrid was used as two electrodes in the 1 M KOH electrolyte system for overall water splitting, the needed cell potential for achieving the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is 1.6 V, and it also showed superior stability for HER and OER after 10 h' test with almost negligible decay. Experimental results revealed that the P atoms in CoP were the active sites for HER and the CoP@NPC hybrid showed excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic properties due to the synergistic effects between the high catalytic activity of CoP NPs and NPC, in which the doping of N and P in carbon led to a stronger polarization between Co and P in CoP, promoting the charge transfer from Co to P in CoP, enhancing the catalytic activity of P sites and Co sites in CoP for HER and OER, respectively. Specifically, the improvements could result from the changed charge state, the increased active specific surface area, and the facilitated reaction kinetics by N, P co-doping and admixture. This work provides a high-efficient, low-cost and stable electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, and throws light on rational designing high performance electrocatalysts.

However, due to the slow kinetics and large thermodynamic potential requirements of anodic OER, water splitting process still needs high energy consumption. In this aspect, replacing the OER by urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with low thermodynamic potentials can endow opportunity for less energy consumption for hydrogen production. At the same time, the electrochemical UOR offers a good access to treat urea-rich waste water. As the anodic UOR involves a 6e(-) transfer process, it needs high-performance and low-cost electrocatalysts to boost the efficiency. Herein, through W doping, we fabricated a 3D NiS2/MoO2 hybrid heterostructure grown on conductive carbon cloth (W-NiS2/MoO2@CC). Due to the W-induced abundant active sites, the as-fabricated WNiS2/MoO2@CC demonstrates excellent bifunctional catalytic activities toward UOR and HER with very low potentials of 1.3 V and 52 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. More importantly, benefiting from the combined merits of the hybrid heterojunction of NiS2 and MoO2, W-doping and the 3D porous structure grown on conductive carbon cloth support, the catalyst exhibits highly efficient catalytic performance towards a urea electrolytic cell (HER||UOR). Substantially, reduced cell voltage of 1.372 V is required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is 230 mV lower than that of conventional water electrolysis. In the meantime, the catalyst shows excellent stability with ignorable degradation of current density for 24 h. This work provides an effective catalyst design strategy for energy-saving electrochemical H2 production.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000780379700004

Here it is shown, by combining surface science experiments and density functional theory, that the pristine surface of PtTe2 is chemically inert toward the most common ambient gases (oxygen and water) and even in air. It is demonstrated that the creation of Te vacancies leads to the appearance of tellurium-oxide phases upon exposing defected PtTe2 surfaces to oxygen or ambient atmosphere, which is detrimental for the ambient stability of uncapped PtTe2-based devices. On the contrary, in PtTe2 surfaces modified by the joint presence of Te vacancies and substitutional carbon atoms, the stable adsorption of hydroxyl groups is observed, an essential step for water splitting and the water-gas shift reaction. These results thus pave the way toward the exploitation of this class of Dirac materials in catalysis.									54	2	0	0	3	0	54			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000430101100020

Herein, a synergistic regulation strategy of surface/interface is developed to optimize the catalytic activity of nickel sulfide (Ni3S2). The construction of nickel phosphide with Ni3S2 heterostructure by using fluorine (F)anion modification is successfully developed on nickel foam (F-NiPx/Ni3S2-NF) via a simple fluorination and phosphating treatment. This new kind of electrocatalyst contains plenty of active sites and strong electronic interactions, presenting superior bifunctional activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The overpotentials only need 182 mV and 370 mV to reach the current density of 100 mA cm-2 for HER and OER, respectively. In addition, the F-NiPx/Ni3S2-NF-based electrolyzer delivers promising performance for overall water splitting. A low potential of 1.55 V and 1.7 V can be achieved at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 and 50 mA cm-2. This work provides a new surface/interface regulation strategy for high-efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The superior electrochemical performance of Co/N-carbon for HER could be attributed to such 2D setup that encompasses the low H atom binding energy of metallic cobalt, the high conductivity of carbon and the stability of carbon-encapsulated Co nanoparticles.									40	1	0	0	1	0	40			2168-0485			WOS:000405139100005

Transition-metal selenides have been proposed to be OER catalyst alternatives to noble metal based catalysts, but generally exhibit limited electrocatalytic activity. We here report hierarchical Fe-doped Ni3Se4 ((Ni,Fe)(3)Se-4) ultrathin nanosheets as an efficient electrocatalyst for OER in alkaline electrolytes. The preparation involves a solvothermal synthesis and a topotactic conversion process. The prepared hierarchical (Ni,Fe)(3)Se-4 ultrathin nanosheets show abundant and accessible catalytically active sites, facile charge transfer and a high specific surface area. Relative to the Ni3Se4 nanosheets, the as -prepared (Ni,Fe)(3)Se-4 ultrathin nanosheets show a higher current density and a lower Tafel slope towards the OER. Remarkably, hierarchical (Ni,Fe)(3)Se-4 ultrathin nanosheets supported on Ni foam exhibit an electrocatalytic OER with a current density of 10 mA cm at a low overpotential of 225 mV and a small Tafel slope of about 41 mV dec(-1). This study establishes (Ni,Fe)(3)Se-4 ultrathin nanosheets as an efficient electrocatalyst for the OER that can be used in the fields of metal-air batteries and water splitting for hydrogen production.									113	6	0	0	2	0	115			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000428787200018	29492488

Two T-DNA insertion mutant lines deficient in either the PsbO1 or the PsbO2 protein were retarded in growth in comparison with the wild type, while differing from each other phenotypically. Both PsbO proteins were able to support the oxygen evolution activity of PSII, although PsbO2 was less efficient than PsbO1 under photoinhibitory conditions. Prolonged high light stress led to reduced growth and fitness of the mutant lacking PsbO2 as compared with the wild type and the mutant lacking PsbO1. During a short period of treatment of detached leaves or isolated thylakoids at high light levels, inactivation of PSII electron transport in the PsbO2-deficient mutant was slowed down, and the subsequent degradation of the D1 protein was totally inhibited. The steady-state levels of in vivo phosphorylation of the PSII reaction centre proteins D1 and D2 were specifically reduced in the mutant containing only PsbO2, in comparison with the mutant containing only PsbO1 or with wild-type plants. Phosphorylation of PSII proteins in vitro proceeded similarly in thylakoid membranes from both mutants and wild-type plants. However, dephosphorylation of the D1 protein occurred much faster in the thylakoids containing only PsbO2. We conclude that the function of PsbO1 in Arabidopsis is mostly in support of PSII activity, whereas the interaction of PsbO2 with PSII regulates the turnover of the D1 protein, increasing its accessibility to the phosphatases and proteases involved in its degradation.									82	7	1	0	78	0	88			0960-7412	1365-313X		WOS:000243637900012	17217465

The work has been conducted in order to investigate the differential nanoparticle corrosion behaviour and associated mechanisms of U removal behaviour in conditions representative of near-surface and deep groundwater systems. Batch systems were analysed over a 28-day reaction period during which the liquid and nanoparticulate solids were periodically analysed to determine chemical evolution of the solutions and particulates. Analysis of aqueous samples using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry recorded near-total U removal after 1 hour of reaction in all systems studied. However, in the latter stages of the reaction (after 48 hours), significant rerelease of uranium was recorded for the mine water batch system with dissolved O-2 present. In contrast, less than 2% uranium rerelease was recorded for the anoxic batch system. Concurrent analysis of extracted nanoparticle solids using X-ray diffraction recorded significantly slower corrosion of the nanoparticles in the anoxic batch system, with residual metallic iron maintained until after 28 days of reaction compared to only 7 days of reaction in systems with dissolved O-2 present. Results provide clear evidence that the corrosion lifespan and associated U6+ removal efficacy of nanoscale zero-valent iron replace enhanced in the absence of dissolved oxygen.									28	1	0	0	11	0	28			1687-4110	1687-4129		WOS:000337451600001

However, for laminates of NiFe LDHs, the edge sites are active, but the basal plane is inert, leading to underutilization as catalysts for the OER. Herein, for the first time, light and electron-deficient Li ions are intercalated into the basal plane of NiFe LDHs. The results of theoretical calculations and experiments both showed that electrons would be transferred from near Ni2+ to the surroundings of Li+, resulting in electron-deficient properties of the Ni sites, which would function as "electron-hungry" sites, to enhance surface adsorption of electron-rich oxygen-containing groups, which would enhance the effective activity for the OER. As demonstrated by the catalytic performance, the Li-NiFe LDH electrodes showed an ultralow overpotential of only 298 mV at 50 mA cm(-2), which was lower than that of 347 mV for initial NiFe LDHs and lower than that of 373 mV for RuO2. Reasonable intercalation adjustment effectively activates laminated Ni2+ sites and constructs the electron-deficient structure to enhance its electrocatalytic activity, which sheds light on the functional treatment of catalytic materials.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000531333800001	32153069

The results show that Mo and W atoms anchored on the large holes of pc-C3N2 exhibit excellent performance in the NRR with low limiting potentials of -0.24 V and -0.23 V, respectively. Moreover, W@pc-C3N2 can effectively suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction.

XRD analysis showed that the LCFCr powder is a pure crystalline phase with an orthorhombic perovskite structure and that its thermal expansion coefficient matches closely with several commonly used solid electrolytes, while TEM analysis confirmed the high purity of the LCFCr powders. The electrochemical activity of LCFCr, screen-printed on a gadolinium doped ceria electrolyte, towards both the oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions, was examined at 600-800 degrees C in stagnant air using a symmetrical RSOFC configuration. Under open circuit conditions, LCFCr showed a very low polarization resistance (R-p) of only 0.07 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C, comparable to some of the best-performing oxide materials reported by others. The LCFCr air electrode was also found to be very stable, with very little loss in performance and no interfacial damage observed, even after 100 h at a 0.4 V (OER) and -0.4 V (ORR) overpotentials.

However, the oxygen redox reaction often leads to structure transition and oxygen release from the material surface. Herein, the surface doping of B is conducted via a molten salt method, which creates a thin reinforcement layer containing stable B-O bonds. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the doping of B only acts on the material surface and cannot inhibit oxygen redox in the bulk. Differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy measurement demonstrates that the surface protective layer effectively reduces the oxygen release of LLOs. A combination of X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscope analyses confirm the enhanced structural stability. As a consequence, the target material displays a high reversible capacity of 275 mAh g-1 at 0.1C and a suppressed voltage decay rate of 2.5 mV per cycle during the first 80 cycles (at 0.2C, 2.0-4.8V). The findings highlight the essential role of stable surface oxygen framework in cycling stability, and demonstrate the effectiveness of surface reinforcement doping in reducing oxygen release.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000660438800001

Performing ab initio DFT+U molecular dynamics calculations of cluster models in explicit water solution, we provide insight into the pathways for oxygen evolution of a cobalt-based catalyst (CoCat). The fast motion of protons at the CoCat/water interface and the the occurrence of cubane-like Co-oxo units at e catalyst boundaries are the keys to unlock the fast formation of O-O bonds. Along the resulting pathways, we identified the formation of Co(IV)-oxyl species as the driving ingredient for the activation of the catalytic mechanism, followed by their geminal coupling with O atoms coordinated by the same Co. Concurrent nucleophilic attack of water molecules coming directly from the water solution is discouraged by high activation barriers. The achieved results suggest also interesting similarities between the CoCat and the Mn4Ca-oxo oxygen evolving complex of photosystem II.									198	1	0	0	23	0	198			0002-7863			WOS:000326125200022	24044778

The metal ions were found to accelerate the gelation of the polyisocyanurate networks. The nickel-cobalt-polyisocyanurate (Ni-Co-PIR-RT) hybrid monoliths were pyrolyzed under inert atmosphere at varying temperatures (from 600 to 1000 degrees C) to yield oxide and metallic forms of Ni and Co with significant carbon content. Pyrolysis of Ni-Co-PIR-RT at 600 degrees C (Ni-Co-PIR-600) resulted in the complete reduction of Ni and Co ions to metallic Ni and Co, whereas samples pyrolyzed at 800 degrees C (Ni-Co-PIR-800) resulted in the partial transformation of the metallic Ni and Co to its respective oxides. The complete transformation of metallic Co to CoO was obtained at 1000 degrees C (Ni-Co-PIR-1000) with a significant amount of metallic Ni and NiO. The Ni-PIR-1000 sample displayed minimal activity toward methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) with an onset potential and maximum current density of 1.44 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) and 0.6 mA/cm(2) respectively, whereas the Co-PIR-1000 sample displayed oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at an onset potential of 1.33 V with no evident activity toward MOR in 0.1 M KOH with 0.2 M CH3OH. On the other hand, under the same conditions Ni-Co-PIR-1000 displayed 5 manifold increase in current density and reduction in onset potential by 100 mV toward MOR (with an onset potential of 1.34 V and current density 4 mA/cm(2)) relative to Ni-PIR-1000. The synergistic and superior activity of Ni-Co-PIR-1000 can be attributed to the combined presence of Ni, NiO, and CoO. Here, (1) Ni and NiO act as the catalysts for methanol oxidation by electrochemically transforming to NiOOH (active centers for methanol oxidation) via Ni(OH)(2), (2) the presence of CoO facilitates the electrochemical generation of atomic oxygen ([O]) (an intermediate in oxygen evolution reaction and a well-known oxidizing agent) by transforming to CoOOH, the [O] formed here may be responsible for the formation of NiOOH by chemically reacting with Ni(OH)(2) resulting in increased activity toward MOR.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2168-0485			WOS:000486565900007

Results and problems in cell differentiation				45				1	31		10.1007/400_2007_046				2008	2008	Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have provided unprecedented access into the diversity of the microbial world. Herein we use the comparative genomic analysis of microbial genomes and environmental metagenomes coupled with structural modelling to explore the diversity of aerobic respiration in Archaea. We focus on the heme-copper oxidoreductase superfamily which is responsible for catalyzing the terminal reaction in aerobic respiration-the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. Sequence analyses demonstrate that there are at least eight heme-copper oxygen reductase families: A-, B-, C-, D-, E-, F-, G-, and H-families. Interestingly, five of these oxygen reductase families (D-, E-, F-, G-, and H-families) are currently found exclusively in Archaea. We review the structural properties of all eight families focusing on the members found within Archaea. Structural modelling coupled with sequence analysis suggests that many of the oxygen reductases identified from thermophilic Archaea have modified proton channel properties compared to the currently studied mesophilic bacterial oxygen reductases. These structural differences may be due to adaptation to the specific environments in which these enzymes function. We conclude with a brief analysis of the phylogenetic distribution and evolution of Archaeal heme-copper oxygen reductases.									119	0	1	0	105	0	120			0080-1844			MEDLINE:18183358	18183358

Electrode activation is synchronized with a photosensitive p-region (WSe2) that forward biases itself with respect to the electrolyte reduction potential. Following activation, electron injection by NiFe(2)O(4)nanodots forms the basis of excellent OER and HER at the catalyst-electrolyte interface. The electron injection potential of NiFe(2)O(4)was confirmed from its ability to function like an organic sensitizer in a solar cell. The photoresponse time and photosensitivity characteristics showed that the catalyst has an n-p-n structure similar to that of a virtual phototransistor. The synergy between electron injection and two-way electron transfer yielded overpotentials of 43 and 92 mV for the HER and OER in alkaline medium, respectively. First principle calculations supported this excellent performance by correlating it to adsorption/desorption binding energy. The results from this research offer a new strategy to design noble metal-free catalyst systems for large-scale solar to fuel generation applications.									8	1	0	0	1	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000546391600029

The nature of shell oxygen burning in a massive star, prior to core collapse, is used as a first example; it is of particular interest because it is (1) the region in which Ni-56 will be produced by the supernova shock, (2) the region of the ''mass cut,'' which will separate the collapsed core from the ejected mantle, (3) the site of much of the explosive nucleosynthesis, and (4) a suggested source of symmetry breaking to drive mixing instabilities which were observed in SN 1987A. The nature of the shell burning affects the size of the core which will collapse. The method is illustrated on this test case, and the character of the convection is examined.									39	0	1	0	0	0	40			0004-637X			WOS:A1994NN73900037

Periodic models of close-packed (111) surfaces were constructed, their geometry was optimized and the most stable geometric surface configuration was identified. The correlation between the intermediate species binding energy and the favored reaction pathway from amongst 1e(-), 2e(-), and 4e(-) mechanisms were studied by calculating the binding energies of a 1/4 monolayer of O, O-2, LiO, LiO2, Li2O2, and Li2O on various sites and orientations. The reaction free energies (Delta G(rxn)) were calculated and used to compute the catalytic activity of the surfaces using molecular kinetics theory. Plots of the catalytic activity vs. Oxygen binding energy (E-Binding (o)) showed a typical "volcano" profile.

Similarly, iridium oxide is the usual anode material in polymeric exchange membrane electrolyzers. The performance and, in particular, the stability of these catalysts strongly depends on the characteristics of the support. This study presents the results of the physicochemical and electrochemical characterization of the powers of antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO) synthesized by a chemical coprecipitation method and a minimum calcination time. These supports were used as catalytic supports for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The ATO was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry and four probe resistivity techniques. The electrochemical properties were obtained by cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear voltammetry (LV) and rotating disk electrode (RDE). The material obtained showed nanometric sizes of 4-9 nm, and the electrochemical results indicate that the synthesized ATO nanoparticles can be used as a support for IrO2 and Pt in electrodes for PEM electrolyzers and fuel cells. Some mixtures of synthesized ATO and Vulcan carbon (VC) were assayed as mixed supports for ORR and OER and for acquiring a protective effect of ATO on the degradation of the carbon support.					14th International Congress of the Mexican-Hydrogen-Society - Hydrogen Technologies - Nanostructured Materials and Energy Systems for Sustainable Future14th International Congress of the Mexican-Hydrogen-Society - Hydrogen Technologies - Nanostructured Materials and Energy Systems for Sustainable Future	SEP 30-OCT 04, 2014SEP 30-OCT 04, 2014	Mexican Hydrogen SocMexican Hydrogen Soc	Cancun, MEXICOCancun, MEXICO	13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000362958700003

Here, we present a novel strategy to design a self-driven dual hydrogen production system for efficient hydrogen production based on highly-dispersed single Rh atoms supported on an oxygen-functionalized Ti3C2Ox MXene (Rh-SA/Ti3C2Ox) catalyst. The bifunctional Rh-SA/Ti3C2Ox catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic activities towards both the pH-universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Using Rh-SA/Ti3C2Ox as the electrode in the self-driven dual hydrogen production system by combining a Zn-H-2 battery and overall hydrazine splitting units, an ultra-high H-2 generation rate of 45.77 mmol h(-1) can be achieved. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the atomically dispersed single Rh atoms not only make the free energy of adsorbed H (Delta G(*H)) more thermoneutral for the HER but also largely decrease the free-energy barrier of the dehydrogenation of adsorbed NHNH2 for the HzOR.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000724280600001		
J	Gadzhov, I.; Mantcheva, R.								Anode materials and processes occurring in palladium-nickel electrolyte								TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF METAL FINISHING				85	3			141	146		10.1179/174591907X192302				MAY 2007	2007	The behaviour of various inert and soluble anode materials has been studied in a weakly acidic chloride electrolyte for deposition of Pd-Ni alloys. Inert anodes studied were graphite, and platinum, while the soluble ones were palladium and nickel. The possible preparation of a combined Pd-Ni anode is examined. The processes occurring on the anode are identified. The evolution of chlorine and oxygen is considered to be undesirable. The effects of the anode material, pH and temperature on the rate of chlorine and oxygen evolution have been studied by recording the polarisation curves under potentio-dynamic regime as a function of potential scan rate. The most suitable anode materials prove to be platinum and ruthenium oxide (OPTA). The use of combined Pd-Ni anodes is not recommended, since a third undesirable reaction also occurs on these, that of oxidation of ethylenediamine. Methods for elimination of the undesirable, side anode processes are proposed with a view to improving stable operation of the electrolyte.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0020-2967	1745-9192		WOS:000247237200014		
J	Aleixandre-Tudo, J. L.; du Toit, W. J.								Evolution of Phenolic Composition During Barrel and Bottle Aging								SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ENOLOGY AND VITICULTURE				41	2			233	237		10.21548/41-2-4128				2020	2020	During red wine ageing, phenolic compounds undergo several reactions that have an impact on wine colour and mouthfeel properties. The evolution of phenolic content is affected during wine ageing. The aim of this study was to investigate the phenolic content and evolution of 82 commercial red wines subjected to barrel and bottle ageing. The phenolic content evolution of wines that underwent an ageing period of 12 months in commercial 225 litre barrels, followed by 12 months in the bottle, was monitored. While the total phenolic content remained stable, the anthocyanin fraction was affected the most, which led to substantial changes in the colour properties of the wines. Differences were found during both ageing regimes, indicating certain phenolic reactions being favoured or compromised under different ageing conditions, with an impact on wine colour properties. This paper provides the first large-scale study on the phenolic evolution of commercial red wine during ageing.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0253-939X	2224-7904		WOS:000587650000011

Here, a novel hierarchically heterostructured catalyst composed of ul-trasmall Mo2C and metallic Co nanoparticles confined within a carbon layer is produced by a facile phase separation strategy. During thermal reduction of CoMoO4 nanosheets in CO ambient, in-situ generated nanoscale Co and ultrafine Mo2C conformally encapsulated in a conductive carbon layer. In addition, some carbon nanotubes catalyzed by Co nano-particles vertically grew on its surface, creating 3D interconnected electron channels. More importantly, the integrated C@Mo2C/Co nanosheets assembled into the hierarchical architecture, providing abundant active surface and retaining the structural integrity. Benefiting from such unique structure, the constructed hierarchical heterostructure shows low overpotentials of 280 mV and 145 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER in an alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, the symmetrical electrolyzer assembled with catalyst exhibits a small cell voltage of 1.67 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in addition to outstanding durability, demonstrating the great potential as a high efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.

We showed surface binding energies of relevant ORR/OER species are coupled strongly to surface polarity and local oxidation states, giving large (similar to 1 eV scale per adsorbate) differences in binding between (001) AO and BO2 surfaces, where the more oxidized BO2 bare surfaces in general exhibit weak coverage dependence, while the more reduced AO bare surfaces of the LaCrO3, LaMnO3, and LaFeO3 perovskites with lower d-electron filling show strong/moderate coverage dependences. We then predicted that surface coverage can play a key role in determining surface stability, and when coverage effects are included the AO and BO2(001) surfaces have either similar stability or the AO surface is more stable, as found for 1 monolayer HO* covered AO surfaces of LaCrO3 and LaFeO3 under ORR conditions and 1 monolayer O* covered LaNiO3 AO surface under OER conditions. For the (001) AO surfaces with strong coverage dependent surface adsorption, we predicted a decrease in ORR overpotential of 1-2 V with proper treatment of coverage effects as compared to those of the bare surface simulations. Our results indicated that the GGA+U method and proper treatment of coverage effects more accurately predict ORR and OER overpotentials relative to experimental values as compared to the GGA method and bare surfaces. The overall ORR activity trends vs. the LaBO3 series were predicted to be Co > Mn approximate to Ni > Fe > Cr.									74	5	0	0	5	0	75			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000359596600072	26227442

Herein, a facile one-step electrodeposition route in deep eutectic solvents (DESs) is developed for morphology-controllable synthesis of cobalt oxide/phosphate-carbon nanohybrids on nickel foam (CoPO@C/NF). A series of CoPO@C/NF nanostructures including cubes, octahedrons, microspheres and nanoflowers are synthesized, which show promising electrocatalytic properties toward oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER/HER). Such surface self-organized microstructure with accessible active sites make a significant contribution to the enhanced electrochemical activity, and hybridizing cobalt oxide with cobalt pyrophosphates and carbon can result in enhanced OER performance through synergistic catalysis. Among all nanostructures, the obtained microspherical CoPO@C/NF-3 catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activities for OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH, affording an anodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 293 mV for OER and 93 mV for HER, with good long-time stability. This work offers a practical route for engineering the high-performance electrocatalysts towards efficient energy conversion and storage devices.

Among them, Nb0.62Co0.33Ox exhibited the highest toluene combustion efficiency. It was found that the incorporation of amorphous niobium provided the surface acid sites and abundant oxygen vacancies for the adsorption and activation of the reactants which was demonstrated by NH3-TPD, XRD, UV-vis DRS, XPS and Toluene-TPD. Furthermore, the strong interaction between niobium and cobalt can also affect its physical and chemical properties related to SEM, H-2-TPR and XPS.

The energy generation rate of these two small networks are also compared to the energy generation rate given by a 489 isotope reaction network with weak reactions turned on and off. The comparison between the seven isotope and ct-chain reaction networks indicate the extent to which one can be replaced by the other, and the comparison with the 489 isotope reaction network roughly indicates under what physical conditions it is safe to use the seven isotope and ct-chain reaction networks. The seven isotope reaction network reproduces the nuclear energy generation rate of the standard alpha -chain reaction network to within 30%, but often much better, during hydrostatic and explosive helium, carbon, and oxygen burning. It will also provide energy generation rates within 30% of an alpha -chain reaction network for silicon burning at densities less than 10(7) g cm(-3). Provided there remains an equal number of protons and neutrons (Y-e = 0.5) over the course of the evolution, and that flows through alpha -particle channels dominate, then both of the small reaction networks return energy generation rates that are compatible with the energy generation rate returned by the 489 reaction network. If Y-e is significantly different from 0.5, or if there are substantial hows through neutron and protons channels, then it is not generally safe to employ any alpha -chain based reaction network. The relative accuracy of the seven isotope reaction network, combined with its reduction in the computational cost, suggest that it is a suitable replacement for alpha -chain reaction networks for parameter space surveys of a wide class of multidimensional stellar models.									91	4	0	0	0	0	92			0067-0049			WOS:000089954200017		
J	Villalobos, J.; Golnak, R.; Lifei Xi; Schuck, G.; Risch, M.								Reversible and irreversible processes during cyclic voltammetry of an electrodeposited manganese oxide as catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction [arXiv]								arXiv								8 pp., supl. 11 pp.	8 pp., supl. 11 pp.						14 Oct. 2020	2020	Manganese oxides have received much attention over the years among the wide range of electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their low toxicity, high abundance and rich redox chemistry. While many previous studies focused on the activity of these materials, a better understanding of the material transformations relating to activation or degradation is highly desirable, both from a scientific perspective and for applications. We electrodeposited Na-containing MnOx without long-range order from an alkaline solution to investigate these aspects by cyclic voltammetry (CV), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Mn-K and Mn-L edges. The pristine film was assigned to a layered edge-sharing Mn3+/4+ oxide with Mn-O bond lengths of mainly 1.87 Aring and some at 2.30 Aring as well as Mn-Mn bond lengths of 2.87 Aring based on fits to the extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS). The decrease of the currents at voltages before the onset of the OER followed power laws with three different exponents depending on the number of cycles and the Tafel slope decreases from 186+or-48 to 114+or-18 mV dec-1 after 100 cycles, which we interpret in the context of surface coverage with unreacted intermediates. Post-mortem microscopy and bulk spectroscopy at the Mn-K edge showed no change of the microstructure, bulk local structure or bulk Mn valence. Yet, the surface region of MnOx oxidized toward Mn4+, which explains the reduction of the currents in agreement with literature. Surprisingly, we find that MnOx reactivates after 30 minutes at open-circuit (OC), where the currents and also the Tafel slope increase. Reactivation processes during OC are crucial because OC is unavoidable when coupling the electrocatalysts to intermittent power sources such as solar energy for sustainable energy production. [J.

Electrochemical results revealed a slightly lower kinetic activity but a much larger rate capability for the NDG than commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst. The maximum power density for a Zn-air cell with NDG air cathode reached up to 218 mW cm(-2), which is nearly 1.5 times that of its counterpart with the Pt/C (155 mW cm(-2)). The equivalent diffusion coefficient (DE) of oxygen from electrolyte solution to the reactive sites of NDG was evaluated as about 1.5 times the liquid-phase diffusion coefficient (D-L) of oxygen within bulk electrolyte solution. Combined with experiments and ab initio calculations, this seems counterintuitive reverse ORR of NDG versus Pt/C can be rationalized by a spontaneous adsorption and fast solid-state diffusion of O-2 on ultralarge graphene surface of NDG to enhance effective ORR on N-doped-catalytic-centers and to achieve high-rate performance for Zn air batteries.									36	5	0	0	0	0	36			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000395494200049	28166623

Water electrolysis is one of the most convenient processes to produce high purity hydrogen. Cobalt-based catalysts are well-known electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this article, all these merits indicate that the present cobalt nanocomposite is a promising electrocatalyst for OER. C-Co3O4-nanorods catalyst with nanorod structure was synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of CoCl2 center dot 6H(2)O/dextrose/urea mixture at 180 degrees C for 18 h and then calcined at 400 degrees C for 3.5 h. The role of dextrose percentage in solution to achieve the uniform coating of carbon on the surface of Co3O4-nanorods has been demonstrated. The prepared materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller instrument (BET). Due to its unique morphology, the C-Co3O4-nanorods catalyst exhibited better activity than Co3O4-microplates catalyst for OER in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. The results showed a highly efficient, scalable, and low-cost method for developing highly active and stable OER electrocatalysts in alkaline solution.

Despite its great importance for designing target composites, the ability to identify whether active metal ions at octahedral or tetrahedral sites will preferentially exsolve in a spinel remains unexplored. Here, an inverse spinel NiFe2O4 (NFO) was employed as a prototype and FeNi/NFO composites were successfully constructed via exsolution. The preferential breaking of octahedral metal-oxygen bonds in the spinel oxide was directly observed using Mossbauer and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. This was further verified from the negative segregation energies calculated based on density-functional theory. One exsolved FeNi/NFO composite exhibits enhanced electrochemical activity with an overpotential of 283 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a long stability time for the oxygen evolution reaction. This work offers a unique insight into spinel exsolution based on the preferential breaking of chemical bonds and may be an effective guide for the design of new composite catalysts where the desired metal ions are deliberately introduced to octahedral and/or tetrahedral sites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000837407400001	36093019

Many efforts have been devoted to developing high active ORR and OER bifunctional electrocatalysts to improve the efficiency of devices. However, the possibility of using free solar energy in ORR/OER electrocatalysts to get higher efficiency in the devices has not yet been recognized. Herein, we report a photo-responsive bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalyst with a built-in p-n heterojunction based on Ni12P5 nanoparticles (NPs) coupled strongly with nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT). The Ni12P5@NCNT hybrid catalyst exhibited unusually high catalytic activities for both ORR (onset potential at 0.90 V vs. RHE) and OER (eta = 360mV @ 10 mA cm(-2)) in 0.1 M KOH solution with a.E (E-j (=) (OER)(10) - E-1/2(ORR)) = 0.82 V, comparable to that of its state-of-the-art counterparts (e.g., Pt for ORR, IrO2 for OER). Upon light irradiation (300 W Xenon lamp equipped with an AM 1.5G filter, 5 cm to electrode), the Delta E further decreased to 0.80 V. A rechargeable Zn-air battery devised from a Ni12P5@NCNT cathode in 6 M KOH/0.2 M Zn(Ac)(2) exhibited a low charge-discharge voltage gap (similar to 0.75 V @ 10 mA cm(-2), charge potential = 1.94 V and discharge potential = 1.19 V) and a remarkable cycling stability over 500 cycles, which, upon the light irradiation, showed an even lower charge potential of 1.90 V and higher discharge potential of 1.22 V (i.e., a charge-discharge voltage gap: 0.68 V @ 10 mA cm(-2)). The irradiation caused also a concomitant increase in the round-trip efficiency from similar to 61.3% to similar to 64.2%. To demonstrate the potential applications in portable/wearable electronic devices, we have also developed all solid-state flexible photo-assisted rechargeable Zn-air batteries based on the Ni12P5@NCNT air electrode with high-performance in the both presence and absence of light irradiation. This conceptual demonstration of the first photo-responsive ORR/OER bifunctional catalyst is significant as it reveals a novel catalytic mechanism, from which a class of new bifunctional catalysts with further enhanced photo-responsive performance could be developed, using in other rechargeable metal-air batteries.									68	8	0	0	4	0	68			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000419832100016

A non-linear multi-scale diffusion cancer invasion model that describes the interactions of the tumor cells, matrixmetalloproteinases (MM), matrix-degradative enzymes (MDE) and oxygen was employed for simulation. To quantify chaotic cancer attractors, the technique based on the wandering trajectories analysis was applied. Multi-parametric evolution of conditions leading to cancer invasion was defined and illustrated in numerous figures.Chaotic attractors and phase spaces of the regular oscillations of basic indicators of a biological system with parameters that correspond to the chaotic and regular regions, respectively, have been presented. Amplitude level contours of MM, MDE and oxygen concentrations have been obtained and juxtaposed with the corresponding parametric planes. In all cases the carcinogenesis is accompanied by significant increase in chemical oscillation amplitudes of MM, MDE and oxygen concentrations.

It is revealed that high-purity naked Cu nanoclusters, which have an average diameter of 2 nm, can be extracted from CuCl2 solution. The Au nanoparticles are also completely converted to Au3+ and Au+ ions by "hot holes". This is because of the plasmon generated "hot electrons" which overcome the limitation of thermodynamic reaction between the Au nanoparticles and Cu2+ ions. Furthermore, we find that the naked Cu nanoclusters exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic performance 1500 times higher than that of the ligand-protected Cu nanoclusters with similar size to achieve the oxygen reduction reaction.									22	2	0	0	2	0	22			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451380800040

The crystal structures of both complexes are determined. Thermal decomposition in H-2/He atmosphere leads to the formation of solid solutions of the metals. In the case of the nickel complex, the compositions of the prepared solid solutions are in the miscibility gap. In oxygen atmosphere mixed oxide systems NiO-RuO2 and Co3O4-RuO2 are formed in temperature interval from 400 to 600 degrees C.

It is in fact essential to understand the catalytic process associated to this reaction, especially the structural and electronic evolution of the metallic particles during the catalytic reaction. By EXAFS in-situ experiments realised at the platinum L-III edge, we have observed that the platinum particles sinter rapidly under a flow of NO. Moreover, the presence of C3H6 or NO both with an excess of oxygen did not lead to the total oxidation of the particles, as it was the case under oxygen only. In the presence of the total mixture, the two phenomenon occurred: sintering and oxidation.

Herein, we have developed an efficient multistep strategy to synthesize a unique hybrid nanostructure by directly growing Ni-Fe selenides nanoparticles onto nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Ni-Fe-Se/N-CNTs), which can act as an in situ-derived electrocatalyst for the efficient and stable OER. It has been discovered that the Ni-Fe bimetallic selenides are in situ converted into the corresponding oxides/peroxides during the OER process, which are responsible for the high activity for OER. The remaining Ni-Fe selenides and the N-CNTs with excellent conductivity, and the strong interaction between active species and N-CNTs also contribute to the fast electron transfer of electrocatalysts and the robust durability. As expected, the as-prepared nanohybrids exhibit a low overpotential of 215 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2)and excellent stability in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. This work underscores the importance of using bimetallic selenide as the efficient template for designing highly active and robust bimetallic species for OER.									10	0	0	0	0	0	11			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000545501000001

This shows clearly that the hydrolysis reaction involves some very reactive, presently unidentified, oxygenated groups. Extrapolation of this behaviour at RT is tentatively used to explain the ageing process; that is, the hydrolysis reaction is believed to be able to replace the pyrolysis (which works only at higher temperatures) for the production of reactive species allowing the oxidation process to be continued.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0008-6223			WOS:A1993LK63900021

Both the rate of photoinhibition of oxygen evolution and of D1 protein loss are substantially accelerated at pH 4.5 as compared to pH 7.0. Lowering the pH also affects the light-induced cleavage pattern of the D1 protein: at pH 6.0-7.0, the characteristic C-terminal fragments are of 8-10 kDa, whereas below pH 4.5, 23-24 kDa C-terminal products are accumulated. In addition, the predominant active oxygen species at pH 6.0-7.0 is singlet oxygen, but at low pH, it is replaced by hydroxyl radicals. Rapid D1 protein loss, which is accompanied by 23-24 kDa C-terminal fragments and hydroxyl radical production is characteristic of donor-side-induced photoinhibition. Thus, our results indicate that low pH conditions enhance light-induced damage to PS II function and protein structure by facilitating the donor-side mechanism of photoinhibition. The relevance of this effect to in vivo photoinhibition is discussed.									25	1	0	0	23	0	26			0005-2728	1879-2650		WOS:A1997WF46100024

The results show that, in the early stage of the Galaxy, massive stars are the main producer of carbon, and that as our Galaxy evolves to the late stage, the longer lived intermediate- and low-mass stars play an increasingly important role, while at the same time, metal-rich Wolf-Rayet stars eject a significant amount of carbon into the ISM by radiative-driven stellar winds. However, from the present published nucleosynthesis yields we cannot distinguish whether the main source of carbon in the late Galactic stage is just the massive stars (M >8 M-.) alone, or just the intermediate-, low-mass stars and M less than or equal to 40 M-. massive stars that do not go through the Wolf-Rayet stage. The C-12(alpha,gamma) O-16 reaction rate is very important in the stellar nucleosynthesis calculations: a lower rate will give a higher yield of carbon. The contribution to nitrogen is dominated by intermediate- and low-mass stars, and the secondary source of massive stars cannot explain the observed [N/Fe] in metal-poor stars. Most of oxygen is produced by massive stars. The fact that a higher O abundance in metal-poor stars is derived from the O I 7771-7775 Angstrom triplet than from the forbidden [O I] line at 6300 Angstrom poses a problem.									33	4	0	0	0	0	34			1432-0746			WOS:000170215900017

The OER is significantly enhanced upon modification of the electrodes with nano-CoOx, as demonstrated by a negative shift in the polarization curves at the nano-CoOx modified electrodes compared to that obtained at the unmodified ones. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the electrodeposition of nanometer-size CoOx (average particle size of 200 nm) onto GC electrode. Optimization of the operating experimental conditions (i.e., solution pH and loading level of nano-CoOx) has been achieved to maximize the electrocatalytic activity of nano-CoOx modified electrodes. It has been found that the electrocatalytic activity of the nano-CoOx modified electrodes towards the OER is pH and loading level dependent, while it is substrate independent. The low cost as well as the marked stability of the thus-modified electrodes make them promising candidates in industrial water electrolysis process.									30	0	0	0	1	0	31			1452-3981			WOS:000304413000048

Herein, we report a unique and cost-effective lyophilization and thermal treatment two-step procedure to synthesize a high-performance hybrid consisting of CoFe alloy nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon nanosheets interspersed with carbon nanotubes (CoFe-N-CN/CNTs) hybrid. The lyophilization step during the catalyst preparation leads to a uniform dispersion of carbon-like precursors and avoids the agglomeration of metal particles. In addition, the inserted CNTs and doped N in this hybrid provide a good electrical conductivity, an abundance of chemically active sites, good mass transport capability, and effective gas adsorption/release channels. All these lead to a high specific surface area of 240.67 m(2)g(-1), favorable stability, and remarkable OER activities with an overpotential of only 285 mV at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 51.09 mVdec(-1) in 1.0 m KOH electrolyte, which is even superior to commercial IrO2 catalysts. The CoFe-N-CN/CNTs hybrid thus exhibits great potential as a highly efficient and earth-abundant anode OER electrocatalyst.									31	5	0	0	2	0	33			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000439757800011	29786972

However, the ability to design efficient and durable noble-metal-free catalysts for decreasing the overpotential in the electrolysis process is in high demand. Here, it is demonstrated that cobalt iron carbonate hydroxide hydrate nanowire arrays on Ti mesh (CFOC/TM) obtained through a surface anion interchange method can lead to amorphous cobalt iron tetrathiomolybdate coated on crystalline cobalt iron carbonate hydroxide hydrate nanowire arrays on Ti mesh (CFMS@CFOC/TM), which can act as an efficient and durable water splitting electrocatalyst in alkaline media. CFMS@CFOC/TM shows good performance for the oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions, with the need for low overpotentials of 237 mV and 93 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. As a 3D bifunctional electrode catalyst, it enables alkaline water splitting with excellent performance, achieving 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.63 V with a satisfying stability performance.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2196-0216			WOS:000536495700013

However, the TMPs suffer from low activity for water dissociation, which greatly limits the efficiency for alkaline HER. Here, a facile yet robust strategy is reported to boost the HER of metal phosphides by coating defective TiO2 overlayers. The oxygen vacancies (O-v) on defective TiO2 overlayers are found to possess high activity for adsorption and dissociation of water, thereby significantly promoting the initial Volmer step of HER to generate the reactive hydrogen atoms. Moreover, the porous (Co, Ni)(2)P (i.e., Co2P and Ni2P) nanosheets provide enough active sites for adsorption and recombination of reactive hydrogen atoms to produce hydrogen gas. The catalytic synergy of (Co, Ni)(2)P and O-v coupled with the hierarchically porous structure renders the porous (Co, Ni)(2)P@0.1TiO(2) nanosheet arrays excellent electrocatalysts for HER, showing a small overpotential (92 mV) to yield a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope (49 mV dec(-1)), and an outstanding stability. This work demonstrates a surface decoration route for enhancing the activity of nonprecious metal-based electrocatalysts for HER.									45	0	0	0	4	0	45			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000447660700010	30260576

In this work, we developed porous zinc-cobalt layered double hydroxide (Zn-Co-LDH) nanosheets by using a one-step microwave-assisted approach, and examine their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. The Zn-Co-LDH nanosheets with a high specific surface area of 116.4 m(2) g(-1) exhibit good OER activity, expressed as low onset overpotential, small Tafel slope and large exchange current density. At the overpotential of 0.54 V, the current density of Zn-Co-LDH nanosheets is about 15.06 mA cm(-2), which is much higher than that of Zn-Co-LDH nanoparticles. The comparable electrocatalytic performance may be attributed to the porous 2D structure generating more active sites and higher electronic conductivity. Furthermore, the obtained Zn-Co-LDH nanosheets show good stability during long time running at 1.55 V vs. RHE. Accordingly, an effective OER catalyst is exploited by using a simple microwave-assisted synthesis. Such an effective method could be extended to large-scale synthesis of uniform and stable 2D LDH nanomaterials.									146	13	0	0	5	0	150			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000351552300023

Upon optimization of the dosages of Fe/Co sources and calcination temperature, the optimal Fe0.5Co0.5@NC/NCNS-800 sample exhibits high activity with a potential of 1.5 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER in 1.0 M KOH, which even surpassed that of commercial RuO2. Moreover, as an HER electrocatalyst in 1.0 M KOH, Fe0.5Co0.5@NC/NCNS-800 just requires a low overpotential of 150 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) with an onset potential of -63 mV. All these results highlight the synergistic effects of the 3D macroporous channels of the flower-like architecture, 2D mesoporous CNSs, high specific surface area, fine FeCo@NC core-shell units, and various active centers for boosting the OER/HER catalytic activities, defining the Fe0.5Co0.5@NC/NCNS as one of the best non-precious metal-based carbonaceous electrocatalysts for oxygen/hydrogen-based electrocatalysis. More importantly, when Fe0.5Co0.5@NC/NCNS was used as positive and negative electrodes in a two-electrode system for overall water splitting, it just required a cell voltage of 1.60 V to achieve similar to 10 mA cm(-2), which opens a new possibility for the construction of novel water splitting devices. We also believe that our present synthetic strategy can encourage further research for the development of other 3D hierarchically meso/macroporous noble-metal-free catalysts for sensors, batteries, and various other renewable energy applications without any tedious steps or templates.									99	9	0	0	3	0	100			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000397605300020

The electrocatalytic properties were studied with varying F:BCN weight ratios to optimize the intermolecular electron transfer (ET) from the BCN NSs to the electron-accepting C-6(0) molecules. The nanohybrid supramolecular material with 10 wt % F in BCN NSs (10% F/BCN) exhibited the largest Raman and C is binding energy shifts, which were associated with greater cooperativity interactions and enhanced ET processes at the F/BCN interface. This synergistic interfacial phenomenon resulted in highly active catalytic sites that markedly boosted electrocatalytic activity of the material. The 10% F/BCN showed the highest tetrafunctional catalytic performance, outperforming the OER catalytic activity of commercial RuO2 catalysts with a eta(10) of 390 mV and very competitive onset potential values of -0.042 and 0.92 V vs RHE for HER and ORR, respectively, and a current density value of 1.47 mA cm(-2) at 0.1 V vs RHE with an ultralow Delta G(H*) value of -0.03 eV toward the HOR process. Additionally, the 10% F/BCN catalyst was also used as both cathode and anode in a water splitting device, delivering a cell potential of 1.61 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-)(2).									65	2	0	0	8	0	65			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000612557200072	33401899

As-prepared NiS2-Ni(OH)(2)/CNT composite shows excellent storage properties with a specific capacitance of 1250 F/g with pseudocapacitive behavior. Interestingly, NiS2-Ni(OH)(2)/10% CNT electrode exhibited better cycling stability with 80% retention of specific capacitance after 3000 cycles at a current density of 5 A/g. Further, when employed as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, NiS2-Ni(OH)(2)/10%CNT composite electrode exhibits an OER onset potential of 1.45 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and it can catalyze OER efficiently with the overpotential of 290 mV to generate 10 mA/cm(2) current density (with a lower Tafel slope 110 mV/decade) in an alkaline solution. The stability studies also confirm an excellent performance of NiS2-Ni(OH)(2)/CNT even after 2000 cycles without obvious degradation, due to the formation of three-dimensional network of layered sulphide and one-dimensional CNTs that plays a main role in the energy conversion and storage.

We here describe a novel strategy in which basic cobalt carbonate - a precursor to Co3O4 is precipitated as sheet-like structures and microspheres covered with fine surface protrusions, via ammonium carbonate decomposition at room temperature. Importantly, these mild reaction conditions enable us to employ bio-inspired templating approaches to further control the mineral structure. Rod-like tobacco mosaic viruses (TMV) were used as biotemplates for mineral deposition, where we profit from the ability of Co(II) ions to mediate the ordered assembly of the virus nanorods to create complex tubular superstructures of TMV/basic cobalt carbonate. Calcination of these tubules is then achieved with retention of the gross morphology, and generates a hierarchically-structured solid comprising interconnected Co3O4 nanoparticles. Evaluation of these Co3O4 materials as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) demonstrates that the activity of Co3O4 prepared by calcination of ammonia diffusion-grown precursors in both, the absence or presence of TMV exceeds that of a commercial nanopowder.									34	2	0	0	6	0	34			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000401649700015	28387406

However, the development of Li-O-2 batteries is hampered due to the poor cycling performance and high discharge/charge overpotential. In this work, we developed a unique composite of CeO2-decorated Fe Fe2O3 nanorods supported on carbon cloth (Fe2O3/CeO2@CC) as binder-free cathode catalyst. The Fe2O3/CeO2@CC significantly reduced overpotentials for oxygen redox reactions. And their battery could perform to 94 cycles (at 340 mA/g with a limited capacity of 500 mAh/g), which is much better than that of Fe2O3@CC-catalyzed battery (64 cycles). Such well performances should result from that CeO2 catalyst also could serve as oxygen buffer. CeO2 could supply oxygen under deficient conditions and remove oxygen under rich conditions, reducing the interference of oxygen concentration to the battery. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of nickel concentration on the structure and onset potential for oxygen evolution of Ti/Ni-Sb-SnO2 anodes have been systematically investigated. XRD analyses suggest that SnO2 thin films grow in preferential orientation along (101) plane as the nickel concentration increases. The enhanced onset potential of oxygen is above 2.4 V vs NHE due to the introduction of nickel doping, and increases slightly with the nickel concentration. The calculated results show that work function of Ni/Sb co-doped SnO2 also increases with the Ni doping level, which contributes to the enhancement of onset potential for oxygen evolution.

In order to limit the diversity of sites, arrays of discrete iridium clusters with identical metal atom number (Ir-2, Ir-4, or Ir-8) were deposited in submonolayer coverage on conductive oxide supports, and the electrochemical properties and activity of each was evaluated. Exceptional electroactivity for the oxygen evolving reaction (OER) was observed for all cluster samples in acidic electrolyte. Reproducible cluster-size-dependent trends in redox behavior were also resolved. First-principles computational models of the individual discrete-size clusters allow correlation of catalytic-site structure and multiplicity with redox behavior.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			1932-7447			WOS:000432477400025		
J	Tombolelli, Dania; Mroginski, Maria Andrea								Proton Transfer Pathways between Active Sites and Proximal Clusters in the Membrane-Bound [NiFe] Hydrogenase								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				123	16			3409	3420		10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b00617				APR 25 2019	2019	[NiFe] hydrogenases are enzymes that catalyze the splitting of molecular hydrogen according to the reaction H-2 -> 2H(+) + 2e(-). Most of these enzymes are inhibited even by low traces of O-2. However, a special group of O-2-tolerant hydrogenases exists. A member of this group is the membrane-bound [NiFe] hydrogenase from Ralstonia eutropha (ReMBH). The ReMBH harbors an unusual iron sulfur cluster with composition 4Fe3S(6Cys) that is able to undergo structural changes triggering the flow of two electrons to the [NiFe] active site. These electrons promote oxygen reduction at the active site, preventing, in this way, aerobic inactivation of the enzyme. In the superoxidized state, the [4Fe3S] cluster binds to a hydroxyl group that originates from either molecular oxygen or water reaching the site. Both reactions, oxygen reduction to water at the [NiFe]- or [4Fe3S]-centers and oxygen evolution from water at the proximal cluster, require the delivery of protons regulated by a subtle communication mechanism between these metal centers. In this work, we sequentially apply multiscale modeling techniques as quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics methods and classical molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the role of two distinct proton transfer pathways connecting the [NiFe] active site and the [4Fe3S] proximal cluster of ReMBH in the protection mechanism against an oxygen attack. Although the "glutamate" pathway is preferred by protons migrating toward the active site to avoid inactivation by O-2, the "histidine" pathway plays an essential role in delivering protons for O-2 reduction at the proximal cluster. The results obtained in this work not only provide new pieces to the puzzling catalytic mechanisms governing O-2-tolerant hydrogenases but also highlight the relevance of dynamics in the proper description of biochemical reactions in general.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1520-6106			WOS:000466053800003	30931567

Here, B/N co-doped porous carbon shell-encapsulated Fe2N nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized as an active and durable catalyst (Fe2N@BNC) for ORR. Introduction of the B dopant promotes the doping of the N element, amends the carbon shell, and induces the conversion of pyrrolic nitrogen into C-N-B. This immensely promotes the electron transfer from the encapsulated Fe2N NPs to the carbon surface, tailors the electronic structure of the carbon shell, and therefore improves the ORR activity of the inert carbon. The optimized electrocatalyst Fe2N@BNC-2 achieved remarkable activity and durability for ORR, which was even better than that of Com.

In order to obtain localized corrosion, a cathodic reaction (other than hydrogen evolution) must be available at the passive surface. In most cases this is oxygen reduction, necessitating the co-existence of the anaerobic SRB and an aerated bulk environment. The simplest model of the anode is a porous, inert barrier deposit within which the SRB thrive by using nutrients, including sulphate, that diffuse inwards from the bulk, while consuming oxygen through reactions such as: 2HS- + O2 --> 2OH- + 2S0. Microcell electrodes based on this principle have been shown to corrode for many days but to repassivate when essential nutrients are removed from the bulk, aerated solution. Platinum electrodes have been used to characterize the SRB microenvironment, e.g. by measuring its mixed or 'redox' potential.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:A1993ML27900079

Here, we demonstrated the spatial engineering of an ultrathin Co(OH)(x) encapsulated p-Cu2S/n-BiVO4 photoanode for simultaneously enhancing charge separation and surface reaction kinetics in solar water splitting. Specifically, the separation efficiency of photoexcited charge carriers in the bulk was effectively improved due to the formation of a p-Cu2S/n-BiVO4 heterojunction, and the light-driven water oxidation reaction on the surface was further promoted because of the introduction of Co(OH)(x) as an oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) layer. As a result, the p-Cu2S/n-BiVO4 heterostructure yielded a largely enhanced charge separation efficiency of up to 79%, and a significant surface charge separation of 70% was achieved, attributed to the deposition of the Co(OH)(x) cocatalyst. Furthermore, this synergistic effect in the photoanode gave rise to a remarkably enhanced photocurrent density of 3.51 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode. This spatial engineering provides an efficient strategy for the simultaneous improvement of internal and surface charge separation via dual modification, i.e., p-n heterojunction formation and OEC coating.									29	1	0	0	2	0	29			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463814800012

For the first time, herein we demonstrate the design and successful bottom-up fabrication of a novel noble-metal-free nickel phthalocyanine-based 2D MOF (NiPc-MOF) for highly efficient water oxidation catalysis. This NiPc-MOF can be easily grown on various substrates. The thin film deposited on FTO showed high catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with a very low onset potential (<1.48 V, overpotential < 0.25 V), high mass activity (883.3 A g(-1)), and excellent catalytic durability. To the best of our knowledge, this present 2D MOF film catalyst represents the best OER catalytic activity among molecular catalyst-based materials reported so far.

Herein, we synthesize Na+ functionalized porous graphitic carbon nitride nanorods (Na-CNNR) via a facile one-pot calcination method. The morphology and size of Na-CNNR are controllable by changing the amount of sodium salt; both sodium salt and air are essential to the unique structure and oxygen doping. The obtained Na-CNNR contains abundant oxygen in the graphitic carbon nitride (CN) plane. The optimized Na20-CNNR (20 wt% Na2S2O3 center dot 5H(2)O to dicyanamide) photocatalyst exhibits a high surface area with enhanced visible light absorption. Besides, Na20-CNNR displays fast charge transfer and high carrier separation rate characterized by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and electrochemical test. Through time-resolved transient absorption spectra analysis, the trapped unreactive electron accumulation can be highly restrained, favoring efficient active electron de-trapping and transfer. The optimized Na20-CNNR sample exhibits the highest photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of 7.46 mmol/h/g under visible light irradiation (>400 nm, 100 mW/cm(2)), which is up to 85 times that of the bare CN and 27 times that of Na+ doped graphitic carbon nitride nanoparticles (Na20-CNNP). Meanwhile, the cyclability tests indicate that Na20-CNNR displays robust stability over 24 h. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a novel strategy involving an in situ transformation of ultrathin cobalt layered double hydroxide into 2D cobalt zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) nanosheets grafted with 3D ZIF-67 polyhedra supported on the surface of carbon cloth (2D/3D ZIF-67@CC) precursor is proposed. After a low-temperature pyrolysis, this precursor can be further converted into hybrid composites composed of ultrafine cobalt nanoparticles embedded within 2D N-doped carbon nanosheets and 3D N-doped hollow carbon polyhedra (Co@N-CS/N-HCP@CC). Experimental and density functional theory calculations results indicate that such composites have the advantages of a large number of accessible active sites, accelerated charge/mass transfer ability, the synergistic effect of components as well as an optimal water adsorption energy change. As a result, the obtained Co@N-CS/N-HCP@CC catalyst requires overpotentials of only 66 and 248 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER in 1.0 m KOH, respectively. Remarkably, it enables an alkali-electrolyzer with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.545 V, superior to that of the IrO2@CC||Pt/C@CC couple (1.592 V).									233	14	0	0	17	0	234			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000471339300007

All the materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD), and all materials were evaluated as both HER and OER electrocatalysts. The NiMoS2 synthesized from DETA-pretreatment exhibits the best HER catalytic performance with the lowest overpotential of 0.151 V, while the CNT-modified NiMoS2 shows the lowest OER overpotential of 0.310 V. All the pretreated NiMoS2 electrocatalysts show significantly improved catalytic activity compared to the one prepared directly from pristine ATM precursor. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, we report an electrocatalytic decarboxylation (ECDX) approach for the conversion of carboxylic acids into paraffins, olefins, and alcohols via (non-)Kolbe electrolysis on thin films (TEs). The ECDX rate, product selectivity, and current efficiency were potential and electrode dependent. For example, the ECDX activity of RuO2-TF was similar to that of N foil, but the selectivity to Kolbe products was lower on the former. RuO2-TF showed about five times higher rates for the oxygen evolution reaction than N foil, which resulted in lower current efficiency. The ECDX and O-2 evolution activities of IrO2-TF were potential dependent, but this electrode was selective to non-Kolbe products with low current efficiency ( < 10 %). This work highlights the performance of thin films as an alternative to bulk metals as anodes for oxidative upgrading of carboxylic acids.									16	1	0	0	2	0	16			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000552015900084

Characterization of Ir-based catalysts using SEM, TEM, XRD, CO chemisorption and XPS, and reaction studies on various Ir-based catalysts have proved that the formation of relatively large Ir metal particle with 40-60 nm of nanocrystal size carried on inert supports has been a prerequisite for the evolution of high activities in the NOx reduction rather than the formation of Ir metal state on the catalyst. Furthermore, in inert gas conditions in a high temperature range of 850-950 degreesC, Ir metal was easily formed by using the support such as TiO2 and ZrO2 that drastically decreased its specific surface area in the temperature range.					5th Congress on Catalysis and Automotive Pollution Control (CAPoC5)5th Congress on Catalysis and Automotive Pollution Control (CAPoC5)	APR 12-14, 2000APR 12-14, 2000	Automot Emiss Control Catalysts; Daimler Chrysler AG; Ford Motor Co; Fortis Banque (Gr CGER); Johnson Matthey LTD; PSA Peugeot Citroen; Rhodia Terres Rares; Shell; Siemens AG; VolkswagenAutomot Emiss Control Catalysts; Daimler Chrysler AG; Ford Motor Co; Fortis Banque (Gr CGER); Johnson Matthey LTD; PSA Peugeot Citroen; Rhodia Terres Rares; Shell; Siemens AG; Volkswagen	BRUSSELS, BELGIUMBRUSSELS, BELGIUM	3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1022-5528	1572-9028		WOS:000171632100033

In this paper, integrated air electrodes have been successfully assembled by in-site coupling of NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets with N-doped carbon nanosheet arrays on carbon cloth (NiFe LDH@N-CNSs@CC). The electrochemical performance shows that the hierarchical structure provides abundant sites for the catalytic OER and ORR processes. In addition, the rechargeable Zn-air battery using NiFe LDH@N-CNSs@CC as a cathode can maintain a stable voltage gap of 0.90 V over 300 hours of cycling at a current density of 5 mA cm(-2), demonstrating excellent cycling stability, which is better than that of commercial Pt/C + RuO2 catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1466-8033		WOS:000860010100001

The article will explore the surface evolution across five different oxygen to ammonia ratios in the millibar regime for two different temperatures. The presented data set allows us to link variations in the atomic structures measured by diffraction methods and surface species information from NAP-XPS to reaction products in the gas phase. We will show that NO production coincides with significant changes of the surface structure and the formation of a RhO2 surface oxide. It was also observed that the RhO2 surface oxide only fully forms when the nitrogen signal in the N1s has disappeared.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000580580000030

Herein, a new electrocatalyst, FeAg-CNF (CNF, carbon nanofiber), was fabricated via simple electrospinning and subsequent calcinations as an outstanding ORR electrocatalytic catalyst. FeAg-CNF was subjected to water vapor activation to artificially develop the pore structures and excavate more effective sites. The resultant activated FeAg-CNF (A-FeAg-CNF) exhibits excellent activity and durability, which were better than those of commercial Pt/C. Based on our results, we conclude that the improvement in A-FeAg-CNF is caused by the enhanced pore structure and electrical conductivity. We believe that this study suggests a new insight and is helpful to designing carbon-based ORR catalysts for energy storage and conversion application fields.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1932-7447			WOS:000384959100025

However, the reported HER activity of (Ni,Fe)(3)S-2 is still unsatisfactory. Herein, three-dimensional self-supported phosphorus-doped (Ni,Fe)(3)S-2 nanosheet arrays on Ni foam (P-(Ni,Fe)(3)S-2/NF) are synthesized by a simple one-step simultaneous phosphorization and sulfuration route, which exhibits dramatically enhanced HER activity as well as drives remarkable OER activity. The incorporation of P significantly optimized the hydrogen/water absorption free energy (Delta G(H*)/Delta G(H2O*)), enhanced electrical conductivity, and increased electrochemical surface area. Accordingly, the optimal P-(Ni,Fe)(3)S-2/NF exhibits relatively low overpotentials of 98 and 196 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER in 1 M KOH, respectively. Furthermore, an alkaline electrolyzer comprising the P-(Ni,Fe)(3)S2INF electrodes needs a very low cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits long-term stability and outperforms most other state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. The reported electrocatalyst activation approach by anion doping can be adapted for other transition-metal chalcogenides for water electrolysis, offering great promise for future applications.									87	3	0	0	2	0	87			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000480498600019	31303002

However, the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) generally occurs at low rates in neutral solutions due to the low proton concentration in such media. Herein, we fabricated a novel HER catalyst capable of efficient H-2 evolution in water at neutral pH, comprising a nickel-molybdenum nitride nanowire array modified with metallic Ni nanoparticles (Ni/NiMoN). The entire Ni/NiMoN array was supported on a Cu foam. The Ni nanoparticles promoted the dissociation of adsorbed water to enhance the supply of protons in the neutral electrolyte, whilst the nanowire array imparted the electrode surface with underwater superaerophobic properties, thus allowing H-2 gas bubbles to detach from the electrode in a facile manner. On the basis of the synergies realized between the different electrode components, the Ni/NiMoN nanowire array electrode offered exceptional HER performance, with an overpotential of only 37 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in a neutral electrolyte. Results guide the development of next-generation earth-abundant element electrocatalysts for HER in neutral media.									67	3	0	0	3	0	69			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000596610800001

Herein, gamma-Fe2O3/reduced Graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposite is fabricated through a simple and environmentally friendly approach and applied as a high-performance ORR electrocatalyst. Multiple characterizations confirm the formation of gamma-Fe2O3/rGO nanocomposite and exhibit well crystal structure, microstructure, and magnetic properties. Furthermore, the cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry measurements confirm that the gamma-Fe2O3/rGO exhibits high ORR catalytic performance for the synergistic effect. Consequently, the obtained gamma-Fe2O3/rGO might be a promising non-precious, cheap and recycled catalyst for fuel cells and metal-air batteries.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2365-6549			WOS:000689687300048

Despite the considerable efforts in advancing non-precious-metal candidates by multiscale structural engineering, an adequate structural integration remains a significant challenge in achieving an efficient OER, largely bottlenecked by a low population of active sites and limited synergistic effect. Herein, we propose a synergistic strategy of effectively combining aliovalent doping and interface in the NiV nitride@oxyhydroxide (NiVN@OOH) heterostructured nanosheet arrays, successfully developed by in-situ electrochemical surface reconfiguration (ESR) from the core-shell nanostructured Ni3N@Ni3VN aiming for enabling OER kinetics. The thus-optimized NiVN@OOH with abundant core-shell interfaces, vertically aligned nanosheet arrays and purposely-chosen V-doping, demonstrates superior OER activity with an ultralow over-potential of 233 mV at the current density of 50 mA cm(geo)(-2), 64-fold rise in catalytic current density at 1.47 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and 37-fold increase in turn-over frequency at an overpotential of 240 mV, over those of Ni3N@OOH, together with a robust long-term stability in 1 M KOH. Our DFT calculations further reveal that the synergistic effects of the aliovalent V-doping and interface engineering have boosted the intrinsic OER activity on adjacent oxygen active sites. The discovery in the present work provides a new paradigm of multiscale-controlled synergy for much enhanced electrocatalysis.									26	1	0	0	2	0	26			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000663441800001

Non-stoichiometric tungsten oxides, in particular, W18O49 nanostructures have shown their prominence for various functional applications. This work presents the growth mechanism of W18O49 nanowires on W surfaces under H2O(v) atmosphere. The phase evolutions are unfolded in view of the detailed thermodynamic considerations. The reaction between W and H2O(v) produces WO3 along with H-2 as a by-product. H-2 acts as a reductant for WO3 and facilitates the W18O49 phase formation. The complete crystallographic relation of the phase transformation could be represented as W(110)//WO3(010)//W18O49(010). The oxygen vacancy-induced planar defects are responsible for the 1d [010] growth of W18O49 NWs. The hexagonal tunnels along the NW length create a passage for H2O(v) to repeat the reaction and increase the NW length.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1466-8033		WOS:000693224000001

Synthesis and evaluation of the catalyst are coupled as an operation unit to enable continuous and unattended execution of combinatorial experiments. This platform is demonstrated in the identification of high-performance bifunctional catalysts for water splitting from a trimetallic NiFeCo hydroxide system. The platform collects data for evaluating the performance of 66 different catalysts in oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions within a timeframe of four days. Timely feedback from the close-coupled evaluation enables a guided focused-area scanning of the parameter matrix, achieving both full coverage and a fine-tuned hit with a relatively smaller number of experiments. The optimal compositions of the catalysts identified by the platform are well consistent with previous reports. Therefore, the platform is capable of generating useful data for catalyst screening, allowing a researcher to focus more on creative tasks.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2365-709X			WOS:000616748500001

By means of recording and analysis of potential-relaxation transients, coupled with impedance spectroscopy studies, the adsorption behaviour of the Cl. intermediate at the oxide-free Pt surface in TFA has been determined in relation to the Cl. recombination kinetic step, which is indicated as the rate-controlling Cl. desorption pathway. The Cl. adsorption and kinetic behaviour at preoxidized Pt electrodes, also in TFA solutions of Cl-, are examined and discussed comparatively. Although in anhydrous TFA solution the Cl2 evolution reaction demonstrably takes place on a completely oxide-free surface, Cl. recombination-controlled kinetics are also found for oxide-covered Pt, both in TFA and aqueous Cl- solutions. However, the coverage by the Cl. adsorbed intermediate remains relatively small, even towards the limiting current; this is attributed to strong competitive adsorption of the TFA solvent molecule.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0022-0728			WOS:A1993LB32400019

INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				52	16			9522	9531		10.1021/ic401180r				AUG 19 2013	2013	Thermal water oxidation by cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN) was catalyzed by nonheme iron complexes, such as Fe(BQEN)(OTF)(2) (1) and Fe(BQCN)-(OTf)(2) (2) (BQEN = N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'-bis(8-quinolyl)-ethane-1,2-diamine, BQCN = N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'-bis(8-quinolyl)cyclohexanediamine, OTf = CF3SO3-) in a non-buffered aqueous solution; turnover numbers of 80 +/- 10 and 20 +/- 5 were obtained in the O-2 evolution reaction by 1 and 2, respectively. The ligand dissociation of the iron complexes was observed under acidic conditions, and the dissociated ligands were oxidized by CAN to yield CO2. We also observed that 1 was converted to an iron(IV)-oxo complex during the water oxidation in competition with the ligand oxidation. In addition, oxygen exchange between the iron(IV)-oxo complex and (H2O)-O-18 was found to occur at a much faster rate than the oxygen evolution. These results indicate that the iron complexes act as the true homogeneous catalyst for water oxidation by CAN at low pHs. In contrast, light-driven water oxidation using [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) as a photosensitizer and S2O82- as a sacrificial electron acceptor was catalyzed by iron hydroxide nanoparticles derived from the iron complexes under basic conditions as the result of the ligand dissociation. In a buffer solution (initial pH 9.0) formation of the iron hydroxide nanoparticles with a size of around 100 nm at the end of the reaction was monitored by dynamic light scattering (DLS) in situ and characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements. We thus conclude that the water oxidation by CAN was catalyzed by short-lived homogeneous iron complexes under acidic conditions, whereas iron hydroxide nanoparticles derived from iron complexes act as a heterogeneous catalyst in the light-driven water oxidation reaction under basic conditions.									141	2	0	0	19	0	141			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000323460800040	23895380

The NiMo carbide/G and CoMo carbide/G are found to be different in main carbide species (i.e., MoC and Mo2C, respectively) and in carbide particle size distribution. The ORR tests revealed that CoMo carbide/G exhibit better electrocatalytic performance than NiMo carbide/G in terms of on-set potential, limiting current density and durability. Our present results may open new way for the synthesis of molybdenum carbides, and also suggested that strategies for tuning the molybdenum carbide species within bi-metallic carbides may lead to further enhancements in ORR activity.

The binary and ternary Co coatings were deposited on a copper surface using the electroless metal plating technique and morpholine borane (MB) as a reducing agent. The as-deposited Co-Ni, Co-Fe, Co-Fe-Mn, Co-Fe-Mo, and Co-Zn coatings produce compact and crack-free layers with typical globular morphology. It was found that the Co-Fe-Mo coating gives the lowest overpotential of 128.0 mV for the HER and the lowest overpotential of 455 mV for the OER to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The HER and OER current density values increase 1.4-2.0 times with an increase in temperature from 25 degrees C to 55 degrees C using the prepared 3D binary or ternary cobalt coatings for HER and OER.

In order to assess the importance of the lumenal extrinsic loop that connects transmembrane helices I and II of D1 we have constructed five deletion mutants and two double mutants in the cyanobaterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Four of the deletion mutants (Delta 59-65, Delta 69-74, Delta 79-86 and Delta 109-110) are obligate photoheterotrophs unable to accumulate D1 in the membrane as assayed by immunoblotting experiments or pulse-labelling experiments using [S-35]-methionine. In contrast deletion mutant Delta 100 which lacks A100 behaved very similarly to the WT control strain in terms of photoautotrophic growth rate, saturated rates of oxygen evolution, flash-induced oxygen evolution, fluorescence induction and decay, and thermoluminescence. Delta 100 is the first example of an internal deletion on the lumenal side of the D1 polypeptide that is benign to photosystem two function. Double mutant D103G/E104A also behaves similarly to the WT control strain leading to the conclusion that residues D103 and E104 are unlikely to be involved in ligating the metal ions Mn or Ca2+, which are needed for photosynthetic oxygen evolution. Double mutant, G109A/G110A, was constructed to assess the significance of this GlyGly motif which is also conserved in the L subunit of purple bacterial reaction centres. The G109A/G110A mutant is able to evolve oxygen at approximately 50-70% of WT rates but is unable to grow phatoautotrophically apparently because of an enhanced sensitivity to photoinactivation than the WT control strain. A photoautotropic revertant was isolated from this strain and shown to result from a mutation that restored the WT codon at position 109. Pulse-chase experiments in cells using [S-35]-methionine showed that resistance to photoinhibition in the revertant correlated with an enhanced rate of incorporation of D1 into the membrane compared to mutant G109A/G110A. The sensitivity to photoinhibition shown by the G109A/G110A mutant is therefore consistent with a perturbation to the D1 repair cycle possibly at the level of D1 synthesis or incorporation of D1 into the PS II complex.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1996WD34300009	24271824

During the past decade, bioinspired polydopamine (PDA) has drawn tremendous attention in the advanced materials field. In this review, we provide an overall view of emerging PDA-inspired materials for energy conversion and storage applications. The peculiar advantages of PDA in the elaboration of desired functional materials are highlighted. We focus on the fabrication strategies used for PDA-based materials and their cutting-edge applications as electrocatalysts for oxygen-, hydrogen-and CO2-involving energy conversion reactions and electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries and sodium-ion batteries. The rational tailoring of structures and atomic level molecular design of PDA-based materials for specific functions are particularly demonstrated by a range of examples.									77	2	0	0	9	0	77			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000456724800011

Co-decomposition of Cu and Ir precursors in the presence of CTAC (cetyltrimethylammonium chloride) forms CuIr nanocrystals with an Ir-rich {111} facet. A mechanistic study reveals that the surface Cu atoms of the initially formed octahedral-shaped Cu-rich Cu-Ir alloy nanoparticles are replaced by Ir atoms via a galvanic replacement reaction. The formation of the Ir phase is rather slow, leading to the impermeable nature of the Ir shell, which does not allow the dissolution of the Cu phase. The CuIr nanocrystals with an Ir-rich shell show high catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction.									28	1	0	0	1	0	28			1466-8033			WOS:000361139300007

Inspired by ferroalloy materials, it is speculated that the pore environment, framework charge, and catalytic properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) could be optimized dramatically via the introduction of ferroalloy-like inorganic building blocks. However, different to ferroalloy, the accurate integration of different metals into one MOF platform is still challenging. Herein, taking advantages of the good compatibility for metals in trigonal prismatic trinuclear cluster, a series of Fe-based alloy-like [M3O(O2C)(6)] motifs (M-3 = Fe-3, Fe-1.5 Ni-1.5, Fe1.5Co1.5, Fe1.5Ti1.5, FeCoNi, and FeTiCo) are successfully generated, which further lead to a robust Fe-MOF material family (SNNU-5s). These multicomponent MOFs not only provide a good chance to explore the impact of pore environment on gas adsorption/separation but also offer an opportunity to the efficient electrocatalytic reaction directly. Accordingly, compared with the SNNU-5-Fe parent structure, the pore characters of heterometallic SNNU-5 MOFs are clearly regulated by the type of alloy-like building blocks. SNNU-5-FeTi displays more superior gas separation performance for CO2/CH4, C2H2/CH4, C2H4/CH4, and C2H2/CO2 gas mixtures. What is more, benefited from the multimetallic active sites and their catalytic synergy, FeCoNi-ternary alloy-like cluster-based SNNU-5 MOF material exhibits an exceptional oxygen evolution reaction activity in aqueous solution at pH = 13, which delivers a low overpotential (eta(j=)(10) = 317 mV), a fast reaction kinetics (Tafel slope = 37 mV dec(-1)), and excellent catalytic stability. This facile multialloy-like building block strategy holds promise to accurately design and improve the performance of MOFs, as well as open an avenue to understand the related mechanisms.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000510532000025	31838854

Despite decades of effort, only a few inorganic catalysts are effective and even fewer are effective under visible light. Recently, attention has been paid to synthetic semiconducting polymers, mainly on graphitic C3N4, with encouraging hydrogen evolution performance but lower activity for water oxidation. Here, a highly ordered covalent triazine-based framework, CTF-1 (C8N2H4), is synthesised by a very mild microwave-assisted polymerisation approach. It demonstrates extremely high activity for oxygen evolution under visible light irradiation, leading to an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of nearly 4% at 420 nm. Furthermore, the polymer can also efficiently evolve H-2 from water. A high AQE of 6% at 420 nm for H-2 production has also been achieved. The polymer holds great potential for overall water splitting. This exceptional performance is attributed to its well-defined and ordered structure, low carbonisation, and superior band positions.									155	7	0	0	11	0	156			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000435351000024

Instead of operating both electrodes as hydrogen and oxygen electrodes respectively the electrodes are used as oxidation and reduction electrodes in both modes of operation. A more suitable selection of electrocatalysts and an improved cell design are possible; both can increase the efficiency of the cell considerably. New results on the electrocatalytic activity of various noble-metal containing catalysts with respect to both oxygen evolution and hydrogen oxidation in a proton exchange membrane-cell at 80-degrees-C are reported. Kinetic data derived from Tafel plots of the oxygen evolution polarization curves agree closely with those of experiments with aqueous sulphuric acid electrodes. This agreement allows the determination of kinetic parameters for electrocatalysts difficult to prepare in solid smooth electrodes but easy to be made into porous deposits. Polarization curves of the hydrogen oxidation reaction clearly indicate a relative activity rating of the studied catalysts. In cycling tests the lifetime stability of the new bifunctional oxidation electrode was determined. Polarization data obtained under these conditions agree with those obtained in earlier experiments where electrodes were exposed to only one type of oxidation reaction. During a test of 10 cycles (30 min of electrolyser and 30 min of fuel cell mode each) no changes in the electrode potential were observed. With the conventional cell design employing a hydrogen and an oxygen electrode both catalyzed with platinum and a current density of 100 mA cm-2 a storage efficiency of 50% was calculated; with the alternative concept of oxidation and reduction electrodes and selected oxidation catalysts this was improved to 57%. With further improvements these efficiencies seem possible even at current densities of 500 mA cm-2.									38	4	0	0	0	0	43			0021-891X			WOS:A1992KD37100009

The lack of grain boundaries in SrTaO2N porous single crystals (PSCs) enables fast photocarrier migration from bulk to the surface whilst the high porosity offers adequate accessible surface to perform photocatalytic reactions. In this work, we demonstrate a facile synthesis of SrTaO2N PSCs via a top-otactic conversion route. These SrTaO2N PSCs deliver exceptional activity and stability for photocatalytic O-2 production from water with a record-breaking apparent quantum efficiency as high as 17.9% at 420 +/- 20 nm. Overall water splitting with H-2/O-2 equals 2 has also been attained in a Z-scheme system employing SrTaO2N PSCs as the O-2-evolution moiety. These results signify a paradigm to improve photocatalytic performance based on PSCs, which extends the toolbox to achieve efficient solar water splitting over conventional photocatalysts.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000727738900002

Films were p-type semiconducting with a flat-band potential of approximately 0.30 V (Hg/HgO/1 mol dm(-3) KOH). The cyclic voltammogram between 0 and 0.65 V exhibited a pair of redox peaks (E(0) = 0.43 V) prior to the onset of O-2 evolution at the oxide film in 1 mol dm(-3) KOH. Among the oxide catalysts prepared, La0.7Sr0.3CoO3 was the most active electrocatalytically. The Tafel slope and the reaction order for electrolytic evolution of oxygen were found to be 65-72 mV decade(-1) and ca. 1, respectively. Strontium substitution for La in the mixed-oxide lattice enhanced the electrochemically active area; the effect being greatest with 0.3 mol strontium.									51	0	0	0	0	0	52			0956-5000			WOS:A1996UZ14800014

For the first time, we show that the spent catalyst can be used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for possible applications in the zinc-air battery because of its suitable structural and electronic properties. Detailed spectroscopic and microscopy characterization has revealed that it contains Ni nanoparticles along with multiwalled carbon nanotubes supported on porous alumina (NAlCNTs-750). The NAlCNTs-750 exhibits a low overpotential value of 370 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 119 mV dec(-1) towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). For the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the onset potential is found to be 0.82 V with a Tafel slope of 88 mV dec(-1). The chronoamperometry of NAlCNTs-750 exhibits good stability for 20 and 8 h towards the OER and ORR, respectively. Consequently, the NAlCNTs-750 employed in Zn-air batteries has displayed commendable charge-discharge performance up to 45 h with high reversibility. A careful electrochemical analysis of individual components reveals that the bifunctional nature of NAlCNTs-750 arises from Ni nanoparticles serving as active metal centers towards the OER and CNTs contributing to the ORR as well as facilitating low charge transfer resistance, whereas Al2O3 provides the required porous support. The spent catalysts from industry may realize the dream of achieving "today's waste is tomorrow's energy".									1	1	0	0	1	0	2			2398-4902			WOS:000626710500010

The catalytic activity of electrocatalysts could be optimized by reasonable electronic structure regulation and increasing active sites. Herein, we report the design and fabrication of Mo-doped nickel sulfide/hydroxide heterostructures (Mo-NiS/Ni(OH)(2)) as a multisite water splitting catalyst via straightforward solvothermal and in-situ growth strategy. Based on foreign metal doping and interface interaction, the electronic conductivity of heterostructures is improved and the charge transfer kinetics across the interface is promoted, which are demonstrated by the theoretical calculations. Mo-NiS/Ni(OH)(2) electrocatalyst is endowed with high electrocatalytic performance for water splitting and remarkable durability in alkaline electrolyte. It exhibits the low overpotential of 186 and 74 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively. Importantly, after continuously working for 50 h, the current densities of HER and OER both show negligible degeneration. Even, the resulting Mo-NiS/Ni(OH)(2) better catalyzes water splitting, yielding a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.5 V and outperforming Pt/C-IrO2 couple (1.53 V). This result demonstrates that transition metal doping and heterogeneous interface engineering are useful means for conventional catalyst design.									28	1	0	0	0	0	28			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000653620900004

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been intensively employed as the templates/precursors to synthesize catalysts with hollow structures for various energy-related applications. In this study, using MOF (Ni-Fe prussian-blue-analog) as a template and precursor, a novel and promising bimetallic phosphide catalyst (Ni0.62Fe0.38)(2)P was obtained. Benefiting from synergistic effect between the Ni and Fe species, well-defined architecture and high surface area the as-made (Ni0.62Fe0.38)(2)P hollow nanocubes show a remarkable electrocatalytic performance for the OER in 1 M KOH electrolyte with a low overpotential of only 290 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 44 mV per decade, which even surpass the benchmark IrO2 catalyst. Moreover, the (Ni0.62Fe0.38)(2)P hollow nanocubes exhibit good long-term stability. This facile and novel route to prepare bimetallic phosphide hollow nanocubes as active OER catalysts broadens the scope for designing other noble-metal-free OER efficient catalysts for electrochemical water splitting in the future.									102	7	0	0	6	0	106			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000399421800012

Generalized Koopmans' theorem is applied to predict the vertical detachment energies and simulate the photoelectron spectra. Large highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gaps are observed for these two stoichiometric M4O10 clusters and estimated to be 3.98 and 4.38 eV for M = Nb and Ta, respectively. The M4O10-/0 (M = Nb, Ta) clusters are polyhedral cage structures with high symmetry (Td for the neutral and D2d for the anion) in which each metal atom joints three bridging and one terminal O atoms. For the Nb oxide species, Nb4O8-/0 and Nb4O9-/0 can be viewed as removing two and one terminal O atoms from Nb4O10-/0, respectively. The Ta species follow the same rule to the Nb species, except that the anionic Ta4O8- is formed by removing one terminal and one bridging O atoms from Ta4O10-. The Ta4O9 containing a localized Ta3+ site can readily react with O2 to form the Ta4O11 which can also be viewed as replacing a terminal oxygen atom in Ta4O10 by a peroxo O2 unit, whereas the added oxygen atom is found to be a bridging one in the O-rich clusters Nb4O11-/0 and the anionic Ta4O11-. Molecular orbital analyses are performed to analyze the chemical bonding in the tetra-nuclear metal oxide clusters and to elucidate their structural and electronic evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1432-881X			INSPEC:14731229

The analysis is not restricted to near Chapman-Jouguet detonation speeds and is capable of predicting quasi-steady, normal detonation shock speed versus curvature (D-kappa) curves with multiple turning points. An evolution equation that retains the shock acceleration, D, namely a D-D-kappa relation is rationally derived which describes the dynamics of pre-existing detonation waves. The solutions of the equation for spherical detonation are shown to reproduce the ignition/failure phenomenon observed in both numerical simulations of blast wave initiation and in experiments. A single-step chemical reaction described by one progress variable is employed, but the kinetics is sufficiently general and is not restricted to Arrhenius form, although most specific calculations are performed for Arrhenius kinetics. As an example, we calculate critical energies of direct initiation for hydrogen-oxygen mixtures and find close agreement with available experimental data.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0022-1120	1469-7645		WOS:000227787000007

By virtue of the sensitivity of soft X-ray to the transition-metal 3d states and oxygen 2p states, evolutions of Ni, Mn, and O in LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 are compared between the two batches of electrodes. In the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 with fast capacity fading, Mn2+ is evidently observed in the initial charge cycle. Strikingly, the Mn2+ content is notably high at the fully charged state. This sharply contradicts the conventional wisdom that Mn2+ evolves from a disproportional reaction favored in the discharged state. Additionally, the shallow probe depth of soft X-ray spectroscopy enables another finding that Mn2+ manifests itself mostly on the side of the electrode facing separator. Our comparative study provides direct experimental evidence on the association between Mn2+ and performance failure. It strongly suggests that Mn2+ formation is mostly determined by electrode-electrolyte surface reactions, instead of disproportional reactions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, a facile electrospinning followed by a post-carbonization treatment to synthesize nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs) integrated with Ni and Mo2C nanoparticles (Ni/Mo2C-NCNFs) as water splitting electrocatalysts is developed. Owing to the strong hydrogen binding energy on Mo2C and high electrical conductivity of Ni, synergetic effect between Ni and Mo2C nanoparticles significantly promote both HER and OER activities. The optimized hybrid (Ni/Mo2C(1:2)-NCNFs) delivers low overpotentials of 143 mV for HER and 288 mV for OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). An alkaline electrolyzer with Ni/Mo2C(1:2)-NCNFs as catalysts for both anode and cathode exhibits a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.64 V, which is only 0.07 V larger than the benchmark of Pt/C-RuO2 electrodes. In addition, an outstanding long-term durability during 100 h testing without obvious degradation is achieved, which is superior to most of the noble-metal-free electrocatalysts reported to date. This work provides a simple and effective approach for the preparation of low-cost and high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts for efficient overall water splitting.									289	15	0	0	14	0	290			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000461062900004

Results showed that the reaction temperature possessed a more prominent impact on the corrosion behaviors of the EBCs. The Yb2SiO5 top layer dissolved into CMAS melts and reprecipitated garnet and fine apatite particles, while the Yb2Si2O7 interlayer formed coarse apatite particles, which accelerated the corrosion reaction. The Yb2SiO5 top layer showed better corrosion resistance, which was related to the more stable crystal structure, less oxygen vacancies and easier formation of garnet.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:000781359100002

One approach to better understand the role of Fe, and enable the design of catalysts with higher activities, is to find other cations that behave similarly and compare the common chemical features between them. Here we evaluate the effects of La, Mn, Ce, and Ti incorporation on the OER activity and redox behavior of NiOxHy in rigorously Fe -free alkaline solution using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical quartz-crystal microgravimetry. We use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry to confirm that measurements are free from relevant levels of trace Fe contamination. We find that only Ce leads to increased activity in NiOxHy (about a factor of 10 enhancement), but this effect is transient, likely due to phase separation. We further find no clear correlation between activity and the nominal Ni2+/34 redox potential, suggesting that the "oxidizing" power of the Ni is not directly correlated with the OER activity. These findings suggest a uniqueness to Fe and are consistent with it being the active site in Ni(Fe)OxHy									166	6	0	0	9	0	168			2155-5435			WOS:000373524400032		
J	WATANABE, H; NAGOSHI, T; INABA, H								LUMINESCENCE OF A BACTERIAL LUCIFERASE INTERMEDIATE BY REACTION WITH H2O2 - THE EVOLUTIONARY ORIGIN OF LUCIFERASE AND SOURCE OF ENDOGENOUS LIGHT-EMISSION								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA				1141	2-3			297	302		10.1016/0005-2728(93)90056-L				MAR 1 1993	1993	The bacterial luciferase reaction was shown to emit light in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) instead of aldehyde. Although the light intensity was weaker than that with an aldehyde, the bioluminescence emission spectrum of the luciferase reaction (lambda(max) 495 nm) with H2O2 closely agreed with that using a long chain aliphatic aldehyde (decanal). It was also found that the chemiluminescence of reduced or unreduced FMN with H2O2 was enhanced by peroxidase. Light emission in the luciferase reaction with H2O2 is attributed to a catalase-like reaction, in which the abstraction of one atom of oxygen from intermediate II (luciferase-bound FMNH-OOH) by H2O2 leads to the formation of excited hydroxide (E-FMNH-OH*), H2O and O2. Since H2O2 is formed in the spontaneous breakdown of intermediate II in the absence of aldehyde, the reaction of this H2O2 with intermediate II can explain the origin of endogenous (non aldehyde) light emission. In the presence of luciferase, intermediate II can be formed both from FMNH2 and oxygen, and by the reaction of H2O2 with FMN. The functional origin of the bacterial luciferase is postulated to be a FMN-dependent non-heme catalase which scavenges H2O2, concomitant with weak light emission. Prior to the association of luciferase genes (lux AB) with the aldehyde synthesis genes (lux CDE), forming the lux operon in luminous bacteria, the genes may have been expressed independently such that the bacteria lacked a high level of light emission.									16	0	2	0	13	0	18			0006-3002			WOS:A1993KQ14000019

Herein, a sandwich-like MnCo2O4 modifying PbO2 composite electrode was fabricated via chemical-bath-deposition and electrodeposition. Consequently, the synthesized PbO2 electrode exhibits low Tafel slope of 0.17 V per decade and an operating potential of 1.68 V vs. SCE for 500 A m(-2) in a simulated solution containing 150 g L-1 H2SO4 and 50 g L-1 Zn2+. Compared with traditional Pb-0.76Ag alloy, the overpotential at 500 A m(-2) decreased by 357 mV, which ascribe to the incorporation of MnCo2O4 minoring crystal grain size and charge transfer resistance and enlarging active surface area. Furthermore, the composite electrode shows robust durability as long as 95 h at 15,000 A m(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Hence, this study offers a facile synthesis route to prepare composite electrodes for zinc electrowinning and provides deep insight into the relationship among modifying substances, microstructures, and electrocatalytic activity.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000661845500002

A model is proposed that describes this process in terms of the ultraviolet-induced removal of hydrogen and hydrocarbon components from the surface of the pores and the formation of stable oxygen bonds. A calculation has been carried out to determine the numerical values of the rate constants of these photochemical reactions, and their activation energies are determined. It is shown that the increase in the photoluminescence of porous silicon is athermal.									5	0	0		0	0	5			1063-7850			INSPEC:5324558

Herein, a kinetically controlled room-temperature coprecipitation is developed as a general strategy to produce a variety of sandwich-type metal hydroxide/graphene composites. Specifically, well-defined a-phase nickel cobalt hydroxide nanosheets are vertically assembled on the entire graphene surface (NiCo-HS@G) to provide plenty of accessible active sites and enable facile gas escaping. The tight contact between NiCo-HS and graphene promises effective electron transfer and remarkable durability. It is discovered that Ni doping adjusts the nanosheet morphology to augment active sites and effectively modulates the electronic structure of Co center to favor the adsorption of oxygen species. Consequently, NiCo-HS@G exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity and durability for OER with a very low overpotential of 259 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, a practical water electrolyzer demonstrates a small cell voltage of 1.51 V to stably achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and 1.68 V to 50 mA cm(-2). Such superior electrocatalytic performance indicates that this facile and manageable strategy with low energy consumption may open up opportunities for the cost-effective mass production of various metal hydroxides/graphene nanocomposites with desirable morphology and competing performance for diverse applications.									69	4	0	0	3	0	70			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000419866000012

However, their design and synthesis are challenging as they need to satisfy the increasing demands, low cost, and enhanced catalytic performance with high efficiency to effectively replace Pt-based materials. This work reports the enhanced catalytic efficiencies of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in the presence of nitrogen-doped graphene oxide dots (NGODs) for hydrogen evolution in a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte with a Tafel slope of 87 mV dec(-1) and an overpotential of 145 mV vs RHE at 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, the hybrid structure reveals the complete removal of organic pollutants with higher catalytic efficiencies as compared to Pt, Pd, and Rh hybrid catalysts. DFT calculations demonstrate that the observed high catalytic activity originates from the oxygen-containing groups present on NGODs and AuNPs. This study may open new avenues for developing scalable and economically viable hybrid systems.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3				2574-0970		WOS:000752894100012

Electrolyzing water is one of the carbon free technologies for hydrogen production, which is limited by the sluggish kinetics of the half reaction of the anode - the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, a self-supported Cu3P nanowire (Cu3P NWs/CF) electrode is prepared by electrodeposition of a Cu(OH)(2) nanowire precursor on conductive Cu foam (Cu(OH)(2) NWs/CF) with a subsequent phosphating procedure under a N-2 atmosphere. When used as an OER working electrode in 1.0 M KOH solution at room temperature, Cu3P NWs/CF exhibits excellent catalytic performance with an overpotential of 327 mV that delivers a current density of 20 mA cm(-2). Notably, it can run stably for 22 h at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) without obvious performance degradation. This highly efficient and stable OER catalytic performance is mainly attributed to the unique nanostructure and stable electrode construction. Interestingly, this synthesis strategy has been proved to be feasible to prepare large-area working electrodes (e.g. 40 cm(-2)) with unique nanowire structure. Therefore, this work has provided a good paradigm for the mass fabrication of self-supporting non-noble metal OER catalysts and effectively promoted the reaction kinetics of the anode of the electrolyzing water reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000709445700001	35497269

As for overall water splitting (OWS), when the current density is 10 mA cm(-2), the required voltage is only 1.46 V. Meanwhile, it exhibits a large current density property and long-time stability (>60 h current-time tests) for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In order to reach the current densities of 100 and 1000 mA cm(-2), Sn-Ni3S2/NF needs overpotentials of 0.17 and 0.57 V for HER, and 0.27 and 0.58 V for OER, respectively. The water-splitting property of Sn-Ni3S2/NF is much better than that of pure Ni3S2/NF or even 20 wt % Pt/C/NF and RuO2/NF. Furthermore, Sn-Ni3S2/NF showed a higher turnover frequency at different potentials, with similar to 100% Faraday efficiency for both O-2 and H-2. The improved activity of Sn-Ni3S2/NF activity for water-splitting is attributed to the doping of Sn, which enhanced the intrinsic activity of Sn-Ni3S2/NF for OWS. This article not only provides a new efficient and stable catalyst for OWS, but also proposes an interface design principle for NF-based high-performance water splitting materials.									69	4	0	0	5	0	70			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000451932800022	30378420

Herein, we report a novel three-dimensional replication strategy to fabricate three-dimensional architecture of porous carbon for oxygen electrodes in lithium-oxygen batteries. As a demonstration, ball-flower-like carbon microspheres assembled with tortuous hollow carbon nanosheets are successfully prepared by completely replicating the morphology of the nanostructured zinc oxide template and utilizing the polydopamine coating layer as the carbon source. When used as the active material for oxygen electrodes, the three-dimensional porous architecture of the prepared ball-flower-like carbon microspheres can accommodate the discharge product lithium peroxide and simultaneously maintain the ions and gas diffusion paths. Moreover, their high degrees of defectiveness by nitrogen doping provide sufficient active sites for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. Thus the prepared ball-flower-like carbon microspheres demonstrate a high capacity of 9,163.7 mA h g(-1) and excellent reversibility. This work presents an effective way to prepare three-dimensional architectures of porous carbon by replicating the controllable nanostructures of transition metal oxide templates for energy storage and conversion applications.									7	3	0	0	0	0	7			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000461366000003

Benefiting from their diversified spatial structure and controllable chemical constituents, they have become a research hotspot in the field of electrocatalytic water splitting. Herein, Fe2Ni-MIL-88B MOF on nickel foam (Fe2Ni MOF/NF) has been prepared through a one-pot method growth process. Compared with Fe MOF/NF and Ni MOF/NF, the interaction between Fe3+ and Ni2+ in Fe2Ni MOF/NF accelerates the electron transfer through the oxygen of the ligand, leading to increased 3d orbital electron density of Ni, which enhances the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution. Fe2Ni MOF/NF provides a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 222 mV, and its Tafel slope is also very small, reaching 42.39 mV dec(-1). The success of the present Fe2Ni MOF/NF catalyst is attributed to the abundant active centers, the bimetallic clusters Fe2Ni-MIL-88B, the positive coupling effect between Ni and Fe metal ions in the MOF, and synergistic effect between the MOF and NF. Besides, Fe2Ni MOF/NF possesses excellent stability over 50 h of continuous operation, providing feasibility for commercial use.									25	3	0	0	1	0	26				2046-2069		WOS:000496135200065	35529117

However, saturated coverage of iron sites on substrate and dynamic deposition control are rarely reported. Herein, bi-metal dynamic balances are analyzed in depth based on interface of double-layer hollow metal-organic framework (MOF). The newly designed catalyst undergoes an accelerated deposition and saturation coverage of Fe ions via controlling the concentration of Fe(III) in electrolyte, as well as electron holes and active host. Importantly, the balance of iron dissolution and redeposition (main cycle) and the oxidation-reduction equilibrium of cobalt ions (by-cycle) are proposed, and also mechanism of their synergistic effect to improve the efficiency of OER is revealed. Furthermore, the formation mechanism of double-layer hollow cage is studied by time-dependent evolution process. This study may inspire a better catalyst system for OER in alkaline medium and further design on complex structured MOFs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2542-5293			WOS:000854962400004

Our GCP-K formulation arises naturally from minimizing the free energy using a Legendre transform relating the net charge of the system and the applied voltage. Performing this macroscopic transformation explicitly allows us to make the connection of GCP-K to the traditional Butler-Volmer kinetics. Using this GCP-K based free energy, we show how to predict both the potential and pH dependent chemistry for a specific example, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at a sulfur vacancy on the basal plane of MoS2. We find that the rate-determining steps in both acidic and basic conditions are the Volmer reaction in which the second hydrogen atom is adsorbed from the solution. Using the GCP-K formulation, we show that the stretched bond distances change continuously as a function of the applied potential. This shows that the main reason for the higher activity in basic conditions is that the transition state is closer to the product, which leads to a more favorable Tafel slope of 60 mV/dec. In contrast if the transition state were closer to the reactant, where the transfer coefficient is less than 0.5 we would obtain a Tafel slope of almost 150 mV/dec. Based on this detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism, we conclude that the second hydrogen at the chalcogenide vacant site is the most active toward the hydrogen evolution reaction. Using this as a descriptor, we compare it to the other 2H group VI metal dichalcogenides and predict that vacancies on MoTe2 will have the best performance toward HER.									68	1	0	0	7	0	68			0002-7863			WOS:000452693800051	30406657

However, layered transition-metal oxides exhibit structural degradation such as cation migration, layer exfoliation or cracks upon deep charge, which is a major obstacle to achieve higher energy-density batteries. Here we demonstrate a self-repairing phenomenon of stacking faults upon desodiation from an oxygen-redox layered oxide Na2RuO3, realizing much better reversibility of the electrode reaction. The phase transformations upon charging A(2)MO(3) (A: alkali metal) can be dominated by three-dimensional Coulombic attractive interactions driven by the existence of ordered alkali-metal vacancies, leading to counterintuitive self-repairing of stacking faults and progressive ordering upon charging. The cooperatively ordered vacancy in lithium-/sodium-rich layered transition-metal oxides is shown to play an essential role, not only in generating the electro-active nonbonding 2p orbital of neighbouring oxygen but also in stabilizing the phase transformation for highly reversible oxygen-redox reactions.									42	1	0	0	2	0	42			2041-1723			WOS:000468023600009	31097700

However, the efficient realization of large-scale water splitting is severely hampered by the sluggish hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER). As an important class of functional materials, complex hollow electrocatalysts provide promising solutions to accelerate the HER/OER kinetics owing to their advantageous features, such as abundant exposed active sites, increased contact area between catalysts and electrolyte, and shortened mass/charge transport length. Herein, the recent advances in the development of complex hollow electrocatalysts and their outstanding performances in water splitting are summarized. Beginning with the introduction of reaction mechanisms and design principles, achievements in engineering complex hollow HER/OER electrocatalysts are highlighted with the focus on structural modulation, composition control, and electrocatalytic evaluation. Finally, some present challenges and future perspectives for advanced complex hollow electrocatalysts toward water splitting are further discussed.									35	0	0	0	2	0	35			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000711750100001

Composites comprising a triplet sensitizer (Pt(ii) octaethylporphyrin; PtOEP) and a singlet emitter (9,10-diphenylanthracene; DPA) intercalated in a layered clay compound (montmorillonite or saponite) were prepared using a facile but versatile solvothermal method. These composites were capable of converting green incident light (lambda = 535 nm) to blue light (lambda = 430 nm) even in air. The host layered clay as well as the co-intercalated surfactant evidently functioned as barriers against water and oxygen to prevent the quenching of the active compounds. The TTA upconversion driven photocatalytic oxygen evolution using the aqueous mixture of the dyes-clay composite and particulate photocatalysts can be a potential approach to eliminate the undesired optical losses and thus be a breakthrough for future industrial and large-scale installation in an inexpensive manner.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000627550700053	33657196

Despite its early use as a hydrogen-evolution catalyst in alkaline electrolysis, steel was until very recently supposed to be neither an active and stable water-splitting catalyst nor an interesting scientific subject at all. The authors of this contribution not only have shown in recent papers the potential of steel in terms of pure material properties but also have revealed the qualities of steel as a striking scientific topic. They herewith review what is known about the water-splitting properties of untreated and surface modified steel and try to determine a potential transfer to a broader application of modified steels in heterogeneous catalysis. The synopsis is basically limited to the usage of steel as a real electrocatalyst, thus presenting the catalytic active species itself.									88	1	0	0	2	1	90			2380-8195			WOS:000427444300013

However, the pure phase ZnO is rarely used in degradation of refractory pollutants and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution due to its poor photoredox ability. In this study, we develop a novel surface atom regulation strategy using fructose molecules containing hydroxyl groups to improve photo-oxidation ability of ZnO. Interestingly, the fructose-regulated ZnO nanosheets with oxygen vacancies exhibit more positive surface valence band maximum than that of pristine ZnO. The photogenerated holes with strong oxidation capacity can be formed on the fructose-regulated ZnO nanosheets. The fructose-regulated ZnO nanosheets can rapidly degrade high concentration of phenol and other organic pollutants, which is difficultly achieved by the pristine ZnO nanosheets. In addition, photocatalytic H2 production activity is also found on our pure phase ZnO. This work provides a new design strategy for modifying the surface structure of photocatalysts to improve photocatalytic performance.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000640980100002

Bimetallic phosphides show great potential for the bifunctional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts due to the excellent catalytic performance. Herein, the CoFeP two-dimensional nanoarrays successfully grown on nitrogen doped electrospun carbon nanofibers (CoFeP NS@NCNF) through template-directed growth and following phosphorization treatment. Benefiting from the hierarchical nanoarrays structure, synergistic effect of high electrical conductivity carbon nanofiber substrate and bimetallic phosphide, the CoFeP NS@NCNF exhibits efficient bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for OER and HER in 1 M KOH with overpotentials of 268 mV (eta(20)) and 113 mV (eta(10)), respectively. Moreover, the CoFeP NS@NCNF coupled two-electrode system needs a low voltage of 1.59 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting. This work provides a promising way for the preparation of transition metal-based electrocatalysts with hierarchical structure derived from Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) for OER and HER.

Herein, a flower-like Co9S8@MoS2 heterostructure with effective bifunctional activity was achieved using a one-pot approach via the hydrothermal treatment of metal-coordinated species followed by pyrolysis under an N-2 atmosphere. The heterostructures exhibited a 3D interconnected network with a large electrochemical active surface area and a junctional complex with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic activity of MoS2 and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity of Co9S8, exhibiting low overpotentials of 295 and 103 mV for OER and HER at 10 mA cm(-2) current density, respectively. Additionally, the catalyst-assembled electrolyser provided favourable catalytic activity and strong durability for overall water splitting in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The results of the study highlight the importance of structural engineering for the design and preparation of cost-effective and efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000840462700001	36106009

Both CV and Tafel studies revealed that the electrodes from the coating solutions with 60 and 20 mol % Pt content possessed the maximum apparent activity for OER and optimal apparent activity for CER/hypochlorite production, respectively. The specific activity (i/q*) revealed that mixing of the RuO2 and PtOx had no synergistic effects for OER due to the occurrence of phase segregation, which was revealed by element mapping/surface morphologies and Auger electron spectroscopy. Lower current efficiencies for hypochlorite production were found on the freshly prepared binary electrodes (type I electrodes) than on those having been treated by repetitive CVs (type II electrodes). Stability testing of both type I and II electrodes was measured in 0.5 M NaCl solution at 300 mA cm(-2) for 480 h, indicating that both type I and II electrodes are quite stable under the above conditions.									46	2	0	0	2	0	46			0021-891X			WOS:A1996TU75000010

In this work, a noble-metal-free co-catalyst CuNi alloy nanoparticle wrapped in a carbon layer containing oxygen-containing functional groups (CuNi@C=O) was designed and synthesized. Under visible light irradiation, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of CuNi@C=O/g-C3N4 was 2.36 mmol g-1 h-1, which was higher than that of Pt co-catalyst at the same conditions. Density functional theory calculations and mechanistic studies indicate that the H adsorption free energy on the CuNi@C=O was more suitable for hydrogen evolution than that of Pt, where the C=O groups on the carbon layer surface modulated the work function of CuNi alloy. It is believed that the understanding the function of surface C=O group can broaden the research directions of photocatalyst modification and improve the activity of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.									25	1	0	0	6	0	25			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663286400002

Surface layer evolutions of pre-oxidised Fe-30Cr alloy induced by gaseous KCl								CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				46	4			499	504		10.1179/147842209X12559428167481				JUN 2011	2011	This study reports on the evolutions of surface structure and composition of Fe-30Cr alloys that were first oxidised in oxygen atmosphere then followed by an exposure in gaseous KCl environment. After the pre-oxidation treatment at 800 degrees C for 10 h, a continuous, dense and protective chromia scale was produced. During the following exposure in KCl contaminated atmospheres at 650 degrees C, the surface chromia layer was gradually transformed into worm-like potassium chromate textures, which quickly coalesced on the substrate surface along with simultaneous volatility. The protective oxide layer was then severely deteriorated by enhancing cracking, spallation, volatility and porosity. Voluminous iron migrated outward through these defective sites and iron oxide became the dominating reaction products. Both chromate and residual chromia were finally incorporated into the thick and porous iron oxide scale. This process accounts for the major catastrophic destruction of chromia forming materials involving reactions with alkali chloride salts, even at minor amounts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1478-422X	1743-2782		WOS:000292600000030

Previous reports on Co-vanadates ascribed activity differences to optimal metal-oxygen bond strength. In contrast, we found etching of vanadate from precatalyst during electrochemical activation to be the primary contributor. The resulting higher surface reconstruction exposes a higher number of catalytically active cobalt sites that otherwise lay inactive due to their position in bulk. Co-vanadates with polymeric vanadates (CoV2O6) showed better OER over monomeric orthovana-dates (Co3V2O8) due to higher vanadate etching. Further, this work validates that etching can happen even from lattice positions, where bonding between constituents is strong.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000669533800003

Herein, theelectrocatalytic performance of transition metal (TM) atoms supported on a SnS2monolayer was investigated usingfirst-principlesmethods based on density functional theory in the present work. Our results reveal that TM atoms supported on the surface of theSnS2monolayer can effectively improve the catalytic performance of SnS2for OER and ORR. Interestingly, the OER/ORRoverpotentials of Ni/SnS2and Pt/SnS2are estimated to be 0.38/0.62 and 0.37/0.58 V, respectively, showing promising catalyticperformance. Moreover, the volcano plots also evince that the efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for OER/ORR are SnS2monolayer-supported Ni or Pt atoms.

The obtained Ru/Nb2CO2 catalyst mainly undergoes electroreduction of nitrogen that proceeds via an enzymatic hybrid mechanism due to high selectivity (99.9%) and low Delta G(PDS) (Delta G(PDS) = 0.59 eV), and the catalyst also has superior stability at 500 K, suggesting Ru/Nb2CO2 has high promising performance for electrocatalytic synthesis of ammonia.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000674871100016

Unfortunately, the active sites of electrocatalysts for the acidic OER, which are the most powerful tool for designing and optimizing OER electrocatalysts, still remain ambiguous. Herein, we synthesize Ag doped Co3O4 with different atomic ratios of Co2+/Co3+ and investigate the effect of preferential exposure of Co2+ in Co3O4 on the acidic OER through systematic experiments for the first time. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is used to probe the atomic ratio of Co2+/Co3+ on the surface of Co3O4. The results demonstrate that Co3O4 richer in Co2+ shows the best acidic OER performance, and affords a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 470 mV along with having a satisfactory stability in H2SO4 solution. Moreover, low-temperature calcination treatment is found to be an effective method to aid preferential growth of Co2+ on the surface of Co3O4, further making our synthesis process more practical and universal. Therefore, this work provides some insight into designing non-precious electrocatalysts for the acidic OER, by identifying active sites and offering a versatile modulation strategy on the preferential growth of real active sites.									86	1	0	0	4	0	87			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431506600024

As expected, the lattices of the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode and the Li4Ti5O12 anode in the cell are found to simultaneously contract during charging and expand during discharging. It is found that for the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode a solid-solution reaction is associated with the lattice change and the Ni2+/Ni3+ redox couple between 3.06 and 3.16 V (vs. Li4Ti5O12), and a two-phase reaction between LixNi0.5Mn1.5O4 and Ni0.25Mn0.75O2 is corresponding to the Ni3+/Ni4+ redox couple at voltage higher than 3.22 V (vs. Li4Ti5O12) without a corresponding change in lattice. The oxidation states of the metals in the electrodes are determined by tracking the associated change in the oxygen position. In addition, the Ti oxidation state is correlated to the intensity of the Li4Ti5O12 222 reflection at the anode, and the determined oxidation state of the Ni is correlated to the lithium occupancy within the cathode. Furthermore, the small volume changes of the cathode and the anode upon cycling suggest that the cell chemistry is favorable for practical applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a series of component-controllable CC/CNTs@CoSxSe2(1-x) (CC: carbon cloth, CNT: carbon nanotube) with excellent bifunctional properties in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were obtained by chemical vapor deposition. In this strategy, the Zif-67 precursor served as a structural inducer, which was directly grown on CC and pyrolyzed with the assistance of melamine to form multi-walled CNT-encapsulated CoSxSe2(1-x) hierarchical nanostructures. Subsequently, the electrocatalytic properties of the as-prepared materials were optimized by adjusting the S/Se molar ratio. Of note is that the lattice distortion caused by the different radii of Se and S generated a polarized electric field for easy adsorption of the intermediate products. The CoOOH generated in situ on the surface of CoSxSe2(1-x), as well as n- and p-type domains in carbon, synergistically resulted in abundant active sites to boost the electrocatalytic activity. CC/CNTs@CoS0.74Se0.52 exhibited overpotentials for the HER and OER of 225 and 285 mV, respectively and attained a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution. The as-prepared electrocatalysts could act as both cathode and anode in a water electrolyzer showing a cell voltage of 1.74 V and delivering 10 mA cm(-2), comparable to those of noble-metal-based water electrolyzers.									37	3	0	0	0	0	37			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000476080900001	31228339

Herein, we report an industrially scalable, dipcoating method for the fabrication of 3D electrodes using Co and Ni thiolate hybrid inks. The solventless thermolysis of Co hexadecane thiolate in Ni butane thiolate (4:1) mixture results in 2D nanoplates of Ni-Co oxide (NCO) with spinel structure and superparamagnetic nature. The NCO acts as an electrocatalyst exhibiting excellent OER performance in alkaline media with low overpotential values of 310 mV and long-term stability. XPS studies reveal that Ni3+ and Co3+ species on the surface of NCO-20 nanoplates enhance the OER activity.

Nickel/nickel oxide@3dimensional hierarchical porous graphene (Ni-NiO@3DHPG) and cobalt/cobalt oxide@3dimensional hierarchical porous graphene (Co-CoO@3DHPG) electrocatalysts were obtained from cation exchange resin, nickel acetate and cobalt nitrate as a source of carbon, Ni and Co respectively. In Ni-NiO@3DHPG and CoCoO@3DHPG, metal and metal oxide nanoparticles embedded in the graphene layers, were confirmed by different techniques. The 3-D graphene in Ni-NiO@3DHPG and Co-CoO@3DHPG were thinned wall and highly porous structure and large specific surface area. The Ni-NiO@3DHPG composite displays onset potential, overpotential (10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel value of are 1.53 V, 1.64 V and 55 mV dec(-1) for OER and -0.18 V, -0.31 V and 78 mV dec(-1) for HER respectively. Similarly, Co-CoO@3DHPG catalyst show onset potential, overpotential (10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel are 1.59 V, 1.68 V and 65 mV dec(-1) for OER and -0.26 V, -0.40 V and 85 mV dec(-1) for HER respectively. Electrocatalysts show good stability after 4 h continuously. This simple synthetic method will open a new way for cheap and efficient electrocatalysts of other types of non-precious metals for OER and HER.

Moreover, for commercialization, fabricating cost-efficient, earth-abundant electrocatalysts with superior characteristics is of urgent need. Towards this endeavor, we report the synthesis of PANI-MnMoO4 nanocomposites using a hydrothermal approach and an in situ polymerization method with various concentrations of MnMoO4. The fabricated nanocomposite electrocatalyst exhibits bifunctional electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at a lower overpotential of 410 mV at 30 mA cm(-2) and 155 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively in an alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, while showing overall water splitting (OWS) performance, the optimized PM-10 (PANI-MnMoO4) electrode reveals the most outstanding OWS performance with a lower cell voltage of 1.65 V (vs. RHE) at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) with an excellent long-term cell resilience of 24 h.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000775141400001	35352748

In consideration of the OER activity of iron/cobalt oxides and the superior electroconductivity/propitious H atom binding energy of metallic iron/cobalt, bifunctional electrodeposited-film electrode CFeCoP composed of CoFe and CoFePxOy(OH)z was prepared from the irreversible cathodic deposition of FeSO4 and CoSO4 on the surface of a graphite plate in 1 M phosphate buffer (pH = 7). The as-prepared CFeCoP electrode exhibits excellent HER activity (specific activity (j,) = 0.169 mA/cm(2)) with low charge transfer resistance (4.5 52.) and an overpotential of 57 mV, achieving a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), and it also shows OER activity (j, = 1.316 mA/cm(2)) with low charge-transfer resistance (7.8 n) and 282 mV of overpotential, approaching a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in a 1 M NaOH aqueous solution. In addition, the CFeCoP electrode displays long-term stability (139 h) for both HER and OER activity with a stable current density. In the whole cell, the CFeCoP CFeCoP electrode-pair setting achieves a current density of 10 mA/cm2 at a voltage of 1.56 V (Tafel slope of 51 mV/dec), close to those (10 mA/cm(2) at a voltage of 1.58 V (Tafel slope of 68 mV/dec)) of the Pt IrO2 electrode-pair device in a 1 M NaOH aqueous solution. On the basis of XPS, SEM-EDX, and pXRD, the fabric of metallic iron/cobalt buried in a metal-oxide matrix and iron/cobalt (oxy)hydroxides embedded in a metal-oxide matrix as films on the graphite surface for the CFeCoP electrode implies that the electrodeposition-derived film mainly made up of. FeCo and FeCoP,Oy(OH)., may mediate the kinetics that occurs at the catalyst electrolyte interface and displays stability/intrinsic catalytic activity for overall water splitting.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2574-0962			WOS:000458706600023

Herein, three-dimensional (3D) Ni2P nanosheet arrays were fabricated and simultaneously modulated by heterostructure engineering and Mn doping (Mn-doped Ni2O3/Ni2P and Mn-doped NixSy/Ni2P) via a facile hydrothermal reaction and subsequent phosphorization and sulfurization. Due to the Mn doping, synergistic effect in the heterostructures, and abundantly exposed active sites from the 3D-nanosheet arrays, Mn-doped Ni2O3/Ni2P and Mn-doped NixSy/Ni2P exhibit excellent properties for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. The former achieves an excellent current density of -10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 104 mV for HER, while the latter attains 100 mA cm(-2) for OER at an ultralow overpotential of 290 mV and exhibits superior stability at 50 mA cm(-2) for 160 h. Impressively, the Mn-doped Ni2O3/Ni2P//Mn-doped NixSy/Ni2P couple show high overall-water-splitting activity with a cell voltage of 1.65 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and outstanding durability at 50 mA cm(-2) for 120 h in an alkaline electrolyzer. This work presents an effective strategy to design and synthesize low-cost and highly active non-noble metal electrocatalysts for overall water splitting through the simultaneous application of heterostructure engineering, foreign-metal-atom doping, and a 3D-nanoarray structure. The strategy brings a paradigm shift toward the mass production of low-cost non-noble metal electrocatalysts for renewable energy devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000768614300002

Further insights into the formation and modification of carbonatites are provided using carbon, oxygen and clumped isotope (Delta(47)) data of rocks from spatially associated Amba Dongar and Siriwasan alkaline complexes in the north-western Deccan igneous province, India. We derive apparent equilibrium blocking temperatures to help constrain the thermal evolution of the different rock types found within the alkaline complexes in a petrographic context. The apparent temperatures for the carbonatites are significantly low but are consistent with reports on other global carbonatites and model predictions. Rapidly cooled Oldoinyo Lengai natrocarbonatite yielded similar low temperatures, even in the absence of bulk isotopic alteration. The isotopic proxies and petrographic observations favour both isotopic exchange reactions and diagenesis in altering Delta(47) values in calciocarbonatites. Diagenetic reactions are however strongly favoured, as secondary calcites in nephelinites and ferrocarbonatites record much lower temperatures than in the calciocarbonatites, highlighting the effect of fluids and diagenetic reactions in C-13-O-18 bond ordering in carbonatites. Variations in the C-O isotope data reveal the coupling of fractional crystallisation and post-magmatic fluid-rock interactions on bulk rock composition. After emplacement, the resetting of clumped isotope signatures in carbonatites is facilitated by post-magmatic processes in both open and closed systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, a 2D self-supporting bifunctional electrode with excellent stability was designed to efficiently produce hydrogen. Specifically, TiO2 nanorods supported on corrosion-resistant Ti plate (Ti/TiO2) was firstly prepared by one-step alkaline etching and then cellular NiBx catalytic materials were gently modified on Ti/TiO2 by simple electroless plating to obtain Ti/TiO2@NiBx self-supporting electrode. The photoelectrocatalytic performance of the highly-active electrode during Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and overall seawater splitting at 10 mA cm(-2) were increased by 16.2%, 14.7% and 4.4%, respectively. In the meantime, Ti/TiO2@NiBx continuously electrolyzed over 72 h during HER at the industrial-grade current density (500 mA cm(-2)) due to the high corrosion resistance of TiO2, the increased specific surface area originated from the modification of amorphous NiBx, which promoted the effective separation of electron-hole pairs in the TiO2 semiconductor structure, and achieved high-efficient seawater electrolysis. Therefore, this work proposed a simple mute for preparing catalytic electrodes with high activity and outstanding stability, and also provided theoretical supports for practical application of producing high-purity hydrogen from seawater by highly-efficient photoelectrocatalysis system.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000727786200001

Light-induced Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy has been successfully used to study the molecular mechanism of photosynthetic water oxidation. This powerful technique has enabled the characterization of the dynamic structural changes in active water molecules, the Mn4CaO5 cluster, and its surrounding protein matrix during the catalytic cycle.

A number of concentric layers (zones) have been observed in the sample after shock-wave loading. The presence of several zones in the sample reflects the specific features of the processes occurring in different pressure ranges. It has been established that pressures below similar to 45 GPa cause only additional compacting of the material and deformation of aluminum and quartz. In this case, the quartz grain size substantially decreases up to the transition into the X-ray amorphous state. The attainment of a pressure of similar to 45 GPa initiates the solid-state reaction of SiO2 decomposition, which leads to the precipitation of pure silicon and the evolution of oxygen. The beginning of the silicon precipitation and the chemical reaction of Al2O3 formation are separated over the pressure scale. The critical pressure, which is necessary for the solid-state chemical reaction of the Al2O3 formation, is about 50 GPa.					11th Annual Conference of the Materials-Research-Society-of-Serbia (YUCOMAT 2009)11th Annual Conference of the Materials-Research-Society-of-Serbia (YUCOMAT 2009)	AUG 31-SEP 04, 2009AUG 31-SEP 04, 2009	Mat Res Soc SerbiaMat Res Soc Serbia	Heroeg Novi, MONTENEGROHeroeg Novi, MONTENEGRO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0217-9792	1793-6578		WOS:000275932300011

The as-prepared nanoparticles showed a rutile tetragonal structure with a rough undefined morphology having no other elemental impurities. The particle shape and size, band gap, and specific surface area of the samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM, UV-visible diffused reflectance spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area studies. The optical band gap was found in the range of 3.23-3.67 eV and the specific surface area was in the range of 108-225 m(2)/g, which contributes to the significantly enhanced photocatalytic and electrochemical performance. Photocatalytic H-2 generation of as-prepared Cr-doped SnO2 nanostructures showed improved effect of the increasing dopant concentration with narrowing of the band gap.

In this study, a unique interconnected porous carbon (ICPC) and phosphorus doped ICPC (P-ICPC) were synthesized and utilized as a support matrix for ORR in alkaline medium. The activity of P-ICPC further enhanced by compositing with 2D metal dichalcogenide MoS2 materials through facile hydrothermal method. The structural characterization indicated that the addition of phosphorus created more defective site in the carbon structure. The MoS2/P-ICPC catalyst exhibited enhanced ORR activity, and its performance. is close to commercial Pt/C catalyst with regards to current density and onset potential. The synthesized MoS2/P-ICPC catalyst shows better stability regarding activity even after the 2000 cycles of acceleration test. The electron transfer number (n) obtained for MoS2/P-ICPC is similar to 3.8, indicating that the oxygen reduction reaction proceeds via 4e(-) pathway with the similar kinetics of commercial Pt/C.

The abundant reserves of nickel sulfides have been expected to serve as the precious metal-free materials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) or hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this research, a bi-functional S-doped Ni films on three-dimensional (3D) porous copper foams (marked as NiSx/CF) were prepared by a one-step potentiostatic electrodeposition approach in an ethaline solution containing 40mmol NiCl2.6H(2)O and 20mmol CH4N2S. The phase structures, surface elemental valence state,and surface microstructures were observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS),and field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The electrocatalytic performances were measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and ISTEP Multi-Current Steps. The doping of S into Ni grains and three-dimensional porous structure were found to induce more abundant active sites, significantly improving the water splitting electrolytic activity in alkaline media The NiSx/CF catalyst exhibits the lowest overpotential of OER with 302mV at 20 mA.cm(-2) and the lowest overpotential of HER with 146mV at 10 mA.cm(-2). When used in electrocatalytic water splitting, it displays a low cell voltage usage of 1.532V at 20mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. Furthermore, it maintained excellent stability under multiple potentials.

Via a simple one-step hydrothermal procedure, MoS2/Ni3S2 nanorod arrays well-aligned on Ni foam (MoS2/Ni3S2/NF) as a novel three dimensional (3D) hierarchical bifunctional catalytic electrode for overall water splitting has been successfully fabricated in this work. Ni foam (NF) as both 3D substrate and Ni source realized the uniform, dense and nearly vertical in situ self-growth of MoS2/Ni3S2 nanorods on it. Each nanorod had a coated structure with large surface contact regions. Benefiting from the elaborately designed architecture, MoS2/Ni3S2/NF exhibited excellent catalytic activity and good stability for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline electrolyte. To reach the catalytic current density of 10, 100, 200, and 300 mA cm(-2), it only required 187, 274, 300, and 320 mV overpotential for HER and 217, 275, 313, and 335 mV overpotential for OER respectively. Moreover, by employing MoS2/Ni3S2/NF as both the cathode and anode, the water splitting electrolyzer achieved excellent durability. Besides, it only needed very low cell voltages of 1.467, 1.593, 1.640 and 1.661 V to reach the current density of 10, 100, 200 and 300 mA cm(-2), respectively, better than the performance of a benchmark combination. Therefore, MoS2/Ni3S2/NF is a promising non-noble-based bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.									42	2	0	0	1	0	42				2046-2069		WOS:000412211300049

In this paper, a hierarchical NiCo2O4/Ni3S2 hybrid is synthesized by direct growth on nickel foam (NF) using co-precipitation and sulfuration as a general two-step method. When the NiCo2O4/Ni3S2/NF material is used as an electrode, it displays high activity and perfect stability for OER. A low overpotential of only 360 mV is obtained at 40 mA cm(-2), comparable to the benchmark of IrO2 electrodes (330 mV overpotential at 40 mA cm(-2)), benefiting from the particular hybrid structure of NiCo2O4/Ni3S2/NF with large surface area and fast electron transfer. In addition, the NiCo2O4/Ni3S2/NF sample also reveals a superior elevated HER activity compared to NiCo2O4/NF and NF catalysts individually, for which a low overpotential of only 143 mV is obtained at 10 mA cm(-2). Beyond that, NiCo2O4/Ni3S2/NF is also used as a bifunctional water splitting catalyst, for which a very low cell voltage of 1.58 V is acquired at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. The results reveal that oxide/sulfide-based materials can be used as a perfect electrode candidate and afford the advantage of the synergy strategy, which opens a new route toward desired water splitting electrochemical devices of high activity and environmentally friendly electrode materials.									24	1	0	0	2	0	24			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000444201700037	30019052

Although coupling oxygen evolution catalysts on photoanodes to accelerate electrode reactions has been demonstrated an effective strategy to enhance photocurrent, the surface recombination still limits the performance to an ideal level. Herein, a novel multi-step hole transfer strategy is developed for accelerating hole transport and thus suppressing the surface recombination. In this system, porphyrin and polyaniline both act as hole transfer layers, which construct an effective stair-stepping hole transfer channel to ensure much more holes take part in water oxidation process. This simple interface modulation system exhibits a remarkable photocurrent of 4.5 mA cm-2 at 1.23 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), AM 1.5 G illumination) accompanied with good stability and provides a promising strategy for the design of efficient photoanodes for solar conversion.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000706858100001

Visible-light photocatalysis of these particles was investigated for oxygen (O-2) evolution from water in the presence of sacrificial silver(I) sulfate. The calculated crystallite diameters increased with increasing calcination temperature, suggesting that the level of crystallinity increased with calcination temperature. The average specific surface area of the particles was almost the same for all calcination temperatures in the range 200-400 degrees C, but was decreased at 500 degrees C. The photocatalytic reaction rate of O-2 formation increased with increasing calcination temperature up to 400 degrees C, and then decreased as calcination temperature was further increased to 500 degrees C. We therefore concluded that the rate increased with calcination temperature up to 400 degrees C due to the increasing crystallinity, but then decreased due to the decreased specific surface area.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0025-5408	1873-4227		WOS:000430762200008

This work reports a Co-CuOx electrochemical filter with CoOx nanoclusters rooted on vertically aligned CuOx nanowalls for selective nitrate reduction to N-2, utilizing the direct electron transfer between oxygen vacancies and nitrate to suppress the contribution by H*. At a cathodic potential of -1.1 V (vs Ag/AgCl), the Co-CuOx filter showed 95.2% nitrate removal and 96.0% N-2 selectivity at an influent nitrate concentration of 20 N-mg L-1. Meanwhile, the energy consumption and FE were 0.60 kW h m(-3) and 53.5%, respectively, at a permeate flux of 60 L m(-2) h(-1). The presence of abundant oxygen vacancies on Co-CuOx was due to the change in the electron density of the Cu atom and a decrease of the coordination numbers of Cu-O via cobalt doping. Theoretical calculations and electrochemical tests showed that the oxygen vacancies coordinated nitrate adsorption and subsequent reduction reactions, thus suppressing the contribution of H* to nitrate reduction and leading to a thermodynamically favorable process to N-2 via direct electron transfer.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000821581000001	35575637

Despite promising catalytic activity, their OER reaction kinetics are still limited by the sluggish four-electron transfer process. Herein, we develop a terephthalic acid (CoBDC) catalyst with a bifunctional microreactor composed of two species of Co active sites and ligand FcCA (CoBDC FcCA). Benefiting from the ultrathin nanosheet structure, CoBDC FcCA catalyst exhibits an excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 280 mV to reach 10 mA cm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 53 mV dec-1. Structure characterization together with theoretical calculations directly unravel the coordination for two species of Co active moieties with FcCA forming a microreactor of tensile strain, leading to a conversion of the Co spin from a high spin state (t2g5eg2) to an intermediate spin state (t2g6eg1) to regulate antibonding states of Co 3d and O 2p orbital. In situ spectroscopic measurements for mechanistic understanding reveal that this CoBDC FcCA catalyst possesses an optimal OH* adsorption energy for propitious formation of O-O bonds in the OOH* intermediate, thus effectively decreasing the thermodynamic Gibbs free energy of the rate-determining step (O* -> OOH*) to accelerate reaction kinetics for the whole OER process. When loaded on an integrated BiVO4 photoanode as a cocatalyst, CoBDC FcCA enables highly active solar-driven oxygen production from water splitting.

The main obstacle is that bulk materials limit the exposure of active sites. At the same time, the poor conductivity of LDHs is also an important factor. Exfoliation is one of the most direct and effective strategies to increase the electrocatalytic properties of LDHs, leading to exposure of many active sites. However, developing an efficient exfoliation strategy to exfoliate LDHs into stable monolayer nanosheets is still challenging. Therefore, we report a new and efficient solid-phase exfoliation strategy to exfoliate NiFe LDH and graphene oxide (GO) into monolayer nanosheets and the exfoliating ratios of NiFe LDH and GO can reach up to 10 and 5 wt %, respectively. Based on the solid-phase exfoliation strategy, we accidentally discovered that there is a dynamic evolution process between NiFe-LDH nanosheets (NiFe-LDH-NS) and GO nanosheets (GO-NS) to assemble new NiFe-LDH/GO nanohybrids, i.e., NiFe-LDH-NS could be horizontal bespreading on GO-NS or well-organized standing on GO-NS, or both simultaneously. The electrocatalytic OER property test results show that NiFe-LDH/RGO-3 (NFRG-3) nanohybrids obtained by the reduction treatment of NiFe-LDH/GO-3 (NFGO-3) nanohybrids, in which NiFe-LDH-NS are well-organized standing on GO-NS, have excellent electrocatalytic properties for OER in an alkaline solution (with a small overpotential of 273 mV and a Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1) at the current density of 30 mA cm (-2)). The excellent electrocatalytic properties for OER of NFRG-3 nanohybrids could be attributed to the unique three-dimensional arraylike structure with many active sites. At the same time, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) with excellent conductivity can improve the charge-transfer efficiency and synergistically improve OER properties of nanohybrids.									44	2	0	0	2	0	44			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000464769400056	30892865

Here, we report synthesis of an IrO2-modified RuO2 nanowires/nitrogen-doped carbon composite for overall water splitting at all pH. This catalyst exhibits excellent OER activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution with a low overpotential of 188 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) current density, a low Tafel slope value of 42 mV/dec, and similar to 96% faradic efficiency. The OER of this catalyst in neutral and base media is also higher than that of commercial RuO2 and IrO2. IrO2-RuO2/C also showed very good HER activity with 10 mA/cm(2) current density at 82 and 75 mV overpotential in acid and base, respectively. The HER performance of this catalyst is better than that of commercial Pt/C in base and slightly lower in neutral and acid. The catalyst shows excellent OER and HER stability compared to the state-of-art catalysts. In addition, the overall water-splitting performance of IrO2-RuO2/C was also studied, which shows 10 mA/cm(2) current density at 1.52 and 1.51 V cell voltage in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. The outstanding activity of the IrO2-RuO2/C catalyst can be attributed to a unique one-dimensional nanowire structure, synergistic interaction, high surface area, high oxophilicity, and high mass and electron transportation between IrO2, RuO2, and the carbon support. This work may provide an opportunity to design and synthesize a highly durable and efficient electrocatalyst for renewable energy conversion.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000743235500001

In this work, the Fe doped NiO mesoporous nanosheets array on Ni foam with different Fe dopant content (Fe-x%-NiO/NF) was synthesized by a facile solvothermal synthesis in mixed solvents of deionized water and methanol and subsequent anneal in air. The well-connected three-dimensional mesoporous nanosheets array structure offers a large number of catalytically active sites and buffers the large volume change during the electrochemical process of OER and HER. More importantly, the doped Fe3+ ions modified atomic and electronic structure of NiO by activated Ni centers through a Fe-induced partial-charge-transfer process which can promote the electrocatalytic performances of NiO for OER and HER. As a result, the optimized Fe-11%-NiO/NF electrode exhibited excellent OER activity with a small overpotential of 206 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 49.4 mV dec(-1). Moreover, it also presented prominent HER activity, only demanding a small overpotential of 88 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 49.7 mV dec(-1). A two-electrode electrolyzer using Fe-11%-NiO/NF as both anode and cathode performs active overall water splitting, needing a small cell voltage of 1.579 V to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This work can stimulate the design and optimization of Ni-Fe mixed oxide as an efficient electrocatalyst for practical overall water electrolysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The realization of effective electrolysis of water, however, is still limited by the requirement of a high sustainable driving potential above thermodynamic requirements. Here, we report dynamically self-optimized (DSO) NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets with promising bi-functional performance. Compared with pristine NiFe LDH, DSO NiFe LDH exhibits much lower overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), even outperforming platinum. Under 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, the bi-functional DSO catalysts show an overpotential of 184 and -59 mV without iR compensation for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and HER at 10 mA cm(-2). The material system operates at 1.48 V and 1.29 V to reach 10 and 1 mA cm(-2) in two-electrode measurements, corresponding to 83% and 95% electricity-to-fuel conversion efficiency with respect to the lower heating value of hydrogen. The material is seen to dynamically reform the active phase of the surface layer during HER and OER, where the pristine and activated catalysts are analyzed with ex situ XPS, SAED and EELS as well as with in situ Raman spectro-electrochemistry. The results show transformation into different active interfacial species during OER and HER, revealing a synergistic interplay between iron and nickel in facilitating water electrolysis.									275	12	0	0	23	0	278			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000459741700005

Herein, Fe-doped NiS-NiS2 heterostructured microspheres, an electrocatalyst, are synthesized via etching Prussian blue analogues following a controlled annealing treatment. The resulting microspheres are constructed by mesoporous nanoplates, granting the virtues of large surface areas, high structural void porosity, and accessible inner surface. These advantages not only provide more redox reaction centers but also strengthen structural robustness and effectively facilitate the mass diffusion and charge transport. Density functional theory simulations validate that the Fe-doping improves the conductivity of nickel sulfides, whereas the NiS-NiS2 heterojunctions induce interface charge rearrangement for optimizing the adsorption free energy of intermediates, resulting in a low overpotential and high electrocatalytic activity. Specifically, an ultralow overpotential of 270 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is achieved. After adding 0.33 M urea into 1 M KOH, Fe-doped NiS-NiS2 obtains a strikingly reduced urea oxidation reaction potential of 1.36 V to reach 50 mA cm(-2), around 140 mV less than OER. This work provides insights into the synergistic modulation of electrocatalytic activity of non-noble catalysts for applications in energy conversion systems.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000757698300001	35182017

In such PEC systems, an integrated photoelectrode incorporates a light harvester for absorbing solar energy, an interlayer for transporting photogenerated charge carriers, and a co-catalyst for triggering redox reactions. Thus, understanding the correlations between the intrinsic structural properties and functions of the photoelectrodes is crucial. Here we critically examine various 2D layered photoanodes/photocathodes, including graphitic carbon nitrides, transition metal dichalcogenides, layered double hydroxides, layered bismuth oxyhalide nanosheets, and MXenes, combined with advanced nanocarbons (carbon dots, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and graphdiyne) as co-catalysts to assemble integrated photoelectrodes for oxygen evolution/hydrogen evolution reactions. The fundamental principles of PEC water splitting and physicochemical properties of photoelectrodes and the associated catalytic reactions are analyzed. Elaborate strategies for the assembly of 2D photoelectrodes with nanocarbons to enhance the PEC performances are introduced. The mechanisms of interplay of 2D photoelectrodes and nanocarbon co-catalysts are further discussed. The challenges and opportunities in the field are identified to guide future research for maximizing the conversion efficiency of PEC water splitting.									44	4	0	0	2	0	44			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000594285700001	34138209

Herein, a "d-electron complementation" principle to develop such candidates is proposed. By taking advantage of the filling characteristics of 3d orbitals, vanadium-cobalt phosphide (V-CoP) is synthesized. According to X-ray absorption fine structure and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy investigation, V can disorder the coordination environment of Co, leading to increased/decreased charge density in Co(P)/Co(O). As a result, V-CoP shows impressive bifunctional activity, which only needs overpotentials of 46 and 267 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER, respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the accelerated H2O dissociation process on the VOx/CoOx/CoP surface and H conversion kinetics on the V-neighboring Co-Co bridge site result in promoted HER activity. Furthermore, the up-shifted d-band center of V-CoOOH endows the V-neighboring Co site with a lowered energy barrier for the OER. This work serves as a proof-of-concept for the application of the "d-electron complementation" principle, which can be a generalized guideline to design and develop novel highly efficient catalysts.									26	0	0	0	4	0	26			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000691919800001

The films were characterized by nuclear reaction analyses in resonant and non-resonant regions of the cross-section curves, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and low energy ion scattering. The HfSiN/Si structure was shown to be more resistant to oxygen diffusion than HfSiO/Si, although the amounts of O incorporated in HfSiN/Si are larger than in HfSiO/Si. The main channel of oxygen incorporation is atomic exchange with nitrogen or oxygen atoms. HfSiN film on Si incorporate more hydrogen (or deuterium) and in more stable configurations than HfSiO/Si. Nitrogen incorporation into AlON films on Si renders this structure more stable against thermal annealing in vacuum and/or oxidizing atmospheres than Al2O3/Si.

We explore the O-2 evolution process catalyzed by these copper catalysts with various ligands (L) by applying the first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. First, the oxidation of catalysts to the metal-oxo intermediates [LCu(O)](2+) occurs through the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process. These intermediates are involved in the oxygen-oxygen bond formation through the water-nudeophilic addition process. Here, we have considered two types of oxygen-oxygen bond formation. The first one is the transfer of the hydroxide of the water molecule to the Cu=O moiety; the proton transfer to the solvent leads to the formation of the peroxide complex ([LCu(OOH)](+)). The other is the formation of the hydrogen peroxide complex (LCu(HOOH)](2+)) by the transfer of proton and hydroxide of the water molecule to the metal-oxo intermediate. The formation of the peroxide complex requires less activation free energy than hydrogen peroxide formation for both catalysts. We found two transition states in the well-tempered metadynamics simulations: one for proton transfer and another for hydroxide transfer. In both cases, the proton transfer requires higher free energy. Following the formation of the oxygen-oxygen bond, we study the release of the dioxygen molecule. The formed peroxide and hydrogen peroxide complexes are converted into the superoxide complex ([LCu(OO)](2+)) through the transfer of proton, electron, and PCET processes. The superoxide complex releases an oxygen molecule upon the addition of a water molecule. The free energy of activation for the release of the dioxygen molecule is lesser than that of the oxygen-oxygen bond formation. When we observe the entire water oxidation process, the oxygen-oxygen bond formation is the rate-determining step. We calculated the rates of reaction by using the Eyring equation and found them to be dose to the experimental values.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000680436900013	34282907

Herein, we report a bifunctional catalyst by doping atomic Ir into a NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) using a facile atmospheric solvothermal method and subsequent spontaneous galvanic displacement. The as-synthesized atomic Ir-doped NiCo LDH exhibits much better durability for over 200 h than the NiCo LDH with the loading of Ir nanoparticles, due to the fine doping of atomic Ir into the crystal lattice of LDH. Benefiting from the synergistic effects in the HER/OER processes, as well as the large electrochemically active surface area and the improved electrical conductivity, the atomic Ir-doped NiCo LDH couple results in an unprecedented performance for overall water splitting with a low cell voltage of 1.45 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Finally, a practical solar-driven water splitting system with a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 14.8% is demonstrated, outperforming the state-of-the-art analogous systems based on ordinary Si solar cells.									72	3	0	0	4	0	72			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000536690000039

Herein, we report an efficient low-cost nanoporous activated carbon sheets (NACS) with hierarchical pore architecture from Indian Ooty Varkey (IOV) food waste for oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) by following "waste to wealth creation" strategy. Characterization of NAGS carbo-catalyst reveals the presence of pyridinic-nitrogen inherited by self-doping of N from the biomass with high BET surface area (1478.0 m(2) g(-1)). As an electrocatalyst in alkaline medium, it exhibits low-onset potential (1.36 V us. RHE), an overpotential (1110) of 0.34 V at 10.0 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel value (43 mV dec(-1)), and good stability towards OER compared to Pt or Ir commercial catalysts. Tested as HER catalyst, it displays an impressive HER activity with a low-onset potential of -0.085 V (vs. RHE), and overpotential (eta(10)) of 0.38 V at 10.0 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 85 mV dec(-1).

J	Yang, Sijun; Yu, Jie; Yao, Chengli; Li, Shikuo; Xie, Anjian								Preparation and electrocatalytic performance of N-doped hierarchical porous carbon loaded with Fe/Fe5C2 nanoparticles								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				903						163874	10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.163874				MAY 15 2022	2022	The development of efficient non-precious-metal catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is greatly important for accelerating the commercial application of fuel cells. Herein, polystyrene (PS) nanospheres are used as templates for the growth of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) complex precursors with variable molar ratios of Fe3+ to Zn2+ in situ. Through carbonization at a high temperature, the hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) materials with different proportions (xFeyZn-HPC, x + y = 100) have been prepared. The typical product 5Fe95Zn-HPC is composed of nitrogen (N)-doped hierarchical porous carbon loaded with Fe/Fe5C2 nanoparticles obtained at optimal molar ratio. As an electrocatalyst, the 5Fe95Zn-HPC shows a positive onset potential of 0.92 V (vs. RHE), half-wave potential of 0.77 V (vs. RHE) and limiting current density of 5.60 mA cm(-2) at 0.055 V (vs. RHE). The hydrogen peroxide yield is less than 4.2%, and the electron transfer numbers are between 3.91 and 3.99 at 0.055 V similar to 1.055 V in the catalytic ORR, which indicate that the reaction is dominated by four-electron reduction. The 5Fe95Zn-HPC has higher stability and methyl alcohol resistance in alkaline and acidic solutions. The above results indicate the excellent catalytic ORR performance of the 5Fe95Zn-HPC, almost as the commercial Pt/C. Additionally, 5Fe95Zn-HPC has the capacity to catalyze oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and adsorb methylene blue pollutants. Therefore, this work provides a practical method to design the hierarchical porous carbon-based material with outstanding multi-functions. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the development of earth-abundant, inexpensive, highly efficient electrocatalysts contributes a great deal to the overall efficiency of a water electrolytic system. Here, inspired by the low charge transfer resistance of mixed-valence cations, the favorable H atom binding energy of cobalt, and high electrical conductivity of graphene, we report a facile synthesis strategy to synthesize a spinel ternary oxide material consisting of nickel, manganese, and cobalt supported on reduced graphene oxide (rGO/NMC) with further conversion into a spinel ternary sulfide via a gaseous sulfurization protocol. The rGO/NMC-312 oxide material is found to be an efficient OER electrocatalyst with an overpotential as low as 320 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is comparable to that of the state of the art OER catalysts. In addition, when used as HER electrocatalysts, the as-converted rGO/NMC-312 sulfide materials exhibit a low overpotential of 151 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 52 mV/decade, and a remarkable long-term stability. Impressively, a voltage of 1.56 V is required to achieve a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline medium at room temperature by applying rGO/NMC-312 oxide and sulfide as an alkaline water electrolysis anode and cathode, respectively. Our work offers a strategy to apply spinel ternary oxides and sulfides as electrocatalysts in water electrolysis.									76	3	0	0	4	0	77			2155-5435			WOS:000391783200088

A gold nanodendrite-decorated layered double hydroxide as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline media								RSC ADVANCES				7	74			47049	47055		10.1039/c7ra05625g				2017	2017	In this work, a gold nanodendrites-CuMgFe layered double hydroxide composite (AuNDs@LDH) was introduced as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER, respectively) in alkaline media. AuNDs@LDH/GCE was prepared by the coating of the surface of a glassy carbon electrode using the CuMgFe-LDH suspension, and followed by Au electrodeposition. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis showed that nanodendrite-like structures of Au are formed on the LDH film, while Au is electrodeposited as nanoparticles on the GCE (AuNPs/GCE). The performance of the catalysts for HER and OER was investigated using polarization curves, Tafel plots and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). AuNDs@LDH/GCE exhibited the lowest onset potential and highest current density in comparison with AuNPs/GCE and LDH@AuNPs/GCE for both the OER and HER. The lower values of Tafel slope and charge transfer resistance indicated that the kinetics of charge transfer for the AuNDs@LDH are faster than those for the other studied electrodes. A durability test was performed using chronopotentiometry method that reveals the highest durability of the AuNDs@LDH for both of the reactions. The synergistic effect of the AuNDs and LDH and the high active surface area of AuNDs could be major parameters for enhanced catalytic performance of the AuNDs@LDH. As a result, this strategy provides a promising approach for the fabrication of highly efficient metal nanostructure-decorated LDHs, which can be used as a catalyst in water electrolyzers.									10	2	0	0	2	0	10			2046-2069			WOS:000412451500059

In this work, the HER performance of pristine MoS2 is enhanced by doping of Co and Se atoms, which serve as additional active sites and oxygen defects on HER performance respectively, thereby tuning the electronic structure of pristine MoS2 and further optimizing its hydrogen adsorption energy. The structural and morphological characterizations reveal the presence of the cuboid and raspberry nanostructures with a high order of crystallinity and extended interlayer spacing. The Co- and Se-doped MoS2, display enhanced HER activity than pristine MoS2 with a low onset potential of 181 mV and 166 mV, and a low overpotential of 218 mV and 207 mV at a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2). More importantly, the Se-doped MoS2 shows good catalytic stability with a low Tafel slope of 44 mV dec(-1) as compared with that of Co-doped MoS2 (50 mV dec(-1)) and other reported values in the literature. Furthermore, the density functional theory calculations were carried out to get a fundamental understanding of electro-catalytic activity of Co and Se doping onto MoS2. This work can serve as a general methodology to enhance HER activity for the upcoming potential catalysts in the future and may uncover several applications in the field of solar photo-electrochemical (PEC) water-splitting cells and proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers.

Fe-segregation in the nanosheets yields magnetic domains with different spin alignments, while the surface compensating anions affect the local moments and valence states of the Fe atoms. The two conditions do not radically change the super-exchange nature of interactions between the paramagnetic metal centers, but facilitate the formation of various magnetic superlattices in the nanosheets. The calculated free energy change of the intermediates shows that the most stable magnetic structure of Ni-Fe hydroxide nanosheets exhibits superior catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction/evolution reactions, which is indicative of magnetic catalyst. This is due to the cycle transition between Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions in the reactions, which determines the sequence of cleavage of the O-H bond and the release of the OH group, controlling the rate-limiting steps of the reaction. The relationship of magnetism and catalytic activity of Ni-Fe hydroxide nanosheets is established by the valence state change of the Fe ions, which will be helpful to open the way for the design of hydroxide/layered double hydroxides (LDHs)-based magnetic catalysts.									5	3	0	0	0	0	6			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000412227800008

To generate hydrogen via water electrolysis, it is undeniably necessary to develop a cost-effective bifunctional catalyst for water electrolysis. Presently, layered double hydroxide (LDH) and 1D fibrous materials have been used for various applications due to their excellent physiochemical properties. Herein, we had synthesized NiFe-LDH and Ce doped NiFeLDH via a simple wet chemical method followed by the preparation of NiFe-LDH and Ce doped NiFe-LDH incorporated microfiber via the electrospinning (ES) method. The replacement of Fe ions into Ce ions leads to an increase in catalytic activity, flexible coordinate sites, and an increase in the surface area of the particles. The experimental results shows that the Ce@NiFe-LDH fiber possesses a higher activity in both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a lower overpotential of 220 and 81 mV at 10 mA cm-2 current density. The same catalyst has been analyzed in a two-electrode system in 1 M KOH solution (Ce@NiFe-LDH fiber as the anode and cathode), and the overall electrochemical cell demands an overpotential of 360 mV to drive 10 mA cm-2 current density. Therefore, the combination of simple wet chemical synthesis and the ES method produces an excellent electrocatalyst (Ce@NiFe-LDH fiber) for water splitting reaction for large-scale production and commercialization.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000875679700001

The oxidation reactions of chloride and (to a lesser extent) bromide, which can occur in parallel to the evolution of oxygen, lead to environmentally harmful by-products and thus represent undesirable side-reactions. We present some general considerations of solution chemistry and oxidation products that may be expected in a mixed acidic bromide/chloride electrolyte. We performed electrochemical model studies of the simultaneous oxidation of bromide and chloride and their mutual interaction on a Pt electrocatalyst, with the aim of deepening the general understanding of the anodic competition problem. Using simplified model systems, our findings suggest that the oxidation of bromide is hindered by competing chloride adsorption, in a way that can be quite satisfactorily modelled by a simple Langmuir isotherm describing the competing adsorption and reactivity of all species. The oxidation of chloride was however not properly captured by this same model, and may be substantially different. Furthermore, the formation of the interhalogen compound BrCl seems to occur in-between the oxidation of bromide and chloride. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

In this study, we found an evidence for the shuttle effect arising in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with a LiI RM through the visual observation of the diffusion of soluble I-3(-) towards a Li anode where it reacted chemically to produce LiI, which can be only partly dissolved, leading to the loss of both the RM and electrical energy efficiency. Therefore, we proposed a self-defense redox mediator (SDRM) of InI3 to counter this problem. During charging, the In3+ is reduced electrochemically on the Li anode prior to Li+, forming a much stable indium layer to resist the synchronous attack by the soluble I-3(-). The pre-deposited indium layer can also reduce the growth of dendrites from the Li anode surface. As a result, the electrical energy efficiency and the cycling performance of the Li-O-2 cells were improved significantly.									178	14	0	0	6	0	180			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000372243600032

To better understand the role of such structure tailoring, the complicated photocatalytic reaction involving multiple small molecules, namely NO removal, is selected to serve as a model reaction. The experimental results find that the 2D g-C3N4 with oxygen modification (2D OCN) exhibits enhanced performance with good stability in photocatalytic NO removal compared to pristine g-C3N4, as a result for the improved charge separation and optimized molecular adsorption. On one hand, the 2D structure of OCN can shorten the charge migration distance, endow the semiconductor improved redox ability and provide large specific area for reaction proceeding. On the other hand, the oxygen modification could optimize the adsorption ability of reaction molecules (NO and O-2) benefiting the surface catalytic reaction. All the merits mentioned above are supported by detailed characterization and theoretical calculation. This article presented here provides a case study for designing efficient photocatalyst and an approach to analyze the correlation between structure and performance.									43	6	0	0	8	0	45			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000467387200137

Herein, we designed 2D/2D La2Ti2O7/g-C(3)N(4)nanocomposites with abundant oxygen vacancies as an efficient visible light-driven bifunctional photocatalyst for H(2)evolution and CO(2)reduction reactions. Through both experimental and DFT study, a defined oxygen vacancy in La(2)Ti(2)O(7)was confirmed. The oxygen vacancy mediated Z-scheme mechanism verified by ESR analysis plays a significant role in the generation of clean fuels, leading to H-2, CH3OH and CO generation with a much higher yield than that of defective La(2)Ti(2)O(7)and g-C(3)N(4)alone. These 2D/2D nanojunction induces a rapid electron injection from the defect sites of La(2)Ti(2)O(7)nanosheets to g-C(3)N(4)nanosheets and prolong the charge carriers' lifetime, thereby leading to high reducing power for clean fuel generation.									93	5	0	0	9	0	90			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000546391600031

ZZ Ceti stars are pulsating white dwarfs with a carbon- oxygen core build up during the core helium burning and thermally pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch phases. Through the interpretation of their pulsation periods by means of asteroseismology, details about their origin and evolution can be inferred. The whole pulsation spectrum exhibited by ZZ Ceti stars strongly depends on the inner chemical structure. At present, there are several processes a ff ecting the chemical profiles that are still not accurately determined.Aims. We present a study of the impact of the current uncertainties of the white dwarf formation and evolution on the expected pulsation properties of ZZ Ceti stars.Methods. Our analysis is based on a set of carbon- oxygen core white dwarf models with masses 0.548 and 0.837 M-circle dot that are derived from full evolutionary computations from the ZAMS to the ZZ Ceti domain. We considered models in which we varied the number of thermal pulses, the amount of overshooting, and the C-12(alpha,gamma)O-16 reaction rate within their uncertainties.Results. We explore the impact of these major uncertainties in prior evolution on the chemical structure and expected pulsation spectrum. We find that these uncertainties yield significant changes in the g-mode pulsation periods.Conclusions. We conclude that the uncertainties in the white dwarf progenitor evolution should be taken into account in detailed asteroseismological analyses of these pulsating stars.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000395821900105

The 3/1/2-dimensional hybridization heterostructure rationally organized by three-dimensional Cu foam, one-dimensional Cu2+1O nanowires and two-dimensional Co3O4 nanosheets achieves remarkable synergistic interactions. In brief, the free-standing Cu foam framework enables remarkable structure robustness, electronic conductivity and electrolyte infiltration. Meanwhile, the in-situ grown Cu2+1O nanowires with excess metal defects indeed provide certain activity, effectively adjust the size and distribution of anchored Co3O4 nanosheets and dramatically shorten the diffusion pathway of ions and electrons. Moreover, the constructed interfaces between Cu2+1O and Co3O4 further yield sufficient electrochemically active surface area. In consequence, Cu@Cu2+1O@Co3O4 heterostructure delivers superior lithiumion storage capacity and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity. Specifically, a prominent and stable discharge capacity of 1090 mAh g(-1) can be delivered after 200 cycles at 500 mA g(-1). Even when the current density is elevated to 5000 mA g(-1), remarkable discharge capacity of 601 mAh g(-1) still can be yielded. As for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity, Cu@Cu2+1O@Co3O4 heterostructure demonstrates a particularly low overpotential of 223 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 46.3 mV dec(-1). This strategy may enlighten the researchers on the further development of electrochemically active materials for advanced electrode and catalyst.									11	1	0	0	2	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000698115400007

The NC/Fe10-xCox catalysts have exhibited superior electrocatalytic ORR performance comparable to commercial Pt/C via a four-electron pathway under the same loading in alkaline media with outstanding durability and complete methanol tolerance. The improvement of ORR performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of Fe, Co bimetallic activation on nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon layers, rich pore structure and uniformly dispersed dopants in the carbon matrix.

We show that there exists a linear correlation between the adsorption energies of oxygen on LaMO3 (M = Sc-Cu) surfaces obtained using a hybrid functional (e.g., Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof) and those obtained using a semilocal density functional (e.g., Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof) through the magnetic properties of the bulk phase as determined with a hybrid functional. The energetics of the spin-polarized surfaces follows the same trend as corresponding bulk systems, which can be treated at a much lower computational cost. The difference in adsorption energy due to magnetism is linearly correlated to the magnetization energy of bulk, that is, the energy difference between the spin-polarized and the non-spin-polarized solutions. Hence, one can estimate the correction to the adsorption energy as obtained from a semilocal functional directly from the bulk magnetization energy from a hybrid functional.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000359332200019

However, the cumulative corrosive environment resulting from the acidic conditions required and the positive half-cell potentials imply that only materials having high intrinsic activity and stability can be used. Herein, we propose catalysts and a corresponding fabrication method that meets these requirements. A 3D dandelion spore-structured self-supporting IrNi electrocatalyst is directly fabricated on a porous transport layer through the adsorbed H-induced co-electrodeposition of a core-shell IrNi-Ir structure. Subsequent dealloying generates a highly porous nanostructured Ir-based framework robust to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in a wide pH range. Specifically, it exhibited overpotentials of 248 mV (OER) and 15 mV (HER) at +/- 10 mA cm(-2) in an acidic electrolyte with exceptional stability even after constant operation at 200 mA cm(-2) for 50 h (OER) or 5000 potential cycles (HER). When used as a bifunctional catalyst (0.67 mg cm(-2)) for PEMWE, 6.5 A cm(-2) was obtained at a cell voltage of 2.0 V. The degradation rate was only 1.58 mV h(-1) under extremely harsh test conditions of 2 A cm(-2) for 100 h, thus verifying the exceptional stability of a single cell. This is the first report of bifunctional catalysts with such high performance and stability fabricated using a simple method, and this work can aid the commercialization of PEMWE.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000823949100001

The synergistic effect between nitrogen-doped carbon and metal nano-particles enhances the catalytic properties. Thus, how to effectively combine nitrogen-doped carbon with metal nano-particles is a crucial factor for the synthesis of novel catalysts. In this paper, we report on a facile method to prepare nitrogen-doped carbon-supported metal nano-particles by using dimethylgly-oxime as ligand. The nano-particles of Pd, Ni, Cu, and Fe were successfully prepared by the pyrolysis of the corresponding clathrate of ions and dimethylglyoxime. The ligand of dimethylglyoxime is adopted as the source for the nitrogen-doped carbon. The nano-structure of the prepared Pd, Ni, Cu, and Fe particles are confirmed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and trans-mission electron microscopy tests. The catalytic performances of the obtained metal nano-particles for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are investigated by cyclic voltammetry, Tafel, linear sweeping voltammetry, rotating disc electrode, rotating ring disc electrode, and other technologies. Results show that the nitrogen-doped carbon-supported metal nano-particles can be highly efficient catalysts for ORR. The results of the paper exhibit a facile methodology to prepare nitrogen-doped carbon-supported metal nano-particles.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3				2079-4991		WOS:000657016600001	34070015

A catalytic reaction cell attached to a local electrode atom probe allowed controlled exposure of electropolished specimens to oxygen gas. Prior to exposure, some samples were found to be enriched in hydrogen, thought to be introduced during electropolishing. These samples reacted strongly to form sub-surface phases rich in H and O, while samples with less hydrogen did not. These results suggest that hydrogen in the sample plays an important role as a catalyst to oxidation and may affect the hydrogen evolution rate in Mg alloys.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:000518488800024

All these effects are more efficient at lower metallicity.

Amorphous iridium oxide structures are found to be more active than their crystalline counterparts. Herein, we combine synchrotron-based X-ray photoemission and absorption spectroscopies with theoretical calculations to investigate the electronic structure of Ir metal, rutile-type IrO2, and an amorphous IrOx. Theory and experiment show that while the Ir 4f line shape of Ir metal is well described by a simple Doniach-Sunji function, the peculiar line shape of rutile-type IrO2 requires the addition of a shake-up satellite 1eV above the main line. In the catalytically more active amorphous IrOx, we find that additional intensity appears in the Ir 4f spectrum at higher binding energy when compared with rutile-type IrO2 along with a pre-edge feature in the O K-edge. We identify these additional features as electronic defects in the anionic and cationic frameworks, namely, formally OI- and Ir-III, which may explain the increased activity of amorphous IrOx electrocatalysts. We corroborate our findings by in situ X-ray diffraction as well as in situ X-ray photoemission and absorption spectroscopies.

The reduced chemical kinetics scheme is based on a seven-species, ten-reaction hydrogen-oxygen mechanism. Realistic kinetic parameters were used. The speed of the entire chemical process was scaled relative to the mixing process by varying an appropriately chosen Damkohler number. The simulation results were compared to predictions of the Conditional Moment Closure model. Next, predictions for the radical species concentrations based on steady-state and partial equilibrium assumptions were compared to simulation results. A model is proposed which gives the thermochemical state as a function of the mixture fraction and a reaction progress variable. The thermochemical states are derived and tabulated from homogeneous premixed calculations. The predictions of this model are compared to simulation data. An expression is derived for the evolution of the error in a manifold approximation. (C) 1997 by The Combustion Institute.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			0010-2180			WOS:A1997WQ37600008

Herein, we report a dual-metal single-atom catalyst consisted of Cu-N-4 and Zn-N-4 on the N-doped carbon support (Cu/Zn-NC). It exhibits high-efficiency ORR activity with an E-onset of 0.98 V and an E-1/2 of 0.83 V, excellent stability (no degradation after 10 000 cycles), surpassing state-of-the-art Pt/C and great mass of Pt-free single atom catalysts. Operando XANES demonstrates that the Cu-N-4 as active center experiences the change from atomic dispersion to cluster with the cooperation of Zn-N-4 during ORR process, and then turns to single atom state again after reaction. DFT calculation further indicates that the adjustment effect of Zn on the d-orbital electron distribution of Cu could benefit to the stretch and cleavage of O-O on Cu active center, speeding up the process of rate determining step of OOH*.									123	10	0	0	10	0	124			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000649701200001	33786969

So far, platinum group metals (PGM) and their oxides, for example, Pt and iridium oxide (IrO2) have been well-regarded as the criterion for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) electrocatalysts. However, the PGM catalysts usually undergo severe performance decay during the long-term operation. Herein, the in situ growth of iron phosphosulfate (Fe2P2S6) nanocrystals (NCs) catalysts on carbon paper synthesized by combing chemical vapor deposition with solvent-thermal treatment is reported to show competitive performance and stability as compared to the state-of-the-art PGM catalysts in a real water electrolyzer. A current density of 370 mA cm(-2) is achieved at 1.8 V when using Fe2P2S6 NCs as bifunctional catalysts in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer. The Fe2P2S6 NCs also show much better stability than the Pt-IrO2 catalysts at 300 mA cm(-2) for a continuous 24 h test. The surface generated FeOOH on Fe2P2S6 is the real active site for OER. These results indicate that the Fe2P2S6 NCs potentially can be used to replace PGM catalysts for practical water electrolyzers.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2366-9608			WOS:000496843000001

Specifically, emphasis is placed on the stability of the LCFCr oxygen electrode during oxygen evolution (electrolysis mode), whereby many known electrode materials are known to fail due to delamination. The porous microstructure of the electrode was characterized by nanoscale X-ray microscopy (XRM) to reveal the percentage porosity, pore connectivity, average pore size, and electrochemical surface area, etc. Under polarization in a two-electrode symmetrical-cell configuration, while the working electrode was under anodic polarization, a very stable performance was observed at a cell potential of 0.2 V, although increasing the cell potential to 0.65 V caused significant performance degradation. This degradation was reversible when the cell was run at open circuit for 10 h. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and wavelength dispersive spectroscopy revealed that the working electrode (LCFCr)/electrolyte (GDC) interface was structurally and chemically stable after hundreds of hours under polarization with no interdiffusion of the various species observed across the interface, hence rendering LCFCr a viable alternative for the oxygen electrode in RSOCs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4352		WOS:000819113900001

Although gas in thermal equilibrium (thermal gas) plays an important role in many beneficial chemical reactions supporting the most advanced technologies, understanding the adsorption processes of thermal gas in terms of translational energy remains an unsolved issue. Here, for thermal-O-2 and supersonic O-2 molecular beams, we present a comparative study of oxide evolution at early stages of oxidation of a Si(111)-7 x 7 surface at room temperature. Real-time observations of oxides at the surface were conducted by employing high energy resolution photoelectron spectroscopy using high brilliance synchrotron radiation. It was found that ins structure which has one oxygen atom at the backbond of a Si adatom is the common first product for oxidation by thermal-O-2 and supersonic O-2 molecular beams. Similarities between thermal-O-2 and supersonic O-2 molecular beams were found for oxide evolution and illustrate the notion that translational energy of thermal O-2 can be ascribed to the average molecular kinetic energy defined based on the most probable speed of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. This experimental result suggests that translational energy is the unifying reaction parameter that rationalizes adsorption mechanisms for both thermal gas and supersonic molecular beams.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1932-7447			WOS:000335878900015

However, it is still challengeable to fabricate a stable, efficient, and cost-effective electrocatalyst that can overcome the sluggish reaction kinetics of water electrolysis. In order to reduce the energy barrier, for the first time, metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived nickel (Ni) and nickel sulfide (NiS) heteronanoparticle-embedded semi-MOFs are prepared by a partial sulfurization strategy. These semi-MOF electrocatalysts inherit the advantages associated with MOF architecture and nanoparticles, unlike the traditional OER catalysts such as pristine MOFs or completely pyrolyzed MOFs. Due to the unique nanoarchitecture fabricated by Ni/NiS heteronanoparticles within semi-MOF nanosheets and a carbon nanotube (CNT) network (Ni-M@C-130), it displays exceptional bifunctional activity over the other transition metal-based electrocatalysts ever reported. It requires very small overpotentials for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER; eta(10) = 244 mV) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER; eta(10) = 123 mV), with low Tafel slopes of 47.2 and 50.8 mV/dec, respectively. Furthermore, it exhibits overpotential as low as 1.565 V (eta(10)) on nickel foam (1 mg/cm(2)) substrates for overall water splitting. The outstanding catalytic performance of Ni-M@C-130 is attributed to the combined benefits of MOF nanosheets, synergistic interactions, and improved electrical conductivity and mechanical stability. This study describes the advantages of partial sulfurization of CNT-integrated MOFs in attaining electrochemically active heteronanoparticles within MOF nanosheets to accomplish improved bifunctional activity.									36	1	0	0	0	0	36			2168-0485			WOS:000617925200047

In particular, highly efficient electrocatalysts that are also cost-effective are of utmost concern in the development of several clean energy conversion technologies. These include fuel cells and water electrolyzers. It is well recognized that electrocatalysts are needed to greatly accelerate the kinetics of key electrochemical reactions involved in these energy conversion technologies. Perovskite oxides are being used as key materials that have provided impetus in the development of energy conversion and storage, in view of their flexibility in elemental composition. Over 90% of known elements are able to become incorporated into their metal cation sites, resulting in diversified properties. Several strategies can be used to tailor the intrinsic properties of perovskites, leading to the optimization of their catalytic activity for electrochemical reactions. Cation deficiency has received particular attention as a unique strategy since no other elements or phases are involved, thereby avoiding the unknown effects of foreign elements or phases on performance. In this Account, we present our recent contributions to the study of cation-deficient perovskite oxides in the context of their applications in clean energy conversion. This includes oxygen separation through mixed conducting membranes, which is important for clean combustion, electricity generation through both solid oxide fuel cells using chemical fuels and dye-sensitized solar cells, and hydrogen production from water through both solid oxide electrolysis cells at high temperatures and water electrolyzers at room temperature. The journey begins with a discussion of the defect chemistry and charge compensation mechanisms present in cationdeficient perovskite oxides and then we propose benefits from the cation deficiency strategy that can optimize the materials' properties in terms of electrical conductivity, phase structure, oxygen vacancy concentration, oxygen ion and cation diffusion properties, and proton transportation. Thus, both the sintering behavior of materials and their catalytic activity is dramatically improved for key reactions such as oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, and iodine reduction. Accordingly, the remarkable increases in performance of the aforementioned energy conversion systems are achieved through adopting cationdeficient perovskites. At the end of this Account, we conclude with some suggestions on how future research can broaden the applications for cation-deficient perovskites.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27				2643-6728		WOS:000677583500002		
J	Wang, Meng; Liu, Hongxia; Ma, Jiantai; Lu, Gongxuan								The activity enhancement of photocatalytic water splitting by F- pre-occupation on Pt(100) and Pt(111) co-catalyst facets								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				266						118647	10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.118647				JUN 5 2020	2020	The reversible hydrogen and oxygen recombination reaction in semiconductor dispersion highly impede the yield increase of photocatalytic water splitting to hydrogen and oxygen. In order to inhibit such reverse reaction, it is necessary to reduce the degree of hydrogen and oxygen adsorption and activiation over co-catalyst on semiconductor. It is known that partial occupation of Pt sites by halogen ions with high electronegativity can decrease the adsorption and activation degree of hydrogen and oxygen molecules over Pt/TiO2, by this way, hydrogen and oxygen recombination reaction can be significantly inhibited, and the overall water splitting activity can be remarkably enhanced. Nevertheless, the detail inhibition mechanism on the reverse recombination reaction by halogen ions occupation on different Pt sites is still unclear. In the present work, by comparing the fluorine ions occupation on different Pt facets, we found that the fluorine ions occupation could decrease the numbers of adsorption sites on Pt(100) and Pt(111) surface. On Pt(100) facet, a fluorine ion occupation affect the four adjacent adsorption sites for H-2 and O-2 molecules adsorption, while, on Pt(111) surface, a fluorine ion occupation could affect the six adjacent adsorption sites for H-2 and O-2 molecules adsorption. The difference of fluorine ions occupation on the Pt(100) and Pt(111) facets led to the different adsorption strength of hydrogen and oxygen molecules, which further induced the activiation difference of hydrogen and oxygen on Pt co-catalyst. The results of density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicated that the hydrogen and oxygen adsorption energies on F/Pt(100) were higher than that on F/Pt(111) surface. The H-2/O-2-TPD, cyclic voltammetry and in-situ XPS experimental results also verified that the hydrogen and oxygen adsorption on F/Pt(100) surface was stronger than that of F/Pt(111) surface. The hydrogen and oxygen recombination experimental results showed that the hydrogen and oxygen recombination rates over F/Pt(100) surface was higher than that of F/Pt(111) surface. Upon light irradiation, the F/Pt(100)/TiO2 photocatalyst exhibited lower activity for overall water splitting than F/Pt(111)/TiO2 photocatalyst. Results in this paper provide a new avenue to promote seimiconductor catalyst for over-all water splitting by tuning the adsorption sites of hydrogen and oxygen on co-catalyst surface.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000517665200029

In the present work, the structural and electronic properties of 2D multilayer Zr2CO2, Hf2CO2 and Sc2CO2 are explored by density functional theory calculations. We found that the band gap of multilayer Zr2CO2 and Hf2CO2 becomes smaller with increasing layer number and the band edge positions demonstrate to be not suitable for driving the oxygen evolution reaction. However, applying an appropriate strain to multilayer Zr2CO2 and Hf2CO2 could make them into available photocatalysts for water splitting. For Sc2CO2, due to the built-in perpendicular electric field in monolayer Sc2CO2, there are more feasible stacking configurations of multilayer Sc2CO2, yet some of the multilayer Sc2CO2 are also proved to be potential photocatalysts for water splitting.									57	8	0	0	2	0	58			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000417063200049

We reveal that tuning energy distribution of nanoclusters via a simple surface ligand can drastically increase the catalytic activity towards efficient hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction simultaneously. A two-electrode based water electrolysis cell using this newly developed nanocluster catalyst operates at a low bias voltage of 1.55 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) in near-neutral pH solution for overall water-splitting.

In this study, bifunctional catalysts with Ni nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on MoO2 nanorods have been synthesized via in situ dissolution of NiMoO4-ZIF under an inert atmosphere without using hydrogen gas. The Ni-MoO2 catalyst exhibits high electrocatalytic activity by modulating the calcination temperature. Benefitingfrom the MOF transformation and accompanying Ni particles' outward diffusion, a precisely designed interface heterostructure between Ni and MoO2 was constructed. As a result, the optimized Ni-MoO2 catalyst achieves extremely low overpotentials of only 24 mV and 275 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. Furthermore, the catalyst required a small cell voltage of 1.55 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and remained stable over 20 h for overall water splitting. The proposed MOF-derived heterojunction protocol provides a general approach for designing and fabricating transition metal oxide catalysts for water electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000763000000001	35234780

Independently of the pH of solution, we found that at low overpotentials the order of activity increases from Cu(111) to Ag(111) to An(111). At high overpotentials, however, Cu(111) and Ag(1 11) are much more active than An(111). An interpretation of the variation in activity is presented based on the premise that the rate of the ORR is controlled by two factors: a chemical-dependent part, Delta G(theta)(*) = Delta G(0)(*) + gamma Delta G(Theta)(0) Theta(ad), and the pre-exponential part which is determined by the adsorption of spectator species (Theta(ad)) and the availablitiy of bare metal sites, i.e., the (1- Theta (ad)) term.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0942-9352			WOS:000250768300019

Here, we report a general strategy to create transition metal-doped ultrathin RuO2 nanowires (M-doped RuO2 NWs, M = Fe/Co/Ni) featuring a networked structure, a high density of defects and grain boundaries, as superior water splitting catalysts over a broad pH range. The detailed electrocatalytic results reveal that the M-doped RuO2 NWs exhibit a volcano-like electrocatalytic performance as a function of the transition metal doped. The optimized Co-doped RuO2 NWs exhibit superior oxygen evolution reaction activity with an overpotential of 200 mV to generate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under acidic conditions, while the Ni-doped RuO2 NWs show robust hydrogen evolution reaction activity with an overpotential of 52 mV in an alkaline environment. First-principles calculations show that these distinct electrocatalytic performances can be attributed to the balanced adsorption free energy of the intermediates triggered by modulation of d-band center theory after transition metal doping. Significantly, the M-doped RuO2 NWs are further demonstrated as the best catalysts for overall water splitting with superior activities and excellent stabilities under universal pH conditions, and the optimized Co-doped RuO2 NWs parallel to Ni-doped RuO2 NWs deliver a very low potential of 1.537 V and a small Tafel slope of 58.2 mV dec(-1) under acidic conditions, which are much lower values than those of the commercial Ir/C parallel to Pt/C system (1.642 mV and 80.2 mV dec(-1)). We have therefore demonstrated an unprecedented class of electrocatalysts with excellent performances for electrochemical water splitting across a broad pH range.									73	3	0	0	2	0	74			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463970400052

In this work, a chronopotentiometric technique was employed to activate the multicomponent non-noble metal oxyfluorides in-situ for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is interesting to unravel that the increasing applied current density helps to reconstruct the catalyst into nanoporous core-shell structure and introduce metal oxyhydroxide on the surface, which guarantees more channels for efficient ion/mass transportation and thus contributes to exposing more active sites for catalytic reaction. The activated five-membered oxyfluoride shows the best catalytic activity with overpotential of 348 +/- 2 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and a Tafel slope of 110.3 +/- 0.1 mV/dec, in contrast with the pristine one (532 +/- 2 mV & 240.2 +/- 0.1 mV/dec). It still maintains high stability after long time OER measurement, making it a promising succedaneum for noble metal catalysts. The high-entropy effect, amorphous state and high active sites density jointly contribute to its enhanced OER performance. This work provides new ideas for realizing the potential of inactive elements via entropy engineering and using electrochemical self-reconstruction to modify semiconductors for advanced water oxidation.

Here, an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst of in situ formed crystalline nickel metaphosphate on amorphous NiMoOx nanoarrays supported on nickel foam (c-Ni2P4O12/a-NiMoOx/NF) for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution is reported. The c-Ni2P4O12/a-NiMoOx/NF can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low potential of 78 mV for HER, and a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 250 mV for OER. Moreover, it only requires a small cell voltage of 1.55 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for robust water splitting with outstanding long-term durability over 84 h. Various spectroscopic studies reveal that in situ surface reconstruction is crucial for the enhanced catalytic activity, where c-Ni2P4O12/a-NiMoOx is transformed into c-Ni2P4O12/a-NiMoO4 during the HER process, and into c-Ni2P4O12/a-NiOOH in the OER process.

Herein, the ultra-fine bimetallic NiCoP catalysts in-situ embedded in P, N-codoped carbon nanofibers (NiCoP@PNCNF) were successfully fabricated via a facile electrospinning method with the help of phytic acid. Profiting from the unique macro-structural design and micro-electronic/geometric modification, as-prepared NiCoP@PNCNF catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic performance both for HER (110 = 98 mV) and OER (110 = 260 mV) in terms of the low overpotential and robust stabilities in alkaline solution. Meanwhile, XAFS analysis further demonstrated that the remarkable catalytic performance not only attributed to the introduction of heteroatom-doped carbon fibers as their improvements in the corrosion resistance, anti-agglomeration abilities, and conductivity, but also benefited from the local electronic/geometric structure alternations as the strong synergic effects between Ni/Co and P atoms. For practical application, the water splitting performance based on NiCoP@PNCNF electrodes was also investigated and exhibited a lower splitting potential (EJ=10, 1.645 V) over long-term stability tests. These insightful findings undoubtedly shed light on the design and fabrication of cost-effective and robust bifunctional transitionmetal phosphides electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000722425100002

It shows excellent performance toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline medium. The hybrid exhibits rapid kinetics for ORR with high electron transfer number of approximate to 3.97 and exciting durability superior to commercial Pt/C. It also demonstrates great potential with remarkable stability for HER and OER, requiring low overpotential of 118.1 and 351.4 mV, respectively, to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). An electrolyzer based on CoSx@Cu2MoS4-MoS2/NSG produces low cell voltage of 1.60 V and long-term stability, surpassing a device of Pt/C + RuO2/C. In addition, a Zn-air battery using cathodic CoSx@Cu2MoS4-MoS2/NSG catalyst delivers a high cell voltage of approximate to 1.44 V and a power density of 40 mW cm(-2) at 58 mA cm(-2), better than the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. These achievements are due to the rational combination of highly active core@shell CoSx@Cu2MoS4 with large-area and high-porosity MoS2/NSG to produce unique physicochemical properties with multi-integrated active centers and synergistic effects. The outperformances of such catalyst suggest an advanced candidate for multielectrocatalysis applications in metal-air batteries and hydrogen production.									112	6	0	0	8	0	112			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000509827900001

M(OAc)(2)center dot 4H(2)O (M = Co2+ and Ni2+, OAc- = acetate) reacted with 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid dipotassium (K2NDC) and in-situ deposited on the surface of PANI-NF to produce CoNi-NDC/PANI-NF composite. The reaction conditions of CoNi-NDC/PANI-NF were optimized as Co2+ and Ni2+ reacting at the starting ratio of 3: 2 at 60 degrees C for 20 h with the presence of PANI-NF. SEM images revealed that CoNi-NDC/PANI-NF sheets distributed uniformly on the surface of PANI-NF substrate. Compared to CoNi-NDC/NF, with PANI adhered, CoNi-NDC/PANI-NF sheets grew much smaller and distributed more uniformly. Also, CoNi-NDC/PANI-NF exhibited better electrocatalytic activities toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (with an overpotential of 323 mV at 10 mA/cm(2)), and a remarkable reaction kinetics (with a Tafel slope of 73.3 mV/dec). CoNi-NDC/PANI-NF shows horizon I-t curves for 20 h at 10 and 100mA/cm(2), indicating a high durability without degradation of the OER performance. Compared to most recently reported MOF-based composites, lower or comparable overpotential and Tafel slope of CoNiNDC/PANI-NF indicate it is a potential noble-metal-free electrocatalyst for OER.

Chem. Phys. 131, 144302 (2009)] are evaluated using anion photoelectron spectroscopy of an apparent intermediate, W2O6D2-. The spectrum of W2O6D2- is consistent with the W2O5-+D2O -> W2O6-+D-2 intermediate in which the initial water addition involves the interaction of the oxygen from D2O with a tungsten atom, approaching from a direction with the least repulsion from the W2O5- oxygen atoms, coupled with the interaction between a deuterium with a tungsten-tungsten bridging oxygen on the cluster. The presence of W2O6H2- and W2O6D2- suggests that there is insufficient internal energy in the complex to surmount the barrier for rearrangement required for tungsten hydride and hydroxide formation necessary for H-2 or D-2 evolution, which was calculated to be energetically favorable. The quality of the calculations is verified by direct comparison between experimental photoelectron spectra of W2O5- and W2O6- and spectral simulations generated from the lowest energy structures calculated for W2O5-, W2O6- and their corresponding neutrals. The results shed light on the importance of repulsion on the pathway a reaction follows under room temperature conditions. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics.

Manganese oxide would be a good candidate because of its low cost, abundant supply, and environmental benignity if not for its relatively low activity compared with noble metals. To improve the ORR activity of manganese oxide, we developed a sulfurization process to create pores in 2D manganese oxide nanosheets. The nanoporous MnO2 nanosheets (np-MnO2-ns) prepared as such contain 7nm pores in the nanosheets and their half-wave potential (0.73V) is 40mV more positive than that of pore-free MnO2 nanosheets (0.69V). The higher ORR activity of np-MnO2-ns may be attributed to the combination of a large surface area and the presence of high-ORR-activity Mn3+/4+ sites. The np-MnO2-ns also showed an enhanced oxygen evolution reaction activity and delivered a good performance in rechargeable Zn-air batteries.									19	2	0	0	0	0	19			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000423197900013

Increase of the system pressure has been acknowledged as one of the effective measures in CLC for sufficient conversion of coal along with affiliated benefits for CO2 sequestration, but the complex consequences as incurred should be well considered. In this research, reaction of a typical Chinese bituminous coal of high sulfur content (designated as LZ) with CuFe2O4 combined oxygen carrier (OC) within 0.1-3.0 MPa in the CO2 atmosphere was systematically investigated, with focus on the effect of the system pressure to the conversion of LZ coal, transfer of the oxygen involved in CuFe2O4, sulfur evolution and redistribution. Sequential reactions of CuFe2O4 with the volatiles emitted from pyrolysis of LZ coal and further reaction with the released gasification products and residual char were accomplished, which was beneficial to overcome the mass transfer limitation of the reducing gases evolved from LZ coal to OC under the pressurized conditions and alleviate the inhibition effect resulting from accumulation of the transferred reactive gases around the surroundings of OC. And thus, under the pressurized conditions, improved conversion of LZ coal was reached by oxidization of more intractable C-C/C-H groups to oxygen bound carbon groups. Meanwhile, deep reduction of the added CuFe2O4 occurred with deficient Fe3O4 at the lower valence being formed, which would interact with the silicon minerals present in LZ coal to form various iron silicates. Furthermore, sulfur evolution from coal was found to directionally interact with the reduced CuFe2O4 to mainly form solid Cu2S due to their high combination potential. And deeper reduction of Cu2S was instigated especially at 3.0 MPa with Cu1.8S formed, and the total solid sulfur fraction was increased with the elevated system pressure. Overall, comprehensive information on the interaction of coal of high sulfur content with CuFe2O4 under the extended pressurized conditions around 0.1-3.0 MPa was provided, which would be meaningful for the realistic pressurized CLC in the future.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1743-9671	1746-0220		WOS:000718137200003

However, so far the majority of electrocatalysts require a substantial overpotential (eta) (approximately >250 mV) to catalyze the bottleneck oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To overcome this large overpotential for OER, herein we report the growth of nickel-cobalt-selenide (NiCoSe2) nanosheets over 3D nickel foam (NF) via a facile and scalable electrodeposition method. The resulting 3D NiCoSe2/NF hybrid electrode requires an overpotential of merely 183 mV to reach the current density (J) of 10 mA cm(-2). To the best of our knowledge, this is the lowest eta value reported so far for any earth-abundant material-based OER electrocatalyst to attain the same current density. Moreover, a significant reduction in Tafel slope (88 mV dec(-1)) is observed between bare NF and NiCoSe2/NF. Hence, as a result, the 3D hybrid NiCoSe2/NF OER electrode outperforms the previously reported electrocatalysts including the expensive state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts like RuO2 and IrO2. Such enhancement in the OER catalytic efficiency of NiCoSe2 nanosheets over NF can be attributed to its enormous electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) (108 cm(2)), large roughness factor (270), highly conductive NF substrate, and the presence of multiple catalytically active OER species (NiOOH and CoOOH) on its surface. In addition, 3D hybrid NiCoSe2/NF electrocatalyst was tested for hydrazine oxidation for its bifunctional utilization. Much lower onset potential values (-0.7 V vs SCE) and high current densities (>200 mA cm(-2)) are observed for 3D hybrid NiCoSe2/NF when benchmarked against bare NF (-0.4 V and <50 mA cm(-2)). Furthermore, 3D hybrid NiCoSe2/NF OER electrode shows excellent stability of 50 h for continuous OER in strongly alkaline solutions while maintaining its enormous ECSA, chemical composition, and structural morphology. The excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity, long-term stability, and facile preparation method enable NiCoSe2/NF hybrid electrode to be a viable candidate for its widespread use in various water-splitting technologies.									62	4	0	0	1	0	63			2168-0485			WOS:000434491600060

Polymerization and condensation of aromatic rings through loss of aromatic hydrogen are shown to be major chemical reactions in carbonization of both oxidized pitches. Characteristic of oxidized pitches in carbonization is the evolution of considerable amounts of CO, CO2 and H2O caused by decomposition of oxygen-containing groups introduced by oxidation. Thermal decomposition of the oxygen-containing groups probably initiates polymerization of pitch molecules before the major chemical reactions. The polymerization promotes the conversion of a fusible fibre into an infusible one. Of the oxygen-containing groups, carboxyl is decomposed at the lowest temperature. The oxidized petroleum pitch contains a larger number of carboxyl groups than the oxidized coal-tar pitch because the former has more aliphatic structures which can be converted into carboxyl groups by oxidation. The results strongly suggest that the petroleum mesophase pitch is made infusible more easily than the coal-tar mesophase pitch.									19	1	0	0	0	1	20			0016-2361			WOS:A1993KM50500004

In view of the thermodynamic limitations imposed by a positive Gibbs free energy, we examine the feasibility and extent of hydrogen formation from alcohol dehydrogenation using alumina-supported Ag catalysts. The results showed that in a closed system at 120 degrees C, the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde was limited by the available oxygen. The energetically demanding acceptorless route with hydrogen evolution contributed less than 2.5% to the overall conversion. The presence of oxygen as an acceptor is vital for the progress of the reaction. In open systems even without an active influx of oxygen, alcohol dehydrogenation occurred readily but water was the main product rather than hydrogen.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000372152100015

However, Si photoanode towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly challenged due to its poor stability and catalytic inactivity. The integration of highly active electrocatalysts with Si photoanodes has been considered to be an effective strategy to improve their OER performance by accelerating the reaction kinetics and inhibiting Si photocorrosion. In this work, ultra-small NiFe nanoparticles are deposited onto the n-Si/Ni/NiOOH surface to improve the activity and stability of Si photoanodes by engineering the electrocatalyst and Si interface. Ultra-small NiFe nanoparticles can introduce oxygen vacancies via modulating the local electronic structure of Ni hosts in NiOOH electrocatalysts for fast charge separation and transfer. Besides, NiFe nanoparticles can also serve as a co-catalyst exposing more active sites and as a protection layer preventing Si photocorrosion. The as-prepared n-Si/Ni/NiOOH/NiFe photoanode exhibits excellent OER activity with an onset potential of 1.0 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a photocurrent density of similar to 25.2 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus RHE. This work provides a promising approach to design high-performance Si photoanodes by surface electrocatalyst engineering.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000529531500013	32227016

Herein, FeNi alloy confined in N-doped carbon nanosheets (FeNi@NCSs) was harvested via a facile complexation-pyrolysis strategy from the mixture of guanine and metal chlorides. After strictly exploring the pyrolysis temperature and metal types, the resulted FeNi@NCSs showed greatly improved performances on both the ORR (onset potential of 0.93V and half-wave potential of 0.84V) and OER (overpotential of 318mV at 10mAcm-2 and 379mV at 100mAcm-2). Further, the FeNi@NCSs based Zn-air battery exhibited a higher open circuit voltage (1.496V), a larger power density (128.8mWcm-2), and prominent durability (360 cycles, 120h).

It has been widely recognized that this unusual situation, which so profoundly affects the physical properties, should also influence the surface chemical behavior. This paper explores the surface chemistry of TiC(100) and VC(100) with oxygen, and the potential impact of surface electronic structure on this chemistry. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) were employed to observe the chemical state and specific bonds formed between resultant materials in the interfacial region. We find that oxygen adsorbed dissociatively on both surfaces, but discriminated between them by reacting with TiC to form an oxide while forming a metastable overlayer of V=O species on VC. It is proposed that the reaction on TiC was initiated by the preference of oxygen for the carbon atom, due to the predominantly C 2p character of the highest occupied energy level, resulting in evolution of CO, and oxidation of the surface. This reaction was hindered on VC, where the additional electron resides in a predominantly V 3d level. Limited oxidation proceeded on VC with high temperature anneals following room temperature exposure. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

It is found that the doping of FePcs into the Z8Nc precursor plays a crucial role in the structural evolution of the resulting hollow-core porous carbon as well as its high catalytic performance. Doped carbon catalysts derived from either Z8Ncs or FePcs exhibit poor activity towards oxygen reduction, whereas the catalyst derived from Z8Ncs impregnated/covered with FePcs exhibits extremely high performance in both acidic and alkaline media. In 0.1 M HClO4, its onset potential reaches up to 0.910 V, and its half-potential (0.790 V) is only 60 mV lower than that of the 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst (0.850 V). In 0.1 M KOH, its ORR activity even surpasses that of Pt/C. We suggest that the high performance of the catalyst is attributable to the following factors: (i) the high active site density caused by doping FePcs into/onto the highly porous, N-rich Z8Ncs, (ii) the high surface area and adequate active site exposure caused by its hollow spherical morphology, and (iii) the hierarchical porous structure which further facilitates the diffusion and adsorption of oxygen molecules.									31	2	0	0	2	0	31			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000376091600042		
J	Kwon, Sun Kuk; Park, Jun Seok; Park, Joo Hyun								Influence of Refractory-Steel Interfacial Reaction on the Formation Behavior of Inclusions in Ce-containing Stainless Steel								ISIJ INTERNATIONAL				55	12			2589	2596		10.2355/isijinternational.ISIJINT-2015-125				2015	2015	Effect of Ce addition on the interfacial reaction between alumina refractory and 25wt%Cr-20wt%Ni-4wt%Si-0.5wt%Mn stainless steel deoxidized by Al at 1 873 K was investigated to understand the contribution of the refractory-steel reaction to the inclusion evolution processes. The oxygen content markedly decreased by Al deoxidation, followed by a sluggish decrease by Ce addition greater than 0.5 wt%. The Ce content continuously decreased, but the higher the initial Ce content, the lower the Ce-decreasing rate was obtained. The content of Al initially decreased due to the formation of Al-rich inclusions, followed by an abrupt increase mainly due to a reduction of alumina refractory by Ce at the steel-refractory interface. The content of Al decreased again because of the formation of CeAlO3 compound not only as inclusions but also as refractory-steel reaction products. The CeAl11O18 and CeAlO3 were formed at the refractory side, while the Ce2O3 and CeAlO3 were formed at the steel side in the 0.5 wt% and 1.0 wt% Ce added systems. From the refractory-steel reaction mechanism, the process of inclusion evolution was proposed to three steps as follows. The initial SiO2-rich oxides are reduced by Al, resulting in the formation of aluminosilicates inclusions (Step 1). The Al2O3 in the inclusions are reduced by cerium, resulting in the formation of Ce-rich oxides (Step 2). Because the Ce content continuously decreased due to the refractory-steel reaction, the inclusions transform from Ce-Al complex oxides to Al-rich aluminosilicates and from Ce2O3 to Ce-Al complex oxides in the 0.1 wt% and 0.5 wt% Ce added systems (Step 3).									43	5	0	0	0	0	47			0915-1559	1347-5460		WOS:000367424300010

Our results demonstrate the importance of two-site reactivity and of purely chemical steps with the associated activation energies. Taking the electrochemical potential explicitly into account leads to modifications of the reaction energy profiles finally leading to the proposition of a new family of mechanisms involving tetraoxidane intermediates.

Photooxidation and photoreduction in photocatalysis are generally separated from each other, which arises from the hole-electron separation on photocatalyst surface. Here, we show with widely studied photocatalyst Pt/TiO2 as a model, that concentrating abundant oxygen vacancies only at the metal-oxide interface can locate hole-driven oxidation sites in proximity to electron-driven reduction sites for triggering unusual reactions. Solar hydrogen production from aqueous-phase alcohols, whose hydrogen yield per photon is theoretically limited below 0.5 through conventional reactions, achieves an ultrahigh hydrogen yield per photon of 1.28 through the unusual reactions. We demonstrated that such defect engineering enables hole-driven CO oxidation at the Pt-TiO2 interface to occur, which opens up room-temperature alcohol decomposition on Pt nanoparticles to H-2 and adsorbed CO, accompanying with electron-driven proton reduction on Pt to H-2.									43	2	0	0	1	0	43			0027-8424			WOS:000468403400014	31064878

However, the discovery and optimization of such functional materials are great challenges because they are still hampered by material inherencies and thermodynamic limits. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of a novel material structure via atomistic doping and nanoscale compositing, a panoscopic alloying powder (PAP) of cobalt in a CeO2-ZrO2 solid solution. This novel structure possesses superior oxygen-storage capacity (OSC) and improved structural stability because it retains the best features of both transition metal oxides and ceria-based ceramics. According to the thermogravimetry and dilatometry measurements of a 10 mol% PAP sample, (Ce0.65Co0.10)Zr0.25O2-delta, at 800 degrees C under cyclic reduction-oxidation, an OSC of 2312 mu mol-O g(-1) was successfully obtained with negligible structural change and a linear strain of 1%.

Here, a linkage-functionalized modification approach to tackle these challenges via a synchronous lithium oxidation strategy is reported. The doping of Ce in the bulk phase activates the pseudo-bonding effect, effectively stabilizing the lattice oxygen evolution and suppressing the structure distortion. Interestingly, it also induces the formation of spinel phase Li(4)Mn(5)O(12)in the subsurface, which in turn constructs the phase boundaries, thereby arousing the interior self-built-in electric field to prevent the outward migration of bulk oxygen anions and boost the charge transfer. Moreover, the formed coating layer Li(2)CeO(3)with oxygen vacancies accelerates Li(+)diffusion and mitigates electrolyte cauterization. The corresponding cathode exhibits superior long-cycle stability after 300 cycles with only a 0.013% capacity drop and 1.76 mV voltage decay per cycle. This work sheds new light on the development of Li-rich Mn-based oxide cathodes toward high energy density applications.									79	5	0	0	2	0	81			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000568794600001

Formate is a popular product from CO2 reduction, but its reaction selectivity is usually unsatisfactory. Tin-based materials have attracted the most attention for formate production at present. Unfortunately, most of them only exhibit moderate selectivity in a narrow and highly cathodic potential window. In this study, it is demonstrated that traditionally under-explored bismuth has a much greater potential for formate production than tin or other materials. Mesoporous bismuth nanosheets are prepared here by the cathodic transformation of atomic-thick bismuth oxycarbonate nanosheets. They enable the selective CO2 reduction to formate with large current density, excellent Faradaic efficiency (approximate to 100%) over a broad potential window and great operation stability. Moreover, Bi nanosheets are integrated with an oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst in full cells, and achieve efficient and robust solar conversion of CO2/H2O to formate/O-2.									203	21	0	0	14	0	206			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000453273200004

In this work, the OER activity of cobalt- molybdenum metal-organic framework (Co-Mo-MOF)-based materials was significantly improved by controlling 3D and 2D framework structures, namely, Co-Mo-3D and Co-Mo-2D, respectively. When Co-Mo-3D was reacted in an alkaline electrolyte, a highly porous gyroid morphology with a large surface area was formed and designated as KOH-treated Co-Mo-3D. The KOH-treated Co-Mo-3D demonstrated superior OER electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 210 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and small Tafel slope of 50 mV dec-1 in alkaline solution. In addition, KOH-treated Co-Mo-3D exhibited excellent long-term durability at different voltages. The detailed structure transformation of Co-Mo-MOFs during the reaction was also provided by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), and ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the hydrogen-bonding network system formed in Co-Mo-3D plays an important role in assisting proton transfer and enhancing the catalytic activity of the OER. This work opens up a new prospect for the design and development of catalytically active pillar-layered MOF catalysts for OERs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000835504000001

The bulk of current research highlights promising uses of layered Sn chalcogenides with limited discourse on the relevance of Sn valency or crystal structures to their properties. We therefore examine the electrochemistry of orthorhombic SnS and hexagonal SnS2, and determine the implications to their electrocatalytic applications, namely, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Higher inherent electroactivity has been demonstrated in SnS2 as indicated by three distinct cathodic signals juxtaposed with a broad reduction peak in the largely electro-inactive SnS. In addition, SnS2 exhibits a faster heterogeneous electron transfer (HET) rate than SnS, though both are of less-than-sterling showing when compared to the glassy carbon (GC) electrode in terms of current intensity. The low onset potentials and current do not auger well for SnS and SnS, as electrocatalysts for ORR and OER. Contrarily, both Sn chalcogenides fare better as HER electrocatalysts, surpassing the GC electrode. SnS2 exudes stronger HER electrocatalytic behavior than SnS. The differing HER performance is explained by means of HER electrode kinetics and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), SnS2 demonstrates significantly faster HER kinetics than SnS. The DFT study unveiled that the high electrocatalytic showing of SnS2 originated from the propitious Delta G(H) at the S edges. Conversely, Delta G(H) of SnS at all edges are disadvantageous for HER. The results provide crucial knowledge on the electrochemistry and electrocatalysis of Sn chalcogenides and create opportunities for future developments.									68	1	0	0	5	0	68			1932-7447			WOS:000386640800022

Unimolecular isopropanol (IPA) dehydration at 415 K, a probe reaction, occurred on Bronsted acid sites of these oxygen-modified carbides with an intrinsic activation energy of 93 +/- 1.3 kJ mole(-1) via an E-2 elimination mechanism with a kinetically-relevant step of beta-hydrogen scission. Site densities were estimated via in situ 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine (DTBP) titration and used to calculate a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.1 s(-1), which was independent of site density. Oxygen co-processing allows for facile in situ tunability of acidic and metallic sites on highly oxophilic metal carbides. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, a hybrid material consisting of CoS2 strongly coupled to the iron-nitrogen-doped carbon (FeNC) (FeNC-CoS2) is developed as a formidable bifunctional oxygen toxy electrocatalysts. The FeNC-CoS2 catalyst displays good electron and mass transfer capabilities, exposing a great deal of ORR/OER active sites. Hence, it exhibits superior catalytic activity and durability (E-1/2 = 0.848 V) and OER (E-j = 10 mA cm(-2) = 1.608 V). Further, assembled rechargeable zinc-air battery displays remarkable discharge peak power density similar to 117.6 mW cm(-2) and a high capacity of 581.3 mAh gZn(-1), as well as excellent reversibility and stability. This study provides a good guidance and reference for the design and preparation of affordable excellent-performance bifunctional catalysts in the future.

J	Kapalka, Agnieszka; Foti, Gyoergy; Comninellis, Christos								Determination of the Tafel slope for oxygen evolution on boron-doped diamond electrodes								ELECTROCHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS				10	4			607	610		10.1016/j.elecom.2008.02.003				APR 2008	2008	It has been reported that the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes appears at high overpotential and results in unusually high Tafel slope. In this work, we have studied the OER in 1 M HClO4 on BDD macroelectrode and microelectrodes-array (MEA). The correction of the anodic polarization curve for ohmic drop has been performed on BDD macroelectrode taking into account the total uncompensated resistance of the studied system. On BDD MEA, no correction of the polarization curve was necessary due to the small contribution of ohmic drop to the measured potential. At low overpotential (<1.2 V), abnormally high Tafel slopes (340 and 680 mV dec(-1) on BDD MEA and BDD, respectively) have been observed. Such high slopes may result from the presence of surface redox couples/functional groups which act as a barrier for OER on BDD. In this potential region, the Tafel slope depends strongly on the state of the electrode surface. In the high overpotential region (> 1.2 V), the Tafel slope has been found equal to 120 mV dec(-1), which is the theoretical value considering a first or a second electron transfer step as the rate determining step.

Herein, a novel hybrid comprising Fe9S10 anchored onto nitrogen and sulfur dualdoped graphene (Fe9S10/N,S-G) was obtained via a two-step method, namely a pi-pi assemble process of p-phenyl-bis(3,4-dicyanophenyl) thioether iron polyphthalocyanine (PTFePPc) and graphene oxide and a pyrolysis procedure. It is worth noting that the Fe9S10/N, S- G obtained at 700 degrees C facilitated a direct four-electron catalytic pathway toward ORR with a low yield of hydrogen peroxide, favored a quick kinetic process with a small Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1) for its decent ORR activity, and achieved excellent operational stability in an alkaline medium. Furthermore, the proposed electrocatalyst also favored good OER performance, comparable with the benchmark RuO2. The superior electrocatalytic activity of the composite is mainly attributed to the electronic coupling between nitrogen and sulfur atoms doped in the graphene, the highly active sites of Fe9S10 and Fe-N, and the synergistic effects between Fe9S10 and N,S-G.									34	2	0	0	2	0	34			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000396137800015

We determine the activation energy of the initial adsorption step by ab initio calculations and derive an effective sticking coefficient. We show that this quantity essentially determines the film conformity and deposition rate of self limiting ALD processes. Implementing this effective model into a custom feature scale simulator, coupled to a fluid dynamical reactor simulator, a consistent description of ALD on atomistic, feature, and reactor scale is obtained. With this multi scale approach it is possible for the first time to simulate film profile evolution during dielectric ALD into high aspect ratio trenches for future DRAM generations.

In contrast, urea electrolysis can achieve higher energy conversion efficiency and has the prospect of urea-rich wastewater purification. Herein, porous and amorphous CoSx(OH)ycore-shell nanoneedles on Ti-mesh (P-CoSx(OH)yNN/Ti) are successfully synthesized as a bifunctional catalyst for urea electrolysis. These nanoneedles have a high aspect ratio, and are covered by a large amount of ultra-thin small nanosheets. The amorphous and porous properties and the small nanosheets on nanoneedles result in a high specific surface area and abundant active sites. P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti exhibits outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. When the current density reached 10 mA cm-2, the overpotential was only 86 mV in 1.0 M KOH. Furthermore, P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti provides abundant Co3+ and oxygen vacancies, which are favorable to improve the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activity. P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti requires a potential of 1.3 V at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for the UOR, much smaller than that of RuO2 (1.45 V). When P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti is used as both the cathode and anode in a two-electrode configuration for urea electrolysis a small potential of 1.3 V is required to output a current density of 10 mA cm-2, lower than that of the Pt/C||RuO2 couple (1.43 V) as well as other recently reported electrocatalysts. Urea electrolysis can be driven by just a small AA-size battery (1.5 V) and solar panel. Meanwhile, the two-electrode configuration also shows superior long-term stability.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2050-7488			INSPEC:20659792

However, their low intrinsic conductivity remains a major hurdle to be overcome. An effective strategy is to make thin coatings of TMOs on a conducting substrate with high surface area, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene. The preparation of such composites usually involves functionalization of the carbon materials and the current methods commonly require hazardous chemicals, high energy consumption and thus pose environmental concerns. We hereby report Fenton-reaction-inspired synthesis as a green and facile alternative to make composites of MWCNT with TMO or layered double hydroxide (LDH). The resulting Fe2O3/MWCNT composite shows high capacity, superior rate and cycle performance as an anode material for lithium ion battery. Similarly-prepared NiFe LDH/MWCNT composite exhibits high OER electrocatalytic activity and ultra-high stability. The high electrochemical performances in both cases are attributed to the nanosized low crystalline oxide/hydroxide particles anchored on the conducting MWCNT scaffold. This facile yet effective synthesis method features three principles in green chemistry, i.e., pollution prevention, less hazardous chemicals, and high energy efficiency. It marks a generic approach that is also applicable to other transition metals such as manganese and cobalt. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

This method provides for the first time a process by which the chemistry of aluminosilicate-based cementitious materials may be accurately simulated by pure synthetic systems, allowing elucidation of physicochemical phenomena controlling alkali-aluminosilicate gel formation which has until now been impeded by the inability to isolate and control key variables. Phase evolution and nanostructural development of these materials are examined using advanced characterisation techniques, including solid state MAS NMR spectroscopy probing Si-29, Al-27 and Na-23 nuclei. Gel stoichiometry and the reaction kinetics which control phase evolution are shown to be strongly dependent on the chemical composition of the reaction mix, while the main reaction product is a Na2O-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O type gel comprised of aluminium and silicon tetrahedra linked via oxygen bridges, with sodium taking on a charge balancing function. The alkali-aluminosilicate gels produced in this study constitute a chemically simplified model system which provides a novel research tool for the study of phase evolution and microstructural development in these systems. Novel insight of physicochemical phenomena governing geopolymer gel formation suggests that intricate control over time-dependent geopolymer physical properties can be attained through a careful precursor mix design. Chemical composition of the main N-A-S-H type gel reaction product as well as the reaction kinetics governing its formation are closely related to the Si/Al ratio of the precursor, with increased Al content leading to an increased rate of reaction and a decreased Si/Al ratio in the N-A-S-H type gel. This has significant implications for geopolymer mix design for industrial applications.									53	3	0	0	2	0	57			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000372608300015	26911317

The Schottky effect of metal-semiconductor heterojunction affords a built-in electric field at the interfaces to enhance electron transport, whereas the intertwined structure of one-dimensional (1D) NPCNTs facilitates the mass transfer of reactants and intermediates. Therefore, the as-prepared Co/Co2P@NPCNTs catalyst exhibits outstanding bifunctional ORR/OER activities, which are superior to those of commercial Pt/C and RuO2. It can also deliver a high power density and cycling life when used as the cathode for rechargeable ZABs. Theoretical calculation confirms that the spontaneous electron transport from Co to Co2P enables an up-shifted d-band center of Co/Co2P heterojunctions, which is beneficial for the intermediate adsorption in electrocatalytic process.									16	0	0	0	4	0	16			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000707126000245

The electrocatalytic properties of the products towords oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are further investigated. Benefitting from its unique structural characteristics, the hierarchically porous MgMn2O4 microspheres exhibit more positive onset potential and enhanced current density than the MgMn2O4 blocks and irregular sheets, and their ORR catalytic performance is better than the pure manganese oxide (Mn2O3) which is prepared through the same method. In addition, the MgMn2O4 microspheres own superior durability and methanol tolerance than that of Pt/C catalysts in spite of slight negative onset potential, which can be a promising non-noble metal ORR catalyst.Graphical AbstractLSV curves measured at 1600rpm in O-2-saturated 0.1M KOH electrolyte with a scan rate of 5mVs(-1).

Inspired by a natural oxygen-evolving multinuclear manganese cluster, a number of water oxidation catalysts based on multinuclear transition-metal complexes have been developed over the last three decades. In recent years, in parallel with the discovery of mononuclear oxygen-evolving complexes, both experimental and theoretical studies have yielded important insight into O-O bond-formation pathways in these water-oxidizing complexes. In this microreview, we will present an updated view of selected current literature focusing on the working mechanism of ruthenium-based water oxidation catalysts and on the development of rationally designed ruthenium complexes that activate water at mild potentials.									36	2	0	0	2	0	36			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000336741600005		
J	Chen Yongyi; Tang Dian								Studying on the Titanium Anodes Coating with Chlorine Evolution and Oxygen Evolution Syncretism								RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING				38	7			1214	1218						JUL 2009	2009	The titanium anode with sandwich coating structure was prepared by a sol-gel method. The anode was composed of three layers by firstly the oxide based layer coated with Ti70%-Ru30% on the titanium substrate, and then the inter-layer coated with Ir70%-Ta30%, the surface layer coated with Ti70%-Ru30%. The physical and electrochemical properties of the titanium anode with sandwich structure were studied by XRD, electrode potential, polarization curve, cyclic voltammetry and accelerated life tests. The results showed that the anode coating is composed mainly of rutile phases (Ti, Ru)O-2, IrO2 and amorphous Ta2O5. The titanium anode has excellent electro-catalysis activities for both chlorine evolution and oxygen evolution. In the electrochemical conditions for chlorine evolution, the anode can keep better potential stabilities, and also shows a strong anticorrosive property for electrolyzing at high current density and in the high acidity. As the result, the titanium anode act as a good anode for both chlorine evolution and oxygen evolution.									2	7	0	0	0	0	8			1002-185X			WOS:000269071700019

Consideration has been given to the case where the gas behind the wave front is in chemical equilibrium (D rarr D reflection). It has been shown that the presence of the condensed phase can substantially decrease the parameters of the reflected wave (its velocity, pressure, and temperature). Within the framework of a one-dimensional nonstationary approach and with allowance for the detailed kinetics of chemical reactions, the evolution of the shock wave in a stoichiometric hydrogen-oxygen mixture with sand particles in its reflection from a rigid wall has been calculated. The limiting particle concentration below which the reflected wave is of the detonation type and above which it is of the shock type has been found.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1062-0125			INSPEC:13481158

The immediate- to short-term changes in the oxide film were studied by open-circuit potential measurements and cyclic voltammetry. The results show that the intensity of the cathodic current peak related to oxygen reduction at around -0.7 Vsce, decreased and disappeared after 30 minutes of finishing the anodic oxidation. For titanium without anodization (non-coated titanium), the cyclic voltammograms show an anodic current in the range that begins at -0.9 Vsce and continues to more positive potentials (vs SCE), related to the hydrogen oxidation reaction. For anodically polarized titanium (coated titanium), in the anodic direction of the cyclic voltammograms an anodic current in the range that begins at -0.9 Vsce and continues to more positive potentials (vs SCE) was observed. In this case, the oxidation process is related to previous cathodic processes: the hydrogen formation and the cathodic transformation of titanium oxides before the oxygen reduction potential region.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0327-0793			WOS:000297832600001

Relatively little attention has been directed in the past for the synthesis and properties of -Fe nanoparticles. Herein, we demonstrate a NaOH-assisted and metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived method to prepare a novel catalyst featured by -Fe nanoparticles encapsulated into the porous N-doped carbon matrix. The Fe atoms doped in the MOF structure play an important role in the formation of stable -Fe. The catalysts exhibit superior catalytic activity with the four-electron transfer pathway for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline solution. Besides the Fe-N-x sites, -Fe nanoparticles are believed to play an important role in the superior ORR activity. However, it is suggested that the metal nanoparticles are not ORR active species, whereas they may activate the surrounding N/C layers, thus making the N/C layers more active toward ORR. In addition, the oxidized surface of the metal nanoparticles may also act as active species contributing to the ORR activity.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2199-692X			WOS:000464389000018

By heat-treating the gel films, electrochemical cells, LaCoO3/YSZ/LaCoO3 were fabricated. The effect of polyethylene glycol on the microstructure evolution of LaCoO3 and LaMnO3 thin films was investigated, and NO decomposition characteristics of LaCoO3 powders and the electrochemical cells were investigated at 600-800 degreesC. In the absence of oxygen, the LaCoO3 powder was active both in decomposition of NO and reduction of NO by C2H4. It was found that they lost their catalytic activity in the presence of 2% oxygen. By applying a direct current to LaCoO3/YSZ/LaCoO3 electrochemical cell, a good NO conversion rate could be obtained at relatively low current value even if excess oxygen is included in the reaction gas mixture.

The bridge oxygen is found to be the most stable hole trapping site, and it is of a p-type orbital perpendicular to the bridge oxygen row. How the hole reacts with a H2O molecule above the surface is investigated with constrained minimization method. The highest occupied molecular orbital of approaching H2O is found to hybridize with the hole orbital and to form bonding and antibonding orbitals. An electron is seen to be transferred from H2O to the bridge oxygen mediated by the formed bonding state. The electron transfer is accompanied by H2O dissociation concertedly, which results in a hydroxyl radical adsorbed on the surface sharing the hole orbital with an in-plane oxygen atom. The reaction pathway is also estimated.									65	2	0	0	5	0	66			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000302591300031

Copper deposition at the cathodic side and oxygen evolution at the anodic one were adopted as test reactions at the bipolar electrode, from an electrolyte solution with a copper concentration lower than 1000 mg dm(-3), pH 2 and 1 M Na2SO4 as supporting electrolyte. A mathematical model considering the leakage current is proposed, which can represent the tendency observed in the experimental data related to cathodic thickness and potential at both ends of the bipolar electrode. High values of leakage current were determined, which restricts the faradaic processes to small thicknesses at both ends of the bipolar electrode. Likewise, the performance of the bipolar electrochemical reactor for the treatment of effluents is experimentally and theoretically examined. In this case, the conversion for copper removal was 90.1% after 480 min of operation with one bipolar electrode and 94.8% after 300 min of operation with two bipolar electrodes at a total current of 3 A.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000289113500013

This catalyst demonstrated versatile bi-functional features towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in catalytic water splitting along with solar photo catalytic activity in the degradation of Methyl Orange (MO). XRD profile confirmed that composite presented an anatase and cubic phase for TiO2 and Co3O4, respectively, with the GO network. The morphological structures confirm flaky texture of Co3O4 with small irregular spheres of TiO2 nanoparticles randomly dispersed on the broken sheets of GO. GO and clusters of Co2+/Co3+ in different regions of host TiO2 are accountable for decreasing band gap in the composite samples. Co-O-Ti and Co-Ti-C linkages in the composite materials are confirmed by Raman and FTIR studies. In electro catalytic HER in alkaline medium GO/Co3O4-TiO2 catalyst illustrated low onset potential similar to 343 mV vs. RHE, high current density similar to 43 mA cm(-2) corresponding small Tafel slope similar to 97 mV/dec and small R-ct as compared to other catalysts. For HER in GO/Co3O4-TiO2, Co2+ sites are more catalytically active than Co3+ sites along with Ti4+ and GO provides the more active surface area by reducing the agglomeration between the mixed metal oxides. GO/Co3O4-TiO2 shows the highest photo catalytic performance over MO as compared to binary and ternary composites. Pining of metal oxides with reactive oxygen functional moieties of GO considerably improve the photo catalytic degradation activity and helpful in the separation of charge carriers for HER.

So far, the most active and stable electrocatalysts for the reaction are based on Pt group metals. Transition metal oxides (TMOs) constitute an alternative class of materials for achieving operational stability under oxidizing conditions. Unfortunately, TMOs are generally found to be less active than Pt. Here, we identify two reasons why it is difficult to find TMOs with a high ORR activity. The first is that TMO surfaces consistently bind oxygen atoms more weakly than transition metals do. This makes the breaking of the O-O bond rate-determining for the broad range of TMO surfaces investigated here. The second is that electric field effects are stronger at TMO surfaces, which further makes O-O bond breaking difficult. To validate the predictions and ascertain their generalizability for TMOs, we report experimental ORR catalyst screening for 7,798 unique TMO compositions that generally exhibit activity well below that of Pt.									55	0	0	0	4	0	55			2520-1158			WOS:000653656500001

One smart route for obtaining these ideal electrocatalysts is extracting active carbon materials from natural and cheap biomass waste. Here, we prepared a novel nitrogen self-doped porous graphitic carbon nanosheets (NPGCNs-NaCl) derived from a nitrogen-rich pruning of Lycium barbarum L. using NaCl crystal as intercalation agent. The as-obtained NPGCNs-NaCl possessed porous structure, large surface area, increased content of nitrogen and high graphitic carbon, and thus making it with high electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Most importantly, significantly enhanced stability and tolerance against methanol were observed compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst in alkaline solution. This work is believed to open a new avenue for manufacturing advanced and low-cost ORR electrocatalysts in fuel cells from biomass waste.									37	0	0	0	3	0	37			2168-0485			WOS:000414825900083

The as-synthesized La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.95Co0.05O3 nanowires exhibit high specific surface area of 27.96 m(2) g(-1), higher than the most of perovskite oxides synthesized by other researchers. The Co dopants can effectively regulate the electronic structure of perovskites. The one-dimensional mesoporous La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.95Co0.05O3 exhibits excellent bifunctional catalytic activity on account of low ORR overpotential of 435 mV, OER overpotential of 439 mV, and the outstanding battery performance (peak power density of 150.72 mW cm(-2) and 177 discharge-charge cycles). More importantly, density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrates that the enhanced ORR and OER electrocatalytic mechanism of La0.8Sr0.2Mn1-xCoxO3 originates from the regulated electronic structure with the most positive band center of O 2p, Mn 3d and Co 3d because of Co dopants.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000652656400003

However, the enhancement of their catalytic activity and stability are key challenges for practical applications. In this study, Au incorporated Co(OH)(2) nanostructures are electrochemically derived from co-deposited cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF) Au hybrids. This facile approach leads to the creation of Au incorporated amorphous cobalt hydroxide with superior performance for the overall water splitting reaction. This direct electrochemically derived Au-Co(OH)(2) composite exhibits excellent stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solutions and overcame, to a significant degree, the critical stability issues inherent to amorphous cobalt oxides. In contrast to Au free Co(OH)(2), the Au incorporated Co(OH)(2) nanocomposite demonstrates excellent bifunctional activity toward OER and HER. The optimized Au-Co(OH)(2) nanomaterials exhibit an OER and HER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at potentials of 1.61 and -0.424 V, respectively.

Here, a new strategy is proposed to synthesize oxygen and nitrogen codoped carbon nanofibers loaded with manganese oxides (MnO/Mn2O3/ONCNF-n) as an efficient electrocatalyst for ORR by using oxygen plasma surface etching. The MnO/Mn2O3/ONCNF-3 exhibit superior ORR performance in an alkaline electrolyte, which is attributed to various active sites including N and O heteroatoms, vacancies, and manganese oxides. Additionally, the fabricated homemade Al-air battery (AAB) with MnO/Mn2O3/ONCNF-3 exhibits a maximum power density of 129.7 mW cm(-2), demonstrating comparable performance to AABs based on the commercial Pt/C catalyst. This work provides a new approach of using O-2 plasma for enhancing the ORR catalytic activities of carbon materials.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000685245800043	34333971

In this study, mesoporous Ni1-xFexOy (0 <= x <= 1, 1 <= y <= 1.5) nanorods were synthesized by the facile thermal decomposition of Ni-Fe-based coordination polymers. These polymers passed their nanorod-like morphology to oxides, which served as active catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Increasing the Fe-doping amount to 33 at.% decreased the particle size and charge-transfer resistance and increased the surface area, resulting in a reduced overpotential (similar to 302 mV) at 10 mA/cm(2) and a reduced Tafel slope (similar to 42 mV/dec), which were accompanied by a far improved OER activity compared with those of commercial RuO2 and IrO2 electrocatalysts. At Fe-doping concentrations higher than 33 at.%, the trend of the electrocatalytic parameters started to reverse. The shift in the dopant concentration of Fe was further reflected in the structural transformation from a NiO (< 33 at.% Fe) rock-salt structure to a biphasic NiO/NiFe2O4 (33 at.% Fe) heterostructure, a NiFe2O4 (66 at.% Fe) spinel structure, and eventually to alpha-Fe2O3 (100 at.% Fe). The efficient water-oxidation activity is ascribed to the highly mesoporous one-dimensional nanostructure, large surface area, and optimal amounts of the dopant Fe. The merits of abundance in the Earth, scalable synthesis, and highly efficient electrocatalytic activity make mesoporous Ni-Fe binary oxides promising oxygen-evolving catalysts for water splitting.									48	6	0	0	1	0	48			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000401320700023

Defect engineering, although it offers a strategical promise to enhance the photocatalytic performance, has limitations that come from the ambiguity surrounding its role. In the current work, a comprehensive study on defects in promoting the charge transfer, band edge modulation, and surface reaction was carried out. The excess electrons springing from defects act like donor states and cause band bending at the junction interface. Characterization techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, and photoluminescence were employed to investigate defect functionality, and its ultimate effect on photocatalytic performance was studied by simultaneous H-2 production and methylene blue degradation. The role of graphene in optoelectronics and defect formation in the composite catalysts was explored. In addition, efforts have been made to unveil the reaction pathway for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction where excess defect density greatly hampered the quantum yield of the process. Results suggest that maintaining optimal defect concentration aborts the undesired thermodynamically favored back reactions. The conduction band and valence band values of the catalysts indicate that the photocatalytic mechanism was dominated by the electron pathway. Graphene acted as an effective electron sink when its concentration was around 2.5-3%. The superior activity of TiO2-ZnS-rGO was attributed to the narrow bandgap, rapid separation of photo-excited charge carriers, and favorable conduction band position for photocatalytic reactions. This work may assist in exploring the fundamental role of defects in driving the photocatalytic reactions and improve the selectivity in heterogeneous photocatalysis.									21	1	0	0	2	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526609100037	32067446

Intensive properties, such as the number of electrons transferred, are difficult to be considered conductivity-dependent. Four different perovskite oxide catalysts of different conductivities were investigated with varying carbon contents. More conductive environments surrounding active sites, achieved by more conductive catalysts (providing internal electric pathways) or higher carbon content (providing external electric pathways), resulted in higher number of electrons transferred toward more complete 4e reduction of oxygen, and also changed the rate-determining steps from two-step 2e process to a single-step 1e process. Experimental evidence of the conductivity dependency was described by a microscopic ohmic polarization model based on effective potential localized nearby the active sites.									54	1	0	0	1	0	54			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000368061800015	26568300

Based on aging is the result of the accumulation of oxidative damage', this article focuses on the production and evolution of reactive oxygen species and its damaging process. On this basis, a new understanding of the occurrence and development of aging is proposed: the aging process does not depend on the source of reactive oxygen species the amount of superoxide anion free radicals, it mainly relies on the concentration of free iron ions in the cells that can catalyze the Haber-Weiss reaction to generate hydroxyl radicals. When the concentration of iron ions exceeds the upper threshold, it will convert the superoxide anion free radicals in senescent cells into oxygen, making the cells' free radical reaction loses its source. This process switches the oxidized senescent cells into a highly reduced state, and is the turning point in the transformation from senescent cells to tumor cells.			在衰老与肿瘤关系研究中,始终存在一个令人困惑的问题,即衰老细胞如何逾越死亡壁垒,成功转化为肿瘤细胞。本文以衰老是氧化损伤累积的结果为依据,着重分析了活性氧的产生、演变和造成损伤的全过程,在此基础上对衰老的发生发展提出了新的认识:衰老进程不是取决于活性氧的源头超氧阴离子自由基的生成量,而是主要取决于细胞中能够催化Haber-weiss反应生成羟基自由基的自由铁离子浓度高低。当细胞内铁离子浓度超过阈值上限时,它又会将衰老细胞中超氧阴离子自由基转变为氧气,使细胞自由基反应失去源头,由氧化态转变为高度还原态,这就是衰老细胞转化为肿瘤细胞的转折点。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1004-1850			CSCD:7133109

Herein, firstly through pyrolysing tea dregs with inorganic salts, we developed a simple approach to synthesize a heteroatoms quaternary-doped (B, N, P, S) porous carbon as a new metal-free ORR catalyst. Remarkably, after doping with heteroatoms, such prepared hybrid material displays significantly higher onset potential and limiting diffusion current density than the corresponding undoped carbon with similar specific surface area, and much better stability than commercial Pt/C catalyst in alkaline and even neutral solutions. Notably, when used in a Zn-air battery, our hybrid catalyst can reveal comparable open circuit voltage and power density, but better stability than these of Pt/C catalyst as well.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2365-6549			WOS:000406682000049

While efficient ORR and OER have been reported using noble-metal based catalysts, their commercialization is cost prohibitive. In this Perspective, we discuss the potential of nonprecious metal based, mixed electronic-ionic conducting oxides (i.e., perovskites, double perovskites, and Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) oxides) for efficient oxygen electro-catalysis at high and low temperatures. The nonstoichiometry of oxygen in these materials provides key catalytic properties that facilitate efficient ORR/OER electrocatalysis. We discuss the importance of surface structure and composition as critical parameters to understand and tune the ORR/OER activity of these oxides. We argue that techniques facilitating controlled synthesis and characterization of the surface structures are key at achieving a correlation between structure and activity of these materials. We make the case for combinatorial approaches involving quantum chemical calculations combined with detailed characterization, controlled synthesis, and testing as effective ways for developing the fundamental knowledge at the molecular level required to guide the design of efficient nonstoichiometric, mixed metal oxides for oxygen electrocatalysis. We conclude by summarizing current advances and devising future directions in this area.									43	4	0	0	2	0	43			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000431926700002

Herein, a flexible free-standing bifunctional electrode (N-2-NiFe-PBA/NCF/CC-60) is constructed by the 3D spatial combination of CN vacancy-mediated NiFe Prussian Blue Analogue (NiFe-PBA) and N-doped carbon nanofibers (NCF) rooted on carbon cloth (CC). The in situ formed CN vacancies by N-2-plasma activation tune the local coordination environment and electronic structure of Ni-Fe active sites in NiFe-PBA, thus improving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic intrinsic activity, and restraining the loss of Fe element during OER process. The combination of NiFe-PBA and NCF presents a 3D interworking network structure, which exhibits a large specific surface and excellent electrical conductivity, thus guaranteeing sufficient, stable, and efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/OER active sites. Therefore, the N-2-NiFe-PBA/NCF/CC-60 electrode delivers high-efficiency OER activity with a low overpotential (270 mV at 50 mA cm(-2)) and excellent ORR performance with a positive potential of 0.89 V at 5 mA cm(-2). The N-2-NiFe-PBA/NCF/CC-60 based Zn-air batteries display outstanding discharge/charge stability for 2000 cycles. Meanwhile, the corresponding flexible Zn-air batteries with satisfactory mechanical properties exhibit a low voltage gap of 0.52 V at 1.0 mA cm(-2).									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2198-3844		WOS:000758844500001	35191617

A novel atomic-scale (Pt-O-x)-(Co-O-y) nonbonding active structure is designed and constructed by anchoring Pt single atoms and Co atomic clusters on the defective carbon derived from oxygen-rich coal tar pitch (CTP). The Pt loading mass is extremely low and only 0.56 wt%. A new nonbonding interaction phenomenon between Pt-O-x and Co-O-y is found and confirmed based on X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Based on the (Pt-O-x)-(Co-O-y) nonbonding active structure, surface chemical field coupling with electrocatalysis for the HER and ORR is confirmed. It is found that the (Pt-O-x)-(Co-O-y) nonbonding active structure exhibits high mass activities of 64.4 A cm(-2) mg(Pt)(-1) (at an overpotential of 100 mV) and 7.2 A cm(-2) mg(Pt)(-1) (at 0.8 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) for the HER and ORR, respectively. The values are 6.5 and 11.6 times as much as those of commercial 20% Pt/C.

However, the demand for ion-selective transport separator and precious metal electrocatalysts hampers their applications. To address this issue, we develop a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) separator that can selectively transport Zn2+ ions and an atomically dispersed Co electrocatalyst that can catalyze oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) in the challenging acidic medium. The selective ion transport behavior was associated with the Zn2+ ions' bonded ladder structure of PAN, which raises the ion migration energy barrier for the crossover of H+ and OH- In terms of electrocatalysts, extensive ex situ and in situ characterizations suggest that Co single-atom sites stably catalyze the OER and ORR Several types of AMABs (metals Zn, Si, Sn) were tested.

The reactions follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics where V-max = 2420 +/- 490 mol O-2 (mol 1)(-1) hr(-1) and K-M = 53 +/- 5 mM for oxone ([1] = 7.5 muM), and V-max = 6.5 +/- 0.3 mol O-2 (mol 1)(-1) hr(-1) and K-M = 39 +/- 4 mM for hypochlorite ([1] = 70 muM), with first-order kinetics observed in 1 for both oxidants. A mechanism is proposed having a preequilibrium between 1 and HSO5- or OCl-, supported by the isolation and structural characterization of [(terpy)(SO4)Mn-IV(O)(2)Mn-IV(O4S)(terpy)] (2). Isotope-labeling studies using (H2O)-O-18 and (KHSO5)-O-16 show that O-2 evolution proceeds via an intermediate that can exchange with water, where Raman spectroscopy has been used to confirm that the active oxygen of HSO5- is nonexchanging (t(1/2) >> 1 h). The amount of label incorporated into O-2 is dependent on the relative concentrations of oxone and 1. O-32(2):O-34(2):O-96(2) is 91.9 +/- 0.3:7.6 +/- 0.3:0.51 +/- 0.48, when [HSO5-] = 50 mM (0.5 mM 1), and 49 +/- 21:39 +/- 15:12 +/- 6 when [HSO5-] = 15 mM (0.75 mM 1). The rate-limiting step of Oz evolution is proposed to be formation of a formally Mn-V=O moiety which could then competitively react with either oxone or water/hydroxide to produce O-2. These results show that 1 serves as a functional model for photosynthetic water oxidation.									295	4	0	0	56	0	296			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000166698000009	11456544

M-N-C (M 1/4 transition metals) catalysts become one of the most promising electrocatalysts due to its ability to maximize the utilization of active atoms and combine the merit of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. Cu-N-C catalysts have been triggered recently because of not only their robust catalytic ac-tivity and efficiency in various electrochemical reactions (e.g. oxygen reduction/evolution, CO2 reduction, and nitrogen reduction) but also the avoidance of Fenton reaction and improved durability in acid environment. In this review, first an effort is made to summarize the development of Cu-N-C catalysts including preparation, characterization, performance, application, and theoretical exploration. Then, the performance-improving strategies are discussed in terms of the coordination environments of the re-action center and various CuNx fragments, as well as the reaction mechanism and selectivity, based on free energy diagram and electron structure analysis. Finally, the problems, challenges, and opportunities of Cu-N-C catalysts are discussed, providing a perspective for future studies. This review not only gives insights into understanding of the electrochemistry mechanism of Cu-N-C catalysts but also encourages more efforts in the practical application promptly.

There are roughly 30 extant bioluminescent systems that have evolved independently on Earth, with each system likely having unique enzymes responsible for catalysing the bioluminescent reaction. Bioluminescence is a chemical reaction involving a luciferin molecule and a luciferase or photoprotein that results in the emission of light. Some independent systems utilize the same luciferin, such as the use of tetrapyrrolic compounds by krill and dinoflagellates, and the wide use of coelenterazine by marine organisms, while the enzymes involved are unique. One common thread among all the different bioluminescent systems is the requirement of molecular oxygen. Bioluminescence is found in most forms of life, especially marine organisms.Bioluminescence in known to benefit the organism by: attraction, repulsion, communication, camouflage, and illumination. The marine ecosystem is significantly affected by bioluminescence, the only light found in the pelagic zone and below is from bioluminescent organisms.Transgenic bioluminescent organisms have revolutionized molecular research, medicine and the biotechnology industry. The use of bioluminescence in studying molecular pathways and disease allows for non-invasive and real-time analysis. Bioluminescence-based assays have been developed for several analytes by coupling luminescence to many enzyme-catalysed reactions.

One of the characteristic features was the rapid dominance of NO3- spectra, which is indicative of the strong influence of O-3 and NO2 produced by discharge in the early stages of negative ion evolution. Water vapor was also found to play a significant role in NO3- ion formation. The production of OH radicals by ion-molecule reactions involving H2O leads to the formation of HNO3 which accelerates the conversion of primary negative ions to NO3- ions. As a result, NO3- and NO3-HNO3 ions were observed as terminal ion observed as terminal ions. Another terminal ion observed was assigned to HCO3-HNO3. The reaction of OH- with CO2 is probably responsible for the formation of HCO3-. From considerations of ion reactivity, NO3- ions likely represent the most long-lived ion species in negative ion evolution in indoor air. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The oxidation of water to molecular oxygen requires four sequential oxidations; the sequentially oxidized forms of the catalytic site are called the S states. An extrinsic subunit, the manganese-stabilizing protein (MSP), promotes the efficient turnover of the S states. MSP can be removed and rebound to the reaction center; removal and reconstitution is associated with a decrease in and then a restoration of enzymatic activity. We have isotopically edited MSP by uniform C-13 labeling of the Escherichia coli-expressed protein and have obtained the Fourier transform infrared spectrum associated with the S-1 to S-2 transition in the presence either of reconstituted C-12 or C-13 MSP, C-13 labeling of MSP is shown to cause 30-60 cm(-1) shifts in a subset of vibrational lines. The derived, isotope-edited vibrational spectrum is consistent with a deprotonation of glutamic/ aspartic acid residues on MSP during the S, to S, transition; the base, which accepts this proton(s), is not located on MSP. This finding suggests that this subunit plays a role as a stabilizer of a charged transition state and, perhaps, as a general acid/base catalyst of oxy gen evolution. These results provide a molecular explanation for known MSP effects on oxygen evolution.									34	0	0	0	28	0	34			0021-9258			WOS:000083532100037	10542229

However, in the process of splitting water electrochemically, sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) curtails its applicability, as it drags energy input. Herein, we synthesized SrCo-Fe-O oxides to optimize their OER activity by varying the Co/Fe ratio. Among them, Sr2Co1.5Fe0.5O6-delta exhibited the best OER catalytic activity in the series, with an overpotential of 318 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 44.8 mV dec(-1). High-resolution neutron powder diffraction analysis identified an intermediate structure between the perovskite and brownmillerite, with alternating layers of disorderly orientated oxygen-deficient tetrahedra and fully stoichiometric octahedra. The unique stacking of tetrahedral and octahedral units facilitates desired interactions between the electrode surface and electrolyte. Theoretical calculations revealed that increased covalency of Co 3d and O 2p in Sr2Co1.5Fe0.5O6-delta oxide is another primary contributor to its augmented water oxidation ability. As a model for developing catalysts with such an intermediate structure, the synergetic effect of oxygen vacancy and hybridization between Co 3d and O 2p assured the Sr2Co1.5Fe0.5O6-delta oxide as a better catalyst for its enhanced OER activity.y									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000637003700051

Meanwhile, single metal atoms embedded in a two-dimensional material substrate (2D-substrate) have emerged as an outstanding catalyst. Herein, we report on computational ORR/OER efficiencies of a series of single atom catalyst systems, with a nitrogen- doped boron phosphide monolayer (N-3-BP) as the 2D-substrate, and with Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rh, Pd, Ir, and Pt as the single-atom subject (M). In brief, our density functional theory results show that the overpotentials for ORR/OER are low for CoN3-BP, NiN3-BP, and PtN3-BP, with {eta(ORR);eta(OER)} of {0.36; 0.42 V}, {0.29; 0.44 V}, and {0.32; 0.25 V}, respectively. The relevant attributes such as the chemical stability of the 2D-substrate in the ORR/OER environments, immobilization of the single-atom subject on the 2D-substrate, and mechanisms of the ORR/OER activity and the catalyst recovery on the MN3-BP catalysts were carefully examined. The key to the comparative study is how the electronic states of the reaction center near the Fermi level of the catalytic system match the frontier orbitals of ORR/OER reaction intermediates. In short, our method predicts the ORR/OER catalytic efficiencies of novel catalysts via a single-atom/2D-substrate design strategy.									42	1	0	0	1	0	42			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000595547400027	33172252

In this work, a novel process is developed to yield both Co and O vacancies in the synthetical Co3O4 nanosheets when subjected to a laser beam. The method, capable of creating both Co and O vacancies and embarking upon the prediction of the number of vacancies generated, is more reliable/controllable over other methods. The coupling of two types of vacancies eases the occurrence of Co3O4 oxidation reaction at a very low overpotential, which then facilities the OER at an overpotential of 290 mV with a small Tafel slope of 76 mV dec? 1, much better than the pristine Co3O4 and the benchmark RuO2. DFT calculations suggest that the induced multi- vacancies create trap state in the bandgap of Co3O4 promoting the adsorption capability and advancing the water splitting.									24	0	0	0	4	0	23			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000640488200001

Electrochemical fabrication of 3D quasi-amorphous pompon-like Co-O and Co-Se hybrid films from choline chloride/urea deep eutectic solvent for efficient overall water splitting								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				273				71	79		10.1016/j.electacta.2018.04.054				MAY 20 2018	2018	The development of earth-abundant, low-cost, highly active, and durable bifunctional catalysts competent for efficient electrochemical water-splitting is intensively demanding and of vital importance to realize high-purity hydrogen production. Herein, we report that 3D quasi-amorphous pompon-like Co-O and Co-Se hybrid films grown on copper foil (Co-O@Co-Se/Cu) can be electrochemically synthesized from a choline chloride and urea mixed deep eutectic solvent, denoted as Reline, via a facile one-step electrochemical deposition approach. Benefiting from the induction effect of Se, the obtained Co-O@Co-Se/Cu hybrid electrode exhibits strongly enhanced catalytic activity. The optimal Co-O@Co-Se/Cu sample shows good activity and excellent durability for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline solution with low overpotentials of 85 mV for HER and 340 mV for OER, respectively to reach a catalytic current of 10 mA cm(-2). The Co-Se component within the hybrid films is gradually converted into Co-O species during the course of the OER, which are responsible for the good OER performance. In addition, when performed as bifunctional catalysts in a two-electrode configured electrolyzer, the Co-O@Co-Se/Cu couple displays a water-splitting current of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.65 V with reasonable stability for long-term electrolysis over 100 h. This simple one-step electrochemical synthesis route operated in the Reline-based deep eutectic solvent is demonstrated as an efficient strategy to fabricate active non-noble-free electrocatalysts toward overall water splitting applications.

Herein, we report the synthesis of cobalt iron layered double hydroxide (Co1-delta Fe delta LDH) and g-carbon nitride composite (Co1-delta Fe delta LDH/g-CNx) for alkaline water electrolysis. The thin Co1-delta Fe delta LDH nanosheets are successfully impregnated on graphitic carbon nitride surface by one pot co-precipitation method at ambient temperature. The optimal composite, Co0.4Fe0.6 LDH/g-CNx exhibited superior OER activity in 1 M KOH electrolyte with a small overpotential of 0.28 V for 10 mA cm(-2), low Tafel slope of 29 mV/dec, 100% faradic efficiency, and high TOF of 0.25 s(-1) which is superior to commercial (comm) IrO2. Furthermore, the Co0.4Fe0.6 LDH/g-CNx composite also exhibited remarkable HER activity in alkaline media and its HER activity is slightly lower than that of comm Pt/C at low overpotential but it outperforms Pt/C at high overpotential. The catalyst demonstrated its long-term durability and higher stability for HER and OER under alkaline environment. This Co0.4Fe0.6 LDH/g-CNx catalyst can serve as both cathode and anode for overall water-splitting and required the small potential of 1.61 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The superior electrocatalytic activities of the Co0.4Fe0.6 LDH/g-CNx composite are due to the high electrochemical surface area (ECSA), easy access of abundant active sites, and easy mass transport owing to 2D sheet morphology of the composite.									69	3	0	0	1	0	69			2574-0962			WOS:000458705200035

Herein, a cost-effective and scalable strategy is proposed for the synthesis of FeCo alloy nanoparticles embedded in the nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes-grafted nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon nanofibers (FeCo-NSCNF@NCNT). The newly obtained catalyst with three-dimensional (3D) interconnected network architecture demonstrates high ORR and OER catalytic activities as evidenced by the high half-wave potential for the ORR and a low overpotential for the OER, which can be comparable to the commercially available well-known precious metal catalysts. With the catalyst employed as the air electrode of an assembled Zinc-air battery, narrow charge-discharge voltage gap and superb cycling stability (over 100 h) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) can be obtained, signifying the promising application in the next generation of rechargeable metal-air batteries.									26	4	0	0	3	0	28			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000464487000010

Reaction of strontium oxalate with uranyl oxalate was studied by employing simultaneous TG/DTA. It has been observed that uranyl oxalate decomposes into mixture of U3O8 and UO2.13 with the evolution of carbon monoxide, oxygen and carbon dioxide in the temperature range of 573-673 K, but beyond this temperature U3O8 and UO2.13 appeared as intermediates and the final product has been found to be UO2.12. Oxalates of strontium and uranium were taken in the mole ratio of 1:1 to study the solid-state reaction. The products of the reactions have been identified. In the presence of uranium oxide, strontium oxalate first decomposes to strontium carbonate followed by the reaction of the carbonate with uranium oxide at a relatively high temperature during the next step in TG. XRD characterization of the intermediates and end products indicated that SrUO4 is formed, which gets partially reduced to SrUO3 at elevated temperature.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1388-6150	1572-8943		WOS:000372261900005

Ir represents one of the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for promoting OER especially in acidic electrolytes. However, it remains a formidable challenge to synthesize high-quality one-dimensional (1D) Ir-based nanostructures for improved electrocatalytic performance. Herein, a template-assisted synthesis method is reported wherein 1D porous Ir-Te nanowires (Ir-Te NWs) are synthesized with Te NWs serving as the template. The Ir-Te NWs exhibit highly enhanced OER performance compared to commercial IrO2 and Ir/C. In detail, the overpotentials to reach 10 mA center dot cm(-2) are 248 and 284 mV in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively, much lower than those of commercial catalysts. The Ir-Te NWs also show smaller Tafel slopes than commercial IrO2 and Ir/C, signifying faster reaction kinetics. Besides, much more durable OER activity can be maintained for Ir-Te NWs with negligible decay during 25 and 20 h stability tests in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. Further analysis indicates that the significantly improved OER performance of Ir-Te NWs could be ascribed to the larger electrochemical surface area and smaller electrical resistance. More significantly, the templated synthesis of Ir-Te NWs can be facilely extended to the fabrication of other metal-Te NWs including Ru-Te, Rh-Te and Pt-Te NWs. The design and synthesis of 1D metal-based NWs in this work provide important inspiration for the synthesis of diversified 1D metallic nanostructures with distinctly enhanced catalytic performance and beyond.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000694603200002

However, the role of oxalate ligands has not been fully revealed. Here, the effect of oxalate ligands with two -COO functional groups on the surface of bimetallic sulfides is revealed. Through ex situ Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and other material characterization techniques and in situ electrochemical characterization techniques, it is proved that the suitable oxalate-coordinated FeNi bimetallic sulfide (Fe-Ni3S2/OXs) has the best OER catalytic activity, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the high-valence metal sites and the proton center of the carboxyl functional group in oxalate. The results of the density functional theory calculation show that oxalate coordination can effectively optimize the adsorption-dissociation performance of the catalyst surface for OH- and provide a proton adsorption center, thereby promoting the Gibbs's free energy of reaction intermediates. And the overpotential of 260 mV (90% IR) is observed at the geometric current density of 100 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH solution, and the catalytic performance of OER is proved to be strongly associated with the oxalate-coordinated concentration on the support surface. And its Tafel slope reaches 57 mV dec-1, which has excellent OER catalytic reaction kinetics. This work reveals the effect of oxalate ligands on OER activity and provides a promising way for the preparation of efficient basic oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000866329300001

Here, a series of M-Ru/ RuO2@CNT (M = Mn, Cd, Cu) bifunctional catalysts were synthesized by doping and strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) strategies to improve the activity and stability of the catalysts. The experiment results show that the optimized Mn-Ru/RuO2@CNT catalyst with ultra-small particle size (2.5 nm) has the best catalytic performance, and the OER and HER tests at 10 mA cm-2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution show excellent overpotentials of 177 mV and 30 mV respectively, which are better than most of the catalysts reported recently. In addition, current densities of 10 mA cm-2 and 100 mA cm-2 can be obtained at 1.43 V and 1.51 V when measuring water splitting and can last up to 100 h at a current density of 100 mA cm-2. And this is the first time to achieve the stability of acid water splitting of Ru-based catalyst under large current density. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that after manganese doping, the electronic structure is changed by charge redistribution between doped ions and ruthenium-based catalysts containing heterojunctions, and the binding energy of intermediates is optimized to improve the catalytic activity; the stability of the catalyst is improved by increasing the formation energy of ruthenium vacancy and preventing the formation of ruthenium vacancy.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1359-8368	1879-1069		WOS:000826903200001

The structures of the resulting 3D frameworks were characterized by using a variety of microscopic and spectroscopic tools, including scanning and transmission electron microscopies, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman scattering. Importantly, the three-dimensional MoS2/graphene frameworks might be used directly as working electrodes which exhibited apparent and stable electrocatalytic activity in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as manifested by a large cathodic current density with a small overpotential of -107 mV (-121 mV when loaded on a glassy-carbon electrode) and a Tafel slope of 86.3 mV/dec (46.3 mV/dec when loaded on a glassy-carbon electrode). The remarkable performance might be ascribed to the good mechanical strength and high electrical conductivity of the 3D frameworks for fast charge transport and collection, where graphene oxide provided abundant nucleation sites for MoS2 deposition and oxygen incorporation led to the formation of defect-rich MoS2 nanosheets with active sites for HER.									209	9	0	0	6	0	211			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000346326600113	25347618

With the increase of R_O,the overall trend of absorption peaks intensity of the oxygen side chain and aliphatic side chain weakened.The content of oxygen-containing functional groups decreased gradually.When R_O>2.5%,the coal structure basically no longer contains oxygen side chain;When R_O<2.0%,the aliphatic side chain increased rapidly with increasing coalification;when R_O>2.0%,the aliphatic side chain in the coal structure slowly reduced;when R_O>2.5%,nearly no fat side chain was detected in the coal structure.This demonstrates that coal has different gas generation features at different stages.The rapid reduction of coal content in the oxygen-containing side chain indicates that the formation of CO_2 gas mainly occurs in the relatively low evolution stage.The two-stage evolution aliphatic groups indicated that the main gas generation period of coal was at the stage with thermal maturity <2.0%R_O,however,the upper limit of thermal maturity for gas generation from coal was >5.0%R_O.The Fischer-Tropsch reaction,which happened between hydrogen atom cleaved from aromatic rings at graphitization(R_O>3.0%) and CO_2 gengerated by oxygen-containing groups cleavage from coal at R_O<2.0%,should be one of the important reasons causing carbon isotopic reversal of coal derived gases at over maturity.			利用傅里叶红外光谱分析技术对煤化程度(R_O)范围为0.35%~5.32%的19个煤样进行了结构分析。分析结果表明:随着R_O值的增加,煤结构中不同的官能团具有不同的演化规律。芳环结构中C-H键在红外谱图中先增加,当R_O>3.0%后逐渐减小。含氧侧链与脂肪族侧链随着R_O值增加,吸收峰强度总体呈减弱的趋势。含氧官能团的含量在逐渐的减少,R_O>2.5%时,煤结构中基本不再含有含氧侧链;脂肪族侧链R_O<2.0%时,脂肪侧链随着煤化程度的增加快速减少,R_O>2.0%时脂肪族侧链在煤结构中缓慢减少,当R_O>2.5%时,在煤结构中检测到的脂肪侧链已经很少。煤结构的上述演化规律预示着煤在不同的演化阶段具有不同的生气特征。R_O<0.8%含氧侧链在煤结构的快速减少说明CO_2气的生成主要发生在相对低的演化阶段;脂肪侧链两段式的演化规律说明煤的主要生气(烃类气体)阶段发生在R_O<2.0%,而煤生气结束的煤化程度界限为R_O>5.0%。煤在石墨化过程中从芳环上脱落的氢与煤在演化阶段生成的CO_2之间发生的费_托反应可能是过成熟阶段煤成气碳同位素倒转(反转)的一个重要因素。						1	1	0	0	0	0	2			1672-1926			CSCD:6027895

To this end, we report the use of laser ablation synthesis in solution (LASiS) operated with cobalt as the target in graphene oxide (GO) solution in tandem with two different posttreatments to manufacture three kinds of hybrid nanocomposites (HNCs) namely, (1) Co3O4 nanoparticle (NP)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO), (2) Co3O4 nanorod (NR)/rGO, and (3) Co3O4 NP/nitrogen-doped graphene oxide (NGO). FTIR and Raman spectroscopic studies indicate that both chemical and chargedriven interactions are partially responsible for embedding the Co3O4 NPs/NRs into the various GO films. We tune the selective functionalities of the as-synthesized HNCs as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts and/or supercapacitors by tailoring their structure-property relationships. Specifically, the nitrogen doping in the NP/NGO HNC samples promotes higher electron conductivity while hindering aggregation between 0D CoO NPs that are partially reshaped into Co3O4 nanocubes due to induced surface strain energies. Our results indicate that such interfacial energetics and arrangements lead to superior ORR electrocatalytic activities. On the other hand, the interconnecting 1D nanostructures in the NR/rGO HNCs benefit charge transport and electrolyte diffusion at the electrode-electrolyte interfaces, thereby promoting their supercapacitive properties. The NP/rGO HNCs exhibit intermediate functionalities towards both ORR catalysis and supercapacitance.									32	1	0	0	3	0	32			2046-2069			WOS:000404864100015

The microstructure of these coatings was investigated by SEM and XRD methods. The electrochemical behavior of coatings was assessed through accelerated life test (ALT), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The results showed that increasing the RhOx content led to superior service lifetime and lower electrical conductivity of the coatings. Also, the results of cyclic voltammetry tests confirmed that the anodic voltammetric charge was enhanced by increasing the concentration of RhOx in coatings. The EIS examination of the coatings indicated that the charge transfer resistance at the external active surface of the coatings was increased by adding the RhOx content. Furthermore, it was found that the formation of TiO2 passive layer at the interface of the substrate/oxides layer was the main destruction mechanism of the coated anodes. Among the tested anodes, the anode with 10%IrO2-60%RhOx-30%ZrO2 coating exhibited larger electrochemically active surface area, higher stability and inferior electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution.

J	Wu Dao-xin; Chen Qi-yuan; Li Jie; Yin Zhou-Ian								Photocatalytic oxidation of water to O2 over Ta-dopant of rutile TiO2								Chinese Journal of Nonferrous Metals				19	2			360	5						Feb. 2009	2009	The photocatalyst of Ta-doped rutile TiO2 with different Ta doping concentrations were prepared by low temperature ultrasonic hydrolysis using tetrabutyl titanate(C16H36O4Ti) as raw material. This photocatalyst was characterized by XRD, PL, DRS and BET. Under the condition of Fe3+ as electron acceptor, pH = 2.0 with UV irradiation and visible radiation, the effects of various Ta doping concentrations on the photocatalytic oxidation activity of Ta doped rutile TiO2 particles were investigated. The results show that with appropriate concentration ranging in 1.0%-5.0%, Ta can be doped into rutile TiO2 lattice without causing any change in rutile TiO2 crystal structure. Therefore, the surface oxygen vacancies and the donor energy level near the bottom of the conduction band lead to easier departure of photoinduced electrons from holes to achieve stronger photocatalytic activity. The highest photocatalytic oxygen evolution and PL spectra intensity are achieved. When the concentration of Ta is 1.0%, the O2 evolution speeds are 130.4 and 69.6 umol/(L.h) under UV irradiation and visible radiation, which are 14.6% and 12.1% higher than those before doping, respectively.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			1004-0609			INSPEC:10830180

The elements studied are carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sodium, titanium, and iron. The evolution of C and N abundances in the studied red giants shows that their oxygen abundances represent the original values with which the stars were born. Oxygen is a superior element for probing the timescale of bulge chemical enrichment via [O/Fe] versus [Fe/H]. The [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] relation in the bulge does not follow the disk relation, with [O/Fe] values falling above those of the disk. Titanium also behaves similarly to oxygen with respect to iron. Based on these elevated values of [O/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] extending to large Fe abundances, it is suggested that the bulge underwent a more rapid chemical enrichment than the halo. In addition, there are declines in both [O/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] in those bulge targets with the largest Fe abundances, signifying another source affecting chemical evolution: perhaps supernovae of Type Ia. Sodium abundances increase dramatically in the bulge with increasing metallicity, possibly reflecting the metallicity-dependent yields from supernovae of Type II, although Na contamination from H-burning in intermediate-mass stars cannot be ruled out.									77	2	0	0	0	0	79			0004-637X			WOS:000241824300043

Elaboration of porous mullite-based materials via SHS reaction								CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL				36	1			231	239		10.1016/j.ceramint.2009.07.025				JAN 2010	2010	In order to produce cheaper mullite from kaolinitic clays we worked on the opportunity to use self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) reaction to obtain this phase. Two ways were explored during the combustion of metals mixed with the clay. The first one concerns the nature of the combustion gas (air or pure oxygen) which was tested on mixtures of clay and metal powders. The second one showed the influence of magnesium addition in clay/Al mixture. Results conclude that to obtain porous mullite at low-cost by SHS process the best conditions are the addition of magnesium powder and combustion in oxygen gas. Because a SHS reaction is always quicker, we compared this process with the traditional reactive sintering in order to explain the structure and the microstructure of the SHS products.

Herein, bimetallic Ni2-xCoxP supported by N-doped carbon nanofibers (denoted as Ni2-xCOxP/N-C NFs) are developed via electrospinning followed by pyrolysis under an inert flow. The space confinement by in-situ formed N-doped carbon matrix produces ultrafine Ni2-xCoxP with abundant active-sites. More importantly, the engineering on Ni2-xCoxP solid-solution-alloys can vary electronic configuration and consequently optimize hydrogen binding on electrocatalyst surface, accomplishing prominent HER activity in a wide pH range. The optimal Ni2-xCOxP/N-C NFs afford low overpotentials (eta(10)) of 100, 130 and 110 mV to reach a current density of -10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1.0 KOH and 1.0 M PBS (phosphate buffer saline), respectively, performing among the best of noble-metal-free electrocatalysts. With a good functionality for oxygen evolution (eta(10) = 280 mV), such composite further delivers a high efficiency for overall water splitting, featuring a comparable cell voltage (1.56 V @ 10 mA cm(-2)) to a commercial IrO2/C - Pt/C couple, and remarkably better stability. Identifying electrocatalysis relying on solid-solution alloys, this work will inspire the exploration of cost-efficient electrocatalysts and the new understanding on catalytic mechanisms.									91	4	0	0	2	0	91			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000457952600064

Toward exploring advanced OER catalysts with both high efficiency and low cost, transition metal compounds have been regarded as promising alternatives to replace precious metal-based catalysts, among which the cobalt-based materials, especially LaCoO3 perovskites, are highly attractive owing to their tunable electronic structure, relatively high activity, and superior stability. However, the harsh reaction environments for the fabrication of perovskites often result in micrometer-scale particles with limited surface sites, and modulation of electronic structures is also required to be further optimized. In this work, we proposed a molten-salt-protected pyrolysis (MSPP) route to convert the amorphous nanoparticle precursors to LaCoO3 nanocrystals with tunable Fe doping, during which the molten salts could not only act as an effective reaction medium to avoid interparticle sintering but also induce enrichment of surface Co3+ ions with high catalytic activity. Theoretical and experimental analyses indicate that Fe doping could significantly modulate the electronic structure of LaCoO3, resulting in enhanced Co-O covalency and facile charge transfer behavior during the OER. With the above merits, remarkable OER performance with ultralow overpotential, high catalytic current density, small Tafel slop; outstanding intrinsic OER activity, and superior operational stability can be synergistically achieved for the Fe-doped LaCoO3 nanocrystals, making the perovskite nanocatalyst a promising candidate for electrochemical water splitting.									11	2	0	0	0	0	11			2168-0485			WOS:000592226900034

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy and temperature programmed reaction/desorption have been employed to investigate the decomposition process of 1-chloro-2-propanol on Cu(100). The competitive dissociation of the functional C-Cl and CO-H at 265 K results in the formation of ClCH2CH(CH3)O- and -CH2CH(CH3)O- surface intermediates at a 2:1 concentration ratio. This ratio decreases to similar to 0.6:1 at 300 K. The-CH2CH(CH3)O-oxametallacycle is theoretically predicted to be bonded on the Cu(100) surface, with both the O and CH2 at bridge sites. This surface intermediate decomposes mainly at 300 K producing CH3C(O)CH3 and CH3CH=CH2 in addition to H-2 and CO. Preadsorbed oxygen atoms can stabilize the oxametallacycle and increases its reaction temperature to similar to 350 K. Moreover, propene formation is promoted relative to acetone. In the reaction of 3-chloro-1-propanol on Cu(100), a low-temperature (159 K) formation channel of ClCH2CH=CH2 is observed. Other products presumably from -CH2CH2CH2O- reaction, including CH2=CHCHO, CH3CH2CHO, C2H4, CO, and H-2, evolve at a temperature higher than similar to 300 K. No propene from C-O dissociation is formed. Preadsorption of oxygen causes the evolution of these products to be shifted to similar to 400 K, with additional CH3CH2CH2OH and a small amount of CH3CH=CH2. The theoretical calculation indicates that -CH2CH2CH2O- is bonded via the (CH2)-C-3 and O at atop and bridge sites, respectively, and has an energy slightly higher than that of -CH2CH(CH3)O-, by 3.4 kcal.mol(-1).									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000375969000032

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a key step in energy-conversion processes and the synthesis of new materials for highly efficient ORR electrocatalyst is critical in solving the energy problems. To enhance the activity of the electrocatalysts and expose more active sites on the surface, plasma technology is utilized to modify the catalyst surface through etching, heteroatom doping, and surface functionalization. Low-temperature plasma technology is now used extensively in the synthesis and modification of materials. With the advantages of being highly efficient, environment friendly, and affordable, the low-temperature plasma technology holds great potential for development in the future. Herein, the synthesis and modification of nonplatinum ORR catalysts using new advances in low-temperature plasma technology are summarized. The application and development potential of plasma surface treatment and plasma synthesis on nonplatinum ORR catalysts are discussed to provide perspectives for future research in this field.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2699-9412			WOS:000864889600001

The water-gas shift (WGS) reaction is a key step in this waste-to-hydrogen process by removing the CO and producing additional H-2. A nanofiber-structured CoFe(2)O(4 )catalyst was synthesized by the electrospinning method, and the catalytic performance in WGS using waste-derived synthesis gas was compared with that of catalysts prepared by sol-gel, hydrothermal, and co-precipitation methods. The CoFe(2)O(4 )catalyst synthesized by the electrospinning method showed a clear nanofiber structure and revealed a superior redox property. This superior redox property, which has a large relation with the high oxygen storage capacity of the catalyst, induced the formation of an active phase (Co-0 and Fe3O4) in CoFe2O4. As a result, the nanofiber structured oxygen defective CoFe(2)O(4-x )prepared by the electrospinning method showed the best catalytic activity in this study.

The enhancement arises from the higher atomic concentration of electrochemically active Pd exposed on the surface of the nanoparticles as a result of the electrochemical dealloying process, which was verified by electron energy loss spectroscopy elemental mapping, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and CO stripping. These dealloyed catalysts also showed a negligible decrease in the ORR activity after 4000 potential cycles in alkaline media. In addition, after the degradation that resulted from extended potential cycles in alkaline media, the ORR activity of the catalysts could be restored by repeating the dealloying procedures, with only a 14 mV decrease in the half-wave potential after 16,000 cycles for dealloyed PdNi/C. Similar results were obtained for PdMn/C. These findings provide insights for the rational design of the composition and structure of electrocatalysts with higher atomic utilization of active materials and enhanced electrocatalytic activity, based on postsynthesis modification methods.									42	2	0	0	3	0	43			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500052

However, enhancement of the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the cathodes is still a great challenge. Herein, we design and prepare Co3O4 single-crystal nanosheets with edge-enriched {111} facets via a simple pyrolysis of alpha-Co(OH)(2), which show a high activity as cathode catalysts for Li-O-2. The catalytic activity and stability have been significantly improved in comparison with Co3O4 poor-edge {111} facets. This enhancement can be largely attributed to the edge-enriched {111} facets. Co3O4 nanosheets with edge-enriched {111} facets expose more metal atoms to boost the catalytic activity. Moreover, the edge-enriched {111} facets contain a high density of atomic steps and kink atoms which supply a wide space for breaking chemical bonds and increasing the reaction activity. This study also presents some insights into designing high-performance catalysts for metal-air batteries through a strategy of edge-enriched facet engineering.									49	3	0	0	3	0	50			2155-5435			WOS:000467335600002

Here, we present the FeCo2O4@ FeCo2S4 heterostructure in situ decorated on Ni foam as bifunctional electrocatalysts to trigger ORR and OER.

In this work we study the effects of several key structural and morphological features on the performance of LaNiO3 perovskites for the ORR We have prepared a series of LaNiO3 oxides via soft chemistry and calcined the final materials at different temperatures from 500 to 1000 degrees C. With the aim of obtaining morphological and structural information relevant to their performance the prepared oxides have been thoroughly characterized by BET, Power Neutron Diffraction (PND), XRD, HRTEM, STEM-HAADF and XPS. We have analysed the effect of extrinsic (surface area and particle size) and intrinsic factors (formation of oxygen vacancies, Ni oxidation states and occupancy of the e(g) levels) on the current densities and specific activity, respectively, of several samples of LaNiO3. The catalysts with higher catalytic activity are those in which the perovskite structure is properly formed, but display high surface areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The as-obtained micro-rods are well-crystallised with about 2 m lengths and 500 nm widths. In the authors system, the sodium dodecyl sulfate amount, as well as the reaction time and temperature, plays an important role in the formation of the InVO4 micronrods. From the UV-vis absorption spectrum, the bandgap energy of as-obtained InVO4 microrods is 2.3 eV.

We utilize bilayers of phthalocyanine, acting as the light absorber, and perylene diimide, functioning as both electron-acceptor and the hydrogen peroxide evolution electrocatalyst. These heterojunction bilayers are stable when irradiated in simulated physiological conditions, producing photovoltages sufficient to simultaneously drive cathodic oxygen reduction to H2O2 and anodic oxidation of glucose.

However, the efficient adsorption of visible light as well as long-term stability of light-harvesting electrocatalysis is the crucial issue in PEC cells. Metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived bimetallic electrocatalysis with its superior performance has wide application prospects in OER and PEC applications. Herein, we have fabricated a nickel and iron bimetallic organic framework (FeNi-MOF) deposited on top of anodized TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTA) for PEC and OER applications. The FeNi-MOF/TNTA was incorporated through the electrochemical deposition of Ni2+ and Fe3+ onto the surface of TNTA and then connected with organic ligands by the hydrothermal transformation. Therefore, FeNi-MOF/TNTA demonstrates abundant photoelectrocatalytic active sites that can enhance the photocurrent up to 1.91 mA/cm(2) under 100 mW/cm(2) and a negligible loss in activity after 180 min of photoreaction. The FeNi-MOF-doped photoanode shows predominant photoelectrochemical performance due to the boosted excellent light-harvesting ability, rapid photoresponse, and stimulated interfacial energy of charge separation under the UV-visible light irradiation conditions. The results of this study give deep insight into MOF-derived bimetallic nanomaterial synthesis for photoelectrochemical OER and provide guidance on future electrocatalysis design.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7				2079-4991		WOS:000582014800001	32867259

This method can significantly retain the nitrogen content in the catalyst by introducing only a small amount of boron. The bonding ability of cobalt to hetero-atoms was also improved. The optimized bonding patterns between heteroatoms and metal-cobalt have further improved the performance of catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Electrochemical tests show that the Co-NBSC catalyst possesses an onset potential of 0.93 V, a half wave potential of 0.84 V and a current density of 5.58 mA/cm(2) as well as excellent stability in an alkaline solution. In addition, Co-NBSC based zinc-air battery exhibited a power density of 121.2 mW/cm(2) and a discharge stability of more than 30 h.

We describe the synthesis of self-redox CeO2 supported Co in nitrogen-doped carbon nanorods (CoCeO2/N-CNR) by the electro-spun method, and introduced as an enhanced bifunctional catalyst for oxygen reduction (ORR) as well as evolution (OER) reactions by the synergistic effect of oxygen buffer CeO2 with metallic Co. Systematic structural and optical studies confirm the formation and uniform distribution of CeO2 and Co particles in N-CNR. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of Co-CeO2/N-CNR reveals that the presence of Co2+ and multiple valence states of ceria (Ce4+ and Ce3+). The shift in binding energies of Co2+ and Ce3+ states confirm the possible interaction for the cooperative effect of ceria and cobalt during ORR and OER, and electrode stability improvement as well. The Co-CeO2/N-CNR catalyst shows the enhanced oxygen electrode potential of 0.84 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode), which is 100 and 196 mV lower than Co/N-CNR and Pt/C, respectively, including the improved stability.									87	1	0	0	5	0	87			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000442973700117

The obtained X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRD) images confirm the pure Face Centered Cubic (FCC) single phase of NiFe2O4/N-Gr nanohybrid. The average crystallite size remains within the range 20 +/- 2 nm. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) results showed aggregation of ferrite nanoparticles on N-Gr. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the surface chemical composition and cation oxidation states of pure NiFe2O4, N-Gr, and the NiFe2O4/N-Gr nanohybrid. The as-prepared NiFe2O4/N-Gr nanohybrid shows better ORR catalytic activity than pure NiFe2O4 and nitrogen doped graphene (N-Gr), which mainly favours a desirable direct 4e(-) reaction pathway during the ORR process. The admirable electrocatalytic activity of the NiFe2O4/N-Gr nanohybrid is attributed to the strong coupling between the NiFe2O4 nanoparticles and the nitrogen doped graphene as well as the network structure.									12	2	0	0	0	0	12			2158-5849	2158-5857		WOS:000410804200003

In this study, we demonstrate that by modulating the oxygen functional groups near the atomically dispersed cobalt sites with proper electrochemical/chemical treatments, a highly active and selective oxygen reduction process for hydrogen peroxide production can be obtained in acidic electrolyte, showing a negligible amount of onset overpotential and nearly 100% selectivity within a wide range of applied potentials. Combined spectroscopic results reveal that the exceptionally enhanced performance of hydrogen peroxide generation originates from the presence of epoxy groups near the Co-N-4 centers, which has resulted in the modification of the electronic structure of the cobalt atoms. Computational modeling demonstrates these electronically modified cobalt atoms will enhance the hydrogen peroxide productivity during oxygen reduction reaction in acid, providing insights into the design of electroactive materials for effective peroxide production. The production of hydrogen peroxide by electrochemical oxygen reduction is an attractive alternative to the industrial process, but catalysts should be optimized. Here, the authors enhance hydrogen peroxide production in acidic media with epoxy groups near cobalt centers on carbon nanotubes.									85	7	0	0	10	0	88				2041-1723		WOS:000569766000007	32826877

Herein, Ni foam (NF) supported sisal-like porous MoO2 nanosheet array (MoO2/NF) was synthesized through a facile hydrothermal and subsequent annealing process. It is shown that in the NRR process the Mo4+ in MoO2/NF is more favorable in an associative mechanism of NRR than Mo6+ in MoO3/NF, thus yielding an impressive ammonia electrosynthesis activity (NH3 yield rate: 9.56 mu g h-1 cm-2; Faradaic efficiency: 5.14%) in 0.1 M KOH. Moreover, the sisal-like porous nanosheet array structure not only provides a high surface area for abundant accessible active sites, but also limits the coalescence of gas bubbles, enabling active sites better exposed to nitrogen by removing the small gas bubbles rapidly. The MoO2/NF also shows excellent performance for the OER in 0.1 M KOH, exhibiting a small overpotential of 340 mV to realize a current density of 10 mA cm-2. In two-electrode full N2 electrolysis, a remarkable ammonia production performance with an ammonia yield of 5.73 mu g h-1 cm-2, an FE of 15.8%, and good long-term stability for at least 24 h is obtained.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000713670400004

The main features, such as adsorption and underpotential deposition of hydrogen, both protium and deuterium, as well as the specific multilayer (monolayer alpha- succeeded by multilayer beta-phase) oxide growth preceding hydrogen and oxygen evolution, respectively, with characteristic desorption peaks, were more or less marked in both electrolytes. Some distinctly different behaviours have been observed, however, revealing that heavy and regular water behave almost as different solvent ambients. The hydrogen evolution reaction (H. E. R.) in heavy water occurs at substantially more negative potentials, while oxygen evolution becomes shifted to considerably more positive potential values. The latter effect enables one to record on voltammograms the multilayer oxide (beta-phase) growth in alkaline heavy water, as distinctly indicated by corresponding continuously growing characteristic potentiodynamic waves scanned with cyclization. Hydrogen absorption, both protium and deuterium, has been clearly marked by the continuously growing charge capacity of the diffusional desorption peak, which exceeds one-to-one H(D)/Pd atom coverage on the exposed palladium surface and is related to the corresponding adsorption wave for its underpotential deposition. In addition, the hydrogen oxidation peak immediately following its desorption (in particular from acidic heavy water) has also been distinctly scanned on voltammograms. Oxide formation usually starts at more anodic potentials together with deuterium oxidation and, specifically in acidic media, proceeds vigorously with higher and continuously growing rates, while the evolving oxygen thereby arising is shifted to more positive potential values. These features reveal that, due to distinctly different steric factors, heavy water, in particular in acidic media, behaves as a stronger oxidizing agent than regular water. Some discernible properties of the interplay between hydrogen and oxygen on palladium electrodes in both electrolytes along the potential axis have been clearly marked and pointed out.									35	1	0	0	0	0	35			0360-3199			WOS:A1993KU54900002

Crystallographic analysis of 2 revealed a dimeric structure due to the strong hydrogen bonding between azole hydrogen and carbonyl oxygen.

Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)											10.1002/anie.202213328				2022-Oct-05	2022	The electrochemical oxidation of small molecules to generate value-added products has gained enormous interest in recent years due to the advantages of benign operation conditions, high conversion efficiency and selectivity, the absence of external oxidizing agents, and eco-friendly. Moreover, small molecule oxidation reactions can serve as promising substitutes to replace the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems, such as hydrogen production and CO2 reduction. Coupling electrochemical oxidation of small molecules at the anode and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode in an electrolyser would simultaneously realize high value chemicals generation or pollutant degradation and high-efficient hydrogen production. In recent years, various thermodynamically more favorable small molecules oxidation reactions have been designed as promising alternatives to OER to achieve highly efficient hydrogen production. In this Minireview, we present a brief introduction about small molecule choice and design strategies of electrocatalysts. Furthermore, we highlight the discussion about recent breakthroughs in small molecule oxidation assisted highly efficient hydrogen production, including alternative molecules, modulated strategies of catalysts, and related catalytic reaction mechanisms in small molecule oxidation reactions. Finally, a perspective on possible challenges and future orientations of small molecule oxidation is presented.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1521-3773		MEDLINE:36200263	36200263

Herein, a siloxene-p-Pt-2 h composite has been fabricated with an ultralow platinum loading on siloxene (0.56 wt%), which shows greatly enhanced HER activity featuring an ultralow overpotential (eta(10) = 23 mV). Attractively, the siloxene-p-Pt-2 h has been applied as a HER catalyst in a Zn-H2O fuel cell, demonstrating a high power density of 157 mW cm(-2) in coupling with the cathode hydrogen evolution. Moreover, a coupled configuration between two Zn-H2O fuel cells in series and the cell-powered hydroxide electrolyzer achieves the efficient hydrogen co-productions co-catalyzed by the HER catalysts.

Here, the ORR activity of Co3O4 and mixed metal oxides NiCo2O4 and CuCo2O4 was studied. Synthesis by using the nanocasting procedure resulted in a mesostructured spinel phase with uniform morphology and high surface area. However, the evaluation of the specific activity of this material class is often hampered by limitations in determining the real surface area. The cavity-microelectrode technique did not require the addition of any additives to the catalytic material. Thus, measuring the double layer capacitance was used to assess the surface area. This approach showed comparable and reliable values for all samples and different cavity depths. Furthermore, the in situ derived surface area enabled the determination of the specific ORR activity, which is more accurate than utilizing the geometric and nitrogen absorption derived surface area. Although the activity of Co3O4 was rather low, the presence of Ni2+ and Cu2+ in the mixed metal oxides led to a substantial activity enhancement, possibly by providing additional active sites.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2196-0216			WOS:000475512500030		
J	Lv, Wenyue; Xu, Lishuang; Wang, Lili; Yang, Ying; Wang, Lingxian; Wang, Tianqi; Li, Dan; Shao, Hong; Li, Feng; Dong, Xiangting								Synergistic effect of bimetallic nitride micro-flower promotes highly efficient overall water splitting								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				920						165934	10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.165934				NOV 5 2022	2022	Developing efficient, low-cost, high-active, and durable bifunctional non-noble metal electrocatalysts is an essential requirement for hydrolytic hydrogen production. In this work, a three-dimensional (3D) flowerlike bimetallic nitride (Co2NiN) is synthesized on the flexible carbon cloth (CC) that increases the surface area and exposes more active sites. At the same time, the synergistic effect between Ni3N, CoN and Co increases the electron transfer rate and optimizes the binding energy of intermediate products. The Co2NiN/ CC electrode is superhydrophilic and superaerophobic, which guarantees intimate contact with the electrolyte and promotes timely the bubble release from the electrode, ensuring a high efficiency and stable working state. Therefore, the Co2NiN/CC electrode exhibits excellent catalytic performance for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Low overpotentials of only 123 mV and 315 mV are required to achieve the current densities of 10 mA.cm(-2) and 20 mA.cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively. For overall water splitting, Co2NiN/CC as both anode and cathode require only 1.457 V for 10 mA.cm(-2). This work shows the feasibility and potential of fabricating bimetallic nitrides electrocatalysts. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The IrOx/Zn3P2-ZnPi NSs catalyst possesses efficient catalytic activities and prospective stability due to its large electroactive surface area, excellent charge transfer, high mechanical properties of the structure, and good catalyst-substrate interactions. As a result, the IrOx/Zn3P2-ZnPi NSs catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 106 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 286 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to reach a current output of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH medium, which are significantly lower than those of the IrOx/Zn3P2- ZnPi nanorods (NRs) and previously reported bifunctional electrocatalysts. An electrolyzer derived from the IrOx/Zn3P2-ZnPi NSs((+,-)) requires a small cell voltage of 1.62 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and 1.84 V at 100 mA cm(-2), surpassing behaviors of a commercial Pt/C(-)//IrO2(+) system. The results indicate that the IrOx/Zn3P2-ZnPi NSs is a potential bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient water splitting application to produce green hydrogen fuel.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000860741200004

CeO2 plays an essential role in increasing the surface Mn2+/3+/4+ in alpha-MnO2/Mn3O4/CeO2/C for ORR/OER processes. It shows enhanced bifunctional activity, superior to that of the benchmark 20 wt % Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts. It displays an ORR onset potential of -0.13 V (vs Ag/AgCl), limiting current density of -6.63 mA cm(-2) (at 1600 rpm), mass-specific current of 47.6 mA mg(MO)(-1) with a lower Tafel slope (921.9 mV dec(-1)), and an inclusive 4-e transfer involved in ORR. The OER onset potential and current density are 0.58 V (vs Ag/AgCl) and 8.45 mA cm(-2) (at 0.8 V). The unique hybrid structure with oxide-oxide interface in alpha-MnO2/Mn3O4/CeO2 is correlated to explain the mechanistic pathway. Multistate Mn(II/III/IV) and Ce(III/IV) synergistically influence in tendering superior activity with enhanced stability.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000670646600033

The crystal zones of the corrosion layer contain alpha- and beta-PbO2 crystals. Applying controlled thermal degradation it has been established that hydrated zones (denoted as PbO(OH)2) comprise about 10% of the corrosion layer. For comparison, the lead dioxide active mass of the lead-acid battery is hydrated over 30%. On prolonged polarization of the lead dioxide electrode at 1.50 V, the basic electrochemical reaction that takes place is oxygen evolution. It has been suggested that this reaction occurs mainly at the interface crystal/gel-like zones. On opening the circuit, the electrode potential reaches the equilibrium potential for the PbO2/PbSO4 system within a rather long period. This potential decay is related to the diffusion of oxygen through the bulk of the corrosion layer (probably through its hydrated zones) to the solution and to the metal. A suggestion is made that hydrated zones are also involved in the oxygen reaction.									44	6	0	0	0	0	47			0021-891X			WOS:A1993MN27400006		
J	Exner, Kai S.								Paradigm change in hydrogen electrocatalysis: The volcano's apex is located at weak bonding of the reaction intermediate								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				45	51			27221	27229		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.088				OCT 16 2020	2020	Volcano plots are a powerful tool to screen electrode materials in the catalysis and battery science communities. Commonly, simple binding energies are analyzed by the concept of linear scaling relationships to describe activity trends in a homologous series of materials, putting forward the picture that an optimum electrode material in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) binds the reaction intermediate (RI) thermoneutrally at zero overpotential. This approach, however, consists of various oversimplifications since the applied overpotential and kinetics are not accounted for in the evaluation. In the present article, the apex of the HER volcano is modeled by microkinetics. It is demonstrated that the volcano's top shifts to weak bonding of the RI with increasing driving force as soon as kinetic effects are factored in the analysis. This paradigm change is corroborated by the fact that the constructed volcano plots, using microkinetics and scaling relations for the apex and legs of the volcano respectively, reproduce the high activities of Pt in the HER and RuO2 in the chlorine evolution reaction.

Welland, Michael/0000-0002-7683-6213; Redfern, Paul/0000-0002-9475-5396			An atomistically informed mesoscale model for growth and coarsening during discharge in lithium-oxygen batteries								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				143	22					224113	10.1063/1.4936410				DEC 14 2015	2015	An atomistically informed mesoscale model is developed for the deposition of a discharge product in a Li-O-2 battery. This mescocale model includes particle growth and coarsening as well as a simplified nucleation model. The model involves LiO2 formation through reaction of O-2(-) and Li+ in the electrolyte, which deposits on the cathode surface when the LiO2 concentration reaches supersaturation in the electrolyte. A reaction-diffusion (rate-equation) model is used to describe the processes occurring in the electrolyte and a phase-field model is used to capture microstructural evolution. This model predicts that coarsening, in which large particles grow and small ones disappear, has a substantial effect on the size distribution of the LiO2 particles during the discharge process. The size evolution during discharge is the result of the interplay between this coarsening process and particle growth. The growth through continued deposition of LiO2 has the effect of causing large particles to grow ever faster while delaying the dissolution of small particles. The predicted size evolution is consistent with experimental results for a previously reported cathode material based on activated carbon during discharge and when it is at rest, although kinetic factors need to be included. The approach described in this paper synergistically combines models on different length scales with experimental observations and should have applications in studying other related discharge processes, such as Li2O2 deposition, in Li-O-2 batteries and nucleation and growth in Li-S batteries.

To obtain highly efficient cathode catalysts for aprotic Li-O-2 batteries, a facile ultrasonicated method has been developed to synthesize three kinds of 2D MOFs (2D Co-MOF, Ni-MOF, and Mn-MOF). Contributing from the inherent open active sites of the Mn-O framework, the discharge specific capacity of 9464 mAh g(-1) is achieved with the 2D Mn-MOF cathode, higher than those of the 2D Co-MOF and Ni-MOF cathodes. During the cycling test, the 2D Mn-MOF cathode stably operates more than 200 cycles at 100 mA g(-1) with a curtailed discharge capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1), quite longer than those of others. According to further electrochemical analysis, we observe that the 2D Mn-MOF outperforms 2D Ni-MOF and Co-MOF due to a superior oxygen reduction reactions and oxygen evolution reactions activity, in particular, the efficient oxidation of both LiOH and Li2O2. The present study provides new insights that the 2D MOF nanosheets can be well applied as the Li-O-2 cells with high energy density and long cycling life.									70	11	0	0	5	0	72			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000462950600033	30816695

Herein, we successfully fabricated a three-dimensional iron-dysprosium oxide co-regulated in-situ formed MOF-Ni arrays on carbon cloth (FeDy@MOF-Ni/CC) through a facile two-step hydrothermal method. Electrochemical studies demonstrate that the designed FeDy@MOF-Ni/CC catalyst requires an overpotential of only 251 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 52.1 mV dec(-1). Additionally, the stability declined by only 5.5% after 80 h of continuous testing in 1.0 M KOH. Furthermore, a cell voltage of only 1.57 V in the overall water splitting system is sufficient to achieve 10 mA cm(-2); this value is far better than that of most previously reported catalysts. The excellent catalytic performance originates from the unique 3D rhombus-like structure, as well as coupling synergies of Fe-Dy-Ni species. The combination of lanthanide and transition metal species in the synthesis strategy may open entirely new possibilities with promising potential in the design of highly active OER electrocatalysts.

The single phase of cubic BaTiO3 was produced at a sintering temperature of 800 degrees C for 2, 4, 8, and 12 h. The absence of diffraction peak splitting at 2 theta of 45 degrees was indicated cubic BaTiO3. The crystallite size of BaTiO3 ranged from 80-200 nm, and its size increased with increasing temperatures and sintering times. The micro-strain of the BaTiO3 crystal lattice had a range between 0.27 and 0.68%. The minimum bandgap on the indirect bandgap was about 1.75 eV from point M to Gamma, while the direct bandgap was about 1.95 eV from G to G. Ti-O's interaction had a covalent character, while that of Ba-O had an ionic character based on the density of state (DOS) calculation. The characteristics of the BaTiO3 voltammogram show an irreversible redox mechanism with a more observable reduction peak in Ti4+/Ti3+. Higher current density at over potential indicated greater BaTiO3 capabilities in Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER)-Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis. For that, purified cubic BaTiO3 offers potential application as an electrode for batteries, water splitting systems, and regenerative fuel cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1411-9420			WOS:000754757200021

Our method, which is based on a combination of membrane-inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) and O-18-labelling, excludes the possibility of "non-accounted" HCO3- by avoiding (1) the employment of formate for removal of HCO3- from PSII, and (2) the extremely low concentrations of HCO3-/CO2 during online MIMS measurements. By equilibration of PSII sample to ambient CO2 concentration of dissolved CO2/HCO3-, the method ensures that all physiological binding sites are saturated before analysis. With this approach, we determined that in spinach PSII membrane fragments 1.1 +/- 0.1 HCO3- are bound per PSII reaction center, while none was bound to isolated PsbO protein. Our present results confirmed that PSII binds one HCO3- molecule as ligand to the non-heme iron of PSII, while unbound HCO3- optimizes the water-splitting reactions by acting as a mobile proton shuttle.									7	1	0	0	5	0	7			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000430309200019

The Haber-Bosch process is employed in industry to synthesize ammonia, which not only uses a lot of energy but also has a low conversion of only 10% to 15%. Electrochemical ammonia synthesis has the advantages of clean production and gentle reaction conditions as compared to the Haber-Bosch process. The features and benefits of electrochemical ammonia synthesis using nitrogen, nitrate, and nitric oxide as nitrogen sources are discussed, and the reaction mechanisms are studied based on the properties of these nitrogen sources. Different hydrogen supply schemes and hydrogenation methods are described and evaluated based on the diverse nitrogen sources, and the research development of reaction catalysts is systematically summarized. Problems of the electrolytic systems such as poor solubility of nitrogen in water, nitrates with too many valence states, excessive intermediates, instable nitrogen oxide system, and competing hydrogen evolution reaction, are discussed in detail. Some suggestions for them are proposed which include altering the composition or structure of the hydrogen source to prevent hydrogen evolution, developing new catalyst systems with high active sites and oxygen vacancies to improve reaction selectivity, and developing non-aqueous electrolyte systems to improve reaction rate and synthesis efficiency.			氨是基本有机化学工业及化肥生产的主要原料。工业上利用哈伯法合成氨,该工艺不仅耗能大且转化率仅有10%~15%。相比传统合成氨工艺,电化学合成氨有着清洁环保、反应条件温和等优点。本文综述了氮气、硝酸盐及一氧化氮作为氮源时电化学合成氨的特点与优势,并依据不同氮源的特点,剖析了电化学合成氨的反应机制。文中针对不同的氮源,分析总结了多种氢源方案与氢化机理,系统地概述了反应催化剂的研究进展。分别讨论了氮气在水中溶解度较差、硝酸盐在反应过程中元素价态跨度大而生成诸多中间产物、氮氧化物体系不稳定、电解体系中存在析氢竞争反应等问题,提出了通过改变氢源的组成或结构抑制析氢反应、开发新型高活性位点及氧空位的催化剂体系强化反应选择性、研制非水电解质体系提高反应速率及合成效率等解决思路。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-6613			CSCD:7267159

The success of this synthesis relies on the use of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) as a mediator. By tracking the evolution of the Pt nanocrystals throughout the growth process, we found that single-crystal seeds with a pseudo-spherical shape are formed in the early stage of the synthesis, followed by growth through the preferential deposition of Pt atoms onto the {100}facets, directing the seeds to evolve into octahedra enclosed by {111}facets. We have manipulated the atom deposition rates by tuning various experimental parameters in an effort to support the mechanism for the formation of Pt octahedra. In addition, we have investigated the catalytic activity of these Pt nanocrystals towards oxygen reduction. For the 9-nm Pt octahedra enclosed by {111} facets, they show a specific activity of 1.5 mA cm(-2), much greater than that of Pt nanocubes enclosed by {100} facets, which only has a specific activity of 0.28 mA cm(-2).									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2199-692X			WOS:000417743900008		
J	Davankov, Vadim A.				Davankov, Vadim A/B-4262-2013				Critical review on the origin of atmospheric oxygen: Where is organic matter?								PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE				190						105023	10.1016/j.pss.2020.105023				OCT 1 2020	2020	In a short note of 1998 Davankov questioned the generally accepted notion that the unique features of the planet Earth, namely, the presence of life and atmospheric oxygen are inseparably bonded as a case and effect. Indeed, photosynthesis in terrestrial and aquatic phototrophs simultaneously produces oxygen and carbohydrates in almost equal amounts. Since the degradation of organic matter through burning or rotting also consumes an equivalent amount of oxygen, the total masses of oxygen and organic material must always remain comparable. This correlation for Earth appears to be drastically distorted in favor of oxygen, thus disproving the still widespread delusion of biogenic origin of atmospheric oxygen. Instead, by analyzing more recent data on the balance between oxygen and organics we arrive at the conclusion that radiolysis of water vapors with the preferential dissipation of hydrogen to space, most probably, was the major source of the free and oxidation-spent oxygen. The present review tries to illuminate the most important uncertainties that still remain to be clarified before an interdisciplinary and scientifically-balanced picture on the evolution of Earth gets settled.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0032-0633			WOS:000555808800006

The composition of the mantle determines volcanic emissions, which are intimately linked to evolution of the primitive atmosphere. Fundamental questions remain on how and when the proto-Earth mantle became oxidized, and whether redox state is homogeneous or developed large-scale structures. Here we present experiments in which we subjected two synthetic samples of nearly identical composition that are representative of the lower mantle (enstatite chondrite), but synthesized under different oxygen fugacities, to pressures and temperatures up to 90 GPa and 2,400 K. In addition to the mineral bridgmanite, compression of the more reduced material also produced Al2O3 as a separate phase, and the resulting assemblage is about 1 to 1.5% denser than in experiments with the more oxidized material. Our geodynamic simulations suggest that such a density difference can cause a rapid ascent and accumulation of oxidized material in the upper mantle, with descent of the denser reduced material to the core-mantle boundary. We suggest that the resulting heterogeneous redox conditions in Earth's interior can contribute to the large low-shear velocity provinces in the lower mantle and the evolution of atmospheric oxygen.									19	0	0	0	5	0	19			1752-0894	1752-0908		WOS:000383283700021

The morphology of Pt-based nanoparticles supported on carbon was controlled to enhance the catalytic performance in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). detailed study of the microstructural characteristics and electrochemical behavior of the de-alloyed electrocatalysts made it possible to obtain a correlation between the effect PtCu/C materials initial composition and their ORR activity. It has been established that the initial content of the alloying component has a significant effect on the structural reor-ganization of bimetallic nanoparticles. Electrochemical study results showed that the ORR performance of de-alloyed PtCu/C catalyst with large Cu content in the initial structure was better than that of de-alloyed PtCu/C catalysts with low Cu content due to the morphology advantages. A successful reorganization of NPs structure increased the ORR activity of the de-alloyed catalysts by two times. A presented approach can be applied to design of different ORR electrocatalysts based on the PtM nanoparticles.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Thorough characterization of the organic reaction products shows that tributylamine is converted to dibutylformamide and propionaldehyde. Kinetic studies and radical trapping experiments suggest that this occurs via initial single-electron transfer from the amine to 1 coupled with C-H-alpha proton transfer from the oxidized amine. EPR spectroscopy and base inhibition studies indicate that coordination of the amine to 1 is a critical step prior to the electron transfer step. Rate data and its dependence on the amine indicate that the ability of the amine to reduce 1 is correlated to its basicity rather than to its reduction potential. Weakly basic amines were unable to reduce 1 irrespective of their reduction potential. This was inferred to indicate that proton transfer from the amine radical cation is also important in the reduction of 1 by tertiary amines. Comparison of the activation energy with reaction thermodynamics indicates that proton transfer and electron transfer must be concerted to explain the rapidity of the reaction. The fate of the amine radical is dependent on the presence of oxygen, and labeling studies show that oxygen in the organic products arises from dioxygen, although incorporation from trace water was also observed. These data indicate that inhibition of the hydrolytic quenching of the amine radical in an aprotic solvent results in a different fate for the amine radical when compared to amine oxidation reactions in aqueous solution. The proposed mechanism gives new insight into the ability of amines with high reduction potential to reduce metal ions of lower potential. In particular, these data are consistent with the ability of small amines and certain amine-containing buffers to inhibit manganese-dependent oxygen evolution in photosynthesis, which arises in some cases as a result of manganese reduction and its concomitant loss from the PS II reaction center.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			0020-1669			WOS:000165858100033	11151386

The possible revolution of the reaction composition and the corresponding isothermal redox reactions also have been carried out. Compared with the effect of temperature rise (800-1000 degrees C) on the formation of carbon deposition, it is more conducive to the reduction of iron oxide. In the oxidation stage, the temperature of 400-650 degrees C is favorable for inhibiting the formation of C and Fe3C, which greatly influenced the quality of hydrogen production. The compounds such as FeTiO3, FeTi2O5 and Fe2TiO5 can be regenerated by water vapor. However, FeAl2O4 and MgFe2O4 are irreversible, resulting in the loss of reducible iron species. Equilibrium composition study revealed that syngas with an ideal ratio of (H-2/CO = 2) can be obtained at a temperature higher than 900 degrees C, while the carbon deposition has been inhibited. Both the thermodynamic analysis and experiment showed that the chemical thermodynamics analysis method is a leading approach for the reaction characteristic studies of chemical looping reforming of methane.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1875-5100	2212-3865		WOS:000605213400003

In that context, two different types of carbon nanodots (CNDs) with amide (CND-CONH2) and carboxylic (CND-COOH) surface groups, have herein been fabricated and shown to exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the ORR in acid and basic media (0.1M H2SO4 and 0.1M KOH). CND surface modified carbon screen-printed electrodes allow for a facile electrode modification and enabling the study of the CNDs electrocatalytic activity towards the ORR. CND-COOH modified SPEs are found to exhibit improved ORR peak current and reduced overpotential by 21.9% and 26.3%, respectively compared to bare/unmodified SPEs. Additionally, 424gcm(-2) CND-COOH modified SPEs in oxygenated 0.1M KOH are found to facilitate the ORR via a near optimal 4 (3.8) electron ORR pathway. The CNDs also exhibited excellent long-term stability and tolerance with no degradation being observed in the achievable current with the ORR current returning to the baseline level within 100 seconds of exposure to a 1.5M solution of methanol. In summary, the CND-COOH could be utilised as a cathodic electrode for PEMFCs offering greater stability than a commercial Pt electrode.									18	1	0	0	2	0	18			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000427246500005

In this study, we reported a new porous nano-micro-composite as a bi-functional electrocatalyst for ZABs, devised by the in situ growth of metal-organic framework (MOF) nanocrystals onto the micrometer-sized Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3(BSCF) perovskite oxide. Upon carbonization, MOF was converted to porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanocages and ultrafine cobalt oxides and CoN(4)nanoparticles dispersing inside the carbon nanocages, which further anchored on the surface of BSCF oxide. We homogeneously dispersed BSCF perovskite particles in the surfactant; subsequently, ZIF-67 nanocrystals were grown onto the BSCF particles. In this way, leaching of metallic or organic species in MOFs and the aggregation of BSCF were effectively suppressed, thus maximizing the number of active sites for improving OER. The BSCF in turn acted as catalyst to promote the graphitization of carbon during pyrolysis, as well as to optimize the transition metal-to-carbon ratio, thus enhancing the ORR catalytic activity. A ZAB fabricated from such air electrode showed outstanding performance with a potential gap of only 0.83 V at 5 mA cm(-2)for OER/ORR. Notably, no obvious performance degradation was observed for the continuous charge-discharge operation for 1800 cycles over an extended period of 300 h.									34	3	0	0	1	0	33			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000542803000002	34138109

Here, graphene is co-doped with n-type dopants such as phosphorus and halogen (Cl, Br, I). Phosphorus and halogen are introduced through the treatment of graphene oxide with PX3 gas (PCl3, PBr3, and PI3). Graphene oxides are prepared through chlorate and permanganate routes. Detailed chemical and structural characterization demonstrates that the graphene sheets are covered homogeneously by phosphorus and halogen atoms. It is found that the amount of phosphorus and halogen introduced depends on the graphene oxide preparation method. The electrocatalytic effect of the resulting co-doped materials is demonstrated for industrially relevant electrochemical reactions such as the hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions.									19	1	0	0	2	0	20			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000384807600017	27608178

The first step is the oxidation of the superficial sites, where the chloride ion is electroadsorbed giving the atomic chlorine intermediate. The later discharge of chlorine can take place either by recombination of two adsorbed intermediates or by the reaction between the intermediate and the chloride ion, being both chemical steps. The expression of the intrinsic polarisation resistance Rp(o), as a function of the activity of chloride a(Cl-)(o*) and the partial pressure of chlorine (p) over bar (Cl2) was obtained from the resolution of the kinetic mechanism and it was compared with experimental data. The correlations of the independent experimental relationships Rp(o). versus a(Cl-)(o*) and Rp(o) versus (p) over bar (cl2) were remarkably good, giving strong evidence that the ClER takes place through the proposed mechanism on the RuO2 electrodes. The kinetic constants obtained from the correlations were used for the simulation of the dependences of the current density and the surface coverages on overpotential.

It is particularly relevant for solar-assisted reactions that are currently too poorly catalyzed to be practically viable, such as photoelectrochemical splitting of water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. In this work we describe synergistic amplification of water oxidation photoelectrocatalysis by the use of a thin layer electroactive polymer support. Coating of a bare Pt surface with a 0.98 mu m thick film of poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) containing a specific molar ratio of nano-Co3O4 (a water oxidation catalyst) and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (oxidatively stable conductors) synergistically amplifies its rate of water oxidation catalysis by 15-fold (under the most oxidizing conditions that can be applied to PEDOT without degradation; with light illumination of 0.25 sun). To the best of our knowledge, this film is the most active water oxidation catalyst yet reported under near-neutral (pH 12) conditions as a proportion of the activity of Pt, which is the industry-standard catalyst of the reaction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000506570200001

Herein, we first fabricated a self-standing bimetallic FeCo Prussian blue analogue nanosheet array (FeCo PBA) on Ni foam through ion exchange between K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] and hydrothermal synthesized Co-3(PO4)(2)center dot 8H(2)O nanosheet arrays. Then the obtained FeCo PBA were facilely transformed into FeCo/C and FeCoP/C nanosheet arrays through hydrogenation and phosphidation, respectively. Benefiting from the enhanced mass transfer in porous structure, the intimate contact with Ni framework and the synergistic effect of bimetal sites, the resultant FeCo/C NS and FeCoP/C NS demonstrate superior oxygen and hydrogen evolution activity in alkaline media, respectively. Impressively, a low cell voltage of 1.55 V is sufficient to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) by coupling FeCo/C NS and FeCoP/C NS in a two-electrode water splitting electrolyzer, surpassing the performance of PtC based couple (V-cell,V-10 = 1.60 V). This work provides a new approach to construct highly efficient and cost-effective water splitting electrodes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Via first principles calculations, we systematically investigated the electrocatalytic performance of two-dimensional (2D) metal-hexahydroxybenzene frameworks (M-3(C6O6 )(2), where M denotes Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, and Pd) for ORR. Owing to the sufficient Jr-electron conjugation and effective interaction between the metal and the organic linkers, the studied 2D M-3(C6O6)(2) are all metallic with good conductivity for electron transfer. Interestingly, the catalytic activity of M-3(C6O6)(2) turns out to be dependent on the interaction strength between the ORR intermediates and the metal complex (MO4) and can be modified by changing the metal atoms with different d-electron occupations. Remarkably, while 2D Mn-3(C6O6)(2), Fe-3(C6O6)(2), and Rh-3(C6O6)(2) show a rather good ORR activity rivaling that of Pt, 2D Co-3(C6O6)(2) presents a much higher onset potential than that of Pt. Our investigations provide important insights into designing and screening efficient ORR catalysts.									35	2	0	0	0	0	34			2168-0485			WOS:000535305600024

Toward unlocking the energy capabilities of Li-O-2 batteries, it is crucial to have a fundamental understanding of the origin of sudden death in terms of reactive sites and transport limitations. Herein, a mechanistic study is presented on a model system of Au|Li2O2|Li+ electrolyte, in which the Au electrode was passivated with a thin Li2O2 film by discharging to the state of sudden death. Direct conductivity measurement of the Li2O2 film and in situ spectroscopic study of ORR using O-18(2) for passivation and O-16(2) for further discharging provide compelling evidence that ORR (and O-2 evolution reaction as well) occurs at the buried interface of Au|Li2O2 and is limited by electron instead of Li+ and O-2 transport.									128	8	0	0	9	0	130			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000374564300011	26970228

Surface sensitive techniques provide a unique perspective allowing the study of the structure, adsorption sites, and reactivity of catalysts at the atomic scale, which furnishes rationalization and improves the design of highly efficient catalytic materials. Here, a scanning probe microscopy study complemented by density functional theory on the structural and electronic properties of CoO nanoislands grown on Au(111) is reported. Two distinct phases are observed: The most extended displays a Moire pattern (alpha-region), while the less abundant is 1Co:1Au coincidental (beta-region). As a result of the surface registry, in the beta-region the oxide adlayer is compressed by 9%, increasing the unoccupied local density of states and enhancing the selective water adsorption at low temperature through a cobalt inversion mechanism. Tip-induced voltage pulses irreversibly transform alpha- into beta-regions, thus opening avenues to modify the structure and reactivity of transition metal oxides by external stimuli like electric fields.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000745484300001	35064636

The infiltration of samaria-doped ceria nanoparticles (i-SDC) in La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF)-SDC scaffolds enhanced performances for the oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction without noticeable degradation. The exchange current density J0 on 30 vol.% i-SDC/LSCF-SDC was about 3 to 4 times larger than that without i-SDC at 900 to 750 degC. Such an increase in the J0 values is ascribed, with certainty, predominantly to an increase in the transport rate of oxide ions through the SDC particles of the LSCF-SDC composite and i-SDC. The durability of a double-layer hydrogen electrode, consisting of SDC scaffold with highly dispersed Ni-Co nanoparticles as the catalyst layer and a thin current collecting layer of Ni-YSZ cermet, was found to be improved greatly by a reversible cycling operation between electrolysis and fuel cell-modes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1938-5862			INSPEC:20439187

However, it is still a challenge to construct metal selenides-based interfacial nanomaterials with satisfactory oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performances for overall water splitting. Herein, sandwich-like structured NiSe2/Ni2P@FeP nanosheet arrays are rationally constructed, which starts from NiSe2 arrays directly on carbon cloth as backbones, followed by coating FeP nanoparticles on the backbones through the phosphorization process. Further, abundant nanointerfaces with rich defects and disordered structure are constructed during the phosphorization process, which can boost the charge transfer rate and provide rich electroactive sites. Consequently, as-synthesized NiSe2/Ni2P@FeP nanosheet arrays exhibit good HER and OER performances with small overpotentials, low Tafel slopes and good stability. Further, the overall water splitting device built by NiSe2/Ni2P@FeP exhibits a voltage of 1.554 V to attain 10 mA cm(-2). Our current work may provide some new insights on rationally constructing nanointerfaces with rich defects to boost the catalytic performances for overall water splitting.									42	2	0	0	1	0	43			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000503098300018

In particular, transition metal-based selenides exhibit excellent capability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the currently reported synthesis approaches for transition metal-based compounds involve generally complicated, time consuming, energy-intensive and low-yield steps. Herein, we reported a simple, rapid and scalable microwave method for the first time and successfully synthesized a series of ultra-small size transition metal selenide nanoparticles (similar to 5 nm in diameter) loaded on the carbon nanotube (CNT) surface. The entire reaction only takes 120 seconds and enables to obtain gram-level products. By benchmarking the OER activity, the ratio and composition optimized Ni0.27Co0.28Fe0.30Se@CNT exhibits superior water oxidation performance, requiring only 291 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) (48 mV smaller than that of the commercial RuO2, which is currently one of the most efficient transition metal-based catalysts). In addition, Ni0.27Co0.28Fe0.30Se@CNT demonstrates excellent stability up to 50 hours. This work offers a highly efficient synthesis method for ultra-small size transition metal-based selenides with outstanding catalytic performance. More profoundly, this method also pioneers a creative synthesis avenue for other transition metal compounds, such as sulfides, phosphides, etc.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000710572100001

However, it still remains challenging to design an ideal multifunctional material for these purposes. Here, we propose the MoSSe/g-GeC heterostructure that can both realize overall water splitting reaction and serve as a potential candidate for solar cell. The first-principle calculations reveal that the MoSSe/g-GeC heterostructure possesses type-II band alignment, efficient charge separation, and noticeable visible-light adsorption, which supports its good photoelectronic performance. Applying appropriate strain can further promote the photocatalytic and photovoltaic properties of the MoSSe/g-GeC heterostmcture. Especially, 4% compressive strain reduce the Gibbs free energy change of HER/OER to 0.01 eV/1.98 eV by changing interfacial charge transfer. While under 2% tensile strain, the power conversion efficiency of the MoSSe/g-GeC heterostructure is improved by around 35%. Our results indicate that MoSSe/g-GeC heterostructure is a promising multifunctional material for solar harvesting and contribute to developing more relevant systems.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000618306100007

Herein, an efficient Fe-doped Bi7O9I3 microflowers photocatalyst was synthesized. It was discovered that Fe doping could not only tune the concentration of oxygen vacancies of Bi7O9I3 to optimize the dissociation of excitons, but also promote the separation of charge-carriers and the activation of oxygen molecules. Meanwhile, the inducing of surface oxygen vacancies and Fe3+/Fe2+ by Fe optimal doping can act as the activation center for catalytic reactions, which also significantly enhances the photocatalytic activity. Benefiting from the optimized properties, the photocatalytic activity of Fe-doped Bi7O9I3 photocatalyst has been significantly improved by more than 4 times. Finally, we proposed that a highly efficient catalytic oxidation reaction mechanism can be achieved via modulating Fe doping to induce oxygen vacancies to promote charge separation and molecular oxygen activation. This work provides a novel approach for designing efficient photocatalysts.									59	0	0	0	15	0	58			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000623590700002

The resulted hybrid (CCHH/MWCNT) is used as high efficient electrocatalyst for water oxidation with an extremely low onset potential of similar to 1.47 V vs. RHE and an overpotential of 285 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH. The CCHH/MWCNT electrode affords a Tafel slope of 51 mV/ decade and an exchange current density of 2.5 x 10(-7) A cm(-2). Moreover, the CCHH/MWCNT catalyst delivers a high faradic efficiency of 95% and possesses remarkable stability for long-term electrolysis of water. By contrast, neither MWCNT nor CCHH exhibits apparent catalytical activity towards water oxidation. Importantly, we demonstrate that DETA plays crucial role in determining the morphology, structure of the CCHH/MWCNT, therefore resulting in an enhanced performance for water oxidation. This work not only provides a novel cobalt-based electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution, but also offers a useful and viable approach to deliberately synthesize functional nanocomposites for applications in energy conversion and storage.

Herein, hydroxide modification and element incorporation have been demonstrated to realize a synergistic modulation on a new class of M(OH)(x)/M-MoPOx catalysts for accelerating water dissociation and hydrogen ad-desorption steps in the HER. Theoretical and experimental results disclosed that in situ modification with hydroxide endowed M(OH)(x)/M-MoPOx with a strong ability to dissociate water, and meanwhile, oxygen incorporation effectively optimized the M-H-ad energetics of the NiMoP catalyst. Moreover, the interaction between M(OH)(x) and M-MoPOx components in M(OH)(x)/M-MoPOx further enhances their ability to catalyze the two elementary steps in alkaline hydrogen evolution, providing a wide avenue for efficiently catalyzing hydrogen evolution. In general, the optimized Ni(OH)(2)/NiMoPOx catalyst exhibits excellent alkaline HER activity and durability, superior to the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst when the overpotential exceeds 65 mV.									29	3	0	0	1	0	31			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000519240000020	34084414

The obtained CoZn@NG-nPVP samples display three-dimensional porous microsphere structures. Compared with CoZn@NG samples derived from Zn-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) without PVP, the CoZn@NG-nPVP samples derived from Zn-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)-nPVP with PVP exhibit more carbon defects, larger BET specific surface area, and higher contents of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N, leading to the high activity of the catalyst. The onset potential of CoZn@NG-4PVP-900 catalyst towards ORR is 0.98 V (vs. RHE) and the half-wave potential is 0.87 V (vs. RHE), which are comparable with that of commercial Pt/C. In addition, the electrochemical stability of CoZn@NG-4PVP-900 is much higher than that of commercial Pt/C.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000691152300001

In this work, N-doped graphene (N-G) and cobalt species modified N-doped graphene (Co-N-G) are synthesized via a facile two-step and low-cost reactive template approach, and this method did not suffer from complicated manipulation, high cost and corrosive precursors. The resultant catalyst Co-N-G at 800 degrees C (Co-N-G-800) exhibits relatively high surface area (up to 388.6 m(2) g(-1)) and nitrogen content (6.23 wt%). Compared to N-doped graphene (N-G), Co-N-G-800 displays greatly improved ORR catalytic performance, such as more positive ORR peak potential, higher half-wave potential, and larger current density. The enhanced ORR performance of Co-N-G-800 can be attributed to the synergetic effect of the high conductivity of graphene matrix, high proportion of pyrrolic-nitrogen, and Co-N-x active sites.

The as-synthesized catalyst shows excellent catalytic activity for oxygen reduction with its performance close to commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. Compared to free Co3O4 particles, the enhanced performance mainly comes from the synergistic effect of Co3O4 and bio-carbon substrate. The carbonized butterfly wing shows unique porous structure with both high surface area and good connectivity, providing a firm and conductive support for active oxide nanoparticles.

Understanding the mechanism of function of such electrocatalysts at the atomic scale and under realistic working conditions is a challenging, yet important, task for advancing efficient and stable function. This is particularly true for the case of oxygen evolution catalysts and, here, we study a highly active Co3O4/Co(OH)(2) biphasic electrocatalyst on Si by means of operando ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy performed at the solid/liquid electrified interface. Spectral simulation and multiplet fitting reveal that the catalyst undergoes chemical-structural transformations as a function of the applied anodic potential, with complete conversion of the Co(OH)(2) and partial conversion of the spinel Co3O4 phases to CoO(OH) under precatalytic electrochemical conditions. Furthermore, we observe new spectral features in both Co 2p and O 1s core-level regions to emerge under oxygen evolution reaction conditions on CoO(OH). The operando photoelectron spectra support assignment of these newly observed features to highly active Co4+ centers under catalytic conditions. Comparison of these results to those from a pure phase spinel Co3O4 catalyst supports this interpretation and reveals that the presence of Co(OH)(2) enhances catalytic activity by promoting transformations to CoO(OH). The direct investigation of electrified interfaces presented in this work can be extended to different materials under realistic catalytic conditions, thereby providing a powerful tool for mechanism discovery and an enabling capability for catalyst design.									176	8	0	0	6	0	178			0002-7863			WOS:000405158900026	28598604

The ratio of {0 2 3} to {0 0 1} facets could be simply adjusted by tuning the NaOH and EA concentrations during the solvothermal growth process. It was demonstrated that the photocatalytic activities of the variously shaped SrTiO3 should be closely related to the morphology of SrTiO3, i.e., the ratio of {0 2 3} to {0 0 1} facet. The highest photocatalytic activities are achieved for SrTiO3 single crystals with the ratio of {0 2 3} to {0 0 1} facet tuned to 35:65, with hydrogen and oxygen evolution rates reaching 71.1 and 30.0 mu mol/h, respectively, which are about 9.5 and 3.0 times higher than those of the irregular SrTiO3 particles. Facet selective photo-deposition of metal ions reveals that the high-indexed {0 2 3} facets provided active sites for photo-oxidation reaction, while the {0 0 1} facets offered active sites for photo-reduction reaction. Such spatially separated photoactive reduction and oxidation sites should benefit charge separation in a SrTiO3 single crystal, leading to higher photocatalytic activity related to the irregular SiTiO3 particles.

Although many strategies have been proposed to boost the electrocatalysts' performance, efficient and cost-effective methods are rare. Recently, hydrogen (H-2) and oxygen (O-2) production via water electrolysis has seen increased interest. To efficiently produce using electrochemical water splitting (EWS), there are many resistances in electrolysis systems that must be reduced. One of the major resistances in the system that dramatically reduces the system's efficiency is the adhesion of evolved gas bubbles to the surface of the electrode. Blocked active sites occur when bubbles adhere to the surface. As a result, a decrease in mass transfer ability can be expected, which can severely damage the gas production efficiency. One of the main techniques that is able to reduce bubble adhesion is to make electrocatalysts with superaerophobic and/or superhydrophilic surfaces. These surfaces can be created using different morphologies, such as nanosheets, nanotubes, and nanowires.

Semiconductors can be used as photocatalysts that enable the simultaneous production of hydrogen and oxygen from water via water splitting and in recent years inorganic semiconductor photocatalysts have been significantly improved in terms of their performance with organic semiconductors emerging as a potential alternative, though mostly studied for sacrificial half-reactions. Herein, we present recent developments in using organic semiconductors as photocatalysts highlighting their potential due to their synthetic tunability. We will particularly focus on their application in overall water splitting without using sacrificial reagents and suggest future directions in using these materials in large scale applications before concluding with suggestions for a wider community to focus research efforts on particular challenges in the field and opportunities that organic materials offer.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000678766500001

These films were produced on glassy carbon and gold electrodes. The electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and cyclic voltammetry were used to study the in situ growth of poly(Ni(4-TMPyP)) films. The electrochemical properties of poly(Ni(4-TMPyP)) films indicate that the redox process was confined in to the immobilized film. The electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance results showed an ion exchange reaction for the redox couple. The polymer films showed one new redox couple when transferred to strong and weak basic aqueous solutions and the formal potential was found to be pH dependent. The electrocatalytic oxidation of H2O by a nickel tetrakis(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin film-modified electrode was also performed. The mechanism of oxygen evolution was determined by cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and rotating ring disc electrode methods. The oxygen evolution was determined by a bicatalyst system using hemoglobin, and iron tetrakis (N-methyl-2-pyridyl)porphyrin as catalyst to detect the oxygen by electrocatalytic reduction. The electrocatalytic oxidations of adenine, guanine, H2O2, N2H4, NH2OH, and L-cysteine by the film-modified electrode obtained from water-soluble nickel porphyrin were also investigated.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000244199400004

Herein, we fabricate the ultrafine Fe (variations on Fe amounts, chi(Fe) = M-Fe/M(Co+Fe)) and B modulated CoFeBO nanoparticles as efficient water oxidation precatalysts. In view of intrinsic amorphous nanostructure, optimal Fe-doping amounts and borate-rich CoFeOOH active nanosheets formed on the surface of CoFeBO nanoparticles during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, the CoFeBO (chi(Fe) = 0.3) precatalyst has demonstrated active electrochemical water oxidation properties under widen pH value from neutral to alkaline conditions. It exhibits only 263 mV in overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) on glassy carbon (GC) electrode with the lowest Tafel slope of 39 mV/dec in 1 M KOH solution, which outperforms those of individual CoBO and FeBO as well as commercial RuO2 electrocatalyst in the same electrolyte. Moreover, continuous stability tests in 1 M KOH solution by recording potential response at 10 mA/cm(2) for 28 h and current response at overpotential of 270 mV for another 28 h show no obvious fluctuation. Combining the merits of cost-efficient, scalable synthesis and active water oxidation performances, amorphous CoFeBO nanoparticles could be employed as highly active OER precatalysts for OER.

Surface modification of hematite photoanodes with a suitable water oxidation cocatalyst is a key strategy for improving the kinetics of water oxidation. In this study, a CeO(x)overlayer is deposited on the surface of the hematite photoanode by a water-based solution method with ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) followed by heat treatment. The photocurrent of CeOx-modified hematite is 3 times higher than that of pristine hematite (at 1.23 V vs. RHE) under AM 1.5G, 1 sun conditions. Through hole-scavenger measurements, Tafel plot analysis, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, it is concluded that CeO(x)overlayer increases the hole injection efficiency, improves the surface catalytic activity, and enhances charge transfer across the photoanode/electrolyte interface. These observations are attributed to the synergistic effects of Ce3+/Ce(4+)redox species in CeO(x)and the oxygen vacancies. This work elucidates the role of CeO(x)as an efficient cocatalyst overlayer to improve the OER kinetics of photoanodes.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000565350500001	32776429

But the factor determining PMS activation efficiency of perovskite and the evolution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) remain equivocal and elusive. In this study, we proposed an oxygen defect dependent PMS activation mechanism over perovskite with the singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) as the dominant ROS. Among the tested four perovskites, ofloxacin (OFX) degradation efficiency increased with the following order: LaFeO3 < LaZnO3 < LaMnO3 < LaNiO3, which agreed well with their oxygen defect amounts based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis. The results clearly demonstrated a good relationship among oxygen defects in LaBO3, OFX degradation efficiency and O-1(2) concentration. Moreover, O-1(2) evolution mechanism over perovskite by decreasing the activation energy of PMS self-decomposition was proposed. The O-1(2) mediated OFX degradation pathway was further studied by HPLC-MS technique and three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (3D EEMs). This work provides a new insight into PMS activation by perovskites and favors its application in actual water treatment.									118	6	0	0	59	0	120			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000454137400081

The goal of this work is to describe the activity and durability of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in a representative proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) anode environment. Three unsupported and one TiO2 supported IrOx OER catalysts are investigated using ex situ accelerated stress testing (AST). The catalysts are ranked based on the ex situ OER activities and the concentration of dissolved Ir in the electrolyte after ex situ AST. Furthermore, the ex situ interaction between IrOx and the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalyst PVC is investigated to better understand the voltage reversal performance in fuel cells. The ex situ results are compared with reversal times and reversal time losses (i.e., difference between beginning of test (BOT) and end of test (EOT) reversal times) obtained in a PEMFC subjected to accelerated anode stress test (AAST). Generally, catalysts with higher ex situ OER mass activity and Ir dissolution produced the longest BOT reversal times. The smallest reversal loss (i.e., highest OER durability) is shown by IrOx/TiO2. Regarding unsupported IrOx, heat treatment increasing crystallinity is an effective method to increase OER durability in the fuel cell anode environment.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000461408300006		
J	Huang, Baobing; Liu, Yuchuan; Xie, Zailai								Biomass derived 2D carbons via a hydrothermal carbonization method as efficient bifunctional ORR/HER electrocatalysts								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				5	45			23481	23488		10.1039/c7ta08052b				DEC 7 2017	2017	Biomass derived carbons via hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) are critically important for different applications due to their low cost, eco-friendly properties, light weight and potential for the catalysis research field. However, standard HTC carbons commonly present amorphous and spherical morphology with low surface areas and large particle size. Here we report a 2D morphology of crystalline carbons via a HTC method by employing the biomolecule guanine and diverse carbohydrates (glucose, fructose and cellulose) as carbon precursors. Importantly, the addition of guanine to the HTC process plays a significant role in producing the 2D-morphology of carbon materials from the diverse carbohydrates. Hierarchical porous nitrogen-doped carbons with high surface areas up to 974 m(2) g(-1) and nitrogen contents as high as 2.39 at% are made by further high temperature carbonization. The current 2D carbons are found to be highly active toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a rather positive half-wave potential of 0.87 V (vs. the RHE) and a large limiting current density of 5.9 mA cm(-2). These catalysts outperform most other equivalent benchmarks as well as Pt-based electrocatalysts, meanwhile being efficient for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a very low overpotential of 0.35 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline medium. It is expected that our synthetic protocol can be extended to various bio-nucleobases, yielding all-sustainable bio-based electrocatalysts with a tunable structure, elemental composition, porosity and electronic properties.									129	6	0	0	8	0	130			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000415990800009

A thin IrO2 film of submicron thickness was uniformly coated onto a porous Ti mesh substrate by anodic electrodeposition. The electrodeposited IrO2 film plays the dual role of a catalyst layer for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and a corrosion-protection layer that prevents oxidation of the inner Ti. The e-IrO2/Ti exhibited high performance (0.97 A cm(-2) at 1.6 V) despite a low IrO2 loading (0.4 mg cm(-2)) in single-cell tests conducted at 120 degrees C, which is comparable to that of conventional electrodes with greater catalyst loadings (0.8-5 mg cm(-2)). Furthermore, corrosion polarization tests reveal that the IrO2 coating physically blocks exposure of the Ti diffusion layer, thereby reducing Ti corrosion by 82% in 0.5 M H2SO4 at 25 degrees C. The low degradation rate (1.5 mA cm(-2) h(-1) (0.11% h(-1))) obtained in aging experiments at 120 degrees C and 1.72 V (voltage efficiency of 85%) confirms the excellent stability of this electrode.									45	1	0	0	2	0	47			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000425476800031

One of the effective routes to produce green fuel with the help of an integrated solar system is to develop a cost-effective, robust, and bifunctional electrocatalyst by complete water splitting. Herein, we report a superhydrophilic layered leaflike Sn4P3 on a graphene-carbon nanotube matrix which shows outstanding electrochemical performance in terms of low overpotential (hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), 62 mV@10 mA/cm(2), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), 169 mV@20 mA/cm(2)). The outstanding stability of HER at least for 15 days at a high applied current density of 400 mA/cm(2) with a minimum loss of potential (1%) in acid medium infers its potential compatibility toward the industrial sector. Theoretical calculations indicate that the decoration of Sn4P3 on carbon nanotubes modulates the electronic structure by creating a higher density of state near Fermi energy. The catalyst also reveals an admirable overall water splitting performance by generating a low cell voltage of 1.482 Vp10 mA/cm(2) with a stability of at least 65 h without obvious degradation of potential in 1 M KOH. It exhibited unassisted solar energy-driven water splitting when coupled with a silicon solar cell by extracting a high stable photocurrent density of 8.89 mA/cm(2) at least for 90 h with 100% retention that demonstrates a high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of similar to 10.82%. The catalyst unveils a footprint for pure renewable fuel production toward carbon-free future green energy innovation.									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000780214300125	35188366

To achieve this goal, suitable tuning of the structure and composition of electrocatalytic materials is a promising approach that has attracted much attention in recent years. Herein, novel hybrid amorphous ZIF-67@Co-3(PO4)(2) electrocatalysts with yolk-shell structures were prepared using a reflux method. It is demonstrated that yolk-shelled ZIF-67@Co-3(PO4)(2) is not only an active catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) but also an efficient catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The optimized composite electrode showed superior performance with low overpotentials of 73 and 334 mV @ 10 mA.cm(-2) toward HER and OER, respectively, and a low potential of 1.62 V @ 10 mA. cm(-2) and 1.66 V @ 30 mA.cm(-2) in a practical OWS test under alkaline conditions. N-O bonds were formed to connect the two components of ZIF-67 and Co-3(PO4)(2) in the composite ZIF-67@Co-3(PO4)(2), which indicates that the two components are synergistic but not isolated, and this synergistic effect may be one of the important reasons to boost the oxygen and hydrogen evolution performances of the hybrid. Based on experimental data, the high electrocatalytic performance was inferred to be related to the unique structure of ZIF-67, tuning the ability of Co-3(PO4)(2) and synergism between ZIF-67 and Co-3(PO4)(2). The preparation strategy reported herein can be extended for the rational design and synthesis of cheap, active, and long-lasting bifunctional electrocatalysts for OWS and other renewable energy devices.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000712069300048	34505763

Differential expression analyses between two conditions further narrowed the prediction to 27 aerobe-specific COGs. Then, we annotated the enzymes associated with these COGs. Literature review revealed that 14 COGs contained enzymes catalysing oxygen-involved reactions or products involved in aerobic pathways, suggesting their important roles for survival in aerobic environments. Additionally, protein-protein interaction analyses and step length comparisons of metabolic networks suggested that the other 13 COGs may function relevantly with the 14 enzymes-corresponding COGs, indicating that these genes may be highly associated with oxygen utilization. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses showed that the 27 COGs did not have similar trees, and all suffered purifying selection pressures. The divergent times of species containing or lacking aerobic COGs validated that the appearing time of oxygen-utilizing gene was approximately 2.80 Gyr ago. In addition to help better understand oxygen adaption, our method may be extended to identify genes relevant to other living environments.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1462-2912	1462-2920		WOS:000447549700028	30187624

However, the rational design of sufficient and subtle modulators is still challenging. With a multimetal layered double hydroxide (LDH) as the OER catalyst, this study introduces a series of operando high-valence dopants (Cr, Ru, Ce, and V), which can restrict the 3+ valence states in the LDH template to prevent phase separation and operando transfer to the >3+ valence states for sufficient electronic interaction during the OER process. Through density functional theory simulations, ultrathin Cr-doped NiFe (NiFeCr) LDH is synthesized with strong electronic interaction between Cr dopants and NiFe bimetallic sites, evidenced by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The resulting NiFeCr-LDH catalyzes the OER with ultralow overpotentials of 189 and 284 mV, obtaining current densities of 10 and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively. Further, a NiFeCr-LDH anode is coupled in the anion exchange membrane electrolyzers to promote alkaline water splitting and CO2-to-CO electrolysis, which achieves low full cell voltages at high current densities.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000778966200001	35388963

Physical characterizations have confirmed the formation of NiCo2O4 nanoplatelets created by selective adsorption of PVP onto specific crystal orientations, which provides spatial confinement for an anisotropic growth into 2-dimensional nanostructures. In addition, the decomposition of surface adsorbed PVP during the calcination process creates uniformly distributed meso-sized pores in the NiCo2O4 nanoplatelets. The beneficial hybrid and PVP effects are investigated via half-cell testing with NiCo2O4-G in comparison to graphene-free NiCo2O4 and PVP-free NiCo2O4-G, respectively, where much lower activation energy and higher current densities are observed with the mesoporous NiCo2O4-G hybrid for both ORR and OER. Furthermore, the positive impact of Ni incorporation was exclusively demonstrated, whereby NiCo2O4-G outperformed Co3O4-G in terms of onset potential and current densities for both ORR and OER. This is attributed to the increased electrical conductivity and the creation of new active sites with much lower activation energy due to the incorporation of Ni cations into the octahedral sites of the spinel crystal structure. This cost effective and highly efficient bi-functional catalyst is highly suitable for rechargeable metal-air battery technologies.									426	20	0	0	20	0	431			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000316282800019		
J	Ma, Xiaoping; Deng, Lili; Lu, Manting; He, Yi; Zou, Shuai; Xin, Yu								Heterostructure of core-shell IrCo@IrCoO (x) as efficient and stable catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction								NANOTECHNOLOGY				33	12					125702	10.1088/1361-6528/ac4068				MAR 19 2022	2022	Although researches on non-noble metal electrocatalysts have been made some progress recently, their performance in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer is still incomparable to that of noble-metal-based catalysts. Therefore, it is a more practical way to improve the utilization of precious metals in electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the acidic medium. Herein, nanostructured IrCo@IrCoO (x) core-shell electrocatalysts composed of IrCo alloy core and IrCoO (x) shell were synthesized through a simple colloidally synthesis and calcination method. As expected, the hybrid IrCo-200 NPs with petal-like morphology show the best OER activities in acidic electrolytes. They deliver lower overpotential and better electrocatalytic kinetics than pristine IrCo alloy and commercial Ir/C, reaching a low overpotential (j = 10 mA cm(-2)) of 259 mV (versus RHE) and a Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(-1). The IrCo-200 NPs displayed robust durability with life time of about 55 h in acidic solution under a large current density of 50 mA cm(-2). The enhanced electrocatalytic activity may be associated with the unique metal/amorphous metal oxide core-shell heterostructure, allowing the improved charge transferability. Moreover, the *OH-rich amorphous shell functions as the active site for OER and prevents the further dissolution of the metallic core and thus ensures high stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000733973800001	34874299

It is added to a concentration of a few grams Na2Cr2O7/ liter to the electrolyte and has several functions in the process, the most important being to increase the Faradaic efficiency for hydrogen evolution in the undivided electrochemical cells. A thin film of Cr(OH)(3) x nH(2)O formed by reductive deposition on the cathodes decreases the rate of unwanted side reactions, while still enabling hydrogen evolution to occur. In addition chromium(VI) buffers the electrolyte at the optimum pH for operation and promotes the desired homogeneous reactions in the electrolyte bulk. Chromium species also affect the rates of hydrogen and oxygen evolution at the electrodes and are said to protect the steel cathodes from corrosion.Although chromium(VI) stays in a closed loop during chlorate production, chromate is a highly toxic compound and new REACH legislation therefore intends to phase out its use in Europe from 2017. A production without chromium(VI), with no other process modifications is not possible, and today there are no commercially available alternatives to its addition. Thus, there is an urgent need for European chlorate producers to find solutions to this problem. It is expected that chromium-free production will be a requirement also in other parts of the world, following the European example.As the chromium(VI) addition affects the chlorate process in many ways its replacement might require a combination of solutions targeting each function separately. The aim of this paper is to explain the role and importance of chromium(VI) in the chlorate manufacturing process. Previous achievements in its replacement are summarized and critically evaluated to expose the current state of the field, and to highlight the most promising avenues to be followed. An attempt is also made to reveal connections with other research fields (e.g. photochemical water splitting, corrosion science) facing similar problems. Allied effort of these different communities is expected to open up research avenues to the mutual benefit of these fields. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we report an electronic push/pull effect of Co and Fe doping on the HER and OER performance of Ni-based hydroxides as revealed by thorough cyclic voltammetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. A Fe dopant pulls partial electrons from nearby Ni/Co active sites resulting in a higher electron affinity at the Ni/Co sites to facilitate OH-adsorption and charge transfer from the adsorbed OH-for OER. In contrast, a Co dopant tends to push its partial electrons to nearby Ni sites and increase the number of lattice O2- as proton adsorption sites, which lead to faster charge transfer for HER By adjusting the contents of Co/Fe dopants in Ni-based hydroxides, we were able to tune the electronic configuration of the catalyst and to optimize the OER and HER performance specifically. An optimized catalyst with a composition of Ni0.8Co0.1Fe0.1,OxHy showed excellent OER performance with an overpotential (71) of 239 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 45.4 mV.dec(-1). The HER performance was optimized with a catalyst composition of Ni0.9Co0.1OxHy and reached an 17 of 85 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 84.5 mV.dec(-1). Overall water splitting with Ni08Co0.1Fe0.1OxHy as the anode and Ni0.9Co0.1OxHy as the cathode was demonstrated at a low potential of 1.58 V at 10 mA.cm(-2). Utilizing the electronic push/pull effect by dopant elements provides a new pathway for the design and optimization of the transition hydroxides as HER and OER catalysts.									108	6	0	0	4	0	108			2155-5435			WOS:000434369600092

Herein, a defective Prussian-blue (delta-PB or Fe-1.23(III)[Fe-1.12(II)(CN)(6)](0.87).delta(0.13)) on graphene composite electrocatalyst was fabricated through a facile hydrolytic precipitation process, followed by a single-step carbonization treatment at 600 degrees C (denoted as 8-PB/G-600). The resultant optimized delta-PB/G-600 exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic water splitting in alkaline media, producing lower overpotentials of 189 and 105 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively. Most importantly, the 8-PB/G-600 shows remarkable durability for both reactions. The remark-able electrocatalysis was attributed to the abundant active sites and high electrical conductivity with a defective nature, which not only facilitate the electrolyte flux but also maintain the structural stability of 8-PB/G-600. Additionally, the high surface area confirms the facile mass transport and prompts the gaseous release of the composite. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we report a group of (27) single-atom catalysts (SACs) supported on the C2N monolayer as promising bifunctional OER/ORR catalysts by theoretical calculations. In particular, Rh@C2N exhibits a lower OER overpotential (0.37 V) than the IrO2(110) benchmark with good ORR activity, while Au and Pd@C2N are superior ORR catalysts (with an overpotential of 0.38 and 0.40 V) to Pt(111) and their OER performance is also outstanding. More importantly, we discover the origin of the bifunctional catalytic activity by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning (ML). Using DFT, we find a volcano-shaped relationship between the catalytic activity and Delta G(O), and finally link them to the normalized Fermi abundance, a parameter based on the electronic structure analysis. We further unravel the origin of element-specific activity by ML modelling based on the random forest algorithm that considers the outer electron number and oxide formation enthalpy as the two most important factors, and our model can give an accurate prediction of Delta G(O) with much reduced time and cost. This work not only paves the way for understanding the origin of bifunctional OER/ORR activity of SACs, but also benefits the rational design of novel SACs for other catalytic reactions by combining DFT and ML.									20	0	0	0	1	0	19			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000678162400001

We attempt to address such technical challenges through the design and preparation of a group of nanoporous (Fe-Ni-Co)-based metallic glasses (NP-FeNiCo-MGs) as electrocatalyts of OER. The nanoporous structure is yielded through electrochemical selective dissolution of active Fe solid solution phase in free-surface layer of (Fe-Ni-Co)-based amorphous-nanocrystalline alloys (FeNiCoANs). Electrochemical tests reveal that integral composite electrodes combining with a catalytic layer of NP-FeNiCo-MGs and a current collector of FeNiCo-ANs exhibit high catalytic activity towards water oxidation in 1 M KOH solutions, which only requires an overpotential of 274 mV to yield a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Studies of electrochemical states and electrode-electrolyte reaction process of the NP-FeNiCo-MGs during OER unveil plausible working mechanisms driving such promising catalytic activities. Based on the merits of a broad tunable range of compositions of active elements for OER, homogeneous distribution of metastable atoms, and high-surface-area nanoporous structure strongly combining with high-conductive substrate, the proposed nanoporous metallic-glass composite electrodes are of great significance for a variety of applications for clean energy.

However, the ungratified energy efficiency, large overpotential, and poor cycling stability associated with the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) at air electrodes hamper their further development. Herein, we report a facile electrodeposition method to construct three-dimensional nickel defect-rich nickel-iron layered double hydroxide nanosheets decorated with platinum-nickel alloyed nanoparticles grown on macroporous nickel foam substrates (PtNi/NixFe LDHs) as a binder-free electrocatalyst. The optimal catalyst (Pt3Ni1/NixFe LDHs) demonstrates a low overpotential (265 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2)), a small Tafel slope (22.2 mV dec(-1)) towards the OER and a high half-wave potential (0.852 V) for ORR, as well as superior long-term stability in comparison to commercial catalysts. Theoretical calculations revealed that the Ni-top site of Pt3Ni1/NixFe LDHs works as an active site for enhanced OER/ORR activities. The fabricated HSAB with Pt3Ni1/NixFe LDHs as the air cathode displayed not only an initial low overpotential gap (0.50 V) but also superior rechargeability and structure stability with high round-trip efficiency (similar to 79.9%) of over 300 cycles. These results provide a novel design of bifunctional and binder-free catalyst as the cathode for metal-air batteries.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000561168500020

Depending on the type of plasma, different species of nitrogen, oxygen and carbon have been detected on the surface of graphite. The nitrogen containing species have been attributed to pyridinic, pyrrol, quartenary and oxidized groups adsorbed on the surface. The evolution with the treatment time of the relative intensity of the different nitrogen bands for Ar + NO, N-2 + NO, air or N-2 plasmas has served to propose a model accounting for the reactions of graphite with plasmas of NO containing gases. The model explains why carbon materials (in the form of graphite, soot particles, etc.) can be very effective for the removal of the NO present in exhaust combustion gases excited by a plasma. The analysis of the C1s and O1s photoemission peaks reveals the formation of C/O adsorbed species up to a maximum concentration on the surface of around 10% atomic oxygen. A general evolution is the progressive formation of C/O species where the carbon is sp(3) hybridized. This tendency is enhanced when graphite is treated with the plasma of water.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) could be used as perfect self- sacrificed precursors/templates for preparing SACs due to their uniformly distributed and spatially separated metal nodes and organic linkers as well as designable pore structures. Recently, numerous studies have been devoted to utilizing MOFs to prepare SACs through pyrolysis. Herein, this review summarizes the most recent strategies of turning selected MOFs into SACs, focusing on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts. First, the inherent metal sites in MOFs are directly turned into single-atom sites via the high-temperature treatment with/without acid etching. Second, additional metal precursors are introduced into MOFs by various methods to further supplement active sites in the obtained SACs. Third, nonmetal heteroatom-rich (i.e., N, P and S) precursors are combined with MOFs to provide more coordination sites to anchor metal atoms. Finally, perspectives on future opportunities for selecting and designing MOFs as SAC precursors are also proposed.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2589-7780			WOS:000652366100002

Here the hybrids of CoFe layered double hydroxides (CoFe-LDHs) with polydopamine spheres (PDAS) were prepared by growing CoFe-LDHs at the surface of PDAS in situ and their catalytic activity toward the ORR was investigated in detail. The results show that the as-prepared CoFe-LDHs/PDAS hybrids exhibited higher ORR catalytic activity with 4e-route selectivity than pure CoFe-LDHs, PDAS and even calcinated CoFe-LDHs/PDAS, which displays synergistic effect between CoFe-LDHs and PDAS for ORR. Moreover, the CoFe-LDHs/PDAS hybrids demonstrated better durability than commercial Pt/C ORR catalysts. To uncover the ORR mechanism, the interaction between CoFe-LDHs and PDAS were characterized by XPS and the ORR activity of CoFe-LDHs/PDAS and CoFe-LDHs/PDAS leached with acid was compared. The catalytic behavior of CoFe-LDHs/PDAS hybrids is consistent with a dual-site ORR mechanism. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique can form dense and uniform thin films wrapping any complex 3D structure due to the self-limiting surface chemistry reactions. Herein, we developed a confinement strategy based on the ALD technique to prepare a durable Fe2Ni MIL 88-derived electrocatalyst (NiFe/NC@Al2O3-2). Due to the protection of the Al2O3 layer deposited by the ALD technique, the as-prepared catalyst retained the original rod-like structure of MIL 88 after the annealing process. With the confinement effect of the Al2O3 nanolayer, the optimized NiFe/NC@Al2O3-2 exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic properties in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with low overpotentials of 270 and 391 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, the catalyst obtained an excellent durability over 100 hours at a high current density of 50 mA cm(-2), which is superior to those of many previously reported NiFe-based electrocatalysts. The ALD-assisted confinement strategy highlights a novel method to synthesize structure- and morphology-retained MOF-derived catalysts with excellent activity and stability at high current densities.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2052-1553			WOS:000631626000003

Yeast biomass-derived materials-such as multi-heteroatoms (nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus) doped carbon (MHC) catalysts from waste biomass-can help develop efficient, eco-friendly and economical catalysts to improve the sustainability of hydrogen production. Here we report hydrogen and oxygen production in 1 M potassium hydroxide using ruthenium single atoms (RuSAs) along with Ru nanoparticles (RuNPs) embedded in MHC (RuSAs + RuNPs@MHC) as a cathode and magnetite (Fe3O4) supported on MHC (Fe3O4@MHC) as an anode. The RuSAs + RuNPs@MHC catalyst outperforms the state-of-the-art commercial platinum on carbon catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction in terms of overpotential, exchange current density, Tafel slope and durability. Furthermore, compared with industrially adopted catalysts (that is, iridium oxide), the Fe3O4@MHC caalyst displays outstanding oxygen evolution reaction activity. For whole water splitting, it requires a solar voltage of 1.74 V to drive 30 mA, along with remarkable long-term stability in the presence (12 h) and absence (58 h) of outdoor-sunlight exposure, as a promising strategy towards a sustainable energy development.Cleaner hydrogen production can help energy sustainability. The use of yeast biomass-derived materials to develop efficient, eco-friendly and economical catalysts-compared with industrially adopted catalysts-is shown to improve hydrogen production as a strategy towards a sustainable energy system.									99	2	0	0	6	0	98			2398-9629			WOS:000523952400001

Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a theoretical study of the OER electrocatalyst was conducted with three types of IrO2 bulk-like surface structures: nanowires, nanospheres and nanotubes. The electron transfer and distribution between adjacent Ir and O atoms were evaluated using Mulliken charge analysis. IrO2 nanowires have strong chemical bond strength with a large average bond population of 0.375 and electron transfer of -0.56/1.109e. Compared with nanospheres, the overpotential of nanowires (0.387 V) is only 63.4% of that of rutile IrO2 bulk. IrO2 nanotubes presented the largest specific-surface area, and its active atom utilization rate was 2-3 times that of nanospheres. By modifying the electronic structure and oxygen adsorption strength of catalysts, the one-dimensional bulk-like structure can effectively enhance the electrochemical stability and catalytic activity. IrO2 nanowires showed the best overall performance due to their stable bond structure and outstanding catalytic activity. Although nanotubes with hollow structures exhibited higher potential, the stability was relativity poor due to the low bond population (0.354). This research theoretically analyzes catalytic and electronic performance of IrO2 catalysts from unit cells to bulk-like surface structures and provides guidance for electrocatalyst development.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000647733600003		
J	Wang, Haibin; Zhang, Xiaoshuang								Ni-Co LDH/M-Mo-S (M = Zn, Co and Ni) nanoarrays as efficient water oxidation electrocatalytic materials								CRYSTENGCOMM				23	15			2862	2868		10.1039/d1ce00247c		MAR 2021		APR 21 2021	2021	It is possible to research the influencing factors of the electrocatalytic water splitting activity by controlling the composition and morphology of the materials. In this study, an efficient morphology control of Ni-Co layered double hydroxide/M-Mo-S (M = Zn, Co and Ni) hybrid materials was investigated by introducing different metal ions into M-Mo-S. An adjustable morphology was successfully achieved by taking the advantage of the growth mechanism of the Kirkendall growth and Ostwald ripening. The Ni-Co LDH/Ni-Mo-S catalyst displayed an extraordinary oxygen evolution reaction performance (overpotential of 290 mV at 40 mA cm(-2)) and a superior durability (retention rate of 90%) at 10 mA cm(-2) after 14 h compared to Ni-Co LDH/M-Mo-S (M = Zn, Co and Ni) hybrid materials. A series of characterization analyses demonstrate that the efficient electrochemistry performance of the material is assigned to the improved electrical conductivity, greater exposure to active sites and faster oxygen outflow rate. The density functional theory calculation results suggest that the in situ generated Mo-doped NiOOH has the optimal adsorption energy of water compared to NiOOH, which is probably the main active center in the water oxidation reaction. Our study presents a new way of thinking for the development of high efficiency heterojunction catalysts and guidance for the further realization of the industrialization of electrolytic water.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1466-8033		WOS:000635215100001

The morphology of the alpha-MnO2/RuO2 nanostructures changed from sharp sea urchins to solid nanospheres with increasing RuO2 content in the composition. The variations observed in physical, structural, morphological and electrochemical properties were characterized with respect to the MnO2/RuO2 concentrations by step by step analyses. MnO2 exhibited better ORR catalytic activity, while RuO2 revealed superior OER catalytic activity. Among the concentrations investigated, alpha-MnO2:RuO2 (75:25) exhibited superior catalytic activity for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in aqueous media. This excellent catalytic activity logically led us to apply it as air-cathode catalyst in Li-O-2 cell, which produced a maximum capacity of >8100 mAhg (1) with high columbic efficiency and cyclability. The superior performance of the hybrid nanostructure is mainly attributed to its structural and compositional design which favors the electrochemical activity. Based on a careful investigation on the structural characterizations, the growth mechanism of the 3D nanostructured alpha-MnO2/RuO2 mixed oxides is discussed in detail.

J	Hao Wang; Wenhua Chen; Madey, T.E.								Morphological evolution in oxygen-induced faceting of Re(1231)								Physical Review B (Condensed Matter and Materials Physics)				74	20			205426	1-11		10.1103/PhysRevB.74.205426				15 Nov. 2006	2006	We have studied oxygen-induced faceting of the atomically rough Re(1231) surface by means of Auger electron spectroscopy, low energy electron diffraction, and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In contrast to previous faceting studies on other refractory metal surfaces, where simple morphologies of the facets were reported, we find a coverage-dependent morphological evolution of the facets ranging from long sawtooth ridges to complex structures exposing four different facets. The faceting occurs only when oxygen coverage (theta) exceeds 0.5 monolayer (ML) and the surface is annealed at ges700 K. At low oxygen coverage (0.5 MLlestheta<0.7 ML), the O/Re(1231) surface becomes partially faceted upon annealing; further increasing of oxygen coverage (0.7 MLlestheta<0.9 ML) causes the surface to become completely faceted, forming long sawtooth ridges along the [2113] direction with typical dimensions of ~8 nm in width and >50 nm in length upon annealing at 1000 K. The size of the ridges grows with annealing temperature and annealing time, and the distance between the ridges is quite uniform. The two sides of each ridge have (0110) and (1121) orientations, and atomic-resolution STM images reveal that the edge of the ridge is atomically sharp. For 0.9 MLlestheta<1 ML, a third set of facets, identified as (1010), emerges and truncates the original ridges. With the surface fully covered by oxygen (theta=1 ML), a fourth facet (0111) also becomes prominent upon annealing. This morphological evolution is accompanied by a reduction of the average ridge length along [2113], indicating that the (1121) facet is metastable. Our work demonstrates that even in a simple adsorbate/substrate system, the adsorbate-induced modification of the anisotropy of surface free energy can induce a complex sequence of changes in the surface morphology. The faceted Re surfaces may be model systems to study structure sensitivity in catalytic reactions, and may also provide promising templates to grow nanostructures.									0	0	0		0	0	0			1098-0121			INSPEC:9372389

Their interesting catalytic activity, low cost, and diversity are considered major advantages. In this work, a facile dual-doping strategy has been conducted and yielded an astonishing upgrade of lanthanum cobaltite; fine-tuning of both A and B sites with calcium and manganese has proven remarkably beneficial. The dual-doping modulates the electronic configuration of both transition metals and raises the oxygen vacancies. Consequently, oxygen evolution reaction has been assessed and La0.8Ca0.2Mn0.2Co0.8O3 showed significantly improved overpotential and maximal current density in comparison with pristine LaCoO3. Furthermore, the ZAB exhibited a high open circuit potential and superior charge-discharge cyclability, compared to Pt/C-based electrodes. The current work explores the influence of simultaneous doping of the A and B sites in lanthanum perovskite oxides on electrocatalytic performance to encourage further exploration of such an approach in electrocatalysis. Novelty statement Simultaneous Ca and Mn dual-doping of LaCoO3 in the A and B sites were successfully applied. The effects on the crystal structure, oxidation states, and electrocatalytic activity were studied. LCMC8228-based ZAB has achieved a large discharge capacity of 88.1 mAh in comparison to the benchmark.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000850301700001

NiMoN nanowires with the (100) facet preferentially exposed were prepared by an insitu N/O exchange and the morphology tuned by using a rationally designed NiMoO4 precursor. The facet-tuned NiMoN nanowires exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under both alkaline and acidic conditions that was comparable to that of noble metal platinum. DFT calculations further revealed that the catalytic activity of NiMoN nanowires towards HER on the (100) reactive facet is significantly greater than that on the (001) or (101) facets, owing to the low adsorption free energy of H* (G(H*)) on the (100) facet. The NiMoN nanowires also demonstrated outstanding activity towards the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction and an excellent durable activity for overall water splitting, with a cell potential as low as 1.498V at 20mAcm(-2). This work provides insights into improving electrocatalytic activity and developing advanced non-noble metal bifunctional electrocatalysts.									63	1	0	0	6	0	63			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000445178400020	30010250

N defective graphite carbon nitride (N-CN) reveals distinctive physicochemical characteristics relative to CN. The mass activity and specific activity of IrO2/N-CN are 7.86 times and 1.75 times relative to IrO2, respectively. Polarization curves exhibit the optimal OER activity of 1.778 V for IrO2/N-CN at 1.6 A cm(-2), which is substantially smaller than that of IrO2/CN (1.824 V) and IrO2 (1.846 V). Meantime, IrO2/N-CN maintains good stability during the 300 h stability test at the current density of 1.6 A cm(-2). DFT calculations and experimental results reveal that outstanding OER activity and sufficient stability are contributions to the increment of active site accessibility and the moderate adsorption of oxygen intermediates.

Herein, Co/CoNx decorated N-doped porous carbon hybrids with two different morphologies were prepared using commercially available melamine sponge as the precursor. Direct two steps of pyrolysis produced N-doped porous carbon covered with Co/CoNx decorated CNTs (Co@CNT/MSC) with highly dispersed Co2N moiety, while the chemical activation of KOH and the followed high-temperature pyrolysis obtained N,Co co-doped hierarchically porous carbon (Co/HMSC) with CoN, Co2N and CoC8 moieties. Co/HMSC exhibits more excellent bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalytic activity with an ORR onset potential of 0.95 V, an ORR half-wave potential of 0.84 V, an OER overpotential of 396 mV and an ultralow potential gap of 0.78 V, superior to most previous reports. The assembled Co/HMSC-based Zn-air battery shows excellent rechargeability with a small 0.2 V drop in its continuous charge-discharge cycles for 51.6 hat 10 mA cm(-2). The superiority of Co/HMSC is ascribed to the high specific surface area, the affluent active sites and the synergistic effect between the CoNx/CoCx active moieties and the nitrogen-doped carbon support.									29	1	0	0	1	0	29			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000523641800045

The bottleneck blocking the large-scale application of RZABs is the high cost and vulnerability of noble metal (Pt, IrO2, and RuO2) electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER). In this work, using the fruits of glossy privet as raw material, graphenelike and defect-rich carbon sheets with N doping (GPNCS) are produced as a highly active electrocatalyst for RZABs via a nontoxic, scalable, and sustainable biomass strategy. The graphenelike and porous structure of GPNCS enables the material to possess high conductivity and specific surface area, which are beneficial for its good performance as an electrocatalyst. The synergistic effect between N-doping atoms and topological defects endows the GPNCS with remarkable ORR activity and moderate OER performance. The RZABs verify the excellent catalytic performance of GPNCS, with a low charge-discharge voltage gap that remains nearly unchanged after 1340 cycles (about 500 h) at 10 mA.cm(-2). This research opens up a new avenue for the cost-effective and large-scale production of highly efficient ORR/OER electrocatalysts for the development of next-generation energy storage and conversion systems.									32	2	0	0	1	0	32			2168-0485			WOS:000516665500043

The oxide ionic and electronic mixed conductor CaTi0.75Fe0.25O3-alpha was used as a selective oxygen permeable diaphragm. The selective electrochemical permeation of oxygen across a ceramic sample was confirmed by measuring oxygen evolution rate at the low Po-2 side of the oxygen gas concentration cell using sample ceramics as a diaphragm. The gasification of carbon black to CO using this diaphragm was examined. It was observed that CO and CO2 were formed without nitrogen when the opposite side of diaphragm was exposed to air at high temperature. The dependence of the CO/CO2 ratio on the partial pressure of oxygen in the high Po-2 compartment and on the thickness of diaphragm was examined.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0021-891X			WOS:000076048000003

Therefore, exploring a highly efficient and stable hydrogen evolution and urea electrooxidation bifunctional catalyst is the key to achieve economical and efficient hydrogen production. In this paper, we report a heterostructured sulfide/phosphide catalyst (Ni3S2-Ni3P/NF) synthesized via one-step thermal treatment of Ni(OH)(2)/NF, which allows the simultaneous occurrence of phosphorization and sulfuration. The obtained Ni3S2-Ni3P/NF catalyst shows a sheet structure with an average sheet thickness of similar to 100 nm, and this sheet is composed of interconnected Ni3S2 and Ni3P nanoparticles (similar to 20 nm), between which there are a large number of accessible interfaces of Ni3S2-Ni3P. Thus, the Ni3S2-Ni3P/NF exhibits superior performance for both UOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For the overall urea-water electrolysis, to achieve current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), cell voltage of only 1.43 and 1.65 V is required using this catalyst as both the anode and the cathode. Moreover, this catalyst also maintains fairly excellent stability after a long-term testing, indicating its potential for efficient and energy-saving hydrogen production. The theoretical calculation results show that the Ni atoms at the interface are the most efficient catalytically active site for the HER, and the free energy of hydrogen adsorption is closest to thermal neutrality, which is only 0.16 eV. A self-driven electron transfer at the interface, making the Ni3S2 sides become electron donating while Ni3P sides become electron withdrawing, may be the reason for the enhancement of the UOR activity. Therefore, this work shows an easy treatment for enhancing the catalytic activity of Ni-based materials to achieve high-efficiency urea-water electrolysis.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000664289800027	34078074

At optimum conditions (1 mM Mn2+/10 mu M 2,6-dichlorphenolindophenol (DCIP)/20 mM Ca2+), the light-induced increase of oxygen-evolution activity, the increase of membrane-bound Mn, and the B-band thermoluminescence emission intensity occurred in parallel. The extent of recovery of the oxygen-evolution activity was equivalent to 88% and 66% of the activity shown by parent NaCl-extracted PSII membranes and by PSII membranes, respectively. Neither photodamage of primary electron transport nor photoligation of nonfunctional Mn-greater than or equal to 3+ occurred. Analyses of the Ca2+ concentration dependence for the maximum recovery of oxygen evolution activity gave evidence for Ca2+-binding site(s) having K-m values of similar to 38 and similar to 1300 mu M. Illumination of membranes in the strict absence of Ca2+ resulted in large increases (up to 18 Mn/200 chlorophyll) of EDTA nonextractable, EPR silent, nonfunctional membrane-bound Mn-greater than or equal to 3+ and small increases of oxygen-evolution capability, dependent on pH and concentrations of Mn2+ and DCIP. No photodamage of primary electron transport and only similar to 17% decrease of A(T)-band thermoluminescence occurred during the photoligation of the Mn-greater than or equal to 3+. In the strict absence of Ca2+, significant recovery of oxygen-evolution activity was obtained under a limited set of conditions permitting photoligation of a limited abundance of the nonfunctional Mn-greater than or equal to 3+. Small (NH2OH, H2O2) as well as bulky external reductants readily reduced and dissociated the Mn-greater than or equal to 3+ from the membranes, Reillumination of these membranes under optimal conditions for photoactivation (plus Ca2+) gave a high yield of (Mn)(4)-clusters and oxygen-evolution capability. Similarly, simple addition of Ca2+ to membranes containing nonfunctional Mn-greater than or equal to 3+ followed by reillumination resulted in the conversion of Mn-greater than or equal to 3+ to (Mn)(4)-clusters. It is argued that Ca2+ promotes the conformational change involved in the conversion of the Mn2+ mononuclear intermediate to the Mn3+-Mn2+ binuclear intermediate in the photoactivation mechanism, thereby permitting photoassembly of (Mn)(4)-clusters and preventing photoinactivation by Mn-greater than or equal to 3+ ions.									90	2	0	0	69	0	91			0006-2960			WOS:A1995TB58400031	7577940

The outermost layer is mostly NiFe2O4, the middle layer mainly consists of NiO, and the innermost is a Curich metal layer. The dense NiFe2O4 layer is resistant to molten salts and prevents O2- diffusing inwards, the middle NiO layer conducts electrons and functions as a buffer layer to increase the mechanical robustness of the whole scale, and the third copper-rich layer could help to slow down the oxidation rate of the alloy. This low-cost inert anode with a multi-layered scale is able to survive for more than 600 h in molten Na2CO3-K2CO3 electrolysis cell, generating O-2 and thereby enabling a carbon-free electro-metallurgical process.

Here, taking cobalt carbonate hydroxides (CCHs) as the initial crystalline material, we choose the Lewis acid metal salt of Fe(NO3)(3) to induce an aqueous-phase chain reaction generating free CO32- ions with subsequent instant FeCO3 hydrolysis. The resultant ultrathin (similar to 5 nm) amorphous Fe-based hydroxide layer on CCH results in considerable activity in catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yielding 10/50 mA.cm(-2) at overpotentials of 230/266.5 mV for OER and 72.5/197.5 mV for HER. The catalysts can operate constantly in 1.0 M KOH over 48 and 45 h for the OER and HER, respectively. For bifunctional catalysis for alkaline electrolyzer assembly, a cell voltage as low as 1.53 V was necessary to yield 10 mA cm(-2) (1.7 V at 50 mA cm(-2)). This work rationally builds high-efficiency electrochemical bifunctional water-splitting catalysts and offers a trial in establishing a controllable nanolevel ultrathin lattice disorder layer through an atmospheric-temperature chemical route.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000829765200001	35722766

However, the application of Li-excess oxides suffers from significant problems, such as irreversible lattice oxygen loss and structural distortion. A Li/Na-ion exchange strategy can be regarded as an effective way to address these obstacles by tuning oxygen stacking arrangements and the coordination environment of alkali metal within emerging structures. Herein, the state-of-the-art progress made within conventional and Li-excess layered cathodes generated by ion exchange strategy at first is reviewed. Moreover, the mechanisms of oxygen redox, the migrations of Li/transition metals, and structural evolutions within Li-excess oxides have been further clarified by advanced characterizations, which play an important role in understanding lattice oxygen release, irreversible transition metal migration, phase transition, and the root of capacity/voltage decay. In addition, the theory calculations based on density of states, oxygen release energy, and migration energy barriers of Li/transition metals are systematically summarized, providing an essential guidance to harvest stable oxygen-related redox reactions within Li-excess materials. Altogether, this review offers fundamental understanding and future perspectives toward the rational design of high-energy-density Li-excess oxides with reversible anionic/cationic redox chemistry.									19	2	0	0	0	0	19			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000641909200001		
J	Gao, Junyu; Ma, Hongqin; Zhang, Longfei; Luo, Xinyue; Yu, Luqi								Interface engineering of Ni3Se2@FeOOH heterostructure nanoforests for highly-efficient overall water splitting								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				893						162244	10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.162244		OCT 2021		FEB 10 2022	2022	Rational construction of interface engineering is a highly effective strategy for modifying the surface properties and enhancing the intrinsic activity of a catalyst. Herein, the three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical Ni3Se2@FeOOH heterostructure nanoforests with rich heterointerfaces were integrated into nickel foam (Ni3Se2@FeOOH/NF) for electrochemical overall water splitting. Coupling FeOOH with Ni3Se2 can favor the formation of oxygen-containing intermediate (*OOH) and facilitate the dissociation of H2O and adsorption of hydrogen (*H), thus dramatically boosting the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) simultaneously. Furthermore, the self-supported electrode with Ni3Se2@FeOOH heterostructure nanoforests in-situ grown on NF can reduce the indirect contact resistance between the electrocatalyst and substrate, provide abundant electroactive sites, and promote the release of the generated bubbles from electrode timely. Consequently, the Ni3Se2@FeOOH/NF displays outstanding electrocatalytic activity with low overpotentials of 224 mV and 87 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively. When used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in a 1 M KOH electrolyzer, the Ni3Se2@FeOOH/NF exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.54 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2) and retains long-term durability over 20 h. This work demonstrates the significance of the heterostructure for improving the catalytic performance of non noble composite electrocatalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The structure of the as-prepared NiFe-MOF/NF was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), FT-IR and Raman. Compared with the monometallic Ni-MOF material, the incorporation of Fe greatly changes the inherent properties of Ni-MOF. Electrochemical measurement results show the optimized NiFe-MOF/NF [Ni : Fe=3 : 7 (molar ratio)] has better electrocatalytic performance and the current densities of 50 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2) have low overpotentials of 225 mV and 251 mV, respectively, for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution. In particular, the inverse curve of linear sweep voltammetry shows an ultralow overpotential of only 160 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2). NiFe-MOF/NF also has excellent stability and can run continuously for at least 50 h. NiFe-MOF/NF has remarkable OER performance, which is mainly due to the high conductivity, the large specific surface area and the synergistic effects of Fe and Ni in MOFs. The work presents a general strategy for the synthesis of electrocatalytic materials for effective and scalable electrocatalytic water oxidation.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			2365-6549			WOS:000616638000021

MnOx films were prepared by means of two deposition conditions: one using a forming gas (95% N-2, 5% H-2) plasma (FG-MnOx) and one using an O-2 plasma (O-2-MnOx). A composite electrode of FG-MnOx + CoOx was also examined. The conformal nature of ALD films allowed for MnOx to be deposited within the porosity of the GDL, as confirmed by X-ray microanalysis. Full cell ZAB tests showed excellent performance for MnOx-coated electrodes, outperforming Pt/Ru-C at current densities larger than 100 mA cm(-2). Annealed FG-MnOx and O-2-MnOx electrodes had maximum power densities of 170 and 184 mW cm(-2), respectively. With the catalyst distributed within the structure of the GDL, performance limitations associated with electrolyte flooding and air diffusion are reduced, improving discharge potential and cycling behavior. FG-MnOx + CoOx electrodes showed good cycling stability, both in a trielectrode configuration and bifunctionally. When cycled at 20 mA cm(-2) for 100 h (200 cycles), FG-MnOx + CoOx had initial and final discharge potentials of 1.18 and 1.15 V, respectively.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11			2574-0962			WOS:000510104700068

In this paper, a catalyst composed of Co9S8 and porous carbon (Co9S8-C) is prepared first via the calcination of Co-S-C based precursor coating on carbon-fibre-paper (CFP) substrate under argon atmosphere. Then, the Co9S8-C is modified via the decomposition gas of dicyandiamide, thus Co9S8-N-doped carbon (Co9S8-NC) catalyst is synthesized. As revealed, the morphology and defect features are effectively modulated by the modification, suggesting the reduced particle sizes of Co9S8- component and obviously improved N proportion and various defects. As a result, Co9S8-NC represents excellent activities electrocatalytic performances toward OER and ORR, which surpass those of its three counterparts including Co9S8-C, Co9S8, and NC. A half-wave potential of 0.86 V versus RHE for ORR and a low overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm(-2 )current density for OER are achieved, with the LE value of 0.64 V. Additionally, the catalyst also demonstrates desirable application prospect for Zn-air battery. The post-treatment method reported here might be utilized widespread to promote the synergistic effects between the Co-contained particles and N-doped carbons in composite catalysts.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000521107900006

Application to antipyrine degradation								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				380						122410	10.1016/j.cej.2019.122410				JAN 15 2020	2020	TiO2-based photocatalysis is intensively investigated for efficient degradation of emerging environmental contaminants, but the generation of reactive oxygen species during such photocatalytic reactions is often under-researched. In this paper, we study the formation of reactive oxygen species under real solar irradiation on TiO2 P25 loaded with reduced graphene oxide (rGO). TiO2/rGO composites were prepared by mixing graphene oxide and TiO2 P25, followed by hydrothermal treatment. The band gap of TiO2 was not affected in the composites but the optical properties of the systems changed due to the morphology and presence of rGO. When these composites were studied under solar irradiation, the generation rate of hydroxyl HO center dot radicals under solar light was higher in pure TiO2 than in TiO2/rGO, but also their decay with time, so TiO2/rGO eventually presented higher HO center dot concentration at longer times. Moreover, adding rGO to TiO2 also affected the concentration of superoxide O-2(center dot-) and singlet oxygen O-1(2) radicals, which we assign to the charge transfer between TiO2 and rGO and the presence of remaining holes on the surface. The amount of generated hydrogen peroxide H(2)O(2 )and consumed in these systems was practically the same, so its concentration remained low. The catalytic systems developed were tested in the solar photocatalytic degradation of antipyrine, demonstrating the relationship between the evolution of generated reactive oxygen species along the reaction time and the consumption of antipyrine. The TiO2 valence band holes were also found to be the responsible primary species along the course of reaction especially in the final mineralization step.									31	1	0	0	11	0	32			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000494815600017

Their bifunctional activities for electrochemical energy storage and electro-catalysis for water splitting in strong alkaline media are optimized by varying the ratio of concentrations of the Ni and Co precursors. The ratio-based changes vary the pore size of the NCO nanosheets between 92.5 and 200 nm, and structural analyses reveal that the electrode films have a spinel NiCo2O4 structure. The obtained specific capacitance varies dramatically between 613 and 2704 Fg(-1) at 2mA cm(-2), with good capacity retention (80-90%) after 2000 cycles. The NCO nanosheet electrodes also exhibit a good oxygen evolution reaction at the surface. The lowest overpotential (315 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) is obtained with a Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(-1). The observed bifunctional activities of the new NCO nanosheet electrode are superior to those of nanostructured NCO electrodes prepared via hydrothermal and SILAR methods. The analyses regarding the electrochemically active surface area and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, together with the observed electrochemical performance, reveal that the most-optimized Ni and Co composition produces the synergetic effects of an electrochemically active surface area and great stability.

However, the synthetic routes are mostly depending on the top-down exfoliation with unavoidable structural fragmentation and the annoying sheets' re-stacking. Here, an electrocatalytic poly (triazine imide) ligand is firstly synthesized and successfully applied to construct the 2D Ni/Fe coordination polymers nanosheets (Ni/Fe-CPNs) through a bottom-up strategy. Average thickness of the nanosheets is around 5 nm, enabling the highly exposed reactive centers. Further benefiting from the ligand promotion effect, absorption of the oxygen species during the OER is effectively accelerated, thus improving the reaction kinetics. Accordingly, the Ni/Fe-CPNs reveals an adorable overpotential of 244 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel value of 65.8 mv dec(-1). Both values are much better than that of commercial RuO2, and competitive to most of the reported catalysts. The ex-situ techniques, including Raman, FT-IR and XPS analysis alongside with applied potential, are also applied to elaborate the catalytic mechanism. This work offers a new point of view to improve the catalysts' activity. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000718161600007

The direct electrohydrogenation of toluene with water decomposition using electric power is a highly efficient energy conversion process for the MCH synthesis. In this process, an IrO2-based directionally stable electrodeA (R) (DSEA (R)) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is used as the anode because of its good electrocatalytic activity and durability. However, further improvement in the activity is needed for practical applications. In this study, the effect of Zr addition substituted for Ta in IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti, which is a typical OER anode, on the electrocatalytic activity has been investigated in sulfuric acid with TL contamination. The activity of both the IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti and the IrO2-Ta2O5-ZrO2/Ti was higher and less affected by TL contamination than the IrO2/Ti. The activity of the IrO2-Ta2O5-ZrO2/Ti increased with the Zr content. The Zr addition increased the real surface area along with the increase in the double layer capacitance; on the other hand, the increase in activity was more than that of the surface area. Therefore, the Zr additive would affect not only the real surface area increase, but also the electrocatalytic activity.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000386490500001

The present work investigated the effect of ultrasonic treatment on the structure of magnetite by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) technology and Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) mapping technologies, and the results were correlated to the activity of magnetite oxygen carrier for selective oxidation of methane and water splitting. The evolutions of phases and compositions of magnetite during the reaction with methane were also studied to discuss the reaction mechanism. The results showed that ultrasonic treatment significantly improves the activity of magnetite oxygen carrier for methane selective oxidation by destroying the dense structure of magnetite and promoting the interdiffusion of different elements (e.g., Fe, Al and Mg) that could enhance the interaction between the active species (Fe oxides) and inert spaces (Al and Mg oxides). The syngas production increased from 10.29 to 13.15 mmol/g and hydrogen production increased from 4.93 to 5.43 mmol/g after the ultrasonic treatment, and both the produced hydrogen and syngas show high purity (ca. 96.5% for syngas and ca. 98.9% for H-2). During the reaction between methane and magnetite, the reduction of iron oxides firstly occurred in the boundary between the iron oxides and the inert components (e.g., Al/Mg oxides), which then diffused to the adjacent areas and created numbers of smaller Fe islands. The channels around the Fe islands provide pathways for methane diffusion, improving the further reduction of oxygen carrier.									22	3	0	0	3	0	23			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000515117500093

Anisotropic Janus monolayers display excellent potential for water splitting owing to their high photocatalytic activity, while their scarcity proves to be a disadvantage for wide application. Herein, we propose an anisotropic auxetic Janus 2D photocatalyst, a structurally stable epsilon-SnO monolayer, using first-principles calculations. Monolayer epsilon-SnO exhibits extraordinary flexibility due to its ultralow Young's moduli and high critical crack strain. Particularly, the large negative in-plane Poisson's ratios are predicted to be -0.14/-0.17 along the x-/y-direction, which are larger than most previously reported 2D materials. It has a wide indirect bandgap, straddling the redox potentials of water, which varies with the in-plane strain. Radiation-induced carriers can drive the simultaneous occurrence of both hydrogen (HER) and oxygen (OER) evolution half reactions, even when they are under strain. The anisotropic carrier mobility can reach 625.86 cm(2).V-1.s(-1) and the absorption coefficients are predicted to reach up to the order of 10(5) cm(-1), which is favorable for the photoexcited carrier to migrate to the active sites for water splitting. Interestingly, after transition metal atoms (from Sc to Zn) decoration, Mn/epsilon-SnO and Cr/epsilon-SnO as high-efficient single-atom HER photocatalysts are capable of driving HER with ultralow overpotentials of -0.002 V and -0.033 V, respectively, outperforming commercial Pt (-0.09 V). Meanwhile, the Cu/epsilon-SnO with a low-overpotential (0.385 V) is significantly better for neutral OER than IrO2 (0.55 V) that is widely accepted in industrial applications.

A hierarchical approach was successfully employed through a simple "self-settlement" process with descending amounts of carbon to carbon-free electro-catalysts to improve catalyst utilization and avoid carbon degradation during fuel cell operating conditions. Pd85Pt15 NPoS exhibits enhanced methanol resistive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity owing to the presence of highly active and unique surface PdPt islands compared to HiSPEC Pt/C catalysts. Accelerated durability tests of the support-free PdPt NPoS show enhanced durability in harsh acidic environment (1.0 N H2SO4) compared to HiSPEC Pt/C and DOE 2017-2020 durability target. Preliminary direct methanol fuel cell studies using hierarchically derived Pd85Pt15 NPoS variants were performed at ultra-low Pt content. The effects of carbon content and catalyst layer thickness on fuel cell activities are well discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we report a quadruple perovskite oxide CaCu3Ru4O12 as a superior catalyst for acidic water oxidation. This complex oxide exhibits an ultrasmall overpotential of 171 mV at 10 mA cm(geo)(-2), which is much lower than that of the state-of-the-art RuO2. Moreover, compared to RuO2, CaCu3Ru4O12 shows a significant increase in mass activity by more than two orders of magnitude and much better stability. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the quadruple perovskite catalyst has a lower Ru 4d-band center relative to RuO2, which effectively optimizes the binding energy of oxygen intermediates and thereby enhances the catalytic activity.									82	5	0	0	5	0	82			2041-1723			WOS:000482398900011	31444337

After confirming the preparation of CoW12/ clicked g-C3N4 with various physicochemical methods, its photoelectrocatalytic activity is evaluated in the oxygen evolution reaction. The CoW12/clicked g-C3N4 exhibits a low onset potential of 1.32 V versus NHE and a low overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA cm-2 with a low Tafel slope of 67 mV dec-1 under visible light illumination.

Because these iron-oxygen intermediates are short-lived due to their thermal instability and high reactivity, it is challenging to investigate their structural and spectroscopic properties and reactivity in the catalytic cycles of the enzymatic reactions themselves. One way to approach such problems is to synthesize biomimetic iron-oxygen complexes and to tune their geometric and electronic structures for structural characterization and reactivity studies. Indeed, a number of biologically important iron-oxygen species, such as mononuclear nonheme iron (III) -superoxo, iron (III) -peroxo, iron (III) -hydroperoxo, iron (IV)-oxo, and iron(V)-oxo complexes, were synthesized recently, and the first X-ray crystal structures of iron(III)-superoxo, iron(III)-peroxo, and iron(IV)-oxo complexes in nonheme iron models were successfully obtained. Thus, our understanding of iron-oxygen intermediates in biological reactions has been aided greatly from the studies of the structural and spectroscopic properties and the reactivities of the synthetic biomimetic analogues.In this Account, we describe our recent results on the synthesis and characterization of mononuclear nonheme iron-oxygen complexes bearing simple macrocyclic ligands, such as N-tetramethylated cyclam ligand (TMC) and tetraamido macrocyclic ligand (TAML). In the case of iron-superoxo complexes, an iron(III)-superoxo complex, [(TAML)Fe-III(O-2)](2-), is described, including its crystal structure and reactivities in electrophilic and nudeophilic oxidative reactions, and its properties are compared with those of a chromium(III)-superoxo complex, [(TMC)Cr-III(O-2)(Cl)](+), with respect to its reactivities in hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and oxygen atom transfer (OAT) reactions. In the case of iron-peroxo intermediates, an X-ray crystal structure of an iron(III)-peroxo complex binding the peroxo ligand in a side-on (eta(2)) fashion, [(TMC)Fe-III(O-2)](+), is described. In addition, iron(III) -peroxo complexes binding redox-inactive metal ions are described and discussed in light of the role of redox-inactive metal ions in O-O bond activation in cytochrome c oxidase and O-2-evolution in photosystem II. In the case of iron-hydroperoxo intermediates, mononuclear nonheme iron(III)-hydroperoxo complexes can be generated upon protonation of iron(III)-peroxo complexes or by hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) of hydrocarbon C-H bonds by iron(III)-superoxo complexes. Reactivities of the iron(III)-hydroperoxo complexes in both electrophilic and nucleophilic oxidative reactions are described along with a discussion of O-O bond cleavage mechanisms. In the last section of this Account, a brief summary is presented of developments in mononuclear nonheme iron(IV)-oxo complexes since the first structurally characterized iron(IV)-oxo complex, [(TMC)Fe-IV(O)](2+), was reported. Although the field of nonheme iron-oxygen intermediates (e.g., Fe-O-2, Fe-O2H, and Fe-O) has been developed greatly through intense synthetic, structural, spectroscopic, reactivity, and theoretical studies in the communities of bioinorganic and biomimetic chemistry over the past 10 years, there is still much to be explored in trapping, characterizing, and understanding the chemical properties of the key iron-oxygen intermediates involved in dioxygen activation and oxidation reactions by nonheme iron enzymes and their biomimetic compounds.									207	1	0	0	33	0	207			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000359892700026	26203519

Currently, both conditions are hardly fulfilled mainly due to the same reason: the oxygen electrode, which has large overpotentials and is made of precious materials. A possible solution is the use of non-noble electrocatalysts with single-metal active sites. Here, on the basis of DFT calculations of adsorbed intermediates and a thermodynamic analysis, we compare the oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution (OER) activities of functionalized graphitic materials and gas-phase porphyrins with late transition metals. We find that both kinds of materials follow approximately the same activity trends, and active sites with transition metals from groups 7 to 9 may be good ORR and OER electrocatalysts. However, spin analyses show more flexibility in the possible oxidation states of the metal atoms in solid electrocatalysts, while in porphyrins they must be +2. These observations reveal that the catalytic activity of these materials is mainly due to nearest-neighbor interactions. Based on this, we propose that this class of electrocatalysts may be improved by careful selections of the support and the ligand properties close to the active sites and/or the ramifications near them, so that charge is transferred back and forth during adsorption and selective hydrogen bonds are formed.

However, due to the sluggish reaction kinetics of oxygen conversion, practical applications cannot achieve the desired results. By introducing vacancies in the MoS2 basal plane and using an in-situ synthesis method, we demonstrated the excellent catalysis of MoS2-x for oxygen redox kinetics, which can improve Li-O-2 battery performance. The prepared MoS2-x displays little polarization, with a potential gap of 0.59 V and a high discharge capacity of 8,851 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 500 mA g(-1). The improved performance is mainly attributable to abundant S defects and plentiful diffusion channels in the MoS2-x/carbon 3D structural cathodes, which enable the adsorption of gaseous oxygen, reaction intermediates, and discharge products. To the best of our knowledge, these structures fabricated through 3D network design and surface modulation are among the best oxygen conversion catalysts developed so far, offering a new vista for the design of Li-O-2 catalysts and beyond.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2296-598X			WOS:000549104200001

Structural analysis confirmed that smooth 100 nm films can be grown from a Ca2MnO4 sol-gel solution showing a high orientation in (1 0 0) direction when deposited on F:SnO2/quartz and quartz substrates. The distance found by X-ray diffraction between the layers exactly fitted the monoclinic layer compound of composition Ca2Mn3O8. To compare the electrochemical behavior of this layer with the bulk Ca2Mn3O8 powder, a 6 mu m thick film was prepared by screen-printing. Differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy performed in 0.1 M KH2PO4 at pH 7 and 1 M Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane at pH 7.8 revealed that both films were able to oxidize water as well as organic matter with a good correlation to the slope of the current density curves; however, the dip-coated films displayed lower current densities than the screen-printed Ca2Mn3O8 layers. A closer look into the cyclic voltammetry revealed that capacity values were similar indicating that not only the different surface areas played a role, but variations in the specific capacity values possibly due to the orientation of the films or the manganese mixed valence in the surface as determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) could be responsible for these effects.

We report that a range of organic semiconductors are capable of efficient photocatalytic oxygen reduction to H2O2 in aqueous conditions. These semiconductors, in the form of thin films, support a 2-electron/2-proton redox cycle involving photoreduction of dissolved O-2 to H2O2, with the concurrent photooxidation of organic substrates: formate, oxalate, and phenol. Photochemical oxygen reduction is observed in a pH range from 2 to 12. In cases where valence band energy of the semiconductor is energetically high, autoxidation competes with oxidation of the donors, and thus turnover numbers are low. Materials with deeper valence band energies afford higher stability and also oxidation of H2O to O-2. We found increased H2O2 evolution rate for surfactant-stabilized nanoparticles versus planar thin films. These results evidence that photochemical O-2 reduction may be a widespread feature of organic semiconductors, and open potential avenues for organic semiconductors for catalytic applications.									21	0	0	0	3	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000431150900001	29624365

A series of cobalt iron oxide spinel nanowires are prepared via the nanocasting route using ordered mesoporous silica as a hard template. The replicated oxides are selectively reduced through a mild reduction that results in phase transformation as well as the formation of grain boundaries. The detailed structural analyses, including the Fe-57 isotope-enriched Mossbauer study, validated the formation of iron oxide clusters supported by ordered mesoporous CoO nanowires after the reduction process. This affects the OER activity significantly, whereby the overpotential at 10 mA/cm(2) decreases from 378 to 339 mV and the current density at 1.7 V vs RHE increases by twofold from 150 to 315 mA/cm(2). In situ Raman microscopy revealed that the surfaces of reduced CoO were oxidized to cobalt with a higher oxidation state upon solvation in the KOH electrolyte. The implementation of external potential bias led to the formation of an oxyhydroxide intermediate and a disordered-spinel phase. The interactions of iron clusters with cobalt oxide at the phase boundaries were found to be beneficial to enhance the charge transfer of the cobalt oxide and boost the overall OER activity by reaching a Faradaic efficiency of up to 96%. All in all, the post-reduction and phase segregation of cobalt iron oxide play an important role as a precatalyst for the OER.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6				2691-3704		WOS:000788756500016	35373196

Herein, semiconductive spinel CuFe2O4 supported Co-N co-doped carbon (Co-NC) and CoFe alloy nanoparticles were proposed. In this strategy, the three-dimensional ordered macroporous CuFe2O4 support provides rich channels for mass transmission, revealling good corrosion-resistance and durability at the same time. ZIF-67 derived Co-NC decoration improves the conductivity of the catalyst. Further, the uniformly distributed Co-NC and CoFe nanoparticles (C/CF) dramatically promote the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Accordingly, C/CF@CuFe2O4 catalyst shows remarkable bifunctional electrocatalytic activity, with an ORR half-wave potential of 0.86 V, and an OER over-potential of 0.46 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The zinc-air battery using this catalyst exhibits a power density of 95.5 mW cm(-2) and a durable cyclability for over 170 h at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which implies a great potential in practical application.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000745303400001	34952529

The atomic oxygen (AO) resistance of the resulting polyimides were investigated in simulated AO environment, based on their evolution of surface chemistry and morphology. Results indicated that a silica passivating layer finally formed on the membrane surfaces and, there was a percolation threshold of HBPSi addition to achieve the most desirable AO resistance. This is explained by the formation of a much denser and more connected silica passivating layer in shorter time on the membrane surface at high HBPSi loading upon AO exposure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The electrocatalytic efficiency of the electrodes was studied on the basis of electrochemical data obtained from steady-state polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques in oxygen-free 1 M NaOH solution at 298 K. The results were compared with those obtained on polycrystalline Co. Moreover, literature data concerning the electrocatalytic activity of polycrystalline Ni and Ni-Mo alloys, which are considered good electrocatalyst materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline solutions, were also reported for comparison. The values of Tafel slope, b, exchange current density, j(0), and overpotential at the current density of 250 mA cm(-2), eta(250), indicated outstandingly high electrocatalytic activity of Co-W electrodes. The best performance towards the HER demonstrates the Co90W10 alloy in accordance with the prediction based on the electronic structure calculations and the enhanced density of states at the Fermi level of the 3d Co band.

Herein, the construction of atomic-layer IrOx on IrCo nanodendrites with tunable Ir-O bond length by compressive strain effect for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic environment is demonstrated. Evidenced from in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure, it is shown that the compressive strain of the IrOx layer on the IrCo nanodendrites decreases gradually from 2.51% to the unstrained state with atomic layer growth (from approximate to 2 to approximate to 9 atomic layers of IrOx), resulting in the variation of the Ir-O bond length from shortened 1.94 angstrom to normal 1.99 angstrom. The approximate to 3 atomic-layer IrOx on IrCo nanodendrites with an Ir-O bond length of 1.96 angstrom (1.51% strain) exhibits the optimal OER activity compared to the higher-strained (2.51%, approximate to 2 atomic-layer IrOx) and unstrained (>6 atomic-layer IrOx) counterparts, with an overpotential of only 247 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the precisely tuned compressive strain effect balances the adsorbate-substrate interaction and facilitates the rate-determining step to form HOO*, thus assuring the best performance of the three atomic-layer IrOx for OER.									73	2	0	0	3	0	73			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000479993300001	31373731

Herein, our theoretical calculations predicate that the limitations in the mean-field behavior from the traditional catalyst designing strategy can be largely overcome by introducing diluted metal nanoclusters, which can give an optimal thermodynamic effect for enhancing electron-transfer capability, and in turn promote the activation of initial water-dissociation for both the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. As a proof of concept, a unique catalyst, namely diluted nickel nanocluster-decorated ruthenium nanowires, was explored as a high-performance electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The optimized catalyst delivered record activity for overall water splitting in a wide pH range from 0 to 14 with all the potentials lower than 1.454 V to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), largely outperforming the Pt/C-Ir/C integrated couple. It also readily reaches a high current density, of up to 100 mA cm(-2), with a low voltage of only 1.55 V applied. It is further demonstrated that the diluted nickel nanoclusters can strongly anchor on the ruthenium nanowires, contributing to the enhanced stability after the long-term tests. The diluted metal nanocluster-enhanced strategy highlights a general pathway for the rational design of catalysts with unprecedented performance for electrocatalysis and beyond.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000645549100001

However, researches concerning the catalytic activity of the A-site deficient La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 with Fe doping are still scare. In this work, (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)Mn1-xFexO3(x = 0, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5) perovskites are prepared and developed as bifunctional electrocatalysts. Their structure, morphology, surface adsorbed element state and electrochemical behaviors are characterized. The results demonstrate that Fe doping can increase surface oxygen vacancies, tailor Mn and Fe valence state of the perovskite and thus improve electrocatalytic activity. Among all the perovskite samples tested, (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.9)5Mn(0.7)Fe(0.3)O(3) (LSMF2) performs the best ORR/OER activity. Except for the good electrocatalytic activity, it also achieves excellent long-term durability compared with Pt/C catalyst. When LSMF2 is applied as the cathode electrocatalyst, a peak power density of 104 mW cm-2 is achieved for the ZAB. Meanwhile, a much lower charge-discharge voltage gap of only 0.9 V than Pt/C catalyst (1.13 V) is obtained. Besides, the proposed ZAB exhibited remarkably high stability during cycling in performance up to 100 cycles. These results highlight perovskite LSMF2 as a very promising electrocatalyst in ZAB.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000843499600004

By studying the local structure and chemistry of BSCF surfaces, in detail, via a range of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methods, we show that the surfaces of the as-synthesized BSCF particles are Co/Fe rich, and remarkably, adopt a spinel-like structure with a reduced valence of Co ions. Post-mortem and identical location TEM analyses reveal that the Co/Fe spinel-like surface retains a stable chemical environment of the Co/Fe ions, although its structure weakens after electrochemical processing. Further, it is verified that prior to the onset of OER, the Co/Fe spinel-like surface promotes the formation of the highly active Co(Fe)OOH phase, which enhances the OER electrocatalytic properties of the underlying conductive BSCF perovskite. This study provides a detailed understanding of the fundamental transformations that oxide catalysts undergo during electrochemical processes and can aid in the development of novel oxide catalysts with enhanced activity.									41	1	0	0	1	0	41			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000573374400028	32809812

Herein, we report a fast preparation method to construct an integrated CuxO@CoNi-LDH electrocatalyst with a unique 1D nanowire-2D nanosheet hierarchical core-shell structure by electrodepositing CoNi-LDH nanosheet arrays directly onto CuxO nanorods (CuxO were in situ-created on the Cu foam) at a large deposition voltage of -3.0V vs SCE. The unique heterogeneous core-shell nanostructure, large deposition amount of CoNi-LDH and the synergistic effects between CuxO core and CoNi-LDH shell can provide abundant active sites, rich open-channels and reduced charge transfer resistance (Rct) for effective oxygen release and facile electron transport. Consequently, the optimized CuxO@CoNi-LDH/CF exhibits a low overpotential of 207mV in 1M KOH solution at the current density of 10mVcm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 50.1mV dec-1. After 60h of long-term stability test, the catalytic performance is only slightly weakened. This work demonstrates a new approach to design the high-performance LDH and Cu-related OER catalysts by constructing a unique hierarchical core-shell nanostructure.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1095-7103		MEDLINE:36327739	36327739	
J	Cao, Qingxiang; Wu, Xuelian; Zhang, Yunxiao; Yang, Bo; Ma, Xiaofen; Song, Jun; Zhang, Junmin								Potassium-doped carbon nitride: Highly efficient photoredox catalyst for selective oxygen reduction and arylboronic acid hydroxylation								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				414				64	75		10.1016/j.jcat.2022.08.030				OCT 2022	2022	Photocatalytic two-electron oxygen reduction reaction for hydrogen peroxide production, a promising liquid energy carrier and an environmentally friendly oxidant, is regard as a promising process owing to its low-cost and environment-friendly advantages compared to the state-of-art anthraquinone oxidation for H2O2 production. Herein, a potassium-doped carbon nitride photocatalyst has been successfully synthesized by the copolymerization of self-assembly supramolecular cyanuric acid and melamine aggregates with introduction of potassium chloride (KCMCN), wherein its band structure was carefully tuned and a new channel for charge transfer was created. Notably, DFT calculations pointed out that a lower absorption energy of oxygen (E-ads = 0.27 eV) over KCMCN was estimated than that of MCN (E-ads = 1.02 eV) with the introduction of K into carbon nitride framework, which is beneficial for superior H2O2 evolution. The H2O2 yield of KCMCN (317.9 lmol.L-1.h(-1)) was about 10.7 times higher than bulk carbon nitride at low concentration of sacrificial agent (0.5% isopropanol aqueous solution) and the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of KCMCN reached to 7.5% at 420 nm. Furthermore, in-situ photoinduced superoxide radical anion (.O-2(-)) species were generated from dioxygen in KCMCN, which were reacted with arylboronic acids to produce corresponding aryl alcohols through a hydroxylation process under visible light irradiation. This work opens up prospects for providing guidance for other organic syn-thesis based on the oxidative effect of H2O2 and exploring novel heterogeneous photocatalysts in the field of value-added products formation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-9517	1090-2694		WOS:000858454600005

In both complexes, there was little difference in the various combustion characteristics. The combustion reactivity was relatively low compared with the case of using other oxidizing agents, such as KBrO3, etc. But the participation of CuO in the reaction was supposed to be different based on the analysis of the combustion residue. As for the gas evolution behavior, the evolution of N-2, NH3, N2O, NOx and COx gases was confirmed upon ignition at 500 degrees C in both complexes (no H2O analysis). It was interesting that CO gas not evolved from the semicarbazide complex. It was clear that the combustion reactivity and the gas evolution behavior vary in both complexes in spite of the same skeleton and similar oxygen balance.									29	6	0	0	0	0	30			0721-3115			WOS:000086050300008

Herein, we report a facile approach that can uniformly disperse ultrasmall Ir clusters onto MnO2 nanorods for the OER in a universal pH range. Among the x%-Ir-MnO2 (x refers to the mass percentage of Ir) series, 5%-Ir-MnO2 exhibits superior OER performance than other samples, and also exceeds the IrO2 benchmark, as evidenced by small overpotentials of 330 mV (0.2 M PBS, pH = 7.0), 240 mV (1 M KOH, pH = 14.0), and 267 mV (0.5 M H2SO4, pH = 0) to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and markedly superior long-term stability in i-t curves. Furthermore, as an air-cathode catalyst for Zn-air batteries, the 5%-Ir-MnO2 modified battery also demonstrates brilliant performances with large capacities of 655.4 mA h g(-1) and 792 mA h g(-1), long durability of 120 h and 200 h in alkaline and neutral media, respectively. Such excellent electrocatalytic performances are attributed to the unique structural merits of the ultrasmall Ir clusters, the abundant oxygen vacancies of MnO2 nanorods, and the catalytic synergistic effects between the Ir clusters and the MnO2 substrate.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000820729000001		
J	Fang, Dandan; Huang, Yitian; Zhang, Shupei; Dai, Hong; Hong, Zhensheng; Lin, Yanyu								( )Versatile NiCo2O4 nanosheets hybrids-based label-free immunosensor for thyroglobulin using photothermal amplification								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				337						135790	10.1016/j.electacta.2020.135790				MAR 20 2020	2020	Herein, an ultrasensitive label-free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor based on electrocatalytic and photothermal amplification was constructed and was applied to detect Thyroglobulin (Tg). Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNTs) with charming merits was used as supporter for porous NiCo2O4 nanosheets (pNiCo(2)O(4) NSs), the formed pNiCo(2)O(4) NSs/SWCNTs hybrids was utilized as an effective matrix and realized multiple signal amplification. To be specific, pNiCo(2)O(4) NSs/SWCNTs hybrids on the one hand can facilitate the electron transfer and enhance ECL signal. On the other hand can catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to increase the concentration of dissolved O-2 for further strengthening ECL signal. What's more, the pNiCo(2)O(4) NSs/SWCNTs hybrids had a strong near-infrared harvesting capability, can convert laser energy into heat to increase the electrode surface temperature, resulting in the significant enhancement in ECL signal. Based on excellent properties of pNiCo(2)O(4) NSs/SWCNTs hybrids, a highly-efficient label-free ECL immunosensor was developed and exhibited a wide linear range (10(-5) ng/mL to 100 ng/mL) and a low detection limit (3.3 x 10(-6) ng/mL) for Tg determination, which was approximately 7.1 fold-lower than at room temperature. This work provided a new thought for high-performance ECL sensing platform construction. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we report a novel method to grow N-doped carbon nanotube (NCNT) arrays with encapsulated CoFe alloy nanoparticles on carbon fiber cloth (CFC) as a self-supported air cathode for flexible ZABs. The optimized electrode exhibits superior bifunctional activities with a half-wave potential of 0.873 V for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a potential of 1.506 V for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm(-2), greatly superior to that of 20% Pt/C for the ORR and IrO(2)for the OER, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the atomically dispersed Co(Fe) dual-sites formed in the NCNT walls are key to the excellent activities of the self-supported electrode. When the self-supported electrode is applied as an air cathode for flexible solid-state ZABs, a large open-circuit voltage of 1.426 V, a high initial energy efficiency of 69% and a large power density of 37.7 mW cm(-2)as well as robust stability are achieved. Furthermore, the solid-state ZABs with the self-supported electrode exhibit excellent flexibility even under extreme bending conditions. Our strategy presented here opens a new way for bifunctional catalysts for high-performance flexible ZABs.									48	0	0	0	2	0	48			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000569873400024

Here, density functional theory (DFT) calculations imply that the metallic Ni3S2 and semiconductive MoS2 could form Mott-Schottky catalyst because of the suitable band structure. Therefore, we synthesized MoS2/Ni3S2 electrocatalyst by a simple hydrothermal method, and studied its UOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. The formed MoS2/Ni3S2 Schottky heterojunction is only required 109 and 166 mV to obtain +/- 10 mA cm(-2) for UOR and HER, respectively, showing great bifunctional catalytic activity. Moreover, the full urea electrolysis driven by MoS2/Ni3S2 delivers 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at a relatively low potential of 1.44 and 1.59 V. Comprehensive experiments and DFT calculations demonstrate that the MoS2/Ni3S2 Schottky heterojunction causes self-driven charge transfer at the interface and forms built-in electric field, which is not only benefit to reduce H* adsorption energy, but also helps to adjust the absorption and directional distribution of urea molecules, thereby promoting the activity of decomposition of water and urea. This research furnishes a tactic to devise more efficient catalysts for H(2)generation and the treatment of urea-rich water pollution. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

We have prepared an electrocatalyst by the immobilization of NiCo2O4 on a phosphazene-based covalent organic polymer (P-COP) through a facile hydrothermal method. The elemental composition of the P-COP showed the presence of a greater amount of heteroatoms N (6.62%) and P (5.62%) throughout the polymer support. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) were utilized to determine the atomic structure of the nanocuboids, which depicted the formation of an inverse spinel structure. A NiCo2O4-P-COP-based electrode was simultaneously used for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and it displayed a minimum overpotential of 270 and 130 mV (V vs RHE), respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, it acted as an oxygen reduction catalyst with a half-wave potential of 0.83 V (V vs RHE) and a maximum current density of 4.5 mA cm(-2). The electrocatalytic activity is comparable with that of the commercially available Pt and RuO2 catalysts. The combined experimental and computational studies confirm that the catalytic centers formed through the interaction between the heteroatoms (N and P) in the phosphazene matrix and metal oxides (Co and Ni) play an important role in its improved durability and electrocatalytic activity.									5	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000703338600067

Davletshina, Lira/ABF-8740-2021; Semin, Boris/ABF-8153-2021				Correlation between pH dependence of O-2 evolution and sensitivity of Mn cations in the oxygen-evolving complex to exogenous reductants								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				125	1-2	SI		95	103		10.1007/s11120-015-0155-4				AUG 2015	2015	Effects of pH, Ca2+, and Cl- ions on the extraction of Mn cations from oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) in Ca-depleted photosystem II (PSII(-Ca)) by exogenous reductants hydroquinone (H(2)Q) and H2O2 were studied. Two of 4 Mn cations are released by H(2)Q and H2O2 at pHs 5.7, 6.5, and 7.5, and their extraction does not depend on the presence of Ca2+ and Cl- ions. One of Mn cations ("resistant" Mn cation) cannot be extracted by H(2)Q and H2O2 at any pH. Extraction of 4th Mn ion ("flexible" Mn cation) is sensitive to pH, Ca2+, and Cl-. This Mn cation is released by reductants at pH 6.5 but not at pHs 5.7 and 7.5. A pH dependence curve of the oxygen-evolving activity in PSII(-Ca) membranes (in the presence of exogenous Ca2+) has a bell-shaped form with the maximum at pH 6.5. Thus, the increase in the resistance of flexible Mn cation in OEC to the action of reductants at acidic and alkaline pHs coincides with the decrease in oxygen evolution activity at these pHs. Exogenous Ca2+ protects the extraction of flexible Mn cation at pH 6.5. High concentration of Cl- anions (100 mM) shifts the pH optimum of oxygen evolution to alkaline region (around pH 7.5), while the pH of flexible Mn extraction is also shifted to alkaline pH. This result suggests that flexible Mn cation plays a key role in the water-splitting reaction. The obtained results also demonstrate that only one Mn cation in Mn-4 cluster is under strong control of calcium. The change in the flexible Mn cation resistance to exogenous reductants in the presence of Ca2+ suggests that Ca2+ can control the redox potential of this cation.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000356311900009	25975707

The Ru2P/WO3@NPC electrocatalyst exhibits an outstanding HER activity with an overpotential of 15 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent durability in a 1.0 M KOH solution, outperforming state-of-the-art Pt/C and most reported electrocatalysts. Experimental results combined with density functional calculations reveal that the electron density redistribution in Ru2P/WO3@NPC is achieved by electron transfer from NPC to Ru2P/WO3 and from Ru2P to WO3, which directly promotes the dissociation of water on W sites in WO3 and desorption of hydrogen on Ru sites in Ru2P.									69	4	0	0	5	0	70			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000600446700001	33174362

Herein, for the first time, a shape-controlled synthesis of starfish-like Co-Ni-S nano sheets on three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically porous nickel foams (Co-Ni-S/NF) via a one-step hydrothermal method was developed. The influence of reaction time on the nanosheet structure and properties was intensively studied. After 11 h reaction, the Co-Ni-S/NF-11 sample displays the most regular structure of nanosheets and the most outstanding electrochemical properties. As to water splitting, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) required overpotentials of 284.3 and 296 mV, respectively, to provide a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). The marvelous electrochemical performance can be attributed to the conductive networks of 3D layered porous nickel skeletons that are highly interconnected, which provided a large specific area and highly active sites. To further enhance the electrochemical performances of the electrocatalyst, the influence of the doping of the P element was also studied. The results proved that the P-doped Co-Ni-S/NF maintains the starfish structure and demonstrates outstanding properties, providing a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) with only 187.4 and 292.2 mV overpotentials for HER and OER, respectively. It exhibited far more excellent properties than reported dual-functional electrocatalysts. Additionally, when used as an overall water-splitting catalyst, P Co-Ni-S/NF can provide a 10 mA cm(-2) current density at a given cell voltage of 1.60 V in 1 M KOH, which is competitive to the best-known electrocatalysts, with high long-term stability.									79	6	0	0	1	0	79			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000426618000034	29400057

However, their unique band alignment results in small driving photovoltages, significantly limiting the overall photocatalytic efficiency. In this work, we propose two practical methods to address this problem in Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts. One is to introduce a large interfacial polarization. The other is to take wide-bandgap components. Nonpolar wide-bandgap PtO2 and GeC are chosen in this work, because these two nonpolar materials have a large difference in the work function to fulfil the requirement of their large interfacial polarization. Besides, it is convenient to make an effective comparison between our work and the previous works on the direct Z-scheme heterojunctions based on MoSe2 and WSe2. Therefore, PtO2/MoSe2 and PtO2/WSe2 are also investigated in this work. Therefore, the material realization of such rational design is achieved and demonstrated in three van der Waals (vdW) two-dimensional (2D) polar heterojunctions: PtO2/MoSe2, PtO2/WSe2, and PtO2/GeC. Our first-principles calculations show that the polar heterojunctions have an extended light absorption range (covering the near-infrared spectrum), small exciton binding energy, small global band gap, and large interfacial electric field, indicating a high efficiency of light utilization and carrier separation. The most important feature is their large driving photovoltages, up to 4 V for the oxidation evolution reaction (OER) and 2 V for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), induced by the large interfacial polarization and wide band gaps of 2D monolayer materials. The calculated Gibbs free energies demonstrate that such high photovoltages can smoothly drive both the OER and HER, implying a high redox efficiency for the proposed Z-scheme polar heterojunctions. Our work provides a significant strategy for designing the direct Z-scheme heterojunctions with high photocatalytic performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000788178000001

The Rh 3d(5/2), K 2p, and O 1s spectra and LEED patterns were used as fingerprints for the interfacial reactions and the structural changes. Dramatic changes in the chemical state of the substrate occur in the presence of dense K+O adlayers, when the oxygen coverage exceeds one monolayer. The effect of coadsorbed potassium on the "reactivity" of oxygen was probed by following the evolution of the O 1s spectra during titration with H-2. The enhanced surface capacity for oxygen adsorption and the reduced rate of H2O formation with increasing K coverage were discussed considering the influence of K on the dissociative adsorption of O-2 and H-2 and on the bonding of the coadsorbed species.

The effect of Bi doping on the structure, electrical conductivity, chemical compatibility with GDC electrolyte, electro-chemical performance and thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) were investigated. XRD characterization results show that the solid solution content of Bi is less than or equal to 0.1. XPS characterization results indicate that Bi doping increases the oxygen vacancy content of LBSNM-x air electrode and thus greatly benefits its oxygen evolution reaction. Among the Bi-doped samples, LBSNM-0.1 electrode has the best electrochemical perfor-mance with its lowest Rp (polarization resistance) of 0.28 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C based on LBSNM-0.1/GDC half-cell. LBSNM-0.1 single cell with 70%CO2 + 30%CO fuel gas feed on the fuel electrode has achieved current density of 811 mA cm(-2) at 800 degrees C and 1.4 V, a 62.2% increase relative to that of LSNM single cell. In addition, LBSNM-0.1 single cell exhibits excellent stability at 800 degrees C and 1.3 V with 70%CO2 + 30%CO feed gas on the fuel electrode. These results prove that Bi-doped LBSNM-0.1 is an efficient air electrode for SOEC. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Pycnonuclear reactions are predicted near fluid-solid transitions at high densities, where the total reaction rates in fluid and solid phases take on comparable values that are virtually independent of the temperature. Analytic expressions for the reaction rates are presented and are applied to dense carbon-oxygen matter in the white dwarf interiors near ignition conditions and to dense proton-deuteron matter in giant planets and brown dwarfs. Possibility of a laboratory detection of pycnonuclear reactions in ultrahigh-pressure metallic hydrogen near solidification is explored.									30	0	0	0	0	0	30			0004-637X			WOS:000089252600036

Herein, we report a template-free and annealing-free one-step electrodeposition approach for the in situ fabrication of composition- and morphology-controllable NixFe3-xO4/Ni hybrid and NixFe3-xO4 nanosheet arrays (NSAs) on different conducting substrates as highly active and robust oxygen-evolving electrocatalysts. The optimal NixFe3-xO4/Ni hybrid NSA electrodeposited on nickel foam requires low overpotentials of only 218 and 262 mV to deliver OER current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a small Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1), which are the best among the reported Ni-Fe oxide-based OER electrocatalysts. The NixFe3-xO4/Ni hybrid NSA also exhibits robust stability under the OER conditions, showing no decline in the catalytic activity after a continuous oxygen-evolving test conducted at current densities ranging from 10 to 500 mA cm(-2) for a total of 220 h. The excellent electrocatalytic OER performance of the electrodeposited NixFe3-xO4/Ni hybrid NSA could be attributed to its vertically aligned nanosheet morphology providing a large electrochemically active surface area, better matched Fermi energy of NixFe3-xO4 with the O-2 production potential and faster electron transfer due to proper Ni incorporation, and low interfacial resistance and robust contact between the NixFe3-xO4/Ni hybrid and the substrate due to in situ electrodeposition. This work provides a facile (around 3 min of electrodeposition) and low-cost synthesis strategy that could be applicable for the fabrication of nanostructures of various metal oxides or metal oxide/metal hybrids for different applications.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000519903900016

After chlorination, uniform coatings with controllable thickness are formed in situ on the SiC fibres. Evolution of the coating composition and its relation to the electrical properties are investigated. Results indicate that the porous nature of the coating realizes a reaction-controlling mechanism of the coating growth. By enhancing the chlorination temperature within the selected range, SiC, SiCO3 and SiC2O2 phases in the fibre can be successively etched as free carbon to give C-SiCxOy hybrid coatings with increased content of C and decreased content of O. Accordingly, the specific resistivity of the coated SiC fibre declines continuously from 5.01 x 10(6) to 0.39 Omega cm.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2046-2069			WOS:000457292800017	35518038

Complementary measurements on one SnO sample treated in vacuum in this sequence were performed after the thermal treatment at 773 K. In the thermal evolution between SnO and SnO2 the results show the presence of an intermediate oxide not only in the Ar and vacuum annealed samples but also in those annealed in air. The Mossbauer parameters of the 2+ and 4+ states for the intermediate oxide were determined. The results were consistent with a reaction rate dependent on the oxygen partial pressure.									57	3	0	0	1	0	58			0953-8984			WOS:A1992HA16000004

Herein, PtCu alloy with nanowire networks (NWNs) structure is obtained by a simple modified polyol method accompanied with a salt-mediated self-assembly process in a water/ethylene glycol (EG) mixing media. The formation mechanism of PtCu NWNs including the morphological evolution and the relevant experimental parameters has been investigated systematically. We propose that a micro-interface in H2O-EG media formed with the assistance of disodium dihydrogen pyrophosphate (Na2H2P2O7) and its unique nature of coordinating with Pt2+ or Cu2+ play critical roles in the formation of NWNs. When tested as ORR catalyst, the PtCuNWNs/C exhibits much higher activity and durability than that of Pt-NWNs/C and commercial Pt/C, even exceeding the target of DOE in 2020. The excellent performance of PtCuNWNs/C could be attributed to the unique structure of NWNs with 2.4 nm ultrathin wavy nanowires and plentiful surface defects and the modified electronic effect caused by alloying with Cu atoms.									32	5	0	0	1	0	33			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000494681100011

In order to improve the catalytic performance of the composite, copper ions (II) were introduced to PMPhen/C by complex to form the PMPhen-Cu/C catalyst. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were applied to investigate the surface microstructure and elemental compositions of the catalysts. The results from electrochemical analysis show that PMPhen/C reduced oxygen to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through a two-electron transfer process. PMPhen-Cu/C could reduce oxygen to water through a four-electron pathway. Except the slightly lower initial reduction potential, PMPhen-Cu/C has a comparable oxygen reduction ability (ORR) to that of the commercially available Pt/C catalyst, which makes it a potential candidate as the cathodic catalyst in some fuel cells running in neutral medium, such as a microbial fuel cell.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2073-4344			WOS:000436128600024

Specifically, a multi-scale model based on micro-mechanics analysis in conjunction with continuum damage mechanics (CDM) is developed to simulate the accelerated fiber-matrix debond growth in the longitudinal direction of a unidirectional HTPMC. Using this approach, one can relate the behavior of composites at the micro-level (representative volume element) to the macro-level (structural element) in a computationally tractable manner. Thermo-oxidative aging is simulated with diffusion-reaction model in which temperature, oxygen concentration, and weight loss effects are considered. For debond growth simulation, a model based on Darcy's laws for oxygen permeation in the fiber-matrix interface is employed, that, when coupled with polymer shrinkage, provides a mechanism for permeation-controlled debond growth in HTPMC. Benchmark of model prediction with experimental observations of oxidation layer growth is presented, together with a laminate thermo-oxidative life prediction model based on CDM to demonstrate proof-of-concept.

Herein, we prepared Pt nanoclusters with exposed (1 1 1) face plane embedded Fe-based metal-organic frameworks (Fe-MOF, MIL-100(Fe)) catalyst for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR). It is noted that the available oxygen sites on the surface of MIL-100(Fe) would form Pt-O interaction with Pt nanoclusters to acquire strong interfacial interaction, which endows Pt/MIL-100(Fe) electrocatalyst effective electron transfer, increasing catalytic active sites, accelerating proton-electron coupling, and improving conductivity. Benefitting from the desirable metal-supports interaction and derive merits for catalysis, the high electrocatalytic activity and durability for HER and EGOR were achieved as expected. Impressively, superior HER performance with higher current density, lower overpotential (46/29 mV in acidic/alkaline electrolyte) and smaller Tafel slope (19.7/37.8 mV dec(-1) in acidic/alkaline electrolyte) were acquired compared to commercial Pt/C. Moreover, Pt/MIL-100(Fe) electrode exhibits a rather high mass activity of 11826 mA mg(Pt)(1) and long-term stability for EGOR. The present investigation demonstrates the promise of active metal/MOF combination for the interfacial strategy and rational design of dual-functional electrocatalyst, which has potential applications for future electrocatalysis field.

Calcium and sulfate increase as a result of a combined sulfide oxidation and plagioclase alteration reaction. The gneiss contains andesine-plagioclase (An(20)-An(40)) and is rich in primary sulfide. As an effect of Ca and SO4 release by the prime water-rock reaction, dissolved oxygen decreases and the waters become more reduced. The waters have Cl/Br mass ratios of about 50, which is very close to that of experimentally leached gneiss powders indicating that the rock matrix is the source of the halogens. The waters are undersaturated with respect to calcite in the upper parts of the mine. With increasing reaction progress, calcite saturation is reached and carbonate forms as a reaction product of the prime reaction that also controls the partial pressure of CO2 to progressively lower values. The chemical evolution of groundwater in fractured basement of the Clara mine suggests that the partial pressure of CO2 is an internally buffered parameter rather than a controlling external variable.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1437-3254	1437-3262		WOS:000270384600014

The alloy liquid is cooled to a rod-shaped alloy ingot in an inert gas atmosphere, and the single-roll chiller is used to blown into the corresponding alloy strip. The alloy strip is put in an alkaline or neutral solution for dealloying, rinsed with ultrapure water for various times, and then dried to obtain a transition metal oxide or oxyhydroxide powder sample. The dealloyed product is placed in a tubular annealing furnace, with sulfur powder placed upstream of the sample. The temperature of the tubular annealing furnace is raised to 350-700 degrees C, and driven by the flow of the protective gas, the sulfur vapor and the dealloying product contact and react at a high temperature, and the bimetallic persulfide multifunctional catalyst is prepared when lowered to room temperature.

J	Lee, WH; Lin, RY								Hot corrosion mechanism of intermetallic compound Ni3Al								MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS				77	1			86	96	PII S0254-0584(01)00567-3	10.1016/S0254-0584(01)00567-3				JAN 2 2003	2003	The molten salt-induced oxidation/sulfidation (hot corrosion) on nickel alummide intermetallic compound (Ni3Al, Ni-11.7 wt.%Al-0.6 wt.%Zr-0.01 wt.%B) has been studied in the 1%SO2/air gas mixtures. X-ray analyses for the hot-corroded specimen tested at different period of time show only NiO formed at 605 degreesC, and NiO and NiAl2O4 at 800 and 1000 degreesC. EDAX analyses reveal that AIS(x) and/or NiS, are produced beneath the oxide scales at all temperatures.From the experimental results, the hot corrosion mechanism can be described as follows. NiO oxide formation consumes oxygen in molten salt. The consumption of oxygen will locally reduce the oxygen and increase the sulfur partial pressure in molten salt. This partial pressure change can be represented by the stability diagram. As the increased sulfur partial pressure reaches the equilibrium partial pressure region of NiSx and/or AlSx, NiSx and/or AlSx will form at the salUalloy interface through sulfidation reaction. The consumption of sulfur will balance out the sulfur and oxygen partial pressure increases in molten salt. This will force NiO to form again. This process also suggests that NiO and NiSx and/or AlSx will be produced simultaneously. Since the produced sulfide is thermodynamically unstable when the oxygen potential increases, it is possible for sulfide to convert into oxides (NiO, Al2O3, and NiAl2O4) through the necessary reactions. There are two possibilities for the formation of spinel phase, which is produced either through the reaction of Al and Ni with oxygen in the molten salt or through the evolution of sulfides.

Ruthenium (Ru), as the cheapest member of platinum-group metals, has attracted much attention, and the incorporation of trace amount of Ru with cobalt phosphide could significantly improve the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic activity. In this work, ruthenium-incorporated cobalt phosphide nanocubes are synthesized via a reaction between Co-Co Prussian blue analog (Co-PBA) and ruthenium chloride (RuCl 3 ) followed by the phosphidation. The sample with a Ru content of similar to 2.04 wt.% exhibits the best HER catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 51 and 155 mV, to achieve the current densities of -10 and -100 mA cm(-2) , respectively, and the Tafel slope of 53.8 mV dec(-1), which is comparable to the commercial Pt/C. This study provides a new perspective to the design and construction of high performance electrocatalysts for HER and other catalytic applications in a relatively low price.									26	1	0	0	4	0	26			2296-2646			WOS:000448671700001	30425981

Here, flexible porous nanofibers embedded with Co nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon (Co@NPCFs) have been synthesized to work as self-standing and binder-free electrodes in flexible ZABs. These unique nanofibers with nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon are beneficial for electron transport, oxygen capture and desorption of the OH- ions. The Co@NPCFs could provide rich active sites and exhibit good catalytic activity for both the oxygen evolution reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction. The fabricated composites with a flexible self-standing network structure can be applied directly to flexible ZABs and contact well with gel electrolyte when bending the batteries. As a result, this strategy provides a good example of flexible self-standing electrodes for ZABs and can also be extended to other flexible electric energy storage devices.									22	2	0	0	0	0	22			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000526936600014

Here we report a new strategy to improve the electrocatalytic performance of nickel for CO2 reduction by employing a nitrogen-carbon layer for nickel nanoparticles. Such a nickel electrocatalyst exhibits high Faradaic efficiency 97.5% at relatively low potential of -0.61 V for the conversion of CO2 to CO. Density functional theory calculation reveals that it is thermodynamically accomplishable for the reduction product CO to be removed from the catalyst surface, thus avoiding catalyst poisoning. Also, the catalyst renders hydrogen evolution reaction to be suppressed and hence reasonably improves catalytic performance.									29	4	0	0	1	0	29			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000467495900024

A close inspection of spectra obtained at early stages has revealed the presence of low-ionization lines, and among the others we have identified the presence of the ionized Be-7 doublet in a region relatively free from possible contaminants. After studying their intensities, we have inferred that ASASSN-16kt has produced (5.9-7.7) x 10(-9)M(circle dot) of Be-7. The identification of bright Ne lines may suggest that the nova progenitor is a massive (1.2 M-circle dot) oxygen-neon white dwarf. The high outburst frequency of oxygen-neon novae implies that they likely produce an amount of Be similar, if not larger, to that produced by carbon-oxygen novae, then confirming that classical novae are among the main factories of lithium in the Galaxy.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000439547400013

In this study we fabricated polymer electrolyte membrane based on PTFE pore filled membrane impregnated with [Dema][TfO]. The activation energy obtained for an ionic conductivity was 8.12 kJ mol(-1). Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) were studied in the solid-state cell with an in-situ RHE reference electrode, using Pt/C cathode and IrO2 anode respectively. The HER was observed at two different potentials, one at a peak potential of -0.47 V vs RHE with a limiting current density of -9.7 mA/cm(2), assigned to reduction of hydronium ion. The second HER was observed at -0.63 V vs. RHE, assigned to the [Dema-H](+) cation reduction. Similarly, two oxidation peaks were assigned to OER one at 1.47 V and the second at 1.72 V vs RHE. The full cell water electrolyser achieved a current density of 70 mA/cm(2) at 2.2 V with 50% RH at 100 degrees C. The stability of [Dema-H](+)[TfO](-) was studied with in-situ mass spectrometry which showed the loss of DEMA at > -0.8 V vs RHE while [TfO](-) anion was stable up to 2.5 V vs RHE.

In this paper, the species and contents of OFGs on the surface of ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) and their effects on the sodium storage performance are systematically investigated without the interference of interlayer distance variation, extrinsic defects, other heteroatoms (e.g., N, S), etc. Theoretical calculations performed on various OFGs demonstrate that quinones and carboxylic anhydride groups possess two C=O bonds with stable configurations, good electronic conductivity, and strong sodium adsorption capability, contributing greatly to the Na+ storage capacity compared to the carboxylic acid groups. The ex situ techniques disclose the evolution of the OFGs and manifest the stable coordination of Na+ with C=O bonds even after long cycles. The optimized OFGs boost the Na+ redox reaction kinetics and enhance the surface capacitance contribution, achieving a capacity enhancement of 64.7% compared to the pristine OMC. This work would present implications in rational designing of oxygen-functionalized carbon materials for energy storage fields.									32	3	0	0	0	0	34			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000514256400018	31957428

In this work we present a comparative study of the OER on the oxide NaTaO3 (113) surface and the oxynitride SrTaO2N (001) surface. Oxynitrides are highly promising photocatalysts due to their smaller band gap and resulting better visible light absorption compared to oxides but our knowledge about their surface structure and chemistry is still very limited. With the goal to compare the surface chemistry of oxides and oxynitrides, we perform density functional theory calculations to obtain the free energy changes associated with the OER reaction steps. For the OER at the Ta site of the clean surfaces, our results predict the overpotential-determining step (ODS) for both materials to be the formation of the *OOH intermediate, with a larger over potential for the oxide than the oxynitride (1.30 V vs 1.01 V). The Na site is found to be more active than the Ta site on the oxide surface with an OER overpotential of 0.88 V, whereas the OER at the Sr site on the oxynitride has an overpotential of 1.14 V. For the A sites, contrary to the Ta site, the deprotonation of *OH was found to be the ODS. Computed Pourbaix diagrams show that at relevant (photo)electrochemical conditions all surfaces are covered with oxygen adsorbates. Oxygen adsorbates at A (Na, Sr) sites are however found to couple and desorb as 02, leaving these sites empty under typical operating conditions. Following this desorption, we find the OER to proceed by the conventional *OOH mechanism on the SrO termination of the oxynitride but by a direct coupling of neighbouring *O at Na sites on the oxide surface. This coupling mechanism on the oxide has the smallest overpotential of 0.79 V compared to 0.88 V for the oxynitride, implying that the oxide is a better OER catalyst. Since it however absorbs light only in the UV part of the solar spectrum this leads to a tradeoff between light absorption and the catalytic activity.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0039-6028	1879-2758		WOS:000447478700034		
J	Qu, Qing; Pan, Guo-Liang; Lin, Yan-Ting; Xu, Chang-Wei								Boosting the electrocatalytic performance of Pt, Pd and Au embedded within mesoporous cobalt oxide for oxygen evolution reaction								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				43	31			14252	14264		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.05.123				AUG 2 2018	2018	High efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essential components of renewable energy technologies. However, the high onset potential and limited active sites restrict the catalytic activity of current electrocatalysts. Therefore, we are motivated by the development of cheap and efficient catalytic electrodes to promote the sluggish water-splitting systems associated with the large-scale application of clean and renewable energy technologies. Herein, a novel, simple, and efficient routine is presented by noble metal particles embedded within mesoporous metal oxide materials as high-efficiency anode catalysts for OER. Highly ordered mesoporous Co3O4 was prepared by a nanocasting method using the silica KIT-6 as hard template, showing an enhanced electrochemical performance. Then, M - Co3O4 (M = Pt, Pd, Au) nanomaterials were prepared by a simple but novel chemical reduction method. They show the high surface area of 112.3, 81.0 and 73.6 m(2) g(-1), which can provide more active surface area exposure leads to shorter paths of charges from electrolyte to electrode surface. Moreover, a three-dimensional highly ordered mesoporous structure can facilitate diffusion and penetration of electrolyte and oxygen, and can also keep catalyst nanoparticles in a well-dispersed condition with more active sites. Electrochemical measurements revealed that 20, 50, 25 wt % are the best weight contents for M (M = Pt, Pd, Au) in the Co3O4 with highest electrochemical activity (0.410, 0.415 and 0.422 V vs. SCE) and loon, reaching a maximum value. M-Co3O4(M = Pt, Pd, Au) materials exhibit superior activities and excellent long-duration stability in alkaline attributed to accelerating the formation of Co(IV) cations after being introduced M(M = Pt, Pd, Au) nanoparticles within mesoporous Co3O4. This kind of noble metal embedded within mesoporous oxide catalysts will hold a large potential as a highly promising electrocatalyst in the future. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, we present a cost-efficient multiphasic 1T/2H MoSe2-on-MXene nanosheets heterostructure (denote as 1T/2H MoSe2/MXene) as electrocatalyst for efficient overall water splitting. On one hand, the 1T/2H MoSe2 possesses abundant active sites providing relatively high electrocatalytic activity. On the other hand, the MXene nanosheets serve as high-conductive 2D substrates capable of promoting charge transfer ability and preventing 1T/2H MoSe2 from aggregation. Consequently, the 1T/2H MoSe2/MXene catalyst in alkaline media exhibits remarkable synergy in both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity having advantage over pure 1T/2H MoSe2, MXene and 2H MoSe2/MXene counterparts. To be specific, for HER performance, the 1T/2H MoSe2/MXene reveals an overpotential (95 mV) and Tafel slope (91 mV dec(-1)); for OER performance, the 1T/2H MoSe2/MXene shows an overpotential (340 mV) and Tafel slope (90 mV dec(-1)). Particularly, when 1T/2H MoSe2/MXene serving as bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, only 1.64 V is requested to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-)2. The 1T/2H MoSe2/MXene heterostructure also exhibits good durability in overall water splitting system. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, an innovative strategy is demonstrated to prepare PBA nanoarchitectures on various metal substrates. The interfacial redox reactions between metal cyanide ions and metal substrate result in the formation of desirable PBA nanostructures via the in situ precipitation process. Furthermore, the morphology and growth rates of PBAs can be readily regulated by changing the pH value of the reaction solution. The obtained PBA nanostructures can be transformed into the corresponding metal oxides via the simple thermal treatment. More importantly, the hollow oxide derivative manifests considerable catalytic activity with a low potential of 1.53 V to achieve the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and impressive prolonged durability over 600 h. This novel synthetic approach provides a favorable pathway to synthesize binder-free PBAs and their derivatives on diverse metal substrates, enabling new kinds of nanoarchitectures with desirable morphology and compositions for specific applications.									66	5	0	0	6	0	66			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000480824900001

Oxygen is a molecule in the triplet state (i. e., the outer electrons have parallel spins), which means that the spins localised in the p shell (up arrow O=O up arrow), the d shell and the conduction band electrons (t(2g)(n)e(g)(m)) will couple through exchange interactions, which we think will provide favourable conditions for the OER. We compare the perovskites CaCu3Fe4O12 (CCF) and Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) with RuO2. CCF and BSCF both have fluctuating electronic structures accessible at room temperature that are linked to conducting spin-polarised density of states, equivalent to the paramagnet-ic state of covalent transition metal oxides with fine charge conductivity. CCF and BSCF both possess a considerable number of unpaired electrons localised in the inner d shell, high-spin configurations and competing inter-atomic exchange interactions. As a first approximation, the average fluctuation of the magnetisation in the metal atoms correlates linearly with the OER onset potential for the studied compositions. By linking the dynamics of the localised inner-electron spins to the conduction spins through exchange interactions, we can predict that other perovskites, such as Sr2Fe0.75Co0.25MoO6, will be OER active at room temperature, as they have similar electronic properties to CCF and BSCF.									23	0	0	0	4	0	23			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000397015100012

According to recent research, 2D boron mono-chalcogenides in the 1 T and 2 H phases are stable, strong, and broad bandgap semiconductors. Our calculations show a strong UV absorption ability and suitable band edge positions for water splitting oxidation and reduction, making it a good choice for an efficient photocatalyst. The development of bifunctional electrocatalysts has piqued the interest of researchers working in the field of electrocatalysts for fuel cells. The electrocatalytic properties of 2D boron monochalcogenides are also investigated for catalyzing both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The calculated overpotentials for OER/ORR mechanism are found to be 0.92/1.09 for BS (1 T), 1.00/0.59 for BS (2 H), 0.96/ 1.05 for BSe (1 T), 0.92/0.85 for BSe (2 H), and 1.10/0.92 for BTe (1 T), which are close to benchmark catalysts. The ORR overpotential of BS (2H) is 0.59 V, near well-known catalyst Pt (0.45 V). Therefore, our investigations indicate that the family of 2D materials, boron monochalcogenides, are promising pho-tocatalyst and electrocatalyst candidates for OER and ORR.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

J	Okamoto, Yasuharu								Ambivalent Effect of Oxygen Vacancies on Li2MnO3: A First-Principles Study								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				159	2			A152	A157		10.1149/2.079202jes				2012	2012	First-principles calculations were done to examine the effect of oxygen vacancies in Li2MnO3 on the lithium extraction from the crystal. As the ratio of O-vacancy increases, the redox potential associated with the lithium extraction decreases and the Mn contribution in the charge compensation for the lithium extraction increases. These findings indicate that the introduction of O-vacancy activates the Mn sites as the redox center in the lithium extraction process. However, the lithium extraction from Li2MnO3 tends to cause successive O-2 evolution from the crystal. This results in a high O-vacancy density in the crystal, which in turn triggers a drastic volume reduction during the lithium extraction process. (C) 2011 The Electrochemical Society.

In this regard, nitride materials, particularly Ta3N5, have been the subject of investigation due to their promising properties. This review focuses on the fundamental parameters involved in the photocatalytic processes targeting overall water splitting using Ta3N5 as a model photocatalyst. The discussion primarily focuses on relevant parameters that are involved in photon absorption, exciton separation, carrier diffusion, carrier transport, catalytic efficiency, and mass transfer of the reactants.

Carefully exploring the structures of bimetallic NPs is a prerequisite for understanding the structure-associated properties. Herein, binary PtSn NPs with tunable composition are prepared in a controllable manner. X-ray characterizations reveal that their structures evolve from SnO2-x-patched PtSn alloys to SnO2-x-patched Pt clusters when more tin is incorporated. An obvious composition-dependent catalytic performance is observed for the hydrogenation of ,-unsaturated aldehydes: the selectivity to unsaturated alcohol increases substantially at high tin content, whereas the reaction rate follows a volcano shape. Furthermore, Pt sites are responsible for hydrogen dissociation, whereas oxygen vacancy (O-vac) sites, provided by SnO2-x, drastically enhance the adsorption of carbonyl group.									41	3	0	0	2	0	41			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000359299700017	26178645

The evolution on the physicochemical properties of Pr0.7Zr0.3O2-delta during the redox process was studied by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), H-2 temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), O-2 temperature-programmed desorption(O-2-TPD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technologies. The results indicated that Pr0.7Zr0.3O2-delta solid solution showed the high activity for the methane conversion to syngas with a high CO selectivity in the range of 83.5%-88.1%. Though Pr-Zr solid solution possessed high thermal stability, lattice oxygen was obviously reduced for the recycled sample due to decreased surface oxygen which promoted oxygen vacancies. The increased oxygen vacancies seemed to enhance the oxygen transfer ability in the redox process and provided sufficient oxygen for the methane selective oxidation, resulting in a satisfactory activity. The problem of hot pot was avoided by comparing fresh, aged and recycle sample in the reaction.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			1003-6326	2210-3384		WOS:000354034600029

This study developed a freestanding nanoporous high-entropy alloy foil as a dual-functional electrocatalyst. The proposed electrocatalyst combines dealloying and polarization and shows excellent electrocatalytic activity in an alkaline electrolyte. It has an extremely small overpotential of 150 mV at 1,000 mA cm-2 for the HER and a low Tafel slope of 29 mV dec- 1. At the same current density, the overpotential of the OER is only 350 mV. The alkaline electrolyzer using the electrocatalyst as both anode and cathode requires a cell voltage of only 1.47 V to output a stable current density of 10 mA cm-2. This enables it to be an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for alkaline overall water splitting and better stability for more than 375 h of continuous hydrogen production while providing substantial material cost savings relative to platinum. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the ultrahigh HER activity of the catalyst originates from the synergetic effect of optimized hydrogen adsorption in the segregation area and enhanced H2O adsorption in the unsegregation area produced by spinodal decomposition.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773537600003		
J	Zhang, Chenyi; Du, Xiaoqiang; Wang, Yanhong; Han, Xinghua; Zhang, Xiaoshuang								NiSe2@NixSy nanorod on nickel foam as efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				46	70			34713	34726		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.08.046		SEP 2021		OCT 11 2021	2021	Electrocatalytic water splitting technology has become one of the most promising methods to solve the energy crisis, which can produce a large amount of high purity H-2 and O-2. It is necessary to develop efficient and stable water splitting catalyst for reducing the over potential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and accelerating their reaction kinetics. A series of NiSe2@NixSy nanoarrays was firstly in situ grown on the nickel foam through the typical hydrothermal, selenylation and sulfuration pathways. The Na2SeO3 homogeneous solution is formed by hydrothermal and the selenization process is done at the temperature of 180 degrees C. Then the nickel foam (NF) is put into the Na2SeO3 solution to form NiSe2 material at the temperature of 120 degrees C. After that, the NiSe2 materials were sulfuretted with different amounts of sulfur to form NiSe2@NixSy hybrid materials. The experimental results demonstrate that the NiSe2@NixSy material as a 3D electrode can maximize the synergistic reaction between NiSe2 and NixSy, thus exhibiting an efficient and comprehensive water splitting performance. The NiSe2@NixSy-1 material presents a superior OER performance with requiring the overpotential of only 206 mV at 100 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the NiSe2@NixSy-0.3 material presents a superior HER performance with requiring the overpotential of only 148 mV at 100 mA cm(-2). It is worth noting that when NiSe2@NixSy-1 material and the NiSe2@NixSy-0.3 material was used as cathode and anode, only 1.53 V cell voltage is needed to produce a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) throughout the water splitting process, which is one of the smallest values reported so far. Density functional theory calculations results show that the Ni3S2 has the best water adsorption energy, so it is an active species in the process of catalysis. However, NiSe2 has more density distribution around the Fermi level, indicating that it exhibits better metallic properties, which makes the NiSe2@NixSy-1 hybrid material exhibit better electronic conductivity.

J	van Rantwijk, F; Sheldon, RA				Sheldon, Roger Arthur/ADM-3421-2022				Selective oxygen transfer catalysed by heme peroxidases: synthetic and mechanistic aspects								CURRENT OPINION IN BIOTECHNOLOGY				11	6			554	564		10.1016/S0958-1669(00)00143-9				DEC 2000	2000	The:synthetic and mechanistic aspects of the use of heme peroxidases as functional mimics of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in oxygen-transfer reactions have been described. The chloroperoxidase from Caldariomyces fumago (CPO) is the catalyst of choice in sulfoxidation, hydroxylation and epoxidation on account of its high activity and enantioselectivity. Other heme peroxidases were less active by orders of magnitude; protein engineering has resulted in impressive improvements but even the most active mutant was still at least an order of magnitude less active than CPO. The 'oxygen-rebound' mechanisms of oxygen transfer mediated by heme enzymes - as originally conceived - have proved to be untenable. Dual pathway mechanisms, via oxoferryl species that insert oxygen as well as iron hydroperoxide species that insert OH+, have been proposed that accommodate all of the known experimental data.									166	3	0	0	78	0	167			0958-1669	1879-0429		WOS:000165853600007	11102789

Herein, by the assistance of strain and introduction of light and reactant, in-situ formed oxygen defective WO3 film was synthesized, as an effective catalyst for reverse water gas shift reaction with an intense photothermal-synergistic effect. Furthermore, the in-situ single-particle Time-Resolved Photoluminescence (TRPL) and Photoluminescence (PL) spectrum were used to explore the details during the reaction, and prolonged charge carrier lifetime and significantly enhanced Photoluminescence intensities were observed in the in-situ single-particle study. Notably, the production rate of CO for WO3 film is almost 10 times that of powder, which means that WO3 film has an intense photothermal-synergistic effect. As proved by the results of CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and CO2 adsorption, the oxygen vacancies are beneficial to the capture and activation of CO2, boosting the process of the reverse water gas shift. Meanwhile, lattice strain arising from the thermal expansion during the reaction could assist the in-situ formation of oxygen defects, enhance charge separation and regulate the electrical structure. All of this contribute to the synergy effect in photothermal reaction. Our work may provide a novel strategy for reasonable design of catalyst and illuminate the behavior of carriers in single-particle level.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000774904400001

X-ray absorption spectroscopy unequivocally confirmed that the iron single sites were incorporated into the Mo2CTx structure by substituting Mo atoms in the molybdenum carbide lattice with no other detectable Fe-containing phases. Mo2CTx:Fe, the first two-dimensional carbide with isolated iron sites, demonstrates a high catalytic activity and selectivity in the oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide. However, an analysis of the electrode material after the catalytic tests revealed that Mo2CTx:Fe transformed in situ into a graphitic carbon framework with dispersed iron oxyhydroxide (ferrihydrite, Fh) species (Fh/C), which are the actual active species. This experimental observation and the results obtained for the titanium and vanadium 2D carbides challenge previous studies that discuss the activity of the native MXene phases in oxygen electrocatalysis. Our work showcases the role of 2D metal carbides as precursors for active carbon-based (electro)catalysts and, more fundamentally, highlights the intrinsic evolution pathways of MXenes in electrocatalysis.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000643591600027	33789048

Less widely recognised is that erythrocyte Hb belongs to a large family of Hb proteins with members distributed across all three domains of life-bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. This review, aimed chiefly at researchers new to the field, attempts a broad overview of the diversity, and common features, in Hb structure and function. Topics include structural and functional classification of Hbs; principles of O-2 binding affinity and selectivity between O-2/NO/CO and other small ligands; hexacoordinate (containing bis-imidazole coordinated haem) Hbs; bacterial truncated Hbs; flavohaemoglobins; enzymatic reactions of Hbs with bioactive gases, particularly NO, and protection from nitrosative stress; and, sensor Hbs. A final section sketches the evolution of work on the structural basis for allosteric O-2 binding by mammalian RBC Hb, including the development of newer kinetic models. Where possible, reference to historical works is included, in order to provide context for current advances in Hb research.									66	7	2	0	44	0	75			1079-9796	1096-0961		WOS:000430393500003	29126700

However, improving the overall efficiency of water splitting is a challenging issue. Here, we designed Co-Fe nanoparticle coupled nitrogen-enriched porous carbon (CoyFe10-yOx/NPC) nanosheets as highly efficient non-precious-metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nitrogen-enriched porous carbon (NPC) nanosheets were prepared using a Schiff-base network (SNW) as the precursor and the SNW was based on commercially available and inexpensive monomers which were terephthalaldehyde and melamine. The resulting SNW possessed a high nitrogen content, a high surface area and a high density of metalcoordination sites. In addition, when used as the catalyst for the OER, the Co-Fe nanoparticle catalyst containing 30% Co (Co3Fe7Ox/NPC) showed the highest activity, requiring 328 mV over-potential to achieve a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for at least 15 h and a small Tafel slope of 31.4 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH solution, which were comparable even superior to those of many other non-noble metal catalysts. Consequently, the high efficiency and durability make these supported amorphous Co-Fe nanoparticles potentially applicable for improving the performance for electrolysis of water and energy storage applications. More importantly, the support of electrode materials comes from the pyrolysis of porous polymers and this idea offers a new possibility for exploring overall water splitting non-precious-metal catalysts.									77	4	0	0	6	0	77			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000374862600032

The HOR/HER activities were found to be predominantly related to OH adsorption that is related to the surface impurity content. Further, it was found that the foreign metal species on Ir surface could effectively enhance or depress HOR activity depending on their oxophilicity. We found that there is a volcano-shaped dependence of HOR/HER activity on the OH adsorption strength; and trace Fe species or moderate oxophilic Ru atoms on the surface of Ir based catalyst bring the modest OH adsorption and lead to enhanced HOR/HER activity.

J	Ressler, T; Wienold, J; Jentoft, RE; Neisius, T								Bulk structural investigation of the reduction of MoO3 with propene and the oxidation of MoO2 with oxygen								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				210	1			67	83		10.1006/jcat.2002.3659				AUG 15 2002	2002	Reduction of MoO3 in propene and oxidation of MoO2 in oxygen are investigated by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Xray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Temperature-programmed and isothermal experiments (573-773 K) are performed to elucidate the structural evolution of phases present during the reactions and, in addition, to reveal the solid-state kinetics of the processes involved. During the reduction of MoO3 in propene and the oxidation of MoO2, only crystalline MoO3 and MoO2 were detected by in situ XRD. The formation of a "Mo18O52"-type shear structure as intermediate during reduction of MoO3 in propene and during oxidation of MoO2 in oxygen was observed by in situ XAS. The solid-state kinetics of the reduction of MoO3 in propene exhibits a change in the rate-limiting step as a function of both temperature and extent of reduction. The solid-state kinetics of the oxidation of MoO2 is governed by three-dimensional diffusion. A schematic reaction mechanism for the reduction of MoO3 in propene and reoxidation in oxygen is proposed that consists of (i) generation of oxygen vacancies at the (100) or (001) facets by reaction with propene, (ii) vacancy diffusion in the MoO3 bulk, (iii) formation of Mo18O52-type shear structures in the lattice, and (iv) formation and growth of MoO2 nuclei. With respect to a redox mechanism for the partial oxidation of propene on MoO3, three stages are distinguished. (i) at temperatures below similar to600 K the participation of oxygen from the MoO3 bulk is negligible. (ii) At temperatures between similar to600 and similar to700 K oxygen vacancy diffusion in the bulk is sufficient to make a redox mechanism feasible, affording a partially reduced MoO3 under reaction conditions. (iii) At temperatures above similar to700 K sufficiently fast oxygen diffusion in the lattice combined with rapid formation and annihilation of crystallographic-shear planes permits the participation of a considerable amount of the lattice oxygen of MoO3 in the partial oxidation of propene.

Herein, we introduce a double-cation gradient etching technique to manipulate the electronic structure of perovskite LaCoO3. With the gradient dissolution of cations, the surface was reconstructed, and the perovskite/spinel heterostructure V-LCO/Co3O4 (V-LCO refers to LaCoO3 with La and Co vacancies) can be realized. Its surface-electronic-structure is effectively regulated due to the heterogeneous interface effect and abundant vacancies, resulting in a significantly enhanced activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The V-LCO/Co3O4 exhibits low electrochemical activation energy and 2 orders of magnitude higher carrier concentrations (1.36 x 10(21) cm(-3)) compared with LCO (6.03 x 10(19) cm(-3)). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation unveils that the directional reconstruction of surfaceelectronic-structure enables the d-band center of V-LCO/Co3O4 to a moderate position, endowing perfect adsorption strength for oxo groups and thus promoting the electrocatalytic activity.									11	0	0	0	1	0	10			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000709549100034	34553939

However, the low melting temperature and high activity of bismuth based oxides severely limit their wide applications in SOCs. Herein, we successfully synthesized a 40 wt% Er0.4Bi1.6O3 decorated La0.76Sr0.19MnO3+delta (ESB-LSM) electrode via a new gelation method and directly assembled it on a Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) cermet supported YSZ electrolyte cell without the conventional high temperature pre-sintering step. ESB decoration substantially enhances the electrocatalytic activity of the LSM electrode for the oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). A YSZ electrolyte cell with the directly assembled ESB-LSM electrode exhibits a peak power density of 1.62 W cm(-2) at 750 degrees C, significantly higher than 0.48 and 0.88 W cm(-2) obtained on cells with a directly assembled pristine LSM and LSM-YSZ composite electrode, respectively. Most importantly the cells with the directly assembled ESB-LSM oxygen electrodes show excellent stability in SOFC, SOEC and reversible SOC operating modes for over 200 h. The present study demonstrates a significant advancement in the development of bismuth based oxide decorated high performance and stable oxygen electrodes for reversible SOCs.									44	4	0	0	0	0	44			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000403664800022

Bismuth titanates have various complex forms, among which Bi20TiO32 could be an ideal oxygen evolution photocatalyst, but one has been suffering from its metastable structure and the complicate preparation. Herein, pure phase Bi20TiO32 samples were successfully synthesized by a simple sol-gel method followed by calcination of precursors. The effects of chelating agent, source of Bi and Ti precursor's composition have been studied. By combining bismuth nitrate, titanium isopropoxide, and citric acid, highly crystalline Bi20TiO32 was obtained after calcination since citric acid helps the formation of a stable complex in the sol-gel preparation with slow hydrolysis reactions due to highly steric hindrance in titanium isopropoxide. The effect of citric acid to metal ion ratio in this synthesis has been studied and optimized. It was found that only calcinations at 375 degrees C produced a pure phase while others did not. Here we first reported that pure Bi20TiO32 with high crystallinity was obtained with 1:1 ratio of citric acid to metal ions and it showed the highest photocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution under the illumination. The effects of grain size and co-catalyst on Bi20TiO32 photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared samples have been studied. More generally, it suggests the incorporation of bismuth into a simple oxide of wide band gap via the simple sol-gel method as a strategy to design photocatalysts with excellent properties.

At 25 degreesC, both additives depolarise oxygen evolution on the Pb-Co3O4 anode but not on Pb-Ca-Sn or Pb-Sb anodes. The additive TT results in the formation of a smaller amount of PbO2 on the anode compared with that formed in basic electrolyte (BE) or in the presence of BC-2. A slightly larger amount of PbO2 is formed on Pb-Ca-Sn or on Pb-Sb anode in the presence of BC-2 or TT. In the presence of BC-2 or TT, the amount of PbO2 formed on Pb-Co3O4 anode is approximately half that on Pb-Ca-Sn and Pb-Sb anodes. At 45 degreesC, the effect of TT on the Pb-Ca-Sn anode varies during prolonged polarisation. BC-2 depolarises oxygen evolution on Pb-Ca-Sn anodes and contributes to the formation of a larger amount of PbO2 on the anode, whereas for Pb-Co3O4, this reaction is polarised as compared to Pb-Ca-Sn. At 45 degreesC, as well at 25 degreesC, the amount of PbO2 formed on Pb-Co3O4 is approximately half that formed on the Pb-Ca-Sn anode. The corrosion rate of the Pb-Co3O4 anode is lower than the Pb-Ca-Sn anode under these conditions. Both additives modify the structure of the anodic layer on Pb-Co3O4, Pb-Ca-Sn or on Pb-Sb anode.

Utilization of solar photon energy for the uphill water splitting reaction is a promising technology, and therefore many systems using semiconductor photocatalysts and semiconductor photoelectrodes for the reaction producing hydrogen and dioxygen in a 2:1 stoichiometric ratio have been reported. In these systems, molecular catalysts are also considered to be feasible; recently, systems based on molecular catalysts conjugated with semiconductor photosensitizers have been used for photoinduced hydrogen generation by proton reduction. Additionally, there are reports that the so-called Z-scheme (two-step photoexcitation) mechanism realizes the solar-driven uphill reaction by overall water splitting. Although the number of these reports is still small compared to those of all-inorganic systems, the advantages of molecular cocatalysts and its immobilization on a semiconductor are attractive. This Minireview provides a brief overview of approaches and recent research progress toward molecular catalysts immobilized on semiconductor photocatalysts and photoelectrodes for solar-driven hydrogen production with the stoichiometric uphill reaction of hydrogen and oxygen generation.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000471314900004	30963707

Plasma treatment can quickly and efficiently introduce oxygen vacancies on catalyst surfaces. In this work, we used plasma to treat Bi2WO6 ultrathin nanosheets to create more surface oxygen vacancies. Increasing oxygen vacancies on the surface of Bi2WO6 not only increases the catalyst's ability to absorb light, but also greatly promotes the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. In addition, increasing the catalyst specific surface area provides more reaction sites due to plasma etching. In photocatalytic CO2 reduction, Bi2WO6 ultrathin nanosheets with more oxygen vacancies showed excellent activity, and the CO production rate was 40.6 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). Our research provides a simple and fast pathway to improve the CO2 reduction performance of photocatalysts.									43	3	0	0	5	0	43			2052-1553			WOS:000511447700002

The fabricated architectures exhibit remarkably enhanced catalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction far better than the original s-g-C3N4 and GQDs, which is even comparable to those of well-developed graphene and GQD-based catalysts, demonstrating the potential towards energy conversion applications.									193	12	0	0	14	0	201			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000348146600006

Despite this importance, little is known about the evolution of primary particle morphology nor its effect on chemical pathways during synthesis. In this study, operando characterization is combined with atomic-scale and continuum simulations to clarify the relationship between morphology of cathode primary particles and their lithiation during calcination of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC-811). This combined approach reveals a key role for surface oxygen adsorption in facilitating the lithiation reaction by promoting metal diffusion and oxidation, and simultaneously providing surface sites for lithium insertion. Furthermore, oxygen surface termination is shown to increase the activation energy for sintering, leading to smaller primary particle sizes at intermediate temperatures. Smaller particles provide both shorter diffusion lengths for lithium incorporation and increased surface site density for lithium insertion. These insights provide a foundation for more tailored syntheses of cathode materials with optimized performance characteristics.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000768812100001		
J	Wang Qiang; Wang Rui; Xu Haibo								Preparation and Electrocatalytic Properties of Ir0.08Ti0.92O2 and Pt/Ir0.08Ti0.92O2								CHEMICAL JOURNAL OF CHINESE UNIVERSITIES-CHINESE				35	9			1962	1967		10.7503/cjcu20140209				SEP 10 2014	2014	Ir(0.08)Tia(0.92)O(2) nanopowder with low Ir loading was prepared by TiN impregnation-thermal decomposition method, and then Pt/Ira(0.08)Ti(0.92)O(2) electrocatalyst was obtained by microwave assisted hydrothermal synthesis method. X-ray diffractometer (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), energy dispersive spectrometer(EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer(XPS) were used to analysis the morphologies and composition of the products. Ira(0.08)Tia(0.92)O(2) showed to be stick-like nanoparticles with the diameter of 15 nm, and IrO2 and TiO2 formed a solid solution with rutile phase, the diameter of Pt nanoparticles on Ira(0.08)Ti(0.92)O(2) was 5-7 nm. Moreover, Ir/Ti molar ratio in interior support was 0.084:0.916, whereas that on the support surface was 0.296:0.704, indicating the surface accumulation of Ir. Polarization curves and linear sweep voltammetry(LSV) were performed to determine their electrocatalytic properties, compared with those of IrO2 by traditional Adams-fusion method and commercial Pt/C. The results showed that the catalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction(OER) was as follows: Ira(0.08)Ti(0.92)O(2)>Pt/Ir0.08Ti0.92O2>IrO2 (the former two were almost the same). However, catalytic activity of Pt/Iro(0.08)Ti(0. 92)O(2) towards the oxygen reduction reaction(ORR) was lower than that of Pt/C, showing that a further optimization of Pt particle size was required. Therefore, Ir0.08Ti0.92O2 can be used not only as a low-cost and efficient OER catalyst but also as a suitable support material, which promotes Pt/Ir0.08Ti0.92O2 as a promising dual-functional catalyst with more advantage in cost, catalytic property and stability, as well as an excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst in acidic medium.									2	2	0	0	0	0	3			0251-0790			WOS:000343189300018

This work shows the achievement of the solar-driven photo catalytic overall CO2 reduction with H2O to CO and O-2 over a Persian buttercup-like BiOBrxCl1-x solid solution. A CO generation rate of 15.86 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) with the approximate stoichiometric O-2 evolution is yielded on BiOBr0.6Cl0.4 solid solution under simulated solar light irradiation, which was about 7.5 and 10.2 times higher than that of pure BiOCI (2.11 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) and BiOBr (1.55 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)), respectively. The enhanced photoactivity is contributed to the mediate band gap and energy level tuned by the formation of BioBr(x)Cl(1-x) solid solution to facilitate the separation of photogenerated charges. Besides the unique electron structure, the photoinduced oxygen vacancy (O-v) formed on BiOBrxCl1-x solid solution also plays an important role in the CO2 reduction.									108	7	0	0	8	0	110			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000453616800075

Its reaction rate can modify both fluorine nucleosynthesis inside such stars and oxygen and nitrogen isotopic ratios, which allow one to constrain the proposed astrophysical scenarios. Thus, an indirect measurement of the low-energy region of the O-18(p, alpha)N-15 reaction has been performed to access, for the first time, the range of relevance for astrophysical application. In particular, a full, high-accuracy spectroscopic study of the 20 and 90 keV resonances has been performed and the strengths deduced to evaluate the reaction rate and the consequences for astrophysics.									91	0	0	0	0	0	91			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000272790400068

It still is a challenge to realize the effective HER over NiCo-LDHs unless modified with noble metals. In this work, the noble-metal-free core-shell Co(OH)(2)@P-NiCo-LDH hybrid with dodecahedral hierarchical structure is prepared by the sacrificial template method along with subsequent phosphating process, which is available for the electrocatalytic HER. The fabricated Co(Ni)(delta+)-P delta- bonding states on the surface of outer shell NiCo-LDH not only provide the abundant active centers but also reduce interfacial charge transfer resistance to enhance the HER activity. Meanwhile, the unique core-shell dodecahedral structure effectively avoids the agglomeration and restacking of NiCo-LDH nanosheets to improve the electrochemical stability. This work exploits a novel noble-metal-free modification strategy to expand the application of NiCo-LDH in HER. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, it is urgent to develop superior bifunctional oxygen catalysts and robust solid-state electrolytes. Mn-based spinels (MMn2O4) attract great attention due to their high abundance, low toxicity and well-balanced activity-stability performances. However, the Mn-based spinels are generally synthesized at high temperature, which usually causes large particle size, low surface area and insufficient active sites, being detrimental to their oxygen catalytic activities. To solve this issue, we firstly develop a two-step mild-temperature method to synthesize the Mn-based spinels by the evolution from layered birnessite-type MnO2. The optimized Mn-based spinel with the nominal composition of CoMn1.5Ni0.5O4 (CMN-231H) demonstrates the remarkable oxygen catalytic activities with the half-wave potential (E-1/2) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and potential at 10 mA cm(-2) (E-j=10) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of 0.780 V and 1.643 V, respectively, and the bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity of CMN-231H surpasses most reported spinels. Meanwhile, cellulose is introduced into polyacrylamide gel electrolyte to obtain the novel solid-state electrolyte (PAMC), demonstrating high ionic conductivity, water retention capability and excellent tensile property. Combining the CMN-321H and PAMC, the fabricated flexible quasi-solid-state ZABs show high power density, charge-discharge reversibility, cycling stability as well as robustness under severe working conditions. Our work supplies an effective way to synthesize Mn-based spinels under mild conditions and provides a promising approach for the development of quasi-solid-state flexible ZABs with high power density and strong robustness.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000653229500190

Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) are extensively exploited as effective electrocatalysts, but the construction of strong coupling interfaces to improve catalytic performance by simple methods is still a bottleneck. Here, we designed and prepared a novel heterostructure electrocatalyst composed of cobalt-molybdenum (CoMo) alloy particles integrated with CoMoP nanosheets via the method of template-assisted conversion, followed by electrodeposition. Thanks to the strong interfacial coupling and synergistic effect between CoMo alloy particles and CoMoP nanosheets, the prepared CoMo/CoMoP/NF shows outstanding activity with overpotentials of only 29 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 246 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the assembled CoMo/CoMoP || CoMo/CoMoP electrode can attain 10 mA cm(-2) with a low battery voltage of 1.54 V. This study offers a valuable reference to the construction of bimetallic alloy/bimetallic phosphide heterostructure electrocatalysts, which applies to the large-scale application of electrocatalytic energy conversion technology									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000808098800025	35580901

The O-MoS2 QDs were prepared with a one-pot microwave method by hydrazine-mediated oxygen-doping. The synthetic method is straightforward, time-saving, and can be applied in large scale preparation. Ultra-small O-MoS2 QDs with the average size of 5.83 nm and 1-4 layers can be uniformly distributed on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Benefited from the unique structure and the doping effect of oxygen in the MoS2 QDs and the great number of active sites, the O-MoS2 QD hybrid displayed outstanding electrocatalytic performance toward HER. A low overpotential of 76 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and a Tafel slope of 58 mV/dec were obtained in an acidic solution toward HER. Additionally, the resultant O-MoS2 QD hybrid also exhibited excellent stability and durability toward HER, displaying negligible current density loss after 1000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry. The design and synthesis of the electrocatalyst in this work open up a prospective route to prepare active and stable electrocatalysts toward substituting precious metals for hydrogen generation.

The flakes with diameter in the range of 0.5-1.5 mu m and the thickness between 15 and 20 nm were obtained by homogeneous precipitation method with the use of triethanolamine (TEA) and urea. By analyzing the intermediate products, it is suggested that, differently from previous reports, a thermodynamically metastable iron oxyhydroxide and Ni-TEA complex are firstly formed at room temperature. Subsequently, when the mixture is heated to 100 degrees C and the pH increases due to the thermal decomposition of urea, Ni2+ and Fe3+ are slowly released and then recombine, thus leading to formation of pure, highly-crystalline Ni-Fe LDH flakes. This material showed promising results as an electrocatalyst in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) providing an overpotential value of 0.36 V.									35	0	0	0	5	0	35			2045-2322			WOS:000426825900014	29520108

Theoretically revealing the mechanisms of oxygen-induced structure evolution and establishing a framework to distinguish them are vital to improving the operando stability and rational design of metal nanocatalysts. Here, we studied the oxygen-induced disintegration and Ostwald ripening of Ni, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ag nanoparticles on TiO2 (110) using first-principles-based thermodynamic and kinetic simulations. It was found that oxygen promotes Ostwald ripening via the formation of Ag/Ag-O and Pd intermediates on the support and volatile gaseous PtO2 complexes, induces disintegration of Ni nanoparticles to Ni-O complexes, and leads to the formation of copper oxide. These differences in the deactivation pathways can be attributed to the dependence of the ripening activation energies and disintegration free energies on the interaction between metal atoms/complexes and TiO2 (110). Revealed knowledge and corresponding models provide valuable insights into the general mechanisms governing the structural evolution of supported nanocatalysts under reaction conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000800028300027

While function, quantity, and protection of such metal(oxide) nanoparticles have been addressed in the literature of photocatalysis, the stability and transients in the active oxidation-state upon illumination have received relatively little attention. In this Perspective, the latest insights in the active state of frequently applied cocatalysts systems, including Pt, Rh/Cr2O3, or Ni/NiOx, will be presented. While the initial morphology and oxidation state of such nanoparticles is a strong function of the applied preparation procedure, significant changes in these properties can occur during water splitting. We discuss these changes in relation to the nature of the cocatalyst/semiconductor interface.

The one-pot oxidation cascade requires only a minimum of reaction components: resting E. coli cells in aqueous buffered medium (=catalyst), the target substrate and oxygen as environmental friendly oxidant. Conversion of cyclooctane was catalysed with high efficiency (50% yield) and excellent selectivity (> 94%) to cyclooctanone. The reported oxidation cascade represents a novel whole cell system for double oxidation of non-activated alkanes including an integrated cofactor regeneration. Notably, two alcohol dehydrogenases from Lactobacillus brevis and from Rhodococcus erythropolis with opposite cofactor selectivities and one monooxygenase P450 BM3 were produced in a coexpression system in one single host. The system represents the most efficient route with a TTN of up to 24363 being a promising process in terms of sustainability as well.									14	2	0	0	5	0	16			1367-5435	1476-5535		WOS:000387597600002	27771781

By thermogravimetry (TG) experiments, evolution behaviors and properties of thermal oxidation processes at low temperature of a bituminous coal with five microscale particle sizes (L1 215.20 mu m; L2 151.90 mu m; L3 80.22 mu m; L4 43.71 mu m; and L5 19.21 mu m) were investigated. A two-step reaction model was developed by using Coats-Redfern method and pyrolysis kinetics parameters were calculated. Results show that in stage 1 (65.0-160.0 degrees C) segments of water evaporation and gas desorption dominate, while in stage 2 (160.0-320.0 degrees C) segments of generation of coal-oxygen complex and structure oxidation contribute most. Five macro-characteristic temperatures (critical temperature T-1, xerochasy temperature T-2, activity temperature T-3, mass peak temperature T-4, and ignition temperature T-5) move to the low temperature direction with decreasing particle sizes except T-4. Reaction processes during coal-oxygen interactions are proposed. Activation energies decrease as particle sizes reduce during both stage 1 (15.01-32.47 kJ center dot mol(-1)) and stage 2 (64.29-96.34 kJ center dot mol(-1)) since specific surface areas are augmented and more active groups are exposed. This work is expected to better monitoring of temperature thresholds for coal spontaneous combustion processes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1939-2699	1939-2702		WOS:000768673300001

Herein, an etching-assisted synthesis approach was developed to integrate highly active NiFe2O4 nanoparticles with a robust and active NiOOH scaffold directly on commercial stainless steel. A precise selenization strategy was then introduced to achieve selective Se doping of NiFe2O4 to further enhance its intrinsic OER activity while maintaining a three-dimensional NiOOH nanosheet array as a robust scaffold for prompt mass transfer and gas evolution. The resulting NiFe2O4-xSex/NiOOH electrode exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity with low overpotentials of 153 and 259 mV to deliver benchmark current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively. More importantly, the catalyst exhibited remarkable durability at a stable current output of 100 mA cm(-2) for hundreds of hours. These findings may open up opportunities for exploring efficient and robust electrocatalysts for scalable hydrogen production with practical materials.

Ni-Fe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been reported as promising OER electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolytes. Herein, we demonstrate that the introduction of elemental selenium (Se) with an optimized phase composition, i.e., monoclinic (m-) or trigonal (t-) Se, could effectively tailor the OER activity of NiFe-LDH. Compared to t-Se doped NiFe-LDH, the presence of hybrid m/t-Se could effectively tune the electronic states of Ni-O and Fe-O sites, promote the generation of OER-active gamma-NiOOH, and inhibit Fe-migration during the OER process, thus enhancing the OER performance. The optimized Ni0.8Fe0.2-m/t-Se-0.02-LDH catalyst exhibits extraordinarily high OER activity, with an overpotential of 200 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to those of IrO2 and most of the reported Se-based OER catalysts. The Ni0.8Fe0.2-m/t-Se-0.02-LDH catalyst is further implemented as an anode for overall water splitting and demonstrates a low cell voltage of 1.50 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2).									28	0	0	0	4	0	28			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000487944000022	31524918

Herein, 2D Co-Cu-P nanosheets on Ni foam are fabricated by electrodeposition and subsequent phosphorization process. The Co-Cu-P nanosheets are highly interconnected to form an open-structured hierarchical network structure, which endows the product large surface area, efficient mass transportation, and fast gas releasing. In addition, the surface of Co-Cu-P would rapidly convert into hydroxides layer in the earlier oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, which preserves the Co-Cu-P phosphide inside and serves as the real active sites for OER process. Benefiting from the rationally designed open-structured hierarchical network and the synergistic effect from the two kinds of metal cations with high conductivity, the resultant Co-Cu-P bimetal phosphide open-structured network delivers superb OER performance with an overpotential of 240 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline medium, outperforming the performance of the Co-P and Cu3P monometallic phosphide counterpart. This work provides a simple synthesis approach to construct bimetal phosphide with a rationally designed open-structured hierarchical network toward boosting electrocatalytic OER performance.Graphic abstractThe open-structured hierarchical Co-Cu-P/NF network would serve as a robust catalyst for electrochemical water oxidation. The remarkable OER electrocatalytic performance of Co-Cu-P/NF can be mainly attributed to the large surface area, efficient mass transportation and fast gas releasing, as well as the metallic character of Co-Cu-P/NF with a high conductivity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000625630500010

Herein, we reported a cobalt phosphide (Co2P)-loaded reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite catalyst (rGO/Co2P) prepared via the convenient hydrothermal and H-2 reduction methods. The rGO/Co2P catalyst reduced at 800 degrees C (rGO/Co2P-800) shows superior electrocatalytic activities for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in 1.0 M KOH solution, achieving an overpotential of 134 and 378 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the catalyst can not only maintain stability for a long time in alkaline solution but also in acid media because of the protection of the rGO layers. The superior performance of this catalyst is attributed to the synergy between the carbon layer and transition-metal phosphides. The Co2P nanoparticles have a high degree of dispersion, which prevents agglomeration, thereby exposing more active sites. Moreover, rGO protects the exposed metal particles while providing more electroconductivity to the material. This work provides an efficient route for the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts with excellent performance and stability, which provides new ideas toward overall water splitting.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			2470-1343			WOS:000523299700031	32258887

Herein, we demonstrate a templated-engaged strategy for the fabrication of highly open and defect-rich Mn-doped Cu(OH)(2) hexagonal nanorings (denoted as Mn-doped Cu(OH)(2) HNs) by employing Mn(OH)(2) hexagonal nanoplates as a sacrificial template. As a result of the successful doping of Mn into Cu(OH)(2), the as-prepared Mn-doped Cu(OH)(2) HNs possess rich defects and a modified electronic structure, which contribute to the exceptional property as a catalyst for OER electrocatalysis. More importantly, by coupling nickel foam (NF) supported Mn-doped Cu(OH)(2) HNs as the anode electrode, NFs supported Pt/C as cathode electrode, a potential of only 1.62 V is needed to drive the water electrolysis to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), comparable to the commercial IrO2//Pt/C couple.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000498288300049	31652061

The sluggish kinetics of the ORR limits the development of many fuel cells. Design and synthesis of highly efficient nonprecious electrocatalysts are of vital importance for electrochemical reduction of oxygen. Herein, we develop a graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-derived bamboo-like carbon nanotubes/carbon-wrapped Co nanoparticles (BCNT/Co) electrocatalyst by a simple high-temperature pyrolysis and acid-leaching method. The catalytic performance of the as-designed electrocatalyst toward ORR outperforms the commercial Pt/C catalyst in alkaline solution. The onset potential of nonprecious BCNT/Co-800 catalyst was 1.12 V. The half-wave potential was 0.881 V. The result was superior to that of commercial Pt/C (0.827 V vs RHE). The Co nanoparticles, bamboo-like carbon nanotubes, defects, and Co-N-x active sites all result in the remarkable ORR activity, stability, and great methanol tolerance.									62	2	0	0	1	0	62			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000510532000028	31913599

Here, a novel CQDs/E-TiO2 photoanode was designed based on the accurately electrochemical reduction of TiO2 (E-TiO2, Ti4+ + e(-) -> Ti3+) and further modification of oxygen vacancy (O-V)-rich carbon quantum dots (CQDs) for synergistically improving PEC performance. The electrochemical reduction creates moderate O-V in TiO2, which increase the majority carrier density and provide photoinduced charge traps for sharply increasing the bulk charge separation efficiency (eta(bulk)). The CQDs modification dramatically improves the surface charge transfer efficiency (eta(surface)) by serving as oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs), because the abundant O-V in CQDs greatly promote the interfacial OER kinetics. Additionally, the visible light harvesting of TiO2 is significantly improved after CQDs modification. Near-complete bulk charge separation (eta(bulk) = 94.7%) is achieved for E-TiO2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE (V-RHE), which is 4.0 times higher than that of TiO2. The CQDs/E-TiO2 shows the eta(surface) of 56.0% at 0.40 V-RHE,V- which is 7.2 times higher than E-TiO2. Therefore, the CQDs/E-TiO2 exhibits remarkable photocurrent densities of 1.50 mA cm(-2) at 0.60 VRHE and 2.55 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE, which are 27.0 and 10.0 times higher than TiO2, 3.5 and 1.5 times higher than E-TiO2, respectively.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000707126000283

Theoretical calculations of a high-valent manganese-oxo porphyrin complex are also performed to elucidate common characteristic of the active Mn=O bonds in both native OEC and artificial systems. The oxygen site of the high-valent Mn=O is found to be electrophilic in nature, in accord with our previous work, where the SE2, O-1- and O-3-models have been presented for theoretical understanding of complex behaviors of oxygenation reactions by metal-oxo species. The O-1- and O-3-models are applicable to model complexes examined here, since the manganese-oxo bonds exhibit strong biradical character. Possibility of the SE2-like transition structure model for OEC is also discussed on both the theoretical and experimental grounds.

In this work first nickel-silica nanocomposite with a particles size of about 20 nm has been formed by alcogel electrolysis and then employed for catalytic growth of carbon nanostructures by CVD at 650-750 degrees C using alcohol precursor diluted by argon followed by electrocatalytic study towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH solution. The carbon nanotubes of two different diameters, i.e. 10-30 nm and about 100-300 nm are seen at synthesis temperature of 650 degrees C. The larger tubes are replaced by irregular structures and carbon onions at 750 degrees C, with almost negligible nanotubes at the latter temperature. The diameter distribution of onion like carbon is found to be in the range 50-700 nm. Shift from thicker nanotubes to onions may be partly attributable to higher diffusion rates of carbon that result in complete coverage of larger nanoparticles without allowing an open end to continue the growth of a nanotubes. The small radius of curvature and extra-ordinary distortion required for carbon onions has not allowed them to grow on small nanoparticles. Moreover, our synthesized CNTs exhibited overpotentials of 354 mV at current density of 10 mA/cm(2)which was 24 mV lower than revealed for carbon onions under similar conditions.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1380-2224	1573-4854		WOS:000545177400001

In so-called benchmark papers they are compared with respect to their efficiency and activity. In order to relate the different catalyst to each other the definition of well-defined procedures is required. Two different methods are mainly used: Either the normalization with respect to the geometric surface area or to the catalyst loading. Most often only one of these values is available for a sample and the other one cannot be estimated easily. One approach in electrocatalysis is to determine the Helmholtz double layer capacitance (DLC) and deduce the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). The DLC can be obtained from two different methods, either using differential capacitance measurement (DCM) or impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The second value needed for the calculation of the ECSA is the specific capacitance, which is the capacitance for a perfectly flat surface of given catalyst material. Here, we present the determination of the different capacitance values using manganese oxide as the exemplary model for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We determine the capacitance by DCM and EIS to calculate the EC SA using literature values for the specific capacitance. The obtained values are comparable from the two methods, but are much larger than the surface areas obtained by atomic force microscopy. Therefore, we consider the possibility of using the measured AFM area together with the Helmholtz capacitance to determine the specific capacitances for this material class. The comparison of these results with literature values illustrates the actual limits of the ECSA method, which will be discussed in this paper.									66	1	0	0	2	0	67			0942-9352			WOS:000534258100010

The Sabatier principle predicts that catalyst is most active when the intermediate stabilization is moderate, not too strong such that the bound intermediate disrupts the subsequent catalytic cycle, nor too weak such that the surface is ineffective. For decades, researchers have used this concept to rationalize the activity trend of many OER electrocatalysts including RuO2, which is among the state-of-the-art OER catalysts. In this article, we report an experimental assessment of the Sabatier principle by comparing the oxygen electroadsorption energy to the OER electrocatalysis for the first time on RuO2. We find that the OHad and O-ad electroadsorption energies on RuO2(110) depend on pH and obey the scaling relation. However, we did not observe a direct correlation between the OHad and O-ad electroadsorption energies and the OER activity in the comparative analysis that includes both RuO2(110) and IrO2(110). Our result raises a question of whether the Sabatier principle can describe highly active electrocatalysts, where the kinetic aspects may influence the electrocatalysis more strongly than the electroadsorption energy, which captures only the thermodynamics of the intermediates and not yet kinetics.									114	4	0	0	4	0	115			0002-7863			WOS:000454383400041	30463402

Elemental composition, morphology, and crystal structure of this compound were characterized by various analytical techniques including SEM, TEM, ICP, and XRD analyses. Structure refinement and DFT calculation suggests the crystal structure of the resulting Li2CoGeO4 from hydrothermal synthesis is isostructural to Li2ZnGeO4, significantly different from previous reports. Electrochemical studies confirmed Li2CoGeO4 as an active catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In alkaline electrolyte (0.1 M NaOH), rotating disk electrodes made with Li2CoGeO4 as catalyst have a Tafel slope of ca. 67 mV dec(-1) and an overpotential of 330 mV at 50 mu A cm(cat)(-2), about 90 mV less than the electrodes containing another known OER catalyst, Co3O4. Further characterization with cyclic voltammetry, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and elemental analyses revealed the oxidation of Co from 2+ to 3+ during the reaction along with significant surface amorphization and loss of Li and Ge from the catalyst.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000344380000037

In this study, a series of bi-metallic boride catalysts based on Ni and Co were prepared, and their activities were evaluated. The synthesised Co-10Ni-B catalyst exhibited excellent activity for water splitting in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. The overpotential was 330 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), better than previously reported mono-metallic borides and even IrO2. The synergistic effect of Co and Ni was proved by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The facile formation of critical intermediates CoOOH and NiOOH during the catalytic processes and a significant increase in surface area owing to the introduction of a second metal into mono-metallic boride were attributed to the superior catalytic performance of catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. A Co-10Ni-B-sp catalyst with a higher surface area than the Co-10Ni-B catalyst was also synthesised to evaluate the effect of a high surface area on the catalytic activity. A lower overpotential of 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was achieved.									48	4	0	0	1	0	48			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000437761500032	29904771

However, existing sheet systems involve photocatalytic materials with absorption edge wavelengths (lambda(abs)) of approximately 500 nm. Thus, the development of sheet systems based solely on photocatalysts with longer absorption edge wavelengths is essential for obtaining solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency required for practical applications. In this study, we present a photocatalyst sheet system based on Ga-doped La5Ti2Cu0.9Ag0.1S5O7 (Ga-LTCA, lambda(abs) = 710 nm) as the HEP and LaTiO2N (lambda(abs) = 600 nm) loaded with cobalt oxide (CoOx) as the OEP, both embedded in a Au layer by particle transfer (Ga-LTCA/Au/LaTiO2N). Ga-LTCA/Au/LaTiO2N sheets modified with Rh species evolved hydrogen and oxygen simultaneously under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm). The loading of CoOx onto LaTiO2N was found to be essential for successful water splitting, as was the choice of pH values during water splitting. The roles of CoOx and other factors in determining the water splitting activity of the Ga-LTCA/Au/LaTiO2N sheets are described herein, based on the photoelectrochemical properties of LaTiO2N photoanodes.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000445750100022

Different Sn concentration profiles are prepared by alternating atomic layer deposition of Fe2O3 and SnOx. Combined data from spectrophotometry and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy yields the individual process efficiencies for light harvesting, charge separation, and charge transfer. The best performing photoanodes are Sn-doped both on the surface and in the subsurface region and benefit from enhanced charge separation and transfer. Sn-doping throughout the bulk of the hematite photoanode causes segregation at the grain boundaries and hence a lower overall efficiency. Fe2O3 (0001) and (1126) terminations, shown to be dominant by microstructural analysis, are investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The energetics of surface intermediates during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reveal that while Sn-doping decreases the overpotential on the (0001) surface, the Fe2O3 (1126) orientation shows one of the lowest overpotentials reported for hematite so far. Electronic structure calculations demonstrate that Sn-doping on the surface also enhances the charge transfer efficiency by elimination of surface hole trap states (passivation) and that subsurface Sn-doping introduces a gradient of the band edges that reinforces the band bending at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface and thus boosts charge separation.									48	3	0	0	1	0	48			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000456422500005

The parameters of the GA were the catalyst, a cocatalyst capable of using molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant, and ligands that could tune the catalytic system. The GA required running hundreds of reactions to discover and optimize catalyst systems of high fitness, and microfluidics enabled these numerous reactions to be run in parallel. The small scale and volumes of microfluidics offer significant safety benefits. The microfluidic system included methods to form diverse arrays of plugs containing catalysts, introduce gaseous reagents at high pressure, run reactions in parallel, and detect catalyst activity using an in situ indicator system. Platinum(II) was identified as an active catalyst, and iron(II) and the polyoxometalate H5PMo10V2O40 (POM-V2) were identified as active cocatalysts. The Pt/Fe system was further optimized and characterized using NMR experiments. After optimization, turnover numbers of approximately 50 were achieved with approximately equal production of methanol and formic acid. The Pt/Fe system demonstrated the compatibility of iron with the entire catalytic cycle. This approach of GA-guided evolution has the potential to accelerate discovery in catalysis and other areas where exploration of chemical space is essential, including optimization of materials for hydrogen storage and CO2 capture and modifications.									89	0	0	0	15	0	94			0002-7863			WOS:000275660500051	20148558

Morphology and surface structure of the catalysts were studied. Membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) with anion exchange membrane (AEM), comprising para-polybenzimidazole, highly doped with potassium hydroxide, were prepared using these catalysts. The MEA electrochemical performance and catalytic activity toward the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) are investigated in a self-designed electrolysis test cell. The results obtained show low overpotentials for both OER and HER compared to a MEA with Pt catalyst and the same membrane, as well as stable performance in the temperature range up to 80 degrees C.

The doping of Ru and P can effectively optimize the electronic structure and expose more active sites. The unique 3D interconnected nanowires not only ensures the uniform distribution of Ru coupled with NiCoP, but also endows the Ru-NiCoP/NF with the large ECSA, the fast electron transport and the favorable reaction kinetics attributes. Benefiting from the compositional and structural advantages, Ru-NiCoP/NF catalyst exhibits significantly enhanced catalytic activities along with excellent stability, only needing 32.3 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for HER and 233.8 mV at 50 mA cm-2 for OER. In particular, when Ru-NiCoP/NF is employed as both cathode and anode electrodes, a small voltage of 1.50 V is required to reach 30 mA cm-2 for overall water splitting with an impressive stability. This study provides an alternative strategy on the design and development of high performance catalysts for overall water splitting and other energy conversion fields. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Cappa, Christopher/0000-0002-3528-3368			Multi-generation gas-phase oxidation, equilibrium partitioning, and the formation and evolution of secondary organic aerosol								ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS				12	20			9505	9528		10.5194/acp-12-9505-2012				2012	2012	A new model of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation is developed that explicitly takes into account multi-generational oxidation as well as fragmentation of gas-phase compounds, and assumes equilibrium gas-particle partitioning. The model framework requires specification of a limited number of tunable parameters to describe the kinetic evolution of SOA mass, the average oxygen-to-carbon atomic ratio and the mean particle volatility as oxidation proceeds. These parameters describe (1) the relationship between oxygen content and volatility, (2) the probability of fragmentation and (3) the amount of oxygen added per reaction. The time-evolution and absolute value of the simulated SOA mass depends sensitively on all tunable parameters. Of the tunable parameters, the mean O: C is most sensitive to the oxygen/volatility relationship, exhibiting only a weak dependence on the other relationships. The model mean particle O: C produced from a given compound is primarily controlled by the number of carbon atoms comprising the SOA precursor, with some sensitivity to the specified oxygen/volatility relationship. The model is tested against laboratory measurements of time-dependent SOA formation from the photooxidation of alpha-pinene and n-pentadecane and performs well (after tuning). The model can also accurately simulate the carbon-number dependence of aerosol yields previously observed for oxidation of straight-chain alkanes. This model may provide a generalized framework for the interpretation of laboratory SOA formation experiments in which explicit consideration of multiple-generations of products is required, which is true for all photo-oxidation experiments.									87	2	0	0	25	0	88			1680-7316	1680-7324		WOS:000310470400007

It has long been controversial whether this change reflects evolution in the delta O-18 of seawater, or a decrease in ocean temperatures, or greater extents of diagenesis of older strata. Here, we present measurements of the oxygen and "clumped" isotope compositions of Phanerozoic dolomites and compare these data with published oxygen isotope studies of carbonate rocks. We show that the delta O-18 values of dolomites and calcite fossils of similar age overlap one another, suggesting they are controlled by similar processes. Clumped isotope measurements of Cambrian to Pleistocene dolomites imply crystallization temperatures of 15-158 degrees C and parent waters having delta O-18(VSMOW) values from -2 to +12 parts per thousand. These data are consistent with dolomitization through sediment/rock reaction with seawater and diagenetically modified seawater, over timescales of 100 My, and suggest that, like dolomite, temporal variations of the calcite fossil delta O-18 record are largely driven by diagenetic alteration. We find no evidence that Phanerozoic seawater was significantly lower in delta O-18 than preglacial Cenozoic seawater. Thus, the fluxes of oxygen-isotope exchange associated with weathering and hydrothermal alteration reactions have remained stable throughout the Phanerozoic, despite major tectonic, climatic and biologic perturbations. This stability implies that a long-term feedback exists between the global rates of seafloor spreading and weathering. We note that massive dolomites have crystallized in pre-Cenozoic units at temperatures >40 degrees C. Since Cenozoic platforms generally have not reached such conditions, their thermal immaturity could explain their paucity of dolomites.									51	3	0	0	7	0	54			0027-8424			WOS:000436245000052	29891710

Earth-abundant transition metal-based oxide catalysts are highly sought after to replace expensive platinum group metals. Identifying new catalyst formulations and design principles to tune materials' bulk electronic structures and surface energetics for enhanced catalytic activity accelerates the search. Herein, the inherent attributes of mullite-type oxides in catalyzing various oxidation reactions-crystal structure, electronic structure, stability, and catalytic activity-are reviewed. A comprehensive understanding of the nature of active sites, oxidation mechanisms, strategies to enhance the catalytic performance and regeneration of active sites, emerging opportunities in electrocatalysis and sensors, and challenges in computational methodologies is discussed. Finally, a perspective on expanding mullite-type oxides' viability for commercial applications in environmental and sustainable energy production through the integration of advanced synthetic approaches, operando spectroscopic techniques, and high-throughput computational tools is outlined.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2699-9412			WOS:000783855700003

Here, a self-supported stainless steel (SS) nanocone array coated with a layer of nanoparticulate Ni-Fe oxides/(oxy)hydroxides was fabricated by a facile, low-cost, and easily scalable two-step process. The construction of a nanocone array on the surface of an AISI 304 SS plate by acid corrosion greatly enlarged the specific surface area of the substrate, and the subsequent formation of a layer of Ni-Fe oxides/(oxy)hydroxides featuring the NiFe2O4 spinel phase on the nanocone surface by electrodeposition of [Ni(bpy)(3)](2+) significantly enhanced the intrinsic activity and the stability of the SS-based electrode. The as-prepared electrode demonstrated superior activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH, with 232 and 280 mV overpotentials to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm(geo)(-2) current densities, respectively. The high activity of the electrode was maintained over 340 h of chronopotentiometric test at 20 mA cm(geo)(-2), and the electrode also showed good stability over 100 h of electrolysis at high current density (200 mA cm(-2)). More important for practical application, the used SS-based electrode can be easily regenerated with the original OER activity. The superior activity of this SS-based electrode stems from synergistic combination of high conductivity of the SS substrate, a large electrochemically active surface area of the nanocone array, and a uniformly coated nanoparticulate Ni Fe oxide/(oxy)hydroxide layer with an optimal Ni/Fe ratio.									48	5	0	0	2	0	49			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000427910800043	29446610

Herein, we develop a Fe/N co-doped hierarchically structured porous carbon (Fe/N/C-DT) by the dual-templating approach, involving the incorporation of ferrocenecarboxaldehyde (Fc-CHO) into the polyimide, followed by carbonization at 900 degrees C and etching. A steric hindrance offered by the ferrocene and the porosity of the obtained nanostructure prevent the aggregation of Fe atoms, resulting in the maximization of catalytic efficiency of iron-based sites. FeCl2/N/C-DT and FeSO4/N/C-DT using FeCl2 and FeSO4 as iron sources, respectively, are prepared for comparison, to further confirm the potential positive effect of Fc-CHO and explore the synergistic effect of the pentagon defects and Fe-N-4 on the catalytic performance in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The prepared Fe/N/C-DT exhibits outstanding electrochemical activity toward ORR (E-1/2 = 0.902 V vs RHE) and impressive OER activity (E-j=10 = 1.66 V) in alkaline conditions.

In the reaction, it is generally believed that CO2 is converted into organic molecules by photogenerated electrons and protons that result from photo-oxidation of H2O. In this work, we investigate the possibility that H2O, without being oxidized, directly donates protons to CO2 and other intermediates adsorbed at the oxygen vacancy on the anatase TiO2(101) surface. We found that this can greatly lower the barriers (by about 0.3 eV) for the hydrogenation of CO2, CO, H2CO, and CH3O because less energy is required to displace these adsorbates to accept the proton (in H2O). The OH- group produced in these reactions can recombine with a surface-adsorbed proton to form a new H2O molecule, making H2O a shuttling center of the adsorbed protons, or it can take part in the oxygen evolution reaction with a lower barrier. The results suggest that H2O can play multiple roles in artificial photosynthesis and the reduction and oxidation parts of the reaction may have synergistic effects.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000458348600035

Herein, three-dimensional P-doped NiMoO4 (NiMoP) parallel nanosheets anchored on cobalt carbonate hydroxide (CoCH) nanowire arrays were fabricated. The phosphorization process could also introduce oxygen vacancies on the nanosheet surface. The parallel nanosheets with quasi one-dimensional channels could facilitate electrolyte/gas mass transfer and enlarge the exposed surface, thus avoiding the "dead volume" inside the hierarchical architecture. The phosphate dopant and oxygen vacancy-rich surface could increase the intrinsic electron conductivity and create sufficient active defects. Therefore, the NiMoP@CoCH/CC electrode achieved high areal capacitance (4.00 F cm(-2) at 1 mA cm(-2)), superior rate capability (62.5% capacitance retention from 1 to 50 mA cm(-2)) and excellent stability (98.75% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles) in a three-electrode system.

The cheapness of urea and the excellent carbon to nitrogen ratio remove the obstacles ahead of the development of MoP-NC composites.

However, the low initial coulombic efficiency, poor rate performance, and structural degradation have limited their practical applications. Herein, a facile strategy is reported to improve electrochemical kinetics and structural stability by a one-step treatment with thiourea at a moderate temperature. The decomposition reaction integrated nitrogen doped carbon coating, oxygen vacancies, and a built-in S-doping spinel-like/rock-salt structure on surfaces. The built-in surface reconstruction layer with lower TM-O hybridization and covalency suppresses the irreversible oxygen evolution while promoting cation redox. Surface reconstruction layer satisfies the essential requirements of efficient diffusion kinetics, and inhibits corrosion of the electrolyte and the dissolution of transition metal ions. As a result, the initial coulombic efficiency, rate performance, and structural degradation are greatly improved. After 100 cycles at 0.1C, the treated materials exhibit a capacity retention of 96.7% (vs. 86.0% for the pristine sample) with excellent structural stability. This study sheds some new light on designing high-performance Li-rich layered oxide cathode materials by the incorporation of surface reconstitution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000853080500001

Inspired by rapid development of metal organic framework (MOF)-derived materials in various applications, a novel MOF-derived 1D-on-2D hierarchical structure is developed by a facile wet chemical method and pyrolysis process. Specifically, the hierarchical structure (Co-NCS@CNT) consists of 2D carbon framework covered with copious N-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with highly-dispersed cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated within their tips. Abundant Co-N-C active sites, large specific surface area (396 m(2) g(-1)), rapid mass/electron transport and high electrical conductivity enable Co-NCS@CNT with a high ORR half-wave potential of 0.86 V and low OER overpotential of 360 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, compared with commercial Pt/C-Ir/C catalysts, primary and rechargeable Zn-air batteries based on Co-NCS@CNT exhibit a higher peak power density (90 mW cm(-2)), specific capacity (798 mAh g(-1)), open circuit potential (1.42 V) and better stability. Therefore, this work provides a facile, low cost and environmental-friendly strategy to rational design and synthesize micro-structures for bifunctional catalyst materials for zinc-air batteries and other devices.

However, the high polarization and poor cycling stability have hampered their practical applications that heavily depend on the dual-functional cathodes with abundant highly active sites to promote the mass/electron transfer for efficient oxygen reduction and evolution. Herein, a space-confined pyrolysis strategy is proposed by coating a Co-based metal-organic framework composite precursor (ZIF-8 @ZIF-67) with an inorganic SiO2 layer, which efficiently inhibits the precursor loss and nanostructure collapse during the high-temperature carbonization and yields a high-performance carbon nanotube-wrapped Co3O4 electrocatalyst. Thereinto, the Co within the precursor can act as the self-catalyst for the growth of abundant carbon nanotubes, which not only generates more catalytic sites but also improves the electronic conductivity. Systematic investigations reveal that the resultant Co3O4 wrapped with carbon nanotubes (Co3O4/CNTs) possesses significantly improved bifunctional oxygen reduction and evolution activity when compared with the Co3O4 counterpart derived from the traditional direct pyrolysis, which is benefited from the large content of active sites and strong mass/electron transfer capabilities to allow the exceptional rate performance and cycling stability of LOBs. The space-confined pyrolysis strategy described herein may help to exploit the highly efficient electrocatalysts. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

These two reactions play a crucial role in energy storage and energy conversion devices. An important feature of perovskite catalyst is their ability to be tuned, as tuning can positively affect both reactivity and stability. In this study, Density Functional Theory (DFT) has been utilized to calculate both the equilibrium phase stability and the overpotentials (reactivity performance indicator of the catalysts) of La1-xSrxMnO3 (LSM) structures with different stoichiometry by introducing Mn and O vacancies for both the OER/ORR reactions. The electronic structures reveal that combined Mn and O vacancies can lead to higher catalytic activity for both OER and ORR due to the optimum filling of antibonding orbital electrons. Moreover, both O p-band centers and equilibrium phase stability plots show that LSM structures can be stable at normal OER/ORR operating conditions in an alkali medium.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000775602800001

Accordingly, through the tri-octylphosphine (TOP)-based CO-assisted solvothermal method and the small-amount Pt2+ galvanic replacement, highly uniform Pd nanotetrahedrons (NTs) with Pt-doped surfaces are synthesized and supported onto carbon black. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that, owing to the Pt surface-doped (SD) nanostructure, the conformal formation of surface Pt {111} facets, as well as the strain and electronic effects induced by the Pd-Pt alloy structure, Pd/Pt-SD NTs/C exhibits much better electrocatalytic performance than Pd NTs/C, commercial Pd/C, and Pt/C toward both oxygen reduction and formic acid oxidation reactions, showing greatly improved metal utilization and area/mass-specific activity. This study develops a high-performance bifunctional electrocatalyst, and firstly introduces TOP as the easy-removable surface-energy adjuster for the Pd shape-controlled synthesis, which may be further expanded to other metals and shapes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000864082500004

However, the serious photocorrosion property limits its application in photocatalysis. Through modification TiO2 thin film over CdS surface, TiO2/CdS photocatalyst exhibited an obviously enhanced photocatalytic stability. The H2 evolution rate (3.074 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) of modified Pt-TiO2/CdS under visible light toward overall water splitting was almost 6 times higher than that of CdS sample (0.534 pimol h(-1) g(-1)). The application of artificial gill in photocatalytic overall water splitting system removed the newly formed oxygen from catalyst surface mainly inhibiting the hydrogen and oxygen back recombination to water and preventing the oxygen led oxidation or photocorrosion. By these two strategies, we fulfilled visible light induced overall water splitting in CdS dispersion and achieved satisfied stability during reaction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The performances of the IrOx/W-TiO2 catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are measured in half-cells and single-cells and compared with unsupported IrOx and commercial IrO2. In half-cell tests, IrOx/W-TiO2 displays an improved Ir mass activity compared with the unsupported IrOx, demonstrating a positive effect of the support material. In single-cell tests, the performance of IrOx/W-TiO2 also exceeds both the unsupported and commercial IrO2. The cell voltage reaches 1.602V at 1 A cm(-2) (Nafion 212) with total noble metal loading less than 0.2 mg cm(-2), suggesting that significant Ir reductions are possible by using IrOx/W-TiO2 without sacrificing the cell performance. It also shows improved durability than other unsupported catalysts at reduced Ir loading. In-situ electrochemical test reveals that the performance is associated with the enhanced conductivity of the catalyst layer. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the simple solid-state method is employed for coupling Ni (electron donors) with lower-Fermi-level MoO2 or WOx (electron acceptors) into donoracceptor ensembles with well-designed interfaces as robust electrocatalysts for OER. The resulting Ni/MoO2 and Ni/WOx electrocatalysts exhibit smaller overpotentials of 287 and 333 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) as well as smaller Tafel slopes of 51 and 65 mV/ dec, respectively, with respect to the single Ni, MoO2, WOx, and even the benchmark RuO2 in 1 M KOH. Specially, on account of a higher Fermi level of Ni in comparison with MoO2 and WOx, their strong electronic interaction results in directional interfacial electron transfer and increases the hole density over Ni, dramatically enriching the population of high-valence Ni3+ active sites and decreasing the Fermi level of Ni. The existence of Ni3+ can strengthen the chemisorption of OH-, and the downshift of the Ni Fermi level can significantly expedite migration of electrons toward the surface of catalysts during OER, thus synergistically boosting the OER catalytic performance. Furthermore, the inner Ni/MoO2 and Ni/WOx heterostructures and the electrochemically induced surface layers of oxides/hydroxides collectively boost the OER kinetics. This study highlights the importance of designing highly efficient OER electrocatalysts with high-valence active species (Ni3+) and better matched energy levels induced by the work function difference through interfacial engineering.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000643578300033	33822584

Here, we report for the first time that a series of metallic binary alloyed superconductors (MgB2, AlB2, NbB2, and NbSe2) can be used as a photoanode and a cathode in a photocatalyst composite for both hydrogen production and water oxidation reactions. It was found that the highly active ion binary metal-based photocatalyst can be used as a low-cost alternative to Pt for water photolysis. The metallic binary alloyed superconductors exhibit high activity toward both the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions in pure distil water and seawater. The combination of the two such photoanode and cathode yields a water splitting photocurrent density of around 1mA/cm\(2), corresponding to a solar-to-photocurrent efficiency of 34%. The strong correlation between the superconductive temperature and the photocatalytic water splitting effectivity for investigated diborides has been revealed.

In this report, we synthesize self-assembled microspheres by orthorhombic CoSe2 nanorods along with the Ni and/or Fe doped counterparts, and systematically investigate their electrocatalytic performance. The results show that, although either Ni-doping or Fe-doping can significantly enhance the catalytic activity of CoSe2, the ways they promote catalytic activity are different. The Tafel analysis demonstrates that Fe incorporation leads to a kinetics change in the OER while Ni incorporation has little effect. Based on the electrochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations, Ni-doping maintains Co active sites and does not alter the OER mechanism, but decreases the energy barrier of the rate-limiting step by modifying Co active sites. In contrast, Fe-doping transforms the active sites from Co to Fe, and the rate-limiting step changes to the O-OH formation stage, thus affording faster reaction kinetics. These findings are further confirmed by more Ni-Fe co-doped CoSe2 with various content of Ni and Fe. Specifically, under the optimal experimental conditions, Ni-Fe co-doped CoSe2 (Ni0.04Fe0.16Co0.8Se2) exhibits a remarkable OER activity with an overpotential of similar to 230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1).

We can then perform liquid-phase synthesis under vacuum at 300-400 degrees C. This strategy yields FeSi, Ni2Si, and Fe-doped Ni2Si nanocrystals, which exhibit high electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction with an overpotential of 337 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH for Ni2Si doped with optimal iron content. We report high stability over 85 hours. Post mortem studies reveal a core-shell-shell nanostructure, where the core remains crystalline Ni2-xFexSi enabling charge percolation. The outer shell of nanocrystalline Ni1-xFexOOH acts as the electrocatalytic species. The amorphous oxide intermediate layer is specific of silicides and passivates the core against further silicon leaching. These nanostructures produced in situ provide a robust, efficient, and low-cost catalyst for water oxidation.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000731999000001

In this work, molybdenum-doped cobalt iron layered double hydroxide (CoFeMo LDH) nanorods are in situ grown on nickel foam (NF) for the first time using a typical and feasible hydrothermal approach. When the CoFeMo LDH/NF sample acts as an electrocatalyst, it presents superior OER performance, requiring small overpotentials of only 240 and 350 mV at 100 and 500 mA cm(-2) with a low Tafel slope of 82.8 mV dec(-1) in an alkaline medium. Additionally, the combination of Mo doping and CoFe LDH results in the enhanced conductivity of the material. The density functional theory calculation and experimental results prove that the electronic structure tailoring, abundant active sites and the existence of crystalline-amorphous phase boundaries can result in the high catalytic activity of the material. This work presents a novel and feasible approach to design highly efficient and robust catalysts based on advanced LDH-based materials for OER electrocatalysis.C									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000589506800027	33140782

Thus, a well-defined pseudocapacitance could be a great supplement to boost OER. Herein, a highly pseudocapacitive Ni-Fe-Co hydroxides/N-doped carbon nanoplates (NiCoFe-NC)-based electrocatalyst is synthesized using a facile one-pot solvothermal approach. The NiCoFe-NC has a great pseudocapacitive performance with 1849 F g(-1) specific capacitance and 31.5 Wh kg(-1) energy density. This material also exhibits an excellent OER catalytic activity comparable to the benchmark RuO2 catalysts (an initiating overpotential of 160 mV and delivering 10 mA cm(-2) current density at 250 mV, with a Tafel slope of 31 mV dec(-1)). The catalytic performance of the optimized NiCoFe-NC catalyst could keep 24 h. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electrochemically active surface area, and other physicochemical and electrochemical analyses reveal that its great OER catalytic activity is ascribed to the Ni-Co hydroxides with modular 2-Dimensional layered structure, the synergistic interactions among the Fe(III) species and Ni, Co metal centers, and the improved hydrophily endowed by the incorporation of N-doped carbon hydrogel. This work might provide a useful and general strategy to design and synthesize high-performance metal (hydr)oxides OER electrocatalysts.									49	3	0	0	3	0	49			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000442501500017	30063288

Among all the oxygen carriers available, CaSO4 has gained great attention as a promising oxygen carrier (OC) in CLC due to its high oxygen capacity and low price. But further application of CaSO4 OC also suffers the problems of low reactivity and even deactivation due to the sulfur loss via the side reactions of CaSO4, which should be well addressed. In this research, the CaSO4-CoO mixed OC was prepared firstly, and experiments based on thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) were conducted to evaluate the reaction characteristics and evolution of the gaseous products during the reaction of the prepared CaSO4-CoO mixed OC with lignite (abbreviated as YN). Both the higher reaction rate of the prepared mixed OC with YN coal and the elevated CO2 concentration fully reflected the enhanced reactivity of the prepared mixed OC for YN coal conversion. Furthermore, the micromorphology of the solid reaction products was analyzed by the field emission scanning electron microscopy spectrometry (FESEM). Good sintering resistance of the prepared CaSO4-CoO mixed OC during its reaction with YN was verified, which was ascribed to the temporary inert support role played by the CaSO4 substrate. In order to further study the desulfurization ability of CoO in the mixed OC, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and thermodynamic simulation were used for in-depth analysis. The gaseous sulfur species released by the CaSO4 side reactions were mainly fixed as solid CoS, Co9S8 and CaS, with the total content higher than 99.8%. And the sulfided OC could be completely regenerated to its original state at the oxidation stage according to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) result. Overall, the prepared CaSO4-CoO mixed OC not only has the enhanced reactivity and good sintering resistance, but also owns the potential to control sulfur released from the CaSO4 side reactions, which has broad application prospect to simultaneously achieve decarbonization and desulfurization in the CLC process.

J	Rodriguez-Perez, Ismael A.; Zhang, Lu; Leonard, Daniel P.; Ji, Xiulei								Aqueous anion insertion into a hydrocarbon cathode via a water-in-salt electrolyte								ELECTROCHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS				109						106599	10.1016/j.elecom.2019.106599				DEC 2019	2019	We report coronene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), exhibits reversible oxidative anion insertion properties in a LiTFSI based water-in-salt electrolyte. The coronene electrode delivers a reversible capacity of similar to 65 mAh g(-1) with the first-cycle Coulombic efficiency of similar to 73%. The results demonstrate that the high concentrations of LiTFSI lower the anion-insertion potential in coronene, which allows to reveal the capacity below the onset of oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, evidence points to the polymerization of the coronene cathode surface, which contributes to the reversible anion-storage in coronene as well. Ex situ XRD, FTIR, and SEM are carried out to reveal the structural evolution of the coronene electrode and storage mechanism of the TFSI- anions. FTIR studies reveal that upon anion insertion the interactions between the TFSI- ion and coronene molecules resemble that of covalent bonding.									16	1	0	0	2	0	16			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000504039300016

The Ni doping affords more electroactive sites and enhanced conductivity, and the mesoporous structure provides increased surface exposure, which may improve ion/electron transport and reduce charge transfer resistance. The NW arrays exhibit a high ORR activity with a four-electron transfer reaction in alkaline media, a half-wave potential of 0.86 V vs. RHE and a superior stability when compared to the commercial Pt (20 wt%)/C catalyst. Our results suggest that themesoporous Ni-doped Co3O4 NW arrays could be a promising ORR catalyst for fuel cells and metal-air batteries.									49	4	0	0	2	0	51			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000360490600006		
J	CALE, TS; RAUPP, GB; GANDY, TH								BALLISTIC TRANSPORT-REACTION PREDICTION OF FILM CONFORMALITY IN TETRAETHOXYSILANE O2 PLASMA ENHANCED DEPOSITION OF SILICON DIOXIDE								JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY A				10	4			1128	1134		10.1116/1.578214				JUL-AUG 1992	1992	EVOLVE, a low pressure deposition process simulator based on a fundamental model for free molecular transport and heterogeneous surface reactions in features, is used to predict the evolution of silicon dioxide film profiles during plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition from mixtures of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and oxygen. The constitutive relationships required by EVOLVE are supplied by simple models for the plasma, the plasma sheath and the surface chemistry. The intrinsic kinetic model used in the simulations involves film growth by oxidative attack on adsorbed TEOS and/or TEOS fragments by both oxygen ions and oxygen atoms. Recombination of oxygen atoms on the surface of the growing film competes with TEOS oxidation by atoms. The plasma models are used to predict the fluxes of oxygen ions and oxygen atoms to the surface. The fluxes of all neutral species from the source and from all surfaces are assumed to obey cosine distribution functions. Oxygen ions are assumed to follow an exponential distribution; the standard deviation of the distribution is adjusted to match predicted film profiles with experimentally determined profiles. This combination of an almost directional component and an almost isotropic component allows the prediction of the experimental trends in deposition rate and film conformality with operating conditions. The constitutive models are used by EVOLVE to predict film profiles as a function of temperature, within their window of validity, for deposition in ideal rectangular trenches with an aspect ratio of 2. Film conformality decreases as temperature increases, even though deposition rate actually decreases. Film conformality decreases with increasing pressure and increases with increasing power. All of these predicted trends in conformality agree with our experimental results.									25	0	0	0	0	0	30			0734-2101	1520-8559		WOS:A1992JE68100101

However, the catalytic activity of pristine MoS2 is still far from what is expected. Herein, we rationally synthesize ultrathin Ni3S2/MoS2 heterostructured nanosheets for a direct 4-electron transfer ORR. A half-wave potential of 0.885V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) is achieved in 0.1 M KOH, which is 22 mV more positive than that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. The abundant heterointerfaces in Ni3S2/MoS2 not only provide numerous highly active Mo edges/Mo-Ni-S sites and accelerate charge transport but also enable the binding of more oxygen-containing intermediates. This work is expected to inspire the design of advanced MoS2-based materials for diverse applications.									42	3	0	0	1	0	42			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000465152700009

The evolution of atomic density during the afterglow is a sum of two exponential decays. The recombination probability at the pyrex wall of the discharge tube is deduced from the fastest decay. The so obtained value is gamma = (2.4 +/- 1.1) x 10(-3).

However, the construction of nanowire array structure generally requires a complex process. Herein, we report a facile and effective approach in situ to generate the three-dimensional (3D) nanowire arrays of copper oxide/cuprous oxide (CuO/Cu2O) for enhanced OER. The resulting typical sample presents an excellent electrocatalytic OER performance with a low overpotential (246 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability, which may be attributed to the characteristics of nanowire array, mesoporous structures and high surface area for CuO/Cu2O composite as follows. The nanowire array and mesoporous structures are beneficial for the diffusion and transport of electrons and reactants, and the high surface area has the potential to provide more active sites in improving the OER activity. This research provides a worthy inspiration for preparation of CuO/Cu2O electrocatalyst with nanowire array structure by in situ conversion route. (C) 2020 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

In this work, for the first time, we have successfully generated coordinatively unsaturated metal sites (CUMSs) in phytic acid-Co2+ (Phy-Co2+) based metal-organic complexes by engineering the coordination geometry with room-temperature plasma technology. The CUMSs can serve as active centers to catalyze the OER. The electron spin resonance and X-ray absorption spectra provide direct evidence that the coordination geometry is obviously modified with many CUMSs by the plasma treatment. The plasma treated Phy-Co2+ (P-Phy-Co2+) only requires an overpotential of 306 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) on glassy carbon electrodes. When we expand this strategy to a CoFe bimetallic system, it only needs an overpotential of 265 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 36.51 mV dec(-1). P-Phy-Co2+ is superior to the state-of-the-art. Our findings not only provide alternative excellent OER electrocatalysts, but also introduce a promising principle to design advanced electrocatalysts by creating more CUMSs.									58	1	0	0	3	0	58			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000422949700005

The reaction of 1 with OH- produces a Co-II-nitrito complex {3, (Co-II-NO2-)} and hydrogen gas (H-2), via the formation of a putative N-bound Co-nitrous acid intermediate (2, {Co-NOOH}(+)). The homolytic cleavage of the O-H bond of proposed [Co-NOOH](+) releases H(2)via a presumed Co-III-H intermediate. In another reaction, 1 generates Co-II-NO2- when reacted with O(2-)via an expected Co-I-nitro (4) intermediate. However, complex 1 is found to be unreactive towards H2O. Mechanistic investigations using N-15-labeled-(NO)-N-15 and H-2-labeled-(NaOH)-H-2 (NaOD) evidently revealed that the N-atom in Co-II-NO2- and the H-atom in H-2 gas are derived from the nitrosyl ligand and OH- moiety, respectively.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000536688300019	34122960

The evolution of dissolved oxygen was found to be similar in all bottles, whereas ascorbic acid degradation was related to the oxygen transfer with higher losses in standard PET (53%) against active PET (31%). Moreover, when juice was exposed to high intensity light, a fold faster degradation of ascorbic acid was observed compared to total darkness. Depending also on the light intensity and regardless of the package permeability, changes in the aromatic profile of the juice were observed due to the degradation of limonene and the formation of a-terpineol, an off-flavour. A mechanistic model was developed to predict the shelf life of orange juice. This model, coupling O-2 transfer and ascorbic acid oxidation reaction in the bottled juice, confirmed that oxygen permeation through packaging material could not be neglected. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Electrocatalysts are essential to lower the overpotential of the HER and, thus, the overall energy cost of water electrolysis. The search for high performance HER catalysts has been facilitated by coupling experiments with first principles calculation, e.g., density functional theory (DFT). This article will first review the factors determining the performance of HER electrocatalysts. Then, we will discuss the power of coupling experiments with DFT in obtaining insights into the fundamentals of the HER, including explaining experimental results and revealing reaction mechanisms, and facilitating the development of new HER electrocatalysts. The last section of this review focuses on the limitations and progress of coupling experiments with DFT from three perspectives: experimental measurements, characterization and DFT simulation. Finally, we share some opinions about how to better couple experiments with DFT.									15	1	0	0	1	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000536095500001

GO photocatalysts derived from the modified Hummer's method can endow tunable optical and electronic properties by varying the oxidation level into three increasing degrees GO-0.33, GO-0.47 and GO-0.53. Absorption spectroscopy revealed the increasing band gap of GO with respect to increasing oxygen contents and XRD, Raman and AFM studies revealed transformation in properties with increasing degree of oxygenated graphene. As opposed to graphite or graphene which is not photoresponsive, all GO samples exhibited photocatalytic activity towards H-2 generation in sacrificial systems containing 0.1 M Na2S/Na2SO3. Among the studied samples, GO with intermediate O/C ratio of 0.47 (GO-0.47) exhibited the highest H-2 photoactivity of 1104.3 mu molg(-1)h(-1) after of light irradiation, owing to the presence of optimal oxygen loading content in GO. The study reveals that mere chemical modification by oxygen groups on the graphene can confer photocatalytic properties whose activity is further adjustable by modification in the oxygen level.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000438466000011

Herein, a simple method was presented to synthesize a self-supported catalyst using nickel foam (NF) filled with nanoscale Co3O4 (Co3O4/NF) as a hierarchical porous support. A NiCoP alloy was deposited on the Co3O4/NF in the form of profiling growth by electroless plating (NiCoP@Co3O4/NF). And then, the NiCoP@Co3O4/NF electrodes were phosphorylated. The profile-grown NiCoP alloy transformed into a twodimensional (2D) flake-like Co-doped NixPy, forming a self-supported electrocatalyst (Co-NixPy@Co3O4/NF). The Co-NixPy@Co3O4/NF electrode exhibited a large surface area, excellent conductivity, and synergy between metal atoms. This electrode also possessed low overpotentials of 72 and 120 mV to drive the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions at 10 mA cm-2. For overall water splitting, the self-supported Co-NixPy@Co3O4/NF electrode only required a low voltage of 1.47 V to reach the current densities of 20 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH with long-term stability for 36 h. This work represented an achievement the exploration of a new bifunctional of transition metal phosphides with high performances in water splitting.									14	0	0	0	1	0	13			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000672571300002

X-Rays Diffraction characterization showed that single perovskite phases were formed. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy showed that changing the type of B-site metal ion affected the morphology of the prepared perovskites. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy confirmed the formation of orthorhombic phase laCrO(3) and of the rhombohedral phases of LaNiO3, LaMnO3, and LaCoO3. Results were compared with LaFeO3 and the order of the electrocatalytic activity was found to be LaNiO3 > LaFeO3 > LaMnO3. This trend agrees with the calculated activation energy values, 11.38, 20.13, and 22.01 kJ mol(-1) for LaBO3 (B = Ni, Fe and Mn), respectively and is explained based on molecular orbital principles. LaCrO3 and LaCoO3 showed no catalytic activity toward OER due to the dissolution of LaCrO3 and the formation of a passive layer of Co3O4 when tested in HClO4.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization revealed the morphology evolution from ramdom nanoparticles to micro-pyramids with well defined facets. These CoS2 pyramids were applied as electrocatalysts for hydorgen evolution reaction (HER) and showed very different acidic HER performance. The sample prepared at 15 h reaction time showed the best performance with an onset overpotential as low as 81 mV and a Tafel slope of similar to-72 mV/dec. The activity was kept almost 89% even after working for 30,000 seconds. Further study showed that these CoS2 pyramids also functioned well in neutral (1.0 M potassium phosphate buffer solution, pH = 7.00) and alkaline (1.0 M KOH solution, pH = 13.57) conditions. The cubic cattierite-type CoS2 can work as a novel HER electrocatalyst over the wide pH range from 0 to 14, combined with its easy-synthesis, low-cost and high stability, which can potentially serve as a ready-to-go HER catalyst for practical utilization.

Magnetite-based electrocatalyst, which is stable in natural environment, has been widely considered as one of the most promising candidates. However, its electrocatalytic performance is still unsatisfactory because it has the characteristics of large resistance and large energy barriers to form intermediate species during water oxidation. In this report, we demonstrate a convenient method to synthesize Fe3O4/FeS2 NP catalyst from MIL-101(Fe) for oxygen evolution reaction and zinc-air batteries. The Fe3O4/FeS2 NP catalyst shows outstanding activity with lower overpotential of 265 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is better than or comparable to the recently reported Fe-based or Co-based catalysts. Systematic research reveals that thus enhancement can be ascribed to the increase of electrochemically active surface areas and the decrease of bonding energy of intermediates. Based on thus novel Fe3O4/FeS2 NP electrodes, the as-prepared zinc-air batteries can achieve specific capacity of around 560 mAh g(Zn)(-1) and impressive cyclic stability. It is believed that these findings would help us to develop high-performance and sustainable electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000627867500001

Efficient electrocatalyst with high activity and selectivity are of great importance to achieve ORR with four-electron reaction pathway. Targeting robust and cost-effective alternatives to noble metal electrocatalysts, we skillfully fabricated nitrogen doped carbon supported cobalt phosphide (N-C@CoP) nanorod arrays as an earth abundant material for catalyzing ORR. The obtained N-C@CoP composite with relatively high surface area and favorable mesoporous features exhibits intriguing ORR catalytic performances in alkaline conditions due to ease mass diffusion, fast charge transport, and abundance of electroactive sites as a result of doped nitrogen moieties. In addition, the composite catalyst exhibits remarkable durability through an 80,000 s test compared to benchmark Pt catalyst, demonstrating excellent structure stability. The enhanced ORR performances of N-C@CoP catalyst suggest it as a potential non-Pt containing electrocatalyst for efficient ORR.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000424309900014

They offer quite a number of advantages compared to their flooded counterparts. There are, however, some limitations which should be noted. Water loss, for example, is an aging factor that cannot be compensated for by refilling. Even when a perfect internal-oxygen cycle is established, a certain water loss remains because of the unavoidable secondary reactions hydrogen evolution and grid corrosion. The design of the battery and the operating conditions must aim to minimize this water loss. Beyond that, the rates of hydrogen evolution and grid corrosion have to be in a certain balance, because the polarization of the positive and negative electrodes is determined by this balance. If it is disturbed by a too high hydrogen evolution, it may happen that the negative electrode gradually will be discharged, even while the cell is floated at the correct voltage. Past experience has shown that such a balance not always can be achieved. Then the insertion of a catalyst is an effective remedy to stabilize the polarization of the negative electrode.					3rd International Telecommunication Energy Special Conference3rd International Telecommunication Energy Special Conference	MAY 07-10, 2000MAY 07-10, 2000	Deutsch Telekom; DeTeImmobilien; SIEMENS; EXIDE; Gertek; HAWKER Energy Storage; IEEE; Ntelec; KPN Telecom; Piller; Informat Technol Soc, VDE Assoc Electr Elect & Informat Technol; IEEE Power ElectrSoc, Int Telecommunicat Energy Conf Sub GrpDeutsch Telekom; DeTeImmobilien; SIEMENS; EXIDE; Gertek; HAWKER Energy Storage; IEEE; Ntelec; KPN Telecom; Piller; Informat Technol Soc, VDE Assoc Electr Elect & Informat Technol; IEEE Power ElectrSoc, Int Telecommunicat Energy Conf Sub Grp	DRESDEN, GERMANYDRESDEN, GERMANY	0	1	0	0	0	0	1					3-8007-2546-0	WOS:000172834500014

This questions the relevance of the widespread aqueous testing for real world application. In this study, we aim to determine the processes responsible for the dissolution discrepancy. Experimental parameters known to diverge in both systems are individually tested for their influence on dissolution of an Ir-based catalyst. Ir dissolution is studied in an aqueous model system, a scanning flow cell coupled to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Real dissolution rates of the Ir OER catalyst in membrane electrode assemblies are measured with a specifically developed, dedicated setup. Overestimated acidity in the anode catalyst layer and stabilization over time in real devices are proposed as main contributors to the dissolution discrepancy. The results shown here lead to clear guidelines for anode electrocatalyst testing parameters to resemble realistic electrolyzer operating conditions. Dissolution of Ir catalysts varies widely between PEM water electrolysers and aqueous electrolytes. Here, we systematically investigate this finding and propose that stabilization of the catalysts over time and overestimated ionomer acidity are the main contributors to the dissolution discrepancy.									30	0	0	0	1	0	30				2041-1723		WOS:000640640300004	33850142

The application of a Nernst-type equation for evaluation of pressures of sorbed H is shown to be inappropriate, as is also the assumption that sorption of H is driven by H coverage arising in the H + H recombination step. The latter is inapplicable at most cathode metals except active Pt, and also inapplicable at poisoned electrodes where theta(H) is diminished substantially by poisons at transition metals.Potential-relaxation and frequency response experiments have been conducted at Pt in the presence and absence of thiourea as a poison and clearly demonstrate the role of the latter in diminishing coverage by ''overpotential-deposited'' H.Finally, kinetic simulation calculations are given for various reaction pathways and the effects of a co-adsorbed poison giving rise to interaction effects in the adsorbed H film.

The occurrence of ldquoexoticrdquo shapes in light N=Zalpha-like nuclei is investigated. Various approaches of the superdeformed and hyperdeformed bands associated with quasimolecular resonant structures are presented. Evolution of clustering from stability to the drip-lines is examined: clustering aspects are, in particular, discussed for light exotic nuclei with large neutron excess such as neutron-rich Oxygen isotopes with their complete spectrocopy.

Therefore, dioxygen reduction may be regarded as a modified type of proton transfer reaction. To understand it, the underlying phenomenon of proton transfer must first be understood. This requires an evaluation of the kinetic models for the proton transfer reaction. After deciding which model applies best, the effects of adsorption on proton transfer in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are compared with those which have been observed experimentally in dioxygen reduction. Both reactions in acid media are characterized by volcano relationships. However, the volcano in the HER results from reversible absorption effects and that in dioxygen reduction results from irreversible absorption. The effect of this is to reduce the pre-exponential value in the rate expression from a figure close to the theoretical values predicted from the model to a value several orders of magnitude lower. The models of the separate oxygen electrode steps are shown to give excellent agreement with experiment in both acid and alkaline solution over a wide range of materials. The consequences for practical dioxygen reduction catalysts are discussed.									114	1	0	0	6	0	115			0022-0728			WOS:A1993MC26900007

Here, for the first time, we engineer the charge density of Ru(IV) by creating tensile strains in the RuO2 shell of Ru@RuO2 core-shell nanoparticles, viz. Ru@RuO2-L. High-resolution spectroscopic characterizations confirm the presence of av. 6% tensile strain in Ru-O bonds, which results in an effective reduction of the Ru(IV) charge density. The resultant RuX+ (4 < X < 5) active sites greatly accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an acidic electrolyte, leading to a remarkably low overpotential of 191 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). These values are lower than those for the benchmark RuO2 catalyst and are also among the lowest for efficient Ru-based electrocatalysts reported thus far. The specific activity and mass activity are also greatly enhanced 4.2-fold and 17.7-fold compared to those of RuO2, respectively. The acidic OER activity improvement is ascribed to the lowered adsorption energy of *OOH, owing to the reduced charge density of Ru(IV), and the rapid charge transport owing to the Ru core. Ru@RuO2-L also demonstrates high feasibility as the anode catalyst for the overall water splitting in acidic media. (C) 2020, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

However, Mg cofactors existing in enzymes are extremely active in biochemical reactions. Our density function theory calculations reveal that the catalytic activity of the main-group metals (Mg, Al and Ca) in oxygen reduction reaction is severely hampered by the tight-bonding of active centers with hydroxyl group intermediate, while the Mg atom coordinated to two nitrogen atoms has the near-optimal adsorption strength with intermediate oxygen species by the rise of p-band center position compared to other coordination environments. We experimentally demonstrate that the atomically dispersed Mg cofactors incorporated within graphene framework exhibits a strikingly high half-wave potential of 910 mV in alkaline media, turning a s/p-band metal into a highly active electrocatalyst.									103	5	0	0	6	0	103			2041-1723			WOS:000564269900003	32071314

Biodegradation was confirmed as the dominant removal mechanism by measurements of the concomitant chloride ion evolution. Degradation efficiencies of 95% were obtained at a reactor retention time of 1.25 h. A mathematical model was used to describe the simultaneous diffusion and reaction of 34DCA and oxygen in the biofilms on the particles in the reactor.

Here, novel FeNi alloy quantum dot (QD)-decorated cobalt carbonate hydroxide (CoCH) nanosword arrays were successfully constructed on Ni foam (FeNi/CoCH/Ni foam) and used as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in alkaline media. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between the FeNi alloy QDs and CoCH, the FeNi/CoCH/Ni foam electrode delivers a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 240 mV and a small Tafel slope of 44.8 mV dec(-1) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Further, it displays excellent performance for overall water splitting with a voltage of 1.49 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and maintains its activity for at least 23 h. In particular, it only needs low cell voltages of 1.54 and 1.6 V to drive high current densities of 100 and 400 mA cm(-2), respectively, which is much better than commercial Pt/C/Ni foam||RuO2/Ni foam, providing great potential for large-scale application.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000753571400001	35142772

In contrast to the depression of F-v/F-m (35 %) and the rise of non-photochemical quenching (similar to 1.6), we observed an increase in effective absorption cross-section (20 %), Hill reaction (30 %), photosynthetic oxygen evolution (80 %), and electron transport rate estimated from the Chl fluorescence analysis (80 %). We showed an inconsistency in the presently used interpretation schemes, and ascribe the discrepancy between the increase of effective absorption cross-section and the photosynthetic activities on one side and the effective nonphotochemical quenching on the other side to the build-up of a quenching mechanism which dissipates energy in closed reaction centres. Such a type of quenching changes the ratio between thermal dissipation and fluorescence without any effect on photochemical yield. In this case the F-v/F-m ratio cannot be used as a measure of the maximum photochemical yield of PS2.					2nd Regional Photosynthesis Workshop on Chlorophyll Fluorescence - Emotions and Reason2nd Regional Photosynthesis Workshop on Chlorophyll Fluorescence - Emotions and Reason	JAN 31-FEB 03, 1999JAN 31-FEB 03, 1999	Natl Res Ctr Photosynthesis & Global Climate Change; Inst Microbiol; Acad Sci Czech Republ; TrebonNatl Res Ctr Photosynthesis & Global Climate Change; Inst Microbiol; Acad Sci Czech Republ; Trebon	LIPNO, CZECH REPUBLICLIPNO, CZECH REPUBLIC	12	0	0	0	12	0	13			0300-3604			WOS:000085348900014

In this study, a promising strategy was proposed to prepare catalyst CoO nanosheets supported by nitrogendoped activated carbon (CoO@N-AC) to achieve a synergetic effect between metallic oxide and heteroatomdoped carbon. The nanocomposites possess a large Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area (1577.2 m(2) g (1)), low total resistance (9.26 Omega), and fourelectron ORR pathway. These nanocomposites are utilized as the aircathode catalysts in MFCs. CoO@N-AC remarkably increases the maximum power density by 122.5% from 741.5 +/- 8.5 mW m (2) to 1650.1 +/- 36.2 mW m +/- 2, which is higher than that of Pt/C (1201.4 +/- 13.5 mW m (2)). The excellent catalytic activity makes CoO@N-AC a promising cathodic electrocatalyst for practical application of MFCs.

The internal composition of white dwarfs and the 12C(alpha,gamma)16O reaction rate								Proceedings of the 8th Workshop on Nuclear Astrophysics								10	13						Aug. 1996	1996	One of the most uncertain parameters in the theory of stellar evolution is the 12C(alpha,gamma)16O cross section at low energies. The combined effects of this reaction rate and of the detailed treatment of overshooting and/or semiconvection determine the size, growth and chemical composition of the resulting C-O core of the star. The relative proportions of 12C and 16O will determine - among other factors, like the phase diagram of the carbon-oxygen mixture-the rate of cooling of the resulting white dwarf. Since in a simple approximation the rate of cooling of white dwarfs is proportional to the ionic specific heat, the difference in the cooling times of a pure 12C white dwarf and a pure 16O white dwarf may vary by roughly a 25%.

Herein, urchin-like Co9S8@NiFe layered double hydroxide (Co9S8@NiFe LDH) heterostructured hollow spheres are assembled from Co9S8 hollow spheres as the core and porous NiFe LDH nanowires as the shell. The heterostructured hollow spheres show a small overpotential of 220 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 52.0 mV dec(-1), and robust stability, which is better than that of commercial IrO2 and most reported non-precious electrocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the synergetic effect at the interface could improve the electrical conductivity of Co9S8@NiFe LDH, induce electron transfer from NiFe LDH to Co9S8, and lower the energy barriers of intermediates for the OER, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, the urchin-like hollow structure with nanopores and super-hydrophilicity can provide desired structural stability, facilitate ion penetration and release bubbles, improving the accessibility of active sites and thereby boosting OER catalytic performance. This work provides a viable route to develop high performance electrocatalysts for the OER.									13	1	0	0	1	0	14			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000650212500001

The formation mechanism is studied by SEM, XRD, TEM, and Raman techniques. The catalytic activity of the newly obtained CoPSe-CoSe2/CNTs material is then investigated by adopting the material as catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We found that the OER performance of the as-prepared CoPSe-CoSe2/CNTs catalyst shows strongly dependency on the amount of amorphous CoSe2 and a volcano-like relationship is observed which the OER catalytic activity increases firstly to reach its maximum and then slightly drops down by further increasing the amount of amorphous CoSe2 in the catalyst system. The CoPSe-CoSe2/CNTs electrode with optimized amount of CoSe2 can drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with only 268 mV, far lower than the value required on the CoP/CNTs (305 mV) and CoSe2/CNTs (324 mV) electrodes.

The electronic construction and optical transition properties of the excited state were predicted from the first-principles calculations and configuration interaction singles (CIS) calculations, respectively, so as to reinforce the experimental result. The material was found to be a low band gap (1.65 eV) semiconductor photocatalytic material. Visible light photocatalytic test was conducted to study the degradation of an antibiotic drug, chloramphenicol. Linear sweep voltammetry also displayed a very good electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with a measured current density of 60 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 370 mV, which is beneficial for photocatalysis. Our exploration can help improve semiconductor based coordination complexes for application in photocatalysis and electro-catalysis.

Here, colloidal ligand-free Pt nanoparticles were deposited on Al2O3 and CeO2 to investigate the support effect in CO oxidation by in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and mass spectrometry (MS). On Pt/Al2O3, the carbonate-like intermediates accumulate and do not decompose to CO2 at the ignition temperature (150 degrees C) or above; the conversion of CO to CO2 follows classic Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism with direct reaction of CO and O2 on Pt. Whereas for Pt/CeO2, the CO conversion to bidentate carbonate (b-CO32- ) species followed by decomposition to CO2 is a main reaction pathway leading to its high reactivity at low temperature (75 degrees C). CeO2 facilitates the activation of oxygen to produce the carbonate-like intermediates and further decomposition to CO2, which resulted in a lower ignition temperature.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000818526500006

Although activating strategies, such as nanostructure designing and band structure engineering, have led to remarkable activity gains, there remains considerable room to improve performance that aims for real applications. We report here a novel strategy-protonating supramolecular aggregates followed by thermal polycondensation-to prepare porous g-C3N4 nanosheets (SH-g-C3N4) with high oxidation power, which employ as bifunctional OER catalyst and highly efficient photocatalyst material. The OER onset potentials of 1.47 V and Tafel slope of 128 mV dec(-1) over SH-g-C3N4 are superior to the g-C3N4 obtained from supramolecular aggregates without protonation (S-g-C3N4). Furthermore, its Tafel slope would be reduced to 63.6 mV dec(-1) under visible light irradiation, which is comparable to that of the active commercial RuO2 and IrO2 catalysts. Interestingly, the achieved nanosheets display enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity. The striking catalysis performance of SH-g-C3N4 can be ascribed to the unique advantage of its highly porous structure and favorable electronic structure and the generation of lots of center dot O-2(-) and center dot OH radicals promoting the kinetic process. Our theoretical calculations reveal the mechanism of photoelectric catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction. This work provides a facile and scalable method to design highly efficient polymeric catalysts.									11	1	0	0	2	0	11			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000460069500019

Over the last 5 decades, a plethora of research has been performed in species ranging from bacteria to mammals that has elucidated the molecular reaction, subcellular location, and specific isoforms of SOD. However, while humans have only begun to study this class of enzymes over the past 50 years, it has been estimated that these enzymes have existed for billions of years, and may be some of the original enzymes found in primitive life. As life evolved over this expanse of time, these enzymes have taken on new and different functional roles potentially in contrast to how they were originally derived. Herein, examination of the evolutionary history of these enzymes provides both an explanation and further inquiries into the modern-day role of SOD in physiology and disease.									64	0	1	0	49	1	66				2076-3921		WOS:000419247200010	29084153

We now report a comprehensive electrochemical characterization of manganese oxide (MnOx) over a wide pH range, and establish MnOx as a functionally stable OER catalyst owing to self-healing, is derived from MnOx redeposition that offsets catalyst dissolution during turnover. To study this process in detail, the oxygen evolution mechanism of MnOx was investigated electrokinetically over a pH range spanning acidic, neutral, and alkaline conditions. In the alkaline pH regime, a similar to 60 mV/decade Tafel slope and inverse first-order dependence on proton concentration were observed, whereas the OER acidic pH regime exhibited a quasi-infinite Tafel slope and zeroth-order dependence on proton concentration. The results reflect two competing mechanisms: a one-electron one-proton PCET pathway that is dominant under alkaline conditions and a Mn3+ disproportionation process, which predominates under acidic conditions. Reconciling the rate laws of these two OER pathways with that of MnOx electrodeposition elucidates the self-healing characteristics of these catalyst films. The intersection of the kinetic profile of deposition and that of water oxidation as a function of pH defines the region of kinetic stability for MnOx and importantly establishes that a non-noble metal oxide OER catalyst may be operated in acid by exploiting a self-healing process.									379	9	0	0	39	0	382			0002-7863			WOS:000335086100036	24669981

Herein, modulating the surface characteristics of NiMo nanoparticles by various adsorbed amines gives the tunability on their interfacial properties and subsequently improves their catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solutions. Diamines can significantly improve their HER activity by decreasing the charge-transfer resistance and modulating the electronic structures of interfacial active sites. Importantly, among various amines, ethylenediamine facilitates the HER activity of NiMo with a remarkable decrease of 268 mV in the overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) as compared with that of the unmodified NiMo in 1.0 M KOH.

However, there are relatively few reports focused on the structure change of amorphous catalysts during the catalysis process, although this is quite important to the identification of active species and in revealing the reaction mechanism. Herein, amorphous Co-Ni sulfide in the form of a nanoplate and nanowire hybrid on the surface of nickel foam is prepared as the electrode for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). During the hydrogen evolution process, the amorphous Co-Ni sulfide is in-situ transformed into crystalline Ni, S-co-doped CoO which is actually responsible for the catalysis of HER The transformation process is studied in detail by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and theoretical calculations. The in-situ formed electrode presents a high activity and durability toward HER in alkaline media. The Ni and S dopants, sulfurization temperature, and electrode substrate are revealed to be important factors that affect the activity. The present work will not only give more insights in the structure evolution of the electrocatalyst during HER but also provides a new strategy to the fabrication of new electrocatalysts.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			2168-0485			WOS:000475838100061

The surface self-reconstruction during the OER is considered as the key of highly active catalysts, whereas identifying the local electronic and geometric structure of the reconstruction-derived components is challenging. Herein, an in situ exsolution method towards the typical LaCo0.8Fe0.2O3- perovskite is developed to obtain a new type of lanthana-anchored CoFe catalyst. The optimized catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 293 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH. Most importantly, operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements demonstrate that the CoFe species in the catalyst are nearly transformed into unique (Co/Fe)O(OH) with a definite coordination-unsaturated structure under electrochemical conditions, which actually contributes to this superior performance. Moreover, the presence of the lanthana support promotes this transformation. Our work not only suggests a facile reconstructive strategy to dramatically enhance the OER activity of perovskite oxides in alkaline media, but also unravels the fine structure of true active sites through operando X-ray spectroscopic tracking.									100	4	0	0	8	0	102			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000448339100018

Due to the large surface areas and the low coordination numbers of surface atoms, their one-dimensional ultrafine nanowires and two-dimensional ultrathin nanosheets are continually being investigated, while stacking problems inevitably affect their activities and stabilities.We describe herein a three-dimensional metal network electrocatalyst consisting of a worm-like S-doped RhNi alloy (S-RhNi), which improves the performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Experimental results reveal that S-RhNi exhibits Pt-like HER activity with an onset potential close to 0 mV and a Tafel slope of 24.61 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution, having also good stability. The polarization curve shifts only 3.9 mV at a current density of - 60 mA cm(-2) after 1,000 cycles and the potential displays a slight change after holding the current density at - 20 mA cm(-2) for 10 h. This improved performance is supposed to be originated from the combination between the worm-like RhNi alloy, doped S atoms, and the three-dimensional structure. Overall, the results obtained and the facile synthesis methods offer a promising electrocatalyst for scaling-up hydrogen evolution.									42	0	0	0	3	0	42			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000474501500013

In the present paper, we examine theoretically and by means of computer simulation the significance of such measurements, in particular conditions under which capacitance of the double layer can be distinguished from that due to pseudocapacitance associated with the intermediates. The initial potential relaxation slopes, (dV/dt)t=0, required for double layer capacitance evaluation, can be determined accurately by a procedure involving fitting of digitally acquired potential relaxation transient [V(t)] curves, recorded over a time scale of microseconds to milliseconds, by a polynomial or simpler function. Coupled with the current density prior to current interruption, i(t = 0), the procedure enables both the double layer capacitance and "iR" drops to be determined. The accuracy of this method is examined. As examples, the electrochemical H-2, Cl2 and F2 evolution reactions are examined. In the case of the H-2 evolution reaction, both Ni and electrodeposited Ni(80%)-Mo(19%)-Cd(1%) were studied. The curve-fitting results show C(dl) to be ca 40-mu-F cm-2 at Ni wire and ca 90 mF cm-2 at the electrodeposited electrode. For the anodic Cl2 evolution at preoxidized Pt surfaces, the C(dl) values obtained by means of the fitting method are in good agreement with those from ac impedance and the conventional "whole decay curve" analysis. In the case of F2 evolution at carbon, problems of a different kind arise in evaluation of the interfacial capacitance due to its unusually low value of ca 1-mu-F cm-2, or less, which arises on account of the small dielectric capacitance associated with the barrier-layer film of "CF" species generated on F2-evolving C electrodes.					5TH INTERNATIONAL FISCHER SYMP ON ADSORBATES, INTERMEDIATES AND INHIBITORS5TH INTERNATIONAL FISCHER SYMP ON ADSORBATES, INTERMEDIATES AND INHIBITORS	JUN 16-20, 1991JUN 16-20, 1991	DEUT FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCH; STATE BADEN WURTTEMBERG; BADISCHE LANDESBAUSPARKASSE KARLSRUHE; GIULINI; SCHLUMBERGER TECHNOL MUNCHENDEUT FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCH; STATE BADEN WURTTEMBERG; BADISCHE LANDESBAUSPARKASSE KARLSRUHE; GIULINI; SCHLUMBERGER TECHNOL MUNCHEN	UNIV KARLSRUHE, KARLSRUHE, GERMANYUNIV KARLSRUHE, KARLSRUHE, GERMANY	35	0	0	0	3	1	36			0013-4686			WOS:A1992JM29300006

However, large-scale H-2 production is greatly hindered by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics at the anode of a water electrolyzer. Although many OER electrocatalysts have been developed to negotiate this difficult reaction, substantial progresses in the design of cheap, robust, and efficient catalysts are still required and have been considered a huge challenge. Herein, we report the simple synthesis and use of alpha-Ni(OH)(2) nanocrystals as a remarkably active and stable OER catalyst in alkaline media. We found the highly nanostructured alpha-Ni(OH)(2) catalyst afforded a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of a mere 0.331 V and a small Tafel slope of similar to 42 mV/decade, comparing favorably with the state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst. This alpha-Ni(OH)(2) catalyst also presents outstanding durability under harsh OER cycling conditions, and its stability is much better than that of RuO2. Additionally, by comparing the performance of alpha-Ni(OH)(2) with two kinds of beta-Ni(OH)(2), all synthesized in the same system, we experimentally demonstrate that alpha-Ni(OH)(2) effects more efficient OER catalysis. These results suggest the possibility for the development of effective and robust OER electrocatalysts by using cheap and easily prepared alpha-Ni(OH)(2) to replace the expensive commercial catalysts such as RuO2 or IrO2.									1006	36	0	0	49	0	1016			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000336078400052	24761994

Here, we report a facile strategy to design a novel hierarchical nanoporous (HNP) HER electrocatalyst by incorporating transition metal oxide (TMO) NiO and complex phosphide (TMP) NiCoP. With the HNP NiCo2O4 products via a facile solvothermal and annealing method, the NiO/NiCoP composite was easily obtained through a simple subsequent phosphorization process at the optimized temperature. Owing to various factors such as the strong synergetic coupling effects between TMO and TMP, electron interaction between TMPs, unique HNP structure features and increased active sites, the resulting HNP NiO/NiCoP composite demonstrated significantly enhanced electrocatalytic HER activities with a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) at a small overpotential of 112 mV, a low Tafel slope of about 56 mV dec(-1) and satisfactory stability. We expect that this facile synthetic strategy of active binary TMPs functionalized hierarchical porous TMOs will provide a promising prospect for the development of non-precious HER electrocatalysts.

The integration of cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with anodic organic reaction (AOR) improves the energy efficiency of the electrolyzer by reducing the cell voltage of the overall process. Tremendous progress has been achieved in AOR by using transition-metal-based catalysts. These transition-metal-based catalysts undergo anodic activation in the alkali medium to form metal (oxy)hydroxide [M(O)(x)(OH)(y)] as the active catalyst. The atomic and electronic structure of M(O)(x)(OH)(y) essentially controls the conversion efficiency and product selectivity for AOR. In this Account, we have described the design of the AOR precatalyst, its anodic activation, and the basic principles of the integration of cathodic HER with AOR. The structural features of the precatalyst and the active catalyst have been described with representative examples. The recent progress and advancement in this field have been explained, and the future scope and challenges associated with AOR have been addressed.1 Introduction2 Anodic Organic Oxidation Reactions3 Activity and Selectivity of Anodic Organic Reaction4 Anodic Activation of Transition-Metal-Based Catalysts5 Mechanism of Anodic Organic Oxidation6 Perspective and Outlook									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0936-5214	1437-2096		WOS:000843731300001

Here, we report a simple and readily scalable strategy for fabricating binder-free Cu-Fe-NH2 based MOF thin film-electrodes directly applicable as a catalyst for water electrolysis. Films composed of thin 2D-nanosheets of the MOF were deposited by dropping ink obtained from solvothermally synthesised bulk MOFs onto nickel foam substrates, or simply immersing the substrates in the ink. The Cu-Fe-NH2 MOF electrodes demonstrated excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, comparable or superior to recently reported state-of-the-art MOFs. Strikingly, the MOF electrodes exhibited a remarkably low OER overpotential of 330 mV at a high current density of 500 mA cm(-2), and excellent durability with a very minor chronopotentiometric decay loss of 1.26% at the end of a 24 h test at a high bias current of 500 mA cm(-2).									46	2	0	0	2	0	47			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000597647100011

Herein, a WO3 nano-array electrode with a heterogeneous IrRu coating is obtained via a facile electrodeposition approach, obtaining balance between OER activity and stability. The obtained IrRu@WO3 electrode exhibits a competitive overpotential of 245 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Based on studies via ex situ ICP, good stability is achieved, with mild Ir and Ru mass loss ratios of 9.6% and 24.4%, respectively, after 40 h of multi-step chronopotentiometry (10-100 mA cm(-2)). A single cell can attain a current density of 4.5 A cm(-2) at 2.13 V at Ir loading of 115 mu g cm(-2), and the nano-array structure remains stable, with a single-cell lifetime of 500 h. Benefiting from the structure, interfacial Ru exhibits excellent OER performance and it can be secured thanks to the electrophilic electronic structure, avoiding the formation of soluble and over-oxidated Ru. A nanoarray-structure electrode is achieved with tunable stability and activity for PEM water electrolysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000802326300001

The assay is based on the formation of an indamine dye in a horseradish peroxidase coupled reaction between 3-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid and 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone. Using this assay, we found that as the O-2 evolution activity of PS II-enriched membrane fragments is decreased by treatments which cause the dissociation of the 33 and/or 23 and 16 kDa extrinsic proteins (i.e., CaCl2-washing, NaCl-washing, lauroylcholine-treatment and ethylene glycol-treatment), light-induced peroxide formation increases. Both the losses of O-2 evolution and increases in peroxide formation seen under these conditions are reversed by CaCl2 addition, indicating that the two activities originate from the water-splitting site. However, the increased rates of peroxide formation do not quantitatively match the losses in O-2 evolution activity. We suggest that a rapid consumption of the peroxide takes place via a catalase/peroxidase activity at the water-splitting site which competes with both the O-2 evolution and peroxide formation reactions. The observed peroxide formation is interpreted as arising from enhanced water accessibility to the catalytic site upon perturbation of the extrinsic proteins which then leads to alternate water oxidation side reactions.									38	0	0	0	33	0	38			0166-8595			WOS:A1993MX41700024	24317998

At the same time it transiently maintains a limited supply of electrons arising from photosystem II (PSII) to the hydrogenase (Melis and Happe Plant Physiol 2001; 127:740-748). In this work, using fast chl a fluorescence and P700 measurements, we show that ascorbate (Asc), a naturally occurring PSII alternative electron donor, is capable of donating electrons to PSII in heat-treated and sulphur-deprived cells and this can be significantly accelerated by supplementing the culture with 10 mM Asc. It also enhances, about three-fold, the photoproduction of hydrogen in cells subjected to sulphur deprivation as shown by gas chromatography. Similar stimulation was obtained in the presence of diphenylcarbazide (DPC), an artificial PSII electron donor. Asc and DPC also facilitated the anaerobiosis of cells, probably via super reducing the oxygen evolving complex while feeding electrons to PSII reaction centres and the linear electron transport chain, and ultimately to the hydrogenase as shown by the significant DCMU-sensitivity of the light-induced Asc- and DPC-dependent re-reduction of P700(+) and hydrogen evolution.

Herein, biomass peanut shell is used to synthesize B,N-codoped defective graphitic carbon entangled Fe3C nano particles (D-BNGFe) via carbonizing and doping, followed by a defect creation process. In the synthesis, the usage of iron species could effectively prevent the formation of the B-N covalent bond, which maximizes the ORR activity. Moreover, a simple acid dissolution process was used to only reserve Fe3C nanoparticles encapsulated by carbon nanostructures, which can be stable during the electrocatalytic ORR as certified by operando X-ray absorption fine structure spectra and transmission electron microscopy characterization. Combining the ORR catalyst of D-BNGFe with the oxygen evolution reaction catalyst of NiFe-LDH@CF (NiFe-LDH grown on the copper foam substrate) as the air cathode, the assembled rechargeable ZABs feature a low-voltage gap, high power density, and excellent stability, which are superior to the state-of-the-art Pt/C + RuO2 and most of the nonprecious metal-based catalysts.

Here, we report the preparation of ultrafine Ru nanoparticles from a hybrid of ZIF-L(Co) MOF and polydopamine coated few-layered Ti3C2Tx MXene (FL-Ti3C2Tx). FL-Ti3C2Tx is used as a template to grow regular leaf-shaped ZIF-L(Co) nanosheets through the reaction of Co ions anchored on the MXene surface with 2-methylimidazole. The obtained hybrid is then doped with Ru ions through ion exchange between Ru and Co ions, followed by thermal annealing at a temperature of 350 degrees C in an Ar atmosphere to produce ultrafine Ru nano -particles.

This study describes single-phase metal-rich nickel phosphide (Ni12P5)-incorporated carbon composites for a highly efficient water-splitting system. The distinct Ni12P5 is anchored in nitrogen (N)- and phosphorus (P)-rich carbon matrices (Ni12P5@N,P-C); the creation of the matrices entails a facile hydrothermal-followed pyrolysis treatment to explore their bifunctional activities in the water-splitting system. Owing to the superior activity of the rich Ni (delta(+)) component for the production of molecular oxygen and that of P (delta(-))and N species in the carbon framework for hydrogen adsorption, the optimized Ni12P5@N,P-C composites contribute effectively toward both high oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions. Consequently, the Ni12P5@N,P-C composite-based two-electrode water-splitting system shows a low operating potential of 1.57 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and achieves the commercially required high current density of 500 mA cm(-2) at a stable potential of 2 V. The functionalization of composite electrocatalysts based on strategical engineering and the intrusion of multiple active sites can help develop enhanced electrochemical energy systems.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2168-0485			WOS:000737877800001

The deliberately selected PPA and molten electrolyte ensure the unique lamellar nanostructures and the blending of multiple anions of C, N, P, and O in the obtained catalyst, specifically, triggering the in situ formation of the structural oxygen vacancies (V-O) in MoCPO. The nature of the hybrids can be regulated by adjusting the synthesis condition. The optimized hybrid displays a low overpotential of 99.2 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 and stays active over a broad pH range. The theoretical calculations reveal that V-O in the hybrids serves as favorable active sites, thus contributing to the superior HER activity. Moreover, MoCPO is also effective for overall water splitting as a bifunctional catalyst.									6	2	0	0	0	0	8			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000605187100019	33320536

However, the effect of second coordination sphere for efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalysts has rarely been studied, becoming a bottleneck in many energy-related issues. In this article, the cobalt phosphonate (NH3C6H4NH3)Co-2(hedpH)(2)center dot H2O (Co-PDA) displayed decent electrocatalytic water oxidation activity in 50 mM PBS solution (pH 7.0), comparable to the activity of state-of-the-art IrO2. Moreover, it exhibited a 160 mV lower onset potential and 6 times higher TOF than those of the counterpart, (NH4)(2)Co-2(hedpH)(2)(Co-NH4+), which existed with the same Co active center, while surrounded by different ligands. The related mechanistic studydemonstrates that the ligand in Co-PDA would benefit the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes and the formation of high valence state Co(iv).									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000547975900039	32555873

The as-prepared C@Co-NGR exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for the ORR in 0.10 M KOH with a half-wave potential of 0.830 V (vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), which is 21 mV more positive than that of a commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, it shows a higher stability and better methanol tolerance than the commercial Pt/C catalyst in alkaline solution, with almost no shift in the ORR polarization curve after 3000 cycles and no change of the ORR peak in the cyclic voltammogram in the presence of 1.0 M methanol. Most importantly, the C@Co-NGR also exhibits a comparable activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.10 M KOH solution, in which the overpotential needed to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is 410 mV, comparable to that of the state-of-the-art commercial RuO2 catalyst (370 mV, vs. RHE). This makes the C@Co-NGR one of the best non-precious-metal catalyst for OER and ORR in alkaline solution ever reported.									49	2	0	0	2	0	51			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000395422800045	28092389

In this study, small sized Fe-Co sulfide nanoclusters (2-3 nm) in situ anchored on carbon were designed and prepared as an OER catalyst. Due to the smaller size, a large number of catalytic sites are exposed. The optimized Fe-Co bimetal sulfide nanoclusters/carbon composite exhibits an overpotential of only 247 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 35 mV dec(-1). In addition, the formed nanocluster catalyst also showed superior stability without activity decay and metal component dissolution during the OER process. Experimental and theoretical calculations indicate that on the Fe-Co sulfide nanoclusters, Fe sites are preferred to enrich the sulfide surface; surface oxidation will occur during the OER process in alkaline electrolyte forming Fe-Co-S-O species. The electron transfer interactions from Fe to S sites induce stronger acidity on Fe sites, which would facilitate OH- and water adsorption, thus inducing the enhancement of electrocatalytic performance.									67	4	0	0	5	0	67			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000474271200035

In this work, by using mesoporous TiO2 electrodes, we have demonstrated the interplays between HER and Li-ion insertion in Water-in-Salt Electrolyte (WISE). Low C-rates favor the electro-catalytic reaction (HER), but the latter does also depend on the amount of Li in the electrode.

Nitrogen functionalized carbon nanomaterials are an interesting electrocatalysts option because of their attractive electrical properties, excellent chemical stability and catalytic activity. Hence, this study reports the HER mechanism on nitrogen functionalized few-walled carbon nanotubes (N-FWCNT). With this earth-abundant element based catalyst 250mV overpotential is required to reach 10mAcm(-2) current density and so its HER activity is comparable to other non-noble metal catalysts, and clearly among the highest previously reported for N-FWCNTs. To gain fundament insight on their functioning, computational analysis has been carried out to verify the effect of nitrogen and to analyze the reaction mechanism. The reaction mechanism has also been analyzed experimentally with a pH series, and both the methods suggest that the HER proceeds via the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. Overall hydrogen surface coverage on N-FWCNT is also suggested to affect the HER rate. Interestingly, in the studied structure, carbons in vicinity of nitrogen atoms, but not directly bound to nitrogen, appear to promote the HER most actively. Furthermore, durability of N-FWCNTs has been demonstrated by operating a full electrolyzer cell for five weeks.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000443935100033

In this study, holey graphene with a high edge pyridinic N-doping (43.0% in 5.1 at.% N, N-hG) has been prepared via a modified two-step synthetic method, involving the annealing in air at 430 degrees C to create holes, followed by N-doping in Ar/NH3 atmosphere at 850 degrees C. The resultant N-hG was demonstrated to possess a high specific surface area (1170.05 m(2) g(-1)), outstanding ORR performance (E-1/2 = 0.833 V, E-onset = 0.91 V) close to those of Pt/C catalyst in alkaline electrolyte, and a better long-term stability and methanol tolerance than Pt/C. The outstanding performance was attributed to the high specific surface area with abundant exposed active sites as well as the high edge N-content and large number of holes rich with the edge defects to ensure high catalytic activities. Furthermore, a mechanistic understanding of the hole formation in graphene lattice and subsequent edge N-doping was obtained, which could be used to guide the design and development of various new low-cost, highly efficient carbon electrocatalysts for ORR and beyond.

Here, we present a smart design strategy for enhancing Ir utilization and stabilization. We showcase it on a catalyst, where Ir nanoparticles are efficiently anchored on a conductive support titanium oxynitride (TiONx) dispersed over carbon-based Ketjen Black and covered by a thin layer of copper (Ir/CuTiONx/C), which gets removed in the preconditioning step. Electrochemical OER activity, stability, and structural changes were compared to the Ir-based catalyst, where Ir nanoparticles without Cu are deposited on the same support (Ir/TiONx/C). To study the effect of the sacrificial less-noble metal layer on the catalytic performance of the synthesized material, characterization methods, namely X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and identical location transmission electron microscopy were employed and complemented with scanning flow cell coupled to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, which allowed studying the online dissolution during the catalytic reaction. Utilization of these advanced methods revealed that the sacrificial Cu layer positively affects both Ir OER mass activity and its durability, which was assessed via S-number, a recently reported stability metric. Improved activity of Cu analogue was ascribed to the higher surface area of smaller Ir nanoparticles, which are better stabilized through a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000709692900009	34676130

Considering the promoting effect of the electrode structure on catalyzing OER, a stereo-film on carbon cloth comprising FeNi3 nanosheet-covered FeOOH (F@FeNi3-CC) was engineered by the hydrothermal reaction and subsequent synchronous electrodeposition of Fe and Ni ions. In F@FeNi3-CC, the FeOOH array not only provides the Fe source of FeNi3 nanosheets during the cathodic electrodeposition, but also functions as the support for the ultrathin FeNi3 nanosheets. Such a stereo-film with good electrolyte-permeability also offers expedited electrolyte/reactant transmission paths. The tailored FeNi3 nanosheet offers abundant exposed catalytic sites by virtue of the in situ derived hydroxide layer during anodic oxidation and also acts as the current collector to accelerate charge transport. The F@FeNi3-CC electrode yields outstanding catalytic activity towards OER in alkaline media, particularly at low potential of 1.50 V and large current density of 100 mA cm(-2), accompanied with the excellent long-term stability. These results are significant for the construction of stereo-film electrodes for various engineering applications.									34	4	0	0	3	0	34			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000435358600017	29855010

Biomimetic electron donors, manganese complexes and tyrosine, have been linked to a Ru(II)-polypyridine photosensitiser. Oxidation of the donors by intramolecular electron transfer from the photooxidised Ru(III) complex was demonstrated using optical flash photolysis and EPR experiments. A step-wise electron transfer Mn(III,III)-->tyrosine-->Ru(III) was demonstrated, in analogy to the reaction on the donor side of photosystem II. Electron transfer from the tyrosine to Ru(III) was coupled to tyrosine deprotonation. This resulted in a large reorganisation energy and thus a slow reaction rate, unless the tyrosine was hydrogen bonded or already deprotonated. A comparison with analogous reaction in photosystem II is made. Finally, light-induced oxidation of a manganese dimer linked to a Ru(II)-photosensitiser was observed. Preliminary results suggest the possibility of photooxidising manganese dimers in several steps, which is an important step towards water oxidation, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Herein, a novel strategy was developed for the construction of dispersive nickel phosphide (Ni2P) embedded in two-dimensional (2D) amorphous alumina arrays on three-dimensional (3D) nickel foam (NiP-Al2O3/NF) electrocatalysts via the reduction of a layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursor. Owing to its unique 3D nano/micro-architecture, multi-porous structure, interconnected conductive skeleton, and highly dispersive Ni2P active sites, the NiP-Al2O3/NF electrocatalyst exhibited excellent OER activity with overpotential as low as 193 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in a 1.0 M KOH solution and superior catalytic activity for the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in alkaline media. Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the introduction of P to Ni could effectively reduce the OER overpotential. Furthermore, benefiting from the flexibility of compositional tailoring of both the brucite-like layers and interlayer anions of LDHs, the synthesis strategy presented here can be easily extended to the fabrication of various nanostructured noble-metal-free functional materials, which are expected to have wide application prospects in many domains, especially in catalysis.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000470928800026

In this study, we developed highly efficient manganese oxide (MnOx) electrocatalytic films by a simple chemical solution deposition (CSD) method for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Specifically, the MnOx electrocatalytic films were synthesized at different annealing temperatures at 350, 450, and 550 degrees C after the precursor solution coating on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates. The MnOx electrocatalytic film prepared at 450 degrees C has exhibited the most catalytic activity for OER with the overpotential of 387 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) in 1 M NaOH alkaline solution. We suggested that this high OER activity of MnOx electrocatalytic film arise from the higher surface area, richer Mn3+ state on the catalysts surface, and low charge transfer resistance between electrocatalytic film and electrolyte based on electrochemical surface area (ECSA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis.

The electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of these materials is studied by cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometry methods in O-2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. The NiCo2O4/rGO hybrid nanocomposite materials are found to be highly active electrocatalysts for OER at lower overpotentials. The nanonet and microsphere-like NiCo2O4/rGO catalysts require overpotentials of 0.450 and 0.530 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and their corresponding Tafel slopes are 53 and 62 mV dec(-1), which are much lower than values reported for non-precious electrocatalysts. Further, both NiCo2O4/rGO catalysts show good catalytic stability with current retention more than 92 % over long period of 15,000 s determined by chronoampirometry and at the end of 1000th cycle determined by linear sweep voltammetry. The enhanced OER activity of nanostructured NiCo2O4/rGO hybrid catalysts is attributed to synergistic interaction between rGO and NiCo2O4, which seems to be essential for maintaining the large contact area at the electrode-electrolyte interface, better mass, and charge transport and to minimize the aggregation of NiCo2O4 nanoparticles.									49	1	0	0	1	0	49			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000383771700013

As OER catalyst development efforts increase, there is a need to standardize testing and baseline performance to compare catalysts between different studies, better direct materials development, and understand how performance improvements translate to the device. Of the catalysts tested, metals tend to have higher half-cell activity than their fully oxidized counterparts. In single-cells, however, metal activities approach oxides, likely due to the elevated temperature, higher potential, and longer time needed to condition membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) relative to rotating disk electrodes (RDEs). In RDEs, cobalt (Co) and ruthenium nanoparticles are the most OER active. Due to high ruthenium dissolution rates, however, iridium (Ir) is used as a PGM baseline. Activity differences between materials in RDE (Ir 320 A g(-1), Co 12 A g(-1) at 1.55 V) further appear to translate to MEAs (Ir 1370 A g(-1), Co 101 A g(-1) at 1.5 V), indicating that half-cell testing can be useful in the early stages of catalyst development to predict kinetics at the device-level.

In this novel design of mu RS apparatus, the solution in the fluid cell is continuously renewed. A fairly thick (several tens to hundreds of nanometers) layer forms at the galena surface in solutions with pH between 1 and 5.8. This surface layer is composed of Pb oxides, sulfates, and metastable species of sulfur. Native sulfur forms at pH 1 and 4.6, but is not a predominant surface species at pH 5.8. Dissolution rates, measured by solution chemistry, decrease with pH and reaction time. The formation of Pb oxides in these experiments at such low pH values contrasts with thermodynamic predictions based on properties at the macroscale (bulk solution).The in situ assessment of surface speciation confirms that sulfur can partially oxidize at the interface, and indicates that this process of sulfur oxidation depends on pH. We propose that sulfur oxidation may take place, at least partially, during the reaction of dissolved molecular oxygen with S atoms at the galena surface, or in the immediate vicinity. After this first step of reaction, oxygen combines with Pb ions to form Pb oxide at the interface.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			0003-004X	1945-3027		WOS:000245503700008

The former process results in the reversible formation of the metallacycle (CH3)(2)COO(a), an outcome indicated by the incorporation of O-18((a)) into all products evolving at greater than or equal to 215 K during temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy experiments in which O-18 atoms an preadsorbed. This facile exchange of surface oxygen atoms with (CH3)(2)COO(a) indicates that this reversible transfer is a general type of reaction on Ag(110). Cleavage of a C-O bond in (CH3)(2)COO(a) occurs at 215 and 330 K to liberate acetone from the surface. C-H bond activation by O-(a) yields acetone enolate (CH2 double bond C .(CH3)O-(a)) and results in both the evolution of H2O(g) at 220 K and the disproportionation of hydroxyl groups (OH(a)) to yield additional H2O(g) at 300-330 K. The activation of the C-H bond is predicted from the gas-phase acidity of acetone. Acetone is re-formed by enolate disproportionation at 445 K, but no acetone enol is detected in the gas phase. Partial oxidation of adsorbed species yields CO2((g)) at 405 and 475 K, H2O(g) at 450 K, and residual adsorbed hydrocarbon fragments.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			0002-7863			WOS:A1995QK08200019

Particularly, oxygen evolution, the half-reaction at the anode, imposes serious overpotential penalties due to its sluggish kinetics. The continued rational design and optimization of OER catalysts via different strategies such as chemical substitution provide an understanding of the way that catalytic properties can be finely tuned. Here, we show a facile synthetic approach involving a Ce(NO3)(3) precursor to yield a nitrogen and cerium co-doped CoS2 electrocatalyst. Remarkably, it requires an overpotential of only 190 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits long-term stability for 120 h. More importantly, a suite of advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations reveal complementary roles of the dual dopants which stabilize the intermediates as a result of the formation of two higher oxidation state metal active centers and maintain the surface structure. This work correlates the electronic structure and heteroatom doping, providing insights into electrochemical activity and stability and guiding the rational design of efficient electrocatalysts.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000589418400017

Diffusion bonding of oxygen-free Al2O3 ceramic and pure Cu substrates was performed using vacuum hot-press diffusion. The joints to be bonded were prepared by applying a pre-metallization interlayer of Ti-0.8La (wt.%). Experiment results demonstrated the successful diffusion bonding of oxygen-free Al2O3 ceramic and pure Cu substrates at temperatures of 350 degrees C. During the process of bonding, the Ti and La diffused toward the Al2O3 substrate to produce a homogeneous diffusion zone with no defects (i.e., cracking or porosity) at the interface. Adding a small quantity of La significantly increased the hardness of the joints as a function of bonding temperature. No indentation cracking was observed at the interface. At an elevated bonding temperature, the inclusion of La reduced the activation energy required for element diffusion, thereby increasing bonding strength in the interfacial diffusion zone and improving the ductility of Al2O3.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2468-0230			WOS:000606824700003

In spite of the rapid growth of alternative materials, platinum (Pt)-based or platinum alloy materials are still the most efficient catalysts for HER. Here, we report a hot-solvent synthesis for producing pop-corn shaped gallium-platinum (GaPt3) nanoparticles, which exhibits intermetallic behavior with abundant uneven surfaces that guarantee the extensive catalytic active edge sites. The electrochemical catalytic activity of GaPt3-based electrode towards HER was demonstrated for the first time, resulting an outstanding performance of only 27 mV overpotential to achieve the 10 mA/cm(2) current density and a Tafel slope of 43.3 mV/dec. (vs. RHE) in acidic media, which is rather superior to that of commercial Pt catalysts and a relatively low overpotential (<80 mV) was obtained even operated at large area (5 cm(2)). Moreover, cycling tests for 10000-cycle CV sweep (-0.3 to 0.2 V vs. RHE) and durability test for 48 h were applied and the performance remains still, thus giving the confirmation to the long-lasting feature of GaPt3 nanoparticles.

It is confirmed that O(2) gas is evolved in the two-step water-splitting reaction with the reactive ceramics vigorously by rapid heating (alpha-O(2)-releasing reaction). The alpha-O(2)-releasing reaction is due to the formation of interstitial defect and the conversion of lattice oxygen into O(2) gas at a nonequilibrium state. Reactive ceramics (NiFe(2)O(4) and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ)-NiFe(2)O(4) solid solution) can absorb solar thermal energy and convert thermal energy into chemical energy under high O(2) partial pressure atmosphere in the alpha-O(2)-releasing reaction. Repetitive evolutions of O(2) gas were observed in the two-step water-splitting reaction with YSZ-Fe(3)O(4) solid solution and cerium based metal oxides (CeO(2)-NiO, CeO(2)-ZrO(2), and CeO(2)-Ta(2)O(5)) at high O(2) partial pressure. The CeO(2)-Ta(2)O(5) (Ce: Ta = 90: 10) released a large amount of O(2) gas (3.95 cm(3)/g) in the alpha-O(2) releasing reaction in the flow of air.

Here, a scalable and flexible strategy is presented to prepare single crystalline CoNiPS3 incorporated with N-doped carbon (CoNiPS3/C) nanosheets (approximate to 16 nm thickness), which can be further processed into the mosaic-structured CoNiPS3/C nanosheets (approximate to 6 nm thickness) composed of randomly distributed crystalline nanodomains (approximate to 15 nm diameter) and disordered boundaries (denoted as mosaic CoNiPS3/C nanosheets), and further into separated CoNiPS3/C nanodots (approximate to 4 nm diameter). The initial CoNiPS3/C nanosheeets are prepared by using Co-Ni Prussian-blue analogue nanoplates as templating precursors. As compared to the initial CoNiPS3/C nanosheets and nanodots, the mosaic CoNiPS3/C nanosheets exhibit plenty of active edge sites, retained crystallinity, and good structural stability. Synergistically, density functional theory calculations reveal that the bimetallic composition results in higher intrinsic activity, better conductivity, and lower kinetic energy barriers for bifunctional oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions. More importantly, a water-splitting electrolyzer constructed using the mosaic CoNiPS3/C nanosheets as both cathode and anode achieves 30 mA cm(-2) at 1.62 V, which is better than the initial CoNiPS3/C nanosheets (1.69 V) and is comparable to the discreted nanodots (1.58 V). Besides, the mosaic CoNiPS3/C nanosheets show much better electrocatalytic stability than nanodots.									42	1	0	0	1	0	41			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000448258800022

Herein we report a hierarchical stainless steel mesh electrode which features Ni(Fe)OxHy-coated self-supported nanocone arrays. Through a facile, mild, low-cost and readily scalable two-step fabrication procedure, the electrochemically active area of the optimized electrode is enlarged by a factor of 3.1 and the specific activity is enhanced by a factor of 250 at 265 mV overpotential compared with that of a corresponding pristine stainless steel mesh electrode. Moreover, the charge-transfer resistance is reduced from 4.47 Omega for the stainless steel mesh electrode to 0.13 Omega for the Ni(Fe)OxHy-coated nanocone array stainless steel mesh electrode. As a result, the cheap and easily fabricated electrode displays 280 and 303 mV low overpotentials to achieve high current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm(geo)(-2), respectively, for oxygen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH. More importantly, the electrode exhibits a good stability over 340 h of chronopotentiometric test at 50 mA cm(geo)(-2) and only a slight attenuation (4.2%, similar to 15 mV) in catalytic activity over 82 h electrolysis at a constant current density of 500 mA cm(geo)(-2).									17	2	0	0	0	0	17			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000433267100019

These criteria were investigated by conducting quenching experiments with reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxygen concentration experiments, and toxicity evaluations with Vibrio fischeri bacteria. The results indicated that the degradation of naproxen proceeds via pseudo first-order kinetics in all cases and that photodegradation included degradation by direct photolysis and by self-sensitization via ROS; the contribution rates of self-sensitized photodegradation were 1.4 %, 65.8 %, and 31.7 % via center dot OH, O-1(2) and O-2 (aEuro cent a'), respectively. Furthermore, the oxygen concentration experiments indicated that dissolved oxygen inhibited the direct photodegradation of naproxen, and the higher the oxygen content, the more pronounced the inhibitory effect. The toxicity evaluation illustrated that some of the intermediate products formed were more toxic than naproxen.									24	5	0	0	13	0	28			0944-1344	1614-7499		WOS:000337086600002	24638836

Herein, we report a simple three-step route to Cu2O/Cu nanotubes populated by interconnected, phosphorus-doped CoO nanoparticles (denoted P-CoO-Cu2O/Cu-NTs). They possess three-dimensional (3D) accessible surface, thereby greatly favoring the exposure of active sites and electrolyte transport for efficient electrocatalysis. Notably, the integrated electrochemical tests and theoretical calculation reveal that the P-doping imparts the optimization of the electronic structures of CoO, enhancing its conductivity, facilitating the in-situ formation of active CoOOH species during oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and suitably regulating free energy for adsorption of the OER intermediates. Consequently, the P-CoO-Cu2O/Cu-NTs exhibit outstanding performance for OER and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with the overpotential of 261 mV and potential of 1.43 V vs RHE, respectively, at 10 mA em(-2), outperforming most of non-precious metal electrocatalysts and RuO2. As such, the three-step approach involving the use of Cu nano-wires as template to yield Cu2O/Cu nanotubular yet porous scaffold may stand out as a robust strategy for judicious crafting of interconnected hetematom-doped metal oxides for high-performance electrocatalysis.									25	1	0	0	3	0	25			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000503062400094

The relative oxygenation of the leghaemoglobin in the chamber was determined automatically by spectrophotometry of the effluent solution, and the concentrations of free, dissolved O2 ([O2]) and rates of O2 consumption were calculated. Dissolved CO2 and NH3 from N2 fixation were determined in fractions of the effluent solution. Bacteroids utilized endogenous reserves of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), which were depleted by 9.2 % during a typical 5 h-long experiment. Stepwise increases in flow rate (increasing supply of O2) initially produced a drop in O2 demand and resulted in a rise in [O2] and a decline in N2 fixation. Subsequently, O2 demand rose (presumably because of increased mobilization of substrate from PHB) and [O2] declined to a low level. N2 fixation was fully restored, or even enhanced, within 15-20 min of establishment of a new, steady [O2]. This pattern of regulation by O2 supply was completely eliminated by adding low concentrations (20-50-mu-M) of oxidizable substrate (succinate, malate, ethanol) to the reaction medium. During endogenous activity, rates of CO2 evolution were proportional to, but less than, rates of O2 consumption up to 5.4 nmol O2 min-1 mg-1, above which CO2 evolution exceeded O2 consumption.

However, the deficiency of comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the evolution of the electrocatalysts, nature of active centers, intermediate species absorbed in the electrocatalysts, and the reaction pathway during the electrocatalytic processes seriously limits the elucidation of the composition/structure-activity relationship of electrocatalysts. To this end, plenty of powerful in situ techniques that can provide atomic/molecular information are employed to bridge the understanding of fundamental mechanisms to the practical development of electrocatalysts. This review summarizes design strategies based on composition regulation and morphology design for tuning the electronic/geometric structures of electrocatalytic materials with improved activity and stability. Moreover, the recent application of in situ infrared, Raman, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy is elaborated with emphases on tracking the dynamic evolution during electrocatalysis and building a link between the composition/structure and activity of electrocatalysts. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives for in situ monitoring techniques to gain an understanding more deeply and comprehensively in the hydrogen energy-related electrocatalysis are proposed. This review provides insights into the rational optimization of electrocatalysts and inspire the unraveling mechanism of the enhanced electrocatalytic performance in future research.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2688-4062		WOS:000860084300001

Herein, we report surface-engineered amorphous cobalt hydroxide nanoflakes on nickel foam as highly active electrocatalysts for boosting water oxidation by a new repeatedly switching current-polarity strategy. It is discovered that sulfur introduction can simultaneously increase the Co3+/Co2+ ratio to generate more targeted OOH* intermediates and regulate the surface electronic structure to greatly boost its intrinsic activity. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm the reduction of the free energy of the OOH* intermediates. Consequently, our Co(OH)(x)S electrocatalyst exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 283 and 365 mV at 100 and 1000 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media, respectively, and its turnover frequency (TOF) is more than 4 times higher than the corresponding Co(OH)(x) catalysts. This heteroatom triggered surface engineering may open up avenues to explore other efficient non-noble metal electrocatalysts for water oxidation.									41	3	0	0	0	0	41			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000438665100008	29971287

Bimetallic transition metal sulphide (TMS) nanoarrays have been regarded as promising HER electrocatalyst owing to its high conductivity and synergy of different active sites. However, the reaction kinetic of HER for bimetallic TMS is sluggish probably due to the limited active sites for the dissociation of H2O molecule. Herein, NiFe-LDH (NFL) nanosheets are anchored on the ZnCo2S4 (ZCS) nanowire arrays supported on nickel foam (NF) to form core-shell hierarchical ZnCo2S4 @NiFe-LDH architecture (ZCS@NFL/NF). Resulting from the 3D core-shell architectures and synergy between ZCS and NFL, the ZCS@NFL/NF needs a low overpotential of 110 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) for HER in 1 M KOH, which is about 135 mV lower than the bare ZCS/NF and superior to many reported Co-/Ni-based-electrocatalysts. We anticipated that this work could open up an avenue for development of core-shell hierarchical architecture HER electrocatalysts by using LDHs materials as the H2O dissociation promoter.

Within alkaline systems, earth-abundant electro-catalysts could provide both these requirements. However, acontinued exploration of the reactivity and the causes behinddifferent behaviors in performance are necessary to guideoptimization and design. In this paper, Ta-doped NiO thinfilmsare prepared via DC magnetron sputtering (1-2-4 at % Ta) todemonstrate the effect of surface electronic modulation by non-3delements on the catalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).Material properties of the catalysts are analyzed via Rutherfordbackscattering spectrometry, X-ray diffractometry, photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Ta impurities are shown tobe directly responsible for increasing the valence state of Ni sites and enhancing reaction kinetics, resulting in performanceimprovements of up to 64 mV at 10 mA cm-2relative to pristine NiO. Particularly, we show that by applyingoperandoRamanspectroscopy, Ta enhances the ability to create high-valence Ni in gamma-NiOOH at a lower overpotential compared to the undopedsample. The lowered overpotentials of the OER can thus be attributed to the energetically less hindered advent of the creation of gamma-NiOOH species on the pre-catalyst surface: a phenomenon otherwise unresolved through simple voltammetry									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000810516000022	35692248

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is occurred at the anode of solid oxide electrolyzer as the O2- being oxidized and form O-2 gas, which is considered as one of the major cause of overpotentials in steam electrolyzers. This paper investigates the electrolysis of steam based on cobalt oxide impregnated La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) composite anode in an oxide-ion-conducting solid oxide electrolyzer. The conductivity of LSM is studied versus temperature and oxygen partial pressure and correlated to the electrochemical properties of the composite electrodes in symmetric cells at 800 degrees C. Different contents of Co3O4 (wt.1%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, 10%) were impregnated into LSM electrode and it was found that the polarization resistance (R-p) of symmetric cells gradually improved from 1.16 Omega center dot cm(2) (LSM) to 0.24 Omega center dot cm(2) (wt.10%Co3O4-LSM). Steam electrolysis based on LSM and wt.6%Co3O4-LSM anode electrolyzers are tested at 800 C and the AC impedance spectroscopy results indicated that the R-p of high frequency process significantly decreased from1.1 Omega center dot cm(2) (LSM) to 0.5 Omega center dot cm(2) (wt.6%Co3O4-LSM) under 1.8V electrolysis voltage and the R-p of low frequency process decreased from 14.9 Omega center dot cm(2) to 5.7 Omega center dot cm(2). Electrochemical catalyst Co3O4 can efficiently improve the electrode and enhance the performance of high temperature solid oxide electrolyzer.

J	Luo, Ming; Zhou, Lunzheng; Wang, Chao; Kuang, Cao								The evolution and desulfurization of sulfur in chemical looping combustion of coal								ENERGY SOURCES PART A-RECOVERY UTILIZATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS											10.1080/15567036.2021.1874079		JAN 2021			2021	Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is a new technology that has gained great attention due to its advantages in CO2 capture during combustion. Sulfur in coal maybe harmful to the CLC process. The interactions between sulfur and oxygen carrier may reduce the purity of carbon captured, and affect the characteristics of the oxygen carrier. Therefore, the evolution of sulfur in Xinzhou coal and the desulfurization performance in this process were studied by using iron ore as an oxygen carrier. Experimental results showed that the main sulfur-containing component released was SO2, and the fractions of sulfur during the reduction and oxidation periods reached 64.28 and 3.91%, respectively. The addition of desulfurization agent (CaO) could control the release of sulfur and a higher molar ratio of Ca/S resulted in less emission of sulfur-containing gases. The desulfurization efficiency reached 36.61%, 50.72%, and 55.45% when the Ca/S molar ratio was 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 respectively. Considering the investment and operation costs, the recommended molar ratio of Ca/S was 2.0. The formation of CaSO4 was confirmed after reaction, but the stability of CaSO4 and its effect on oxygen carrier over a longer period of time still need to be further studied.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1556-7036	1556-7230		WOS:000612455700001

JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				5	7			3172	3178		10.1039/c7ta00679a				FEB 21 2017	2017	Low Ir loading oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with superior activity and durability for proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers are an important topic in industry and academia. One possible strategy for addressing this challenge is the use of support materials that are stable under highly corrosive acidic environments at a high working potential (>1.4 V). Moreover, highly porous structure is another key criteria for OER catalyst support to achieve a high electrochemical surface area. Here, we report a novel Ir supported on a SnO2: Sb aerogel OER catalyst (Ir/SnO2:Sb-mod-V), which was prepared under ambient pressure by using vanadium additives. It shows an unrivaled activity and enhanced stability, on which vanadium does not play any active role but demonstrates the influences that changes the porosity of the aerogel support and affects the impurity content of the chlorine. By taking advantage of the high porosity of the aerogel substrate, Ir/SnO2: Sb-mod-V allows a decrease of more than 70 wt% for precious metal usage in the catalyst layer while keeping a similar OER activity compared to its unsupported counterpart.									31	0	0	0	0	0	33			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395077600012

EIS was used to obtain information on the porosity of the deposited materials, and to measure the capacity of the composites and its dependence on deposition charge.

When the Fe-based spinel oxides contain more than one oxidizable cation (for instance Fe2+, Mo3+ and Mo4+ in Mo ferrites), it has been demonstrated that each cation oxidizes in a well defined range in temperature in close relation with the cation-oxygen distance of the cation considered. The model involves both thermodynamics and kinetics considerations: thermodynamics involves the minimization of the Gibbs free energy and the kinetics oxidation has been explained on the basis of a diffusion-induced stress effect. Finite element calculations have been developped and applied to compute the features of the reaction in the case of V, Mn-Zn and Mo ferrites. In these materials, the model enables the evolution with time of oxidation to be explained. In the second part of the paper, the influence of the oxidation and reduction reactions occurring during all the stages of sintering upon both physical and mechanical properties is evidenced.					7th International Conference on Ferrites (ICF 7)7th International Conference on Ferrites (ICF 7)	SEP 03-06, 1996SEP 03-06, 1996		BORDEAUX, FRANCEBORDEAUX, FRANCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1155-4339			WOS:A1997XE52900009

However, the practical application of Li-rich oxides has been hindered by formidable challenges. To address these challenges, the understanding of their electrochemical behaviors becomes critical and is expected to offer effective guidance for both materials and cell development. This review aims to provide fundamental insights into the reaction mechanisms, electrochemical challenges and modification strategies of lithium-rich oxides. We first summarize the research history, the pristine structures, and the classification of lithium-rich oxides. Then we review the critical reaction mechanisms that are closely related to their electrochemical features and performances, such as lattice oxygen oxidation, oxygen vacancy formation, transition-metal migration, layered to spinel transitions, 'two-phase mechanism', and lattice evolution. These discussions are coupled with state-ofthe-art characterization techniques. As a comparison, the anionic redox reactions of layered sodium transition metal oxides are also discussed. Finally, after a brief overview of the correlation among the aforementioned mechanisms, we provide perspectives on the rational design of lithium-rich oxides with high energy densities and long-term cycling stability.									86	6	0	0	2	0	86			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000599751100002

This technique allowed us to follow the metal-to-insulator transformation of the top layer of the surface. An electronic signal corresponding to a metallic behavior of the surface evidences the presence of under-stoichiometric MgO species on the surface. The total covering by oxygen of the Mg surface uppermost layer, obtained at around 10 L of oxygen deposition, does not correspond to a fully insulating surface. An insulating surface is obtained after 30 L of oxygen deposition. Depositions of CO2 on a clean and a preoxidized polycrystalline Mg surface have been analyzed to give information about the composition of the surface and its evolution. CO2 adsorption in the form of CO32- compounds on preoxidized Mg is more efficient than on clean Mg. Oxygen species, corresponding to chemisorbed oxygen less bounded than oxygen in the MgO lattice, allows the formation of CO32-. Therefore, it is concluded that during oxygen deposition at room temperature, MgO islands and chemisorbed oxygen species coexist on the surface. Moreover, the larger the oxygen predeposition is, the less CO32- compounds are formed, meaning a decrease of available chemisorbed oxygen sites. From oxidation measurements at high temperature (420 K), we show that MgO islands and uncovered Mg domain coexist. Further, no under-stoichiometric compound features have been observed. The high temperature allows the direct formation of oxide MgO species in islands. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0368-2048			WOS:000170176700006

We determined the initial S-state distribution and the efficiency of the transition between these states including the probability of the O-2 yield through a fast mode. We observed discontinuous changes of the parameters at the temperatures 11 degreesC. 15 degreesC and 21 degreesC. Due to the mass spectroscopy data we think that the irregularity observed at 11 degreesC is due to conformational changes within the water catalytic site. We show that the different contributions of the slow. and fast modes of oxygen evolution and of the water molecule exchange are correlated and that their behavior can be explained in terms of the H2O accessibility to the water splitting enzyme.

Herein, Sr-doped Pr0.94Ba1-xSrxCo2O5+delta (PBSxCO) perovskite oxides are evaluated by experimental and theoretical studies. The phase transformation from tetragonal layered double perovskite to cubic simple perovskite can be identified with increasing the Sr fraction. Benefiting from enhanced electrical conductivity and oxygen surface rate, the PBSxCO catalysts deliver excellent electrochemical performance, as evidenced by symmetrical and completed cells test. Among all compositions, the Pr0.94Ba0.7Sr0.3Co2O5+delta (PBS0.3C0) cathode has the lowest polarization resistance (R-p) of 0.031 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C. The PBS0.3C0 cathode-based fuel cell produces a peak power density of 1077 mW cm(-2), along with a steady operating for 130 h at 700 degrees C. From the density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations, it is discovered that stronger Co 3d-O 2p hybridization is recognized in the Sr substituting model compared with undoped one. Furthermore, the decreased free energy for oxygen adsorption may facilitate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics. These findings highlight the origin of optimal ORR activity induced by A-site alkaline earth doping in the perovskite catalysts, endowing the rational design of oxide catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000843899200001

However, catalysts with excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performances are relatively few. Although metal-ionic-conductor K2Fe4O7 (KFO) can output large current densities for OER/HER even in 10.0 M KOH electrolyte, its water-splitting property still needs to be further improved. Herein, we introduced V5+ directly into KFO and synthesized the binder-free nickel foam (NF) basal V-KFO nanoparticles (labeled as V-KFO/NF). Both the theoretical analysis and actual experimental data certify that V5+ doping enhances the instinct water-splitting property of V-KFO/NF. Additionally, V-KFO/NF can directly serve as the air cathode of liquid/flexible ZABs. The assembled liquid ZAB can continue the charge-discharge cycling testing with a lower voltage gap (0.834 V) and a longer operation life (> 550 h) at 10 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, the assembled flexible ZAB can drive the two-electrode water-splitting unit of V-KFO/NF and needs only 1.54 V to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than that of KFO/NF (1.59 V). This work not only provides a novel and efficient trifunctional catalyst for a self-powered water-splitting device but also is the foundation support for other heteroatom-doped low-cost materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000840538300001	35939293

In this study, Co?Ni phosphides encapsulated in N, P co-doped carbon (CoNiP/PNC) were prepared by a simple one-step pyrolysis method. The obtained catalyst exhibited outstanding oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR and OER) activities in alkaline media. It exhibited a positive half-wave potential of 0.84 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode for ORR, as well as a low overpotential of 470 mV to achieve 10 mA cm-2 for OER, comparable with the benchmark Pt/C and IrO2 catalysts. Furthermore, the rechargeable Zn-air battery was fabricated, which showed a high specific capacity of 729.3 mAh gZn-1, a high peak power density of 171.0 mW cm? 2, and good stability. It reveals that the interplay between heteroatom-doped carbon layers and Co?Ni phase leads to the high ORR activity, and the insitu formed bimetallic hydroxides/oxides contribute to the great OER performance. This work would inspire the future development of bifunctional electrocatalysts towards electrocatalysis in energy conversion and storage fields.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000645118400003

Tests for spontaneous ignition of solid materials								Flammability Testing of Materials Used in Construction, Transport and Mining								385	442						2006	2006	Several test methods have been developed to evaluate the propensity of a solid toward self-heating and spontaneous combustion. These techniques were designed to evaluate one of the phenomena occurring during the spontaneous combustion process: oxygen consumption by a solid, formation of the oxidation products in gas or solid phase, evolution of heat, and mass change in the solid. The classical methods include adiabatic calorimetry, crossing-point temperature and 'oxygen adsorption' techniques. The indexes established for ranking the susceptibility of a solid to self-heating or auto-ignition can be classified into four categories: (i) critical temperature for the onset of self-heating or auto-ignition; (ii) reactivity of the solid toward oxygen; (iii) capacity of the solid to liberate oxidation products; (iv) apparent kinetic data for the exothermic reactions occurring during the auto-ignition process. However, no concensus exists in the literature on the most reliable index for assessing the behaviour of the spontaneous combustion of a solid.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4					978-1-85573-935-2	INSPEC:9560084

Considering the metallic Ag possessing good electrical conductivity and excellent catalytic activity and perovskite oxides exhibiting high abundance, an easily tunable structure, and excellent intrinsically catalytic activity, we adopt the ultraviolet light to realize the deposition of Ag nanoparticles on the La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Mn0.1O3 (LSFM) substrate as a high-performance cathode for LOBs. The results confirm that the synergetic effect of Ag nanoparticle decoration and the La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Mn0.1O3 substrate could dramatically improve the electronic conductivity and ORR/OER kinetics of the nanohybrids. Ag@LSFM hybrids with abundant active sites and considerable electronic conductivity promote the deposition of a thinner discharge product film, and the corresponding LOBs deliver high discharge capacity (12 477 mAh g(-1)), a small gap between charge and discharge potentials (similar to 1.3 V), and high cycling stability (147 cycles). Overall, the study suggests that such a bifunctional catalyst is a promising candidate in LOBs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000703338600071

This model is based on a set of mass balance equations for all the considered species, coupled with the discharge power balance equation and the charge neutrality condition. The present study is an extension of the kinetic global model previously developed for SF6/Ar ICP plasma discharges [Lallement et al., Plasma Sources Sci. Technol. 18, 025001 (2009)]. It is focused on the study of the impact of the O-2 addition to the SF6/Ar gas mixture on the plasma kinetic properties. The simulation results show that the electron density increases with the %O-2, which is due to the decrease of the plasma electronegativity, while the electron temperature is almost constant in our pressure range. The density evolutions of atomic fluorine and oxygen versus %O-2 have been analyzed. Those atomic radicals play an important role in the silicon etching process. The atomic fluorine density increases from 0 up to 40% O-2 where it reaches a maximum. This is due to the enhancement of the SF6 dissociation processes and the production of fluorine through the reactions between SFx and O. This trend is experimentally confirmed. On the other hand, the simulation results show that O(3p) is the preponderant atomic oxygen. Its density increases with % O-2 until reaching a maximum at almost 40% O-2. Over this value, its diminution with O-2% can be justified by the high increase in the loss frequency of O(3p) by electronic impact in comparison to its production frequency by electronic impact with O-2.

A thermochemically derived global reaction mechanism for detonation application								SHOCK WAVES				22	4			363	379		10.1007/s00193-012-0375-x				JUL 2012	2012	A 4-species 4-step global reaction mechanism for detonation calculations is derived from detailed chemistry through thermochemical approach. Reaction species involved in the mechanism and their corresponding molecular weight and enthalpy data are derived from the real equilibrium properties. By substituting these global species into the results of constant volume explosion and examining the evolution process of these global species under varied conditions, reaction paths and corresponding rates are summarized and formulated. The proposed mechanism is first validated to the original chemistry through calculations of the CJ detonation wave, adiabatic constant volume explosion, and the steady reaction structure after a strong shock wave. Good agreement in both reaction scales and averaged thermodynamic properties has been achieved. Two sets of reaction rates based on different detailed chemistry are then examined and applied for numerical simulations of two-dimensional cellular detonations. Preliminary results and a brief comparison between the two mechanisms are presented. The proposed global mechanism is found to be economic in computation and also competent in description of the overall characteristics of detonation wave. Though only stoichiometric acetylene-oxygen mixture is investigated in this study, the method to derive such a global reaction mechanism possesses a certain generality for premixed reactions of most lean hydrocarbon mixtures.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0938-1287	1432-2153		WOS:000305679600009

When the dissolved oxygen concentration was less than 7 mg L-1, the cathodic protection potential showed a plateau at the initial polarization, and then quickly shifted negatively. While the dissolved oxygen was more than 9 mg L-1, the potential shifted negatively in a linear form. After 168 h of polarization, the final protection potential shifted negatively with the decreasing dissolved oxygen concentration. The deposition progress was monitored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and only one single loop was found in Nyquist diagram, indicating deposits of ineffective protectiveness precipitation under the experimental conditions. The protection factor of deposits increased with the decreasing dissolved oxygen concentration which was detected by linear polarization resistance technique. The cathodic electrochemical reaction could change very shortly from oxygen reduction to hydrogen evolution after cathodic protection under very low dissolved oxygen concentration, such as 1 mg L-1, resulting in the hydrogen bubbling from the metallic surface and the decrease of deposits protection factor. Observation by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis demonstrated that the deposits were mainly of calcite under the experimental conditions, and that dissolved oxygen had no effect on the crystalline types of calcium carbonate.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1672-5182	1993-5021		WOS:000396071600008

A Cu-based metal-organic framework (Cu-II-MOF) consisting of trinuclear mixed-ligand units was prepared under hydrothermal conditions, and the structure, morphology, and elemental composition were characterized by (single crystal) XRD, TEM, SEM, XPS, BET, TGA and ATR-FTIR. Doping of 9.2 wt% Cu-II-MOF powder into the carbon paste electrode caused a roughly 440 mV positive shift of the HER potential at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M H2SO4. The Cu-II-MOF showed a high working stability due to the dual-ligand-protected Cu active centers. The intrinsic catalytic mechanism was investigated by Tafel slope analysis, solid state electrochemistry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The Cu-II ions in the Cu-II-MOF are successively reduced through two single-electron steps over a potential range of 0.7 to 0.1 V vs. RHE to form single-atom Cu-0 active centers, on which adsorbed H atoms can be generated with a positive onset potential of about 100 mV vs. RHE through a following chemical redox reaction. The mechanistic findings point out the necessity and feasibility of developing bicomponent or bifunctional MOF-based catalysts to efficiently accelerate both the first and second electron transfer steps of HER.

Focusing on this, we systematically investigated the relationship between structures of materials and their OER performances by taking four 2D alpha-Ni(OH)(2) as model materials, including layer stacked bud-like Ni(OH)(2)-NB, flower-like Ni(OH)(2)-NF, and petal-like Ni(OH)(2)-NP as well as the ultralarge sheet like Ni(OH)(2)-NS. For the first three (layer-stacking) catalysts, with the decrease of stacked layers, their accessible surface areas, abilities to adsorb OH-, diffusion properties, and the intrinsic activities of active sites increase, which accounts for their steadily enhanced activity. As expected, Ni(OH)(2)-NP shows the lowest overpotential (260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (78.6 mV dec(-1)) with a robust stability over 10 h among the samples, which also outperforms the benchmark IrO2 (360 mV and 115.8 mV dec(-1)) catalyst. Interestingly, Ni(OH)(2)-NS relative to Ni(OH)(2)-NP exhibits even faster substance diffusion due to the sheet-like structure, but shows inferior OER activity, which is mainly because the Ni(OH)(2)-NP with a smaller size possesses more active boundary sites (higher reactivity of active sites) than Ni(OH)(2)-NS, considering the adsorption properties and accessible surface areas of the two samples are quite similar. By comparing the different structures and their OER behaviors of four alpha-Ni(OH)(2) samples, our work may shed some light on the structure effect of 2D materials and accelerate the development of efficient OER catalysts.									134	5	0	0	3	0	133			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000431088200083	29630354

However, the synthesis of 1D perovskite nanostructures with anion dopants remains a challenge, as well as insights into the performance origin from experimental and theoretical views. Herein, combined with electrospinning and phosphatizing strategies, P-doped Pr0.5La0.5BaCo2O5+delta perovskite nanofibers (P-PLBC-F) are reported for highly active HER catalysts. The P-PLBC-F catalyst outperforms the classic perovskites and can be comparable to the commercial Pt/C (wt(Pt) = 20%) benchmark, exhibiting a Tafel slope of -32.9 mV dec(-1) and overpotential of -307 mV at 500 mA cm(-2) (disk) in alkaline media. The highly catalytic activity benefits from the desired 1D nanostructure, steered electronic structures (charge transfer energy Delta(Co-P) = 0.79 eV) and Gibbs free energy for the H* desorption (1.02 eV) induced by the P3- doping, as supported by density functional theory calculations.

Herein, we report numerous CoFe alloy nanoparticles, with tunable compositions, anchored firmly over the well-designed oxygen-dopants-rich carbon nanoboxes (CoFe@C NBs) as an active electrocatalyst for electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is fabricated via a facile cation exchange and pyrolysis strategy. Thanks to the robust interfacial electronic coupling and the highly-exposed synergetic bimetallic centers, this optimized CoFe-27 @C NBs with the Co: Fe atomic ratio of 5.4: 1 could exhibit superior activity, excellent long-term stability and high methanol tolerance during a long-term ORR operation, with an excellent half-wave potential of 0.90 V and decent limiting current density of 5.4 mA cm-2, comparable with the commercial Pt/C catalysts and being one of the most active transition-metal ORR electrocatalysts developed. By the atomic-level synchrotron radiation char-acterizations and the detailed electrochemical measurements, it can be found that the strong electronic coupling at the metal-support interface could effectively promote the charge transfer and catalytic reaction kinetics, contributing to efficient 4e- ORR for CoFe-27 @C NBs.

In this work, iridium-cobalt (IreCo) thin films were galvanostatically electrodeposited on a copper (Cu) foam electrode as an electrocatalyst for water splitting in 1.0 M KOH alkaline medium. The effects of loading and solution temperature on hydrogen evolution performance of Ir-Co deposits were investigated. The results show that Ir-Co deposits were adhered to substrates, with porous structure and hollow topography. The concentrations of Ir in the deposits with the loadings of 4.6, 3.2 and 0.8 mg.cm(-2) were 88, 88 and 75 wt%, respectively. IreCo deposit with the loading of 3.2 mg.cm(-2) required an overpotential of 108 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction to reach a current density of 30 mA cm(-2), having a low Tafel slope value of 36 mV.dec(-1). The changes in the solution temperature and catalyst loading had a significant effect on hydrogen evolution performance of Ir-Co/Ir-Co-O electrocatalysts. With the increasing of catalyst loading, the electrocatalytic activity increased firstly and then decreased. As the solution temperature was increased from 20 to 40 degrees C, the electrocatalytic activity of Ir-Co-O electrocatalyst increased, and then decreased with the rising of temperature. The apparent thermal activation energy obtained from Arrhenius plot was similar to 13.9 kJ mol(-1). Ir-Co/Ir-Co-O deposits exhibited relatively good electrocatalytic stability and durability. The present work demonstrates a possible pathway to develop a highly active and durable substitute for thin film electrocatalysts for water splitting of hydrogen evolution reaction.

However, its inherent drawbacks, including wide bandgap and fast recombination of charge carriers, lead to the underutilization of solar light. Increasing the overall solar spectrum utilization of TiO2, especially in the near-infrared region (NIR, approximate to 52%), is the key to efficient solar energy conversion. In this review, the strategies to enhance NIR light capture of TiO2-based photocatalysts, including hybridization with narrow optical gap semiconductors, bandgap engineering, upconversion materials, plasmonic materials, and photosensitizers, are elaborated. The basic mechanisms for NIR light conversion employed by TiO2 and the preparation methods of photoactive materials are summarized.

In this regard, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as potential bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting, but still suffer from high overpotentials. Herein, we report Mo and Co doped nanostructured 1T-VS2 directly grown on carbon cloth in a one step hydrothermal reaction as a binder free highly active bifunctional electrocatalyst for the HER and OER in alkaline media. The bifunctional electrocatalytic properties are tuned by optimizing the doping concentration of the heteroatoms. Various physicochemical results demonstrate that 10% molar doping of Mo and Co in VS2 (10:MoCo-VS2) leads to the highest bifunctional activities demanding HER and OER overpotentials of only 63 and 248 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, a 10:MoCo-VS2 based electrolyzer fabricated using 10:MoCo-VS2 as both the anode and cathode also demonstrated high overall water splitting activity demanding a low cell potential of only 1.54 V to generate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with long-term stability (35 h), which are attributed to its ultrathin and mesoporous nature, expanded interlayer spacing (similar to 63%), activated basal planes, and abundant active sites resulting from the synergistic effect of optimized Mo and Co dual doping into the 1T-VS2 host material. This study thus presents a facile approach for designing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts based on heteroatoms doped VS2 for electrocatalytic water splitting in alkaline media.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000773631900001

Metal catalysts such as copper, gold, silver, tin, bismuth, etc., attract great attention for their high efficiency to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals such as CO, HCOOH, C2H4 and C2H5OH. It is of interest that the unstable metal-based compounds can be considered as pre-catalysts due to the in situ formation of a metallic state during CO2RR, resulting in a reconstruction of surface catalytic structures that mediate much higher CO2RR activity than their metal foil counterparts. However, the precise evolution process of the catalysts during CO2RR and ultimate active sites of the catalyst have not been fully tracked and determined. In this review, we summarize the recent development of metal oxides, metal dichalcogenides, metal halides, metal nitrides and metal-organic compound pre-catalysts, and focus on the structural evolution during the activation process. The key structural factors that impact the performance of catalysts are analyzed in-depth in terms of the remnant of anion elements, enhanced surface areas, facet orientation, and grain boundaries. A perspective is also provided to tackle the critical challenges in designing highly efficient CO2RR pre-catalysts, including the manipulation and identification of surface roughness, structure disorder and partial oxidation of metal center, the monitoring and regeneration of catalysts under a long-time operation, the elimination of impurities during operation and fine control of multicomponent for structural regulation.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000684634500001

The study and analysis of the changes on the electron localisation function topology along a given reaction path reveals fluxes of electron density, allowing to unambiguously identify the main chemical events happening along the chemical reactions. This analysis shows that the first hydrogen transfer (with hydride character) occurs before the transition state (TS), while the second hydrogen transfer (with proton character) takes places after having reached the TS. The lower energy barrier found for formaldehyde over ethene is explained by two reasons. First, the hydride transfer is favoured for the C=O bond over C=C due to the electrophilic character of the carbon atom. Second, a negatively charged CH3-X (X=CH2, O) hidden intermediate is formed in the proximities of the TS region. The oxygen atom is able to stabilise this negatively charged species more effectively than the CH2 group due to its higher electronegativity and the presence of V(O) lone pairs. The obtained analysis explains and rationalises catalyst chemoselectivity (C=O vs. C=C). Finally, a curly arrow representation diagram accounting for the electronic rearrangements is proposed on the basis of BET results.[GRAPHICS].									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0026-8976	1362-3028		WOS:000468552600024

The electrocatalytic facility in water-splitting is manifested in two of the electrochemical output parameters: the lower onset potential and the higher peak current response. The robustness of the envisioned scheme of using lanthanum cerates perovskite (LaCeO3; LCO) in combination with doped compositions provides better electrochemical results for water-splitting when comparing to the use of costly metallic or alloy nanomaterials. Lanthanum cerates were researched for the B-site doping effect on the resulting chemistry for the water electrocatalysis. Series of LaCe1-xMxO3+delta (LCMO; M = Fe3+, Cr3+, Cu2+, Zn2+; x = 0.02-0.10) nanopowders were synthesized and tested electrochemically by using cyclic voltammetry and impedance analysis for water-splitting in alkaline methanol at ambient conditions. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was evidenced by the multifold water-splitting current with perovskite powders coated on to the glassy carbon (GC) electrode. An obvious correspondence was detected between the electrocatalytic activity and the morphological, structural properties of perovskite ceramic powders. (C) 2020 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

Developing high activity electro-catalysts towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial to improve the energy-conversion efficiency of water electrolysis. In this work, heterogeneous nanostructures of NiFe hydroxide composites decorated by Ni metal were directly grown on a porous nickel foam (NF) substrate through an ultrafast electrodeposition process at a large cathodic current density of 1.5Acm(-2) within only 2 seconds. The as-prepared Ni/NiFe (OH)(x)-1500 electrode offers a low OER overpotential of 240 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 290 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 36 mV Dec(-1), which are superior to those of a commercial RuO2/Ti electrode. Moreover, Ni/NiFe (OH)(x)-1500 shows good stability and low cell voltage in the long-time alkaline-water splitting. Additionally, the Ni/NiFe (OH)(x)-1500 electrode also displays excellent electro-catalytic activity toward the oxidation of hydrazine and glucose. This work provides a facile and rapid method to obtain high performance multifunctional electro-catalysts.									17	0	0	0	3	0	17			2196-0216			WOS:000444225300011

Electrocatalysts that satisfy these conditions can be composed of Ti and other metals, supported or not by carbonaceous materials. The present work reports the application of synthesized three-dimensional Ti/Pt-Pd nanoparticles with highly rough surfaces supported on graphene nanoribbons (Ti/Pt-Pd/GNR nanocomposite) by a single one-pot reaction, and applied in ORR. Unlike the effect of strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), which favors electrons transfer from the metal support to the catalyst, the mechanism employed in this study favored the transfer of electrons from the catalyst to the metal support; in other words, the mechanism led to the oxidation of Pt and Pd. Pt, which exhibited Pt-Pd type alloy features, was found to be more externally distributed at the rough surface of the metallic structures. Additionally, Ti, which presented oxide features, was found to be even more externally distributed at the surface of Pt-Pd on non-electrochemically and electrochemically stabilized Ti/Pt-Pd/GNR nanocomposite electrodes. Since all these metals have great amounts of different oxides (i. e. are highly oxidized), the oxides are found to be energetically responsible for the improvement in ORR electrocatalytic activity and stability of Ti/Pt-Pd/GNR/GC electrodes in comparison with the ORR responses for PtC TKK/GC and Pt-Pd/GNR/GC modified electrodes. To Ti-containing catalysts, the high activity is attributable to enhancing the intrinsic activity and the high selectivity to 4-electron ORR is due to the fact that presence of Ti contributes to oxygen-binding energy of these nanocomposites shifts toward more positive values (weakening oxygen bonding).									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2196-0216			WOS:000525948800014

In this regard, multifunctional NiVCe-layered double hydroxide (NiVCe-LDH) nanoparticles were synthesized by the modified sol-gel method. The analysis of this material demonstrated excellent potential for its utilization as electrode materials for hybrid supercapacitor, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and sensor applications. The NiVCe-LDH nanoparticles delivered a specific charge of 740 C g(-1) at 10 A g(-1) and decent rate performance (charge retention of 68.7% at 100 A g(-1)), showing excellent prospects as electrode material for hybrid energy storage devices. In addition, NiVCe-LDH nanoparticles have also been successfully applied as a proof-of-concept for OER, as confirmed by their low Tafel slope of 47 mV dec(-1). Finally, trimetallic NiVCe-LDH-based screen-printed electrodes were developed for the sensing of hydrogen peroxide directly in a real complex mouthwash sample, achieving a satisfactory recovery value of around 98% using a fast and simple batch injection analysis procedure. These results allow us to predict the great potential of this trimetallic hydroxide for building electrochemical sensors with good perspectives as electroactive material for OER processes and energy storage technologies.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2296-8016			WOS:000731702400001

Besides, V-O was confirmed to participate in the decomposition of water, the direct thermal application of reductive photo-induced V-O has been considered an adaptive method for solar utilization. Here, the generation and consumption of V(O)s was detected on titanium dioxide surface, base mechanism and produced hydrogen was further obtained. The photochemical activity boosted upon transition metal doping, and the water splitting performance rise to 12.97-fold result from the increased amount of photoinduced V(O)s. Furthermore, the reaction pathway density functional theory calculations exhibited the difficulty during hydrogen molecule formation, guiding the metal particles loading to improve the V(O)s reactivity. A maximum hydrogen yield was achieved on Ni/Cu-TiO2 equal to 27.01 mu mol/g-cat, which was approximately 36.0 times the behave of bare titanium dioxide. These conclusions demonstrate the obvious impact of quantity and quality of photo-induced V(O)s in V-O-based reactions, and contribute to a new approach for solar functional material engineering.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000613346400004

This review discusses design strategies for state-of-the-art heterogeneous electrocatalysts and associated materials for several different electrochemical transformations involving water, hydrogen, and oxygen, using theory as a means to rationalize catalyst performance. By examining the common principles that govern catalysis for different electrochemical reactions, we describe a systematic framework that clarifies trends in catalyzing these reactions, serving as a guide to new catalyst development while highlighting key gaps that need to be addressed. We conclude by extending this framework to emerging clean energy reactions such as hydrogen peroxide production, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction, where the development of improved catalysts could allow for the sustainable production of a broad range of fuels and chemicals.									5607	307	2	0	326	1	5647			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000391743700032	28082532

Herein, we report a nitridation route to prepare a hierarchical structured Ru/TiOxNy nanobelt electrocatalyst through the thermal treatment of Ru/H2Ti2O5 in ammonia. As-synthesized Ru/TiOxNy shows high HER activity with a low overpotential of 16 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1), and a high mass activity of 4.2 A mg(-1) at 100 mV in alkaline solution, superior to most previously reported noble-metal electrocatalysts. The characterization results imply that nitridation could modify the chemical environment and electronic structure at the interfaces of Ru/TiOxNy, which would not only decrease the adsorption energy of hydrogen intermediates via reducing the content of oxygen vacancies, but would also improve electron transfer through Ru-N bonds. This work provides a meaningful strategy for the design and synthesis of cost-effective and high-activity electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy conversion.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000790404600001

Perovskite oxides show compositional flexibility and high property tunability, while poor electrical conductivity and relatively low HER activity hamper their application in overall water splitting. Here, a conductive monoclinic SrIrO3 perovskite is developed as an excellent alkaline electrocatalyst with bifunctionality which can be easily synthesized under normal conditions. Toward the HER, it experiences progressive surface self-reconstruction during the activation process because of lattice Sr2+ leaching, eventually leading to a remarkable apparent activity with an approximately 11-fold enhancement at 200 mV overpotential relative to the fresh sample. Experimental and theoretical evidence reveals that etching of lattice Sr2+ in relatively less-stable SrIrO3 compared to IrO2 is crucial for triggering this self-reconstruction. Toward the OER, no obvious surface reconstruction occurs, and an overpotential of only 300 mV is required to realize 10 mA cm(geo)(-2) , significantly lower than that for most perovskites reported previously (340-450 mV). The activated SrIrO3 from HER operation can be used alternatively as an OER electrocatalyst with further improved performance. A SrIrO3-based two-electrode water-splitting cell shows exceptional performance, that is, 1.59 V@10 mA cm(geo)(-2 )with negligible performance degradation over 10 h.									45	2	0	0	3	0	43			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000541499600011

This review starts by summarizing typical crystal structures, molecular building blocks, and common synthetic procedures of various porphyrin-based frameworks used in energy-related technologies. Then, a brief introduction is provided and representative applications of porphyrin-based frameworks in ORR, OER, Zn-air batteries, and CO2RR are discussed. The performance comparison of these porphyrin-based frameworks in each field is also summarized and discussed, which pinpoints a clear structure-activity relationship. In addition to utilizing highly active porphyrin units for catalytic conversions, regulating the porous structures of porphyrin-based frameworks will enhance mass transfer and growing porphyrin-based frameworks on conductive supports will accelerate electron transfer, which will result in the improvement of the electrocatalytic performance. This review is therefore valuable for the rational design of more efficient porphyrin-based framework catalytic systems in energy-related conversion and storage technologies.									111	9	1	0	6	0	111			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000624298500010	33475099

Herein, we report a facile hydrothermal route to tailor a new type of N, P co-doped carbon architecture with Fe2P nanoparticles embedded/encapsulated in the crumped carbon nanosheets. The rational design of carbon shell structure in strong interaction with rGO endows the catalyst with graphitic-N abundance, mesoporous structure dominance and active Fe2P isolation. We propose the pyrolyzed dicyandiamidederived carbon fragment as not only an additional nitrogen resource but a favorable microstructured separator and protective porous layer for metal agglomeration and demetallation, which ensures the catalyst with excellent activity and stability. The co-doped carbon shows excellent activity with positive half-wave potential of +0.823 V via complete 4 electron pathway, close to that of Pt/C material (+0.831 V). The inspiring durability is confirmed by merely 2 mV negative potential shifts after 1000 cycles of CV tests.

Since this is the only cluster established in biological water oxidation catalysis, efforts have been made to develop synthetic systems that mimic its structure, properties and water oxidation activity. This perspective provides a brief overview of the current structural and mechanistic understanding of the OEC in photosystem II. It then compares the structural features of this complex with those of manganese oxide water oxidation catalysts and discusses structure-function relationships that inform the development of new catalysts. The identified features should be considered when endeavouring to design manganese oxide, and other metal oxide, catalysts with optimal activity that can ultimately be integrated into photo-electrochemical devices to achieve solar water-splitting.									135	3	0	0	19	0	136			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000337977600008

The synthesized CuGaO2 nanoflakes and microplates were first thoroughly characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, SEM, EDX, XPS, FT-1R, UV-Vis and BET surface area measurements. Moreover, their electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.5 M KOH electrolyte versus Ag/AgCl along with their stability were studied as a cost-effective and active electrode material for water splitting application. Based on cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements, the onset potential, current density, Tafel slope, charge transfer resistance, and stability were obtained and compared. It was demonstrated that the delafossite CuGaO2 nanoflakes synthesized in the presence of SDS at certain concentrations showed better (photo)electrocatalytic performance and stability for OER than those synthesized without the presence of surfactant SDS.

Herein, N-doped Ni3S2/N-doped MoS2 1D hetero-nanowires supported by Ni foam (N-Ni3S2/N-MoS2/NF) are readily synthesized through a chemical transformation strategy by using NiMoO4 nanowire array growth on Ni foam (NiMoO4/NF) as the starting material. With the in situ generation of Ni3S2/MoS2 heterointerfaces within nanowires and the incorporation of N- anions, an extraordinary hydrophilic nature with abundant, well-exposed active sites and optimal reaction dynamics for both oxidation and reduction of water are obtained. Attributed to these properties, as-converted N-Ni3S2/N-MoS2/NF exhibits highly efficient electrocatalytic activities for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions under alkaline conditions. The superior bifunctional properties of N-Ni3S2/N-MoS2/NF enable it to effectively catalyze the overall water-splitting reaction.									22	0	0	0	2	0	22			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000496866900001	31599996	
J	Haddouche, A.; Lemerini, M.								Chemical Analysis of NOx Removal Under Different Reduced Electric Fields								PLASMA SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				17	7			589	594		10.1088/1009-0630/17/7/11				JUL 2015	2015	This work presents a chemical kinetic analysis of different species involved in nitrogen-oxygen mixed gas induced by stationary corona discharge at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. This study takes into account twenty different chemical species participating in one hundred and seventy selected chemical reactions. The reaction rate coefficients are taken from the literature, and the density is analyzed by the continuity equation without the diffusion term. A large number of investigations considered the removal of NO showing the effects of N, O and O-3 radicals. The aim of the present simulation is to complete these studies by analysing various plasma species under different reduced electric fields in the range of 100-200 Td (1 Td=10(-21) v.m(2)) In particular, we analyze the time evolution of depopulation (10(-9)-10(-3) s) of NOx. We have found that the depopulation rate of NO and NO2 is substantially affected by the rise of reduced electric field as it grows from 100 Td to 200 Td. This allows us to ascertain the important role played by the reduced electric field.									10	5	0	0	0	0	10			1009-0630			WOS:000356792200011

To address these issues, a search for a low-cost, Co-free Li-rich cathode materials with a better surface structural stability than LR-NCMs is ongoing. One of such compounds is Li1.16Ni0.19Fe0.18Mn0.46O2 (LNFM). Our as-synthesized LNFM cathode not only delivers a high specific capacity of 229 mAh g(-1) with the capacity retention of 83% in half-cell and 81% in a full-cells but also a stable average discharge voltage, even when cycled at C/5 rate to upper cutoff potential of 4.8 V vs Li+/Li in additive-free electrolyte. Both operando and post mortem characterization was used to understand the structural changes, gas evolution and oxygen redox processes of LNFM material, as well as to understand cathode-electrolyte interfacial reactions and their correlation to the improved electrochemical performance. The gained understanding will help designing new high-capacity Co-free cathode materials, meeting the performance requirements for future high-energy density batteries.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000782413200005

Herein, SnS2 nanosheets (SnS2 NSs)-modified TiO2 nanobelts (TiO2 NBs) (TiO2/SnS2) electrocatalyst with significant enhancement of the OER activity was successfully synthesized by the hydrothermal method. This was achieved by taking advantage of the fast radial transfer of the one-dimensional (1-D) TiO2 NBs, large areas of contact with the electrolyte and the stability of the two-dimensional (2-D) SnS2 NSs. The experimental results indicate that the change in the valence bond environment due to the formation of the heterojunction and the independent exposed crystal facets could distinctly reduce the charge-transfer resistance and the adsorption barrier of the H2O molecules in electrocatalytic water splitting, which are favourable for improving the OER activity. The synergistic effect of the valence bond environment and exposed crystal facets of the TiO2/SnS2 heterojunction catalyst have led to remarkable OER performance with an overpotential of 570 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 10(7) mV dec(-1) and long-time durability in alkaline solution. This non-precious TiO2/SnS2 heterojunction catalyst was designed based on the concept of combining valance factors and crystal facet engineering, which sheds light on a new pathway for the design of new, promising and highly efficient OER electrocatalysts.									37	0	0	0	1	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000425623600023

Here, we propose a nitrogen source-mediated strategy to synthesize active-N-rich defective carbon nanotube encapsulated Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles (denoted as Fe-N-OCNT)viaone-step pyrolysis of OCNTs, Fe-Phen and an additional small molecule nitrogen source. N-source-regulated N configuration and steric hindrance effect of Fe-Phen coordination structures is proved to be a key factor affecting the electrocatalytic activity towards ORR and OER. The resulting Fe-N-OCNT exhibits a high half-wave potential of 0.86 V (vs.RHE) for ORR, and a low overpotential of 0.353 V for OER as well as a reversible oxygen electrode index of 0.723 V, superior to those of most recently reported advanced bifunctional catalysts. Multiple active component Fe/Fe3C cores strongly synergized with active N-rich carbon layers are responsible for the superior bifunctional electrocatalytic activity by forming a favorable interfacial electron interaction. Impressively, the assembled Zn-air batteries with the Fe-N-OCNT catalyst as the bifunctional air electrode deliver excellent charging-discharging performance, high power density (128.8 mW cm(-2)), energy density (779.3 W h kg(-1)) and long lifespan, demonstrating great potential for practical implementation.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000544759800063

The oxygen evolving centre is an integral part of PSII, and extracts an electron from water. PSI accepts the electron, and accumulates reducing power. Traditionally, PSI and PSII are thought to be spatially dispersed. Here, we show that about half of PSIIs are physically connected to PSIs in Arabidopsis thaliana. In the PSI-PSII complex, excitation energy is transferred efficiently between the two closely interacting reaction centres. PSII diverts excitation energy to PSI when PSII becomes closed-state in the PSI-PSII complex. The formation of PSI-PSII complexes is regulated by light conditions. Quenching of excess energy by PSI might be one of the physiological functions of PSI-PSII complexes.									79	3	0	0	68	0	82			2041-1723			WOS:000352634800004	25809225

With three selected examples from our recent studies of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC), we show that a better understanding of heat and mass transport is important to improve the fuel cell performance and operating stability. The first example is about passive DMFCs (with neither liquid pumps nor gas compressors). We show that a change in the feed methanol concentration in a passive DMFC not only alters the rate of methanol transport, but also changes the cell operating temperature. As a result, the kinetics of both the methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions change with methanol concentration. The second example is to show the coupling of oxygen transport and fuel cell operating stabilities. It is demonstrated that the DMFC equipped with the conventional serpentine fields usually suffers from serious discharging instabilities when the oxygen flow rate is low. We invented a so-called convection-enhanced serpentine flow field (CESFF) and found that with this new flow field the oxygen flow rate required to ensure a stable operation was significantly reduced. The application of CESFF enables a reduction in the parasitic power in the fuel-cell system and leads to a higher system efficiency. The third example is about the coupling of oxygen transport and electrochemical reactions in DMFCs. In conventional wisdom, the DMFC is an electrochemical device to generate electricity. However, we discovered that the DMFC can also be used to produce hydrogen besides its function of generating electricity.

While so far regarded as fast when compared to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) regained interest in the last few years owing to its poor kinetics in alkaline electrolytes. Indeed, this slow kinetics not only may hinder the foreseen development of the anionic exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE), but also raises fundamental questions regarding the parameters governing the reaction. In this perspective, we first briefly review the fundamentals of the HER, emphasizing how studies performed on model electrodes allowed for achieving a good understanding of its mechanism under acidic conditions. Then, we discuss how the use of physical descriptors capturing the sole properties of the catalyst is not sufficient to describe the HER kinetics under alkaline conditions, thus forcing the catalysis community to adopt a more complex picture taking into account the electrolyte structure at the electrochemical interface. This work also outlines new techniques, such as spectroscopies, molecular simulations, or chemical approaches that could be employed to tackle these new fundamental challenges, and potentially guide the future design of practical and cheap catalysts while also being useful to a wider community dealing with electrochemical energy storage devices using aqueous electrolytes.									290	5	0	0	11	0	291			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000490984300001	32015799

We describe here an unconventional heterostructure composed of strongly coupled Ni-deficient LixNiO nanoclusters and polycrystalline Ni nanocrystals and its exceptional activities toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous electrolytes. The presence of lattice oxygen species with strong Brensted basicity is a significant feature in such heterostructure, which spontaneously split water molecules for accelerated Volmer H-OH dissociation in neutral and alkaline HER. In combination with the intimate LixNiO and Ni interfacial junctions that generate localized hotspots for promoted hydride coupling and hydrogen desorption, the catalysts produce hydrogen at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under overpotentials of only 20, 50, and 36 mV in acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes, respectively, making them among the most active Pt-free catalysts developed thus far. In addition, such heterostructures also exhibited superior activity toward the hydrogen oxidation reaction in alkaline electrolytes.									53	1	0	0	2	0	53			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000555420600011	32090553

Here, Ni(acac)2 was converted into Ni metal nanoparticles in solvothermal reactions with simple alcohols and oleylamine (OAm). The morphology of the resulting Ni nanoparticles was dependent mainly on the OAm/Ni molar ratio in alcohol solvent. Aggregates of spherical Ni nanoparticles (NiEt-OAml) were observed at the OAm/Ni molar ratio of 1.0, whereas two echinoid Ni nanoparticles (NiEt-OAm4 and NiEt-OAm6) could be prepared in ethanol at the OAm/Ni molar ratios of 4.0 and 6.0. Ni (OH)(2) formed in ethanol during a reaction time of 5 h was then reduced into echinoid Ni nanoparticles after 8 h. Echinoid Ni nanoparticles were formed by atomic addition on the tops of the multipod Ni particles formed via Ni(OH)(2)/NiO aggregates. Webbed feet-like particles (NiIPA-OAm4) with plate edges were also observed in isopropanol under the same reaction conditions. The catalytic activities of the prepared Ni nanoparticles for the hydrogen evolution reaction were evaluated in alkaline solution. The NiEt-OAm4 with urchin-like morphology was much more active than the NiIPA-OAm4 with webbed feet like morphology. The exchange current density of Ni catalysts was increased with increasing the OAm/Ni molar ratio. The NiEt-OAm6 exhibited an exchange current of 0.191 mA cm(-2) and the NiEt-OAm4 exceeded electrocatalytic performance of a commercial Pt catalysts (40% Pt on Vulcan XC 72) in a stability test for 100 kiloseconds at -1.5 V (vs. Hg/HgO) in 1.0 M NaOH due to its high stability.

Herein, by combining a one-pot wet-chemical method and the post surface functionalization, we successfully fabricated polyethylenimine (PEI)-modified bimetallic Au@Rh core-shell mesoporous nanospheres (Au@Rh@PEI MNs). Benefiting from the synergetic effects of Au@Rh core-shell mesoporous architectures and interfacial modification by PEI molecules, the resultant Au@Rh@PEI MNs exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability for the HER in all pH value solutions, which even surpass the benchmark commercial Pt/C catalyst.

Herein, two cobalt-based metal-organic frameworks (Co-MOFs), [Co-6(btc)(2)(DMF)(6)(HCOO)(6)] (2D, MOF 1) and [Co-3(CHOO)(9){DMA}(3)] (3D, MOF 2), where btc = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid, DMF = N,N-dimethylformamide, and DMA = dimethylamine, have been crystallized under hydrothermal conditions, from a single reaction. MOF 1 shows an extraordinary OER performance with 175 mV overpotential to attain 10 mA cm(-2) current density with a low Tafel slope value of 80 mV dec(-1), whereas MOF 2 achieves 10 mA cm-2 current density at 389 mV overpotential. Two different architecture-based MOFs have been synthesized from a single solution for the very first time. Also, the OER activity of MOF 1 overpowers the commercially used RuO2 and surpasses most of the reported OER electrocatalysts.

Herein, it is demonstrated that the versatile perovskite-based oxides, usually applied for operating at low current density and room temperature in alkaline solution, can be developed into low-cost, highly active and durable electrocatalysts for operating at high current densities in a zero-gap anion exchange membrane electrolyzer cell (AEMEC). The composite perovskite with mixed phases of Ruddlesden-Popper and single perovskite is applied as the anode in AEMEC and exhibits highly promising performance with an overall water-splitting current density of 2.01 A cm(-2) at a cell voltage of only 2.00 V at 60 degrees C with stable performance. The elevated temperature to promote anion diffusion in membrane boosts oxygen evolution kinetics by enhancing lattice-oxygen participation. The bifunctionality of perovskites further promises the more cost-effective symmetrical AEMEC configuration, and a primary cell with the composite perovskite as both electrodes delivers 3.00 A cm(-2) at a cell voltage of only 2.42 V. This work greatly expands the use of perovskites as robust electrocatalysts for industrial water splitting at high current density with great practical application merit.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2366-9608			WOS:000868836300001	36251791

Herein, we have developed ultrathin NiFeP nanosheets, and merged the NiFeP with a 3D support of sponge-like strutted graphenes (SG). The synthesized NiFeP/SG, a porous monolith, shows efficient electrocatalytic activities for oxygen and hydrogen evolutions in alkaline electrolyte with low overpotentials of 218 and 115 mV, respectively. Using NiFeP/SG as direct catalytic electrodes, the overall water splitting requires a low cell voltage of 1.54 V to achieve a current of 10 mA cm(-2). The high performances result from the shifted-up d states caused by iron incorporation, the ultrathin NiFeP, and the 3D network structure of SG. Additionally, NiFeP/SG demonstrates excellent gravimetric catalytic activities, meaningful to aerospace and portables. The material opens the way to a universal robust lightweight catalytic electrode for a variety of applications in electrochemical energy storage and conversion.									117	6	0	0	6	0	118			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000461433600099

The graphene oxide carbocatalyst with oxygen functional groups, large amounts of active sites, and hydrophilic property exhibits superior HER activity as compared to the pristine nickel foam and graphene. The graphene oxide coated on nickel substrate exhibits an overpotential of -83.2 mV vs. RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and an excellent electrochemical stability up to 7 hours in 1.0 M H2SO4. In addition, the effect of electrolyte concentrations was also studied in 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 M H2SO4. At high concentration, the HER activity is higher because large amounts of protons can increase the ionic conductivity in the electrolyte and can participate in the reaction generating more hydrogen when compared to the lower concentration. We believe that the graphene oxide-coated Ni electrode, which can be operated in an acidic environment, can be practically used as an alternative electrocatalyst towards HER.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1938-5862			INSPEC:18371002

In this work, atomically dispersed NiMn layered double hydroxides are prepared via simple hydrothermal synthesis and tested as the OER catalyst in rechargeable Zn-air batteries. NiMn layered double hydroxides with the optimized Ni : Mn molar feeding ratio have good crystallinity, big interlayer spacing, and large surface area, which are beneficial to enhance their catalytic activity. They are highly active and stable during the OER, showing an overpotential of 0.35 V, a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec(-1), and remarkable stability during 16 h of a chronopotentiometry test. Rechargeable Zn-air batteries with NiMn layered double hydroxides as the OER catalyst exhibit a low charge voltage of approximate to 2 V which is stable for up to 200 cycles. This study illustrates a platform to enhance the catalytic activity of the OER catalyst via fine-tuning the composition and physical properties of the materials and their application for rechargeable metal-air batteries.									105	3	0	0	5	0	105			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000394780200036	27976771

The changes in the C ls core-level line shape of the polymers, the evolution of the K 2p core-level spectra, and the changes in chemical compositions at the interface with progressive deposition of the metal atoms were carefully monitored, The interactions of the K atoms with the conjugated polymer surfaces were compared with those involving metals of other work functions. Diffusion of the K atoms into the polymers and distinct charge transfer interactions were observed at the interface. The migration of bulk adsorbed oxygen to the surfaces of both polymers during the K deposition process resulted in an increase in oxygen concentration at the K/polymer interfaces. The diffusion of the adsorbed oxygen from the bulk of the conjugated polymer film played a dominant role in the interfacial reactions. The interfacial layer contains mainly oxidized metal and metal-polymer charge transfer species. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The challenges to realizing an efficient photoanode include the integration of a semiconductor light absorber and a metal oxide electrocatalyst to optimize corrosion protection, light trapping, hole transport, and photocarrier recombination sites. To efficiently explore metal oxide coatings, we employ a high-throughput methodology wherein a uniform BiVO4 film is coated with 858 unique metal oxide coatings covering a range of metal oxide loadings and the full (Ni-Fe-Co-Ce)O-x pseudoquaternary composition space. Photoelectrochemical characterization of the photoanodes reveals that specific combinations of metal oxide composition and loading provide up to a 13-fold increase in the maximum photoelectrochemical power generation for oxygen evolution in pH 13 electrolyte. Through mining of the high-throughput data we identify composition regions that form improved interfaces with BiVO4. Of particular note, integrated photoanodes with catalyst compositions in the range Fe(0.4-0.6)Ce(0.6-0.4)Ox exhibit high interface quality and excellent photoelectrochemical power conversion. Scaled-up inkjet-printed electrodes and photoanodic electrodeposition of this composition on BiVO4 confirms the discovery and the synthesis-independent interface improvement of (Fe-Ce)O-x coatings on BiVO4.									28	3	0	0	3	0	30			1944-8244			WOS:000383412000028	27549019	
J	Li, Yu; Fan, Weidong; Wang, Yong; Chen, Can								Characteristics of Char Gasification in Staged Oxygen-Enriched Combustion in a Down Flame Furnace								ENERGY & FUELS				30	3			1675	1684		10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b02077				MAR 2016	2016	Staged oxygen-enriched combustion was carried out in a 20 kW down flame furnace (DFF). The experimental results were used to perform corresponding simulations. This paper proposes a refined char gasification model for accurately simulating the deep-staged combustion of pulverized coal at elevated oxygen concentrations. The following experimental conditions were used: burner stoichiometric ratio (SR) ranging from 0.696 (deep staged) to 1.200 (unstaged), O-2 concentrations ranging from 21 to 30 vol %, and burnout stream injection ratio (Ms) ranging from 0.28 to 0.45. According to the experimental results, as SR decreased from 1.200 to 0.696, the peak CO concentration increased from low to very high levels (above 12 vol % under normal air conditions). The elevated oxygen concentration (30 vol % O-2) further increased the peak CO concentration at SR = 0.696 to approximately 18 vol %. The reaction model in the simulation was refined on the basis of char gasification and then used to successfully reproduce the experimental results (especially the CO concentration profile). The influence of char gasification reactions on the staged oxygen-enriched combustion is investigated in detail. Furthermore, the pollutants formed are then presented by comparing the NO profiles between the experimental and simulation results.					5th Sino-Australian Symposium on Advanced Coal and Biomass Utilisation Technologies5th Sino-Australian Symposium on Advanced Coal and Biomass Utilisation Technologies	DEC 14-16, 2015DEC 14-16, 2015		Wuhan, REP OF GEORGIAWuhan, REP OF GEORGIA	6	2	0	0	0	0	8			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000372562800016

The surface structure of spinel oxides significantly influences the electrocatalytic performance of spinel oxides. Herein, we report a Li reduction strategy that can quickly tune the surface structure of CoFe2O4 (CFO) nanoparticles and optimize its electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Results show that a large number of defective domains have been successfully introduced at the surface of CFO nanopowders after Li reduction treatment. The defective CFO nanoparticles demonstrate significantly improved electrocatalytic OER activity. The OER potential observed a negative shift from 1.605 to 1.513 V at 10 mA cm(-2), whereas the Tafel slope is greatly decreased to 42.1 mV dec(-1) after 4 wt % Li reduction treatment. This efficient Li reduction strategy can also be applied to engineer the surface defect structure of other material systems and broaden their applications.									55	3	0	0	1	0	55			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000457816900033	30624038

Here, a new bifunctional oxygen electrode based on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes decorated by spinel CuCo2O4 quantum dots (CuCo2O4/N-CNTs) is reported, outperforming the benchmark of state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts. Combining spectroscopic characterization and electrochemical studies, a prominent synergetic effect between CuCo2O4 and N-doped carbon nanotubes is uncovered: the high conductivity, large active surface area, and increase in the number of catalytic sites induced by Cu doping (i.e., Cu2+ and Cu. N) can be beneficial to the overall electrocatalytic activities. Remarkably, the native flexibility of CuCo2O4/N-CNTs allows its direct use as reversible oxygen electrodes in Zn-air batteries either with liquid alkaline electrolyte or in the all-solid-state configuration. The prepared devices demonstrate excellent discharging/charging performance, large energy density (83.83 mW cm(-2) in liquid state, 1.86 W g(-1) in all-solid-state), and long lifetime (48 h in liquid state, 9 h in all-solid-state), holding great promise in the practical application of rechargeable metal-air batteries and other fuel cells.									259	20	0	0	5	0	261			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000407261700016

Unlike the traditional mineral acid based oxidation protocols, a facile single-step methodology without any post-treatments is adopted for the carboxylic functionalization of the carbon support. The interconnected 3D nanostructure with an optimal introduction of metal-binding surface functional groups promotes the uniform dispersion of Pt nanoparticles. The resultant Pt-loaded Pt/ACNFs are used for various electrocatalytic reactions. The Pt/ACNFs exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity with multifunctional ability, promoting the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via an efficient 4e(-) transfer, providing a large electrochemical surface area (119.21 m(2) g(-1)) and superior mass activity (684.57 A g(-1)) for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), and demanding minimal overpotential (50 mV) and Tafel slope (35 mV dec(-1)) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Thus, the superior electrocatalytic performance of the prepared Pt/ACNFs is definitely attributable to the uniform binding of Pt metal particles with the carefully grafted -COOH functional groups.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2398-4902			WOS:000539290400020

The deposits consist of a nanocrystalline single gamma-MnO2 type phase in the form of triple Mn1-x-yMoxWyO2+x+y oxide. Anodic deposition in 0.2 kmol m(-3) Mn2+-0.003 kmol m(-3) MO6+-0.006 kmol m(-3) W6+ electrolyte at pH 0.0 resulted in the formation of an electrode with 100 % and 99.8 % oxygen evolution efficiencies before and after electrolysis for 691.2 ks in 0.5 kmol m(-3) NaCl solution of pH 2 at 1000 Am-2. Thus, Mn1-x-yMoxWyO2+x+y electrodes were promising oxygen evolving anodes for acidic seawater electrolysis. It has been concluded that additions of both tungsten and molybdenum beneficially bring about an increase in the real electro-catalytic activity along with the formation of deposits with optimum thickness and good adherence to the IrO2/Ti Substrate.									37	1	0	0	1	0	37			1345-9678	1347-5320		WOS:000228190900037

Conventional synthesis of SA-M catalysts involves high-temperature treatments, leading to low yield with a random distribution of atoms. Herein, a nature-based facile method to synthesize SA-M catalysts (M = Fe, Ir, Pt, Ru, Cu, or Pd) in a single step at ambient temperature, using the extracellular electron transfer capability of Geobacter sulfurreducens (GS), is presented. Interestingly, the SA-M is coordinated to three nitrogen atoms adopting an MN3 on the surface of GS. Dry samples of SA-Ir@GS without further heat treatment show exceptionally high activity for oxygen evolution reaction when compared to benchmark IrO2 catalyst and comparable hydrogen evolution reaction activity to commercial 10 wt% Pt/C. The SA-Ir@GS exhibits the best water-splitting performance compared to other SA-M@GS, showing a low applied potential of 1.65 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with cycling over 5 h. The density functional calculations reveal that the large adsorption energy of H2O and moderate adsorption energies of reactants and reaction intermediates for SA-Ir@GS favorably improve its activity. This synthesis method at room temperature provides a versatile platform for the preparation of SA-M catalysts for various applications by merely altering the metal precursors.									6	1	0	0	0	0	5			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000628878900001

In the presence of polyoxometalate (POM) and triblock copolymer pluronic (P123) as a hybrid soft template, the hydrothermal sulfurization of nickel foam leads to the formation of a hollow microsphere, assembled from the Ni3S2 motif. Sonication for preparing POM+P123 hybrids, while adjusting the POM content, is an effective strategy for synthesizing a Pt-like electrocatalyst with excellent hydrogen evolution efficiency. reason is that both sonication and optimal POM content can simultaneously enhance the electroactive surface area and electron transfer of the Ni3S2 electrocatalyst. Adopting the optimal conditions, the three-dimensional porous network, composed of Ni3S2 hollow microspheres on the nickel foam, shows that the HER in an alkaline medium requires only 77 mV overpotential for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), with a robust long-term stability during a 25 h test. The performance at a large current density outperforms the current benchmark electrocatalyst (Pt) for HER.									28	1	0	0	0	0	28			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000416614600032	29068217

Both in-situ in a flow infrared cell and ex-situ FT-IR studies of the evolution of the sulfate species as a function of time on stream and after regeneration of the sorbent-catalyst were carried out. The results indicate that copper catalyzes the oxidation Of SO2 to SO3 in the presence of gaseous oxygen and that SO3, present probably as S-bonded chemisorbed sulfur oxide, further (i) reacts with near-lying sites of the support without desorption in the gas phase through a mechanism of surface transfer to form a sulfate linked to Al or (ii) reacts with copper species to form a sulfate linked to copper. The relative rates of these two reactions of formation of sulfate species are strongly affected by the reaction temperature, which enhances in particular the former reaction. The latter sulfate species, however, is more easily regenerated by reduction.									106	16	0	0	8	0	119			0888-5885			WOS:A1992JH53000016

Herein, the novel three-dimensional (3D) cobalt (Co) nanoparticles (NPs)-embedded and ultrahigh B and N doped hierarchically porous carbon nanowires (denoted as Co@BNPCFs) have been successfully synthesized via pyrolyzing the 3D cobalt acetate/hydroxybenzeneboronic acid/polyvinylpyrrolidone precursor networks woven by electrospinning. After optimizing the pyrolysis temperatures, the optimal Co@BNPCFs-800 owns a large surface area and abundant carbon edges/defects. Especially, 6.86 atom % of B and 6.59 atom % of N atoms are doped into carbon frameworks with affording 13.45 atom % of B/N active centers (i.e. BC3, pyridinic-N, Co-Nx-C, pyrrolic-N, and graphitic-N). In alkaline solution, the hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential at 10 mA cm-2 of the optimal Co@BNPCFs-800 (151.3 mV) is just 82.4 mV larger than 20 wt% Pt/C (68.9 mV). Especially, the oxygen evolution reaction potential at 10 mA cm-2 of the optimal Co@BNPCFs-800 (1.554 V vs. RHE) is even 2 mV more negative than RuO2 (1.556 V vs. RHE). For full water splitting, Co@BNPCFs-800 based electrolysis cell just requires a small voltage of 1.596 V to achieve 10 mA cm-2, which is 19 mV smaller than that of the state-ofthe-art 20 wt% Pt/C||RuO2 benchmark (1.615 V). The perfect 3D hierarchically porous structures and fairly abundant electrocatalytic active sites dispersed along Co@BNPCFs-800 ' s surface are responsible for the outstanding water splitting performances. In addition, as the good structural and chemical stabilities, Co@BNPCFs-800 nanowires based water electrolysis cell also displays excellent water electrolysis stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000805973600001

In the quest for alternative, non-precious metal catalysts for hydrogen generation to replace platinum, biological systems such as the enzyme hydrogenase serve as a blueprint. By taking inspiration from the bio-system, mostly nickel- or iron-based catalysts were explored so far. Manganese is a known oxygen-reducing catalyst but has received much less attention for its ability to reduce protons in acidic media. Here, the synthesis, characterization, and reaction mechanisms of a series of four mono-nuclear Mn(I) complexes in terms of their catalytic performance are reported. The effect of the variation of equatorial and axial ligands in their first and second coordination spheres was assessed pertaining to their control of the turnover frequencies and overpotentials. All four complexes show reactivity and reduce protons in acidic media to release molecular hydrogen H-2. Quantum chemical studies were able to assign and interpret spectral characterizations from UV-Vis and electrochemistry and rationalize the reaction mechanism. Two feasible reaction mechanisms of electrochemical (E) and protonation (C) steps were compared. Quantum chemical studies can assign peaks in the cyclic voltammetry to structural changes of the complex during the reaction. The first one-electron reduction is essential to generate an open ligand-based site for protonation. The distorted octahedral Mn complexes possess an inverted second one-electron redox potential which is a pre-requisite for a swift and facile release of molecular hydrogen. This series on manganese catalysts extends the range of elements of the periodic table which are able to catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction and will be explored further.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-2646			WOS:000875666900001	36277350

The effect of the sintering condition on the phase evolution and the ferroelectric properties of these BFO ceramics were investigated. A pinched polarization - electric field (P-E) hysteresis loop was observed in the sample sintered at high temperature for a short period (820 degrees C for 1 hour) because the domain wall motion is restricted by a large number of ionic defects such as oxygen vacancies. The BFO sample sintered at low temperature for a long period (760 degrees C for 6 hours) displayed a well-saturated P-E hysteresis loop due to its low ionic defect density.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0374-4884	1976-8524		WOS:000459205800012

FeOOH/NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoplates are grown on cobaltous carbonate hydroxide nanowire arrays (CCH NAs) directly, with nickel foam (NF) as a conductive substrate. This FeOOH/NiFe LDHs@CCH NAs-NF with orderly hierarchical construction of FeOOH/NiFe LDH nanoplates supported on cobaltous carbonate hydroxide nanowire arrays exhibits superior activity for theOER, which delivers current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 220 and 290 mV, respectively, and excellent stability at 10, 100, 300, and 500mA cm(-2) for 40 hours in 1M KOH. For commercial applications, an alkaline polymer electrolyte water electrolyzer (APEWE) with this electrode shows 1.768 V at 500 mA cm(-2), exhibiting higher working current density than typical commercial alkaline water electrolyzers. A chronopotentiometry test in 1 M KOH at 500 mA cm(-2) reveals that the performance of the APEWE is stable at similar to 1.8 V for about 100 hours.									52	2	0	0	3	0	52			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000425623600013

Here we report the synthesis of mesoporous, one-dimensional NiFe2O4 spinel by thermal decomposing of NiFe-based coordination polymer precursor. The annealed temperature and structural/compositional of these as-prepared electrocatalysts were found to have a striking correlation with their electrocatalytic water oxidation properties. The NiFe2O4 nanorods with a surface area of 165.9 m(2)/g obtained at 350 degrees C was found to be the most active oxygen evolving catalyst in alkaline solution, an overpotential of 342 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) with a Tafel slope of 44 mV/dec was detected, comparing with those of electrocatalysts obtained under other decomposed temperature. The OER mechanism in alkaline electrolytes on NiFe2O4 was also proposed. The high oxygen evolving activity can be attributed to the mesoporous one-dimensional nanostructure with abundant surface electrochemically active sites and improved electric conductivity, thus facilitating the charge/electron transfer and further improving the efficiency of water electrolysis. The efficient water oxidation activity and scalable, low-cost synthesis make the NiFe2O4 nanorods a very attractive oxygen evolving catalyst using for water splitting. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, for the first time the growth of sulfur (S) defect engineered self-supporting array electrode composed of metallic Re and ReS(2)nanosheets on carbon cloth (referred as Re/ReS2/CC) via a facile hydrothermal method and the following thermal treatment with H-2/N(2)flow is reported. It is expected that, for example, the as-prepared Re/ReS2-7H/CC for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under acidic medium affords a quite low overpotential of 42 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)and a very small Tafel slope of 36 mV decade(-1), which are comparable to some of the promising HER catalysts. Furthermore, in the two-electrode system, a small cell voltage of 1.30 V is recorded under alkaline condition. Characterizations and density functional theory results expound that the introduced S defects in Re/ReS2-7H/CC can offer abundant active sites to advantageously capture electron, enhance the electron transport capacity, and weaken the adsorption free energy of H* at the active sites, being responsible for its superior electrocatalytic performance.									43	4	0	0	2	0	43			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000549847000001	32686340

However, regarding ARRs activity, the difference between typical O3- and P2-type structures has not been clarified with in-depth exploration. Herein, composed with similar composition, ARRs-induced oxygen behaviors within O3-Na0.6Li0.2Fe0.4Ru0.4O2 and P2-Na0.6Li0.35Fe0.1Ru0.55 O-2 are systematically investigated by varying ex/in situ spectroscopic characterizations. Conducted with a lower charging cutoff voltage (4.0 V), P2-type cathode will more easily trigger the reversible oxygen behaviors and deliver a larger capacity, better rate performance, and stable cyclability, in contrast to the O3-type cathode. Moreover, within O3-type structure, increasing charging potential (beyond 4.3 V) would induce additional anionic oxidation capacity, but inevitably lead to the irreversible evolution of gaseous O-2 and superoxo. With the unique feature, this work provides a promising strategy design for fabricating cathodes with optimal microstructural arrangement, which could further push forward the changes in macro-/nanostructures and even ideal performance.									14	2	0	0	0	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000507146100082	31809015

The electrospun NixRh1-xOy composite nanofibres showed various morphologies and crystallinities depending on the relative molar ratio of Ni to Rh. While NixRh1-xOy with a high Ni content (0.67 <= x <= 0.83) showed the typical structure of nanotube-like main backbones decorated with flake-sprouts and consisted of amorphous Rh oxide and crystalline NiO, Ni0.57Rh0.43Oy, with its more moderate Ni content, had a smooth nanofibre structure, which was also composed of amorphous Rh oxide and crystalline NiO. On the other hand, NixRh1-xOy (0.27 <= x <= 0.39) possessed a rugged nanofibre structure consisting of crystalline RhO y and NiO. Electrocatalytic activity measurements of the electrospun composite nanofibres, when used for an oxygen evolution reaction (OER), demonstrated that the Ni0.77Rh0.23Oy nanofibres were the most effective in a 1 M NaOH aqueous solution. Ni0.77Rh0.23Oy, with a high content of relatively inexpensive Ni, presented OER activity and stability that were superior even to those of commercial iridium, and can be considered as a promising cost-effective catalyst. In our study, the high OER activity of Ni0.77Rh0.23Oy could be reasonably ascribed to the unique morphological and crystalline characteristics as well as the synergistic effect of mixed Ni and Rh oxides.

J	Kim, Hyung-Jin; Jung, Sung Chul; Han, Young-Kyu; Oh, Si Hyoung								An atomic-level strategy for the design of a low overpotential catalyst for Li - O-2 batteries								NANO ENERGY				13				679	686		10.1016/j.nanoen.2015.03.030				APR 2015	2015	Herein, we provide critical information via first-principles calculations to solve one of the major problems of Li-O-2 batteries, namely, large overpotentials during the charge-discharge process. First, we found that PtCo exhibits remarkably low oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials of 0.19 and 0.20 V, respectively. These are considerably lower than those of pure Pt (1.02 and 1.62V, respectively) and of high-performance Pt3Co (1.02 and 1.13V, respectively). The composition optimization of bimetallic catalysts is therefore critical in developing an optimal Li-O-2 battery catalyst with an overpotential of nearly zero. Second, our calculations demonstrate that replacing the late transition metal Co in Pt3Co with the early transition metal Ti significantly decreases overpotentials, yielding ORR and OER overpotentials of 0.34 and 0.82 V, respectively. These results are opposite to those obtained for fuel cells. Notably, our results suggest that a bimetallic catalyst with poor catalytic activity in fuel cells might show excellent activity in Li-O-2 cells. In particular, combinations of active Pt with early transition metals should be studied for development of bimetallic catalysts with high round-trip efficiency in Li-O-2 batteries. Finally, we suggest that the adsorption energies of Li and LiO2 are critical descriptors of catalytic activity and that they should be used to screen new candidate materials. This is because low ORR and OER overpotentials are closely related to strong Li and weak LiO2 adsorptions, respectively, on the catalytic surface. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, sub 10 nm-sized monodispersed partially oxidized manganese oxide nanoparticles were shown to exhibit not only superior catalytic performance for oxygen evolution, but also unique electrokinetics, as compared to their bulk counterparts. In the present work, the water oxidizing mechanism of partially oxidized MnO nanoparticles was investigated using integrated in situ spectroscopic and electrokinetic analyses. We successfully demonstrated that, in contrast to previously reported manganese (Mn)-based catalysts, Mn(III) species are stably generated on the, surface of MnO nanoparticles via a proton-coupled electron transfer pathway. Furthermore, we confirmed as to MnO nanoparticles that the one-electron oxidation step from Mn(II) to Mn(III) is no longer the rate-determining step for water oxidation and that Mn(W)=O species are generated as reaction intermediates during catalysis.									100	1	0	0	9	0	101			0002-7863			WOS:000394482200029	28029792

Kev to these developments is a thorough understanding of the interactions which occur between flux-sintered dielectrics and low-cost, Ag/Pd electrodes. In this paper we present results on the phase equilibria of Ag/Pd electrode systems with Bi2O3 and PbO fluxes. The conditions under which the bismuth reaction occurs and reactions in the Pd-PbO system are reported. Results show that the equilibrium phases which form depend strongly upon the Ag/Pd ratio and temperature. These phases include PdBi2O4, Pd(Bi), PdPbO2, Pd(Pb), and PbPd3. The PdBi2O4 and PdPbO2 phases decompose when PdO destabilizes, resulting in a series of reactions which result in oxygen evolution and partial melting of components. The exact phase relations of the Ag/Pd-Bi2O3-O2(air) system and Ag/Pd-PbO-O2(air) system have been established for the first time and are discussed in terms of their impact on multilayer, cofired structures.									34	3	0	0	0	0	36			0002-7820			WOS:A1992JL82600004

Heteroatom doping is regarded as an effective tactic to facilitate electron interactions, and thereby enhance the electrocatalytic activity. In this work, (P, W)-codoped MoO2 nanoflowers were successfully assembled on a nickel foam (NF) substrate (marked as (P, W)-MoO2/NF) by hydrothermal and phosphorization processes. The as-prepared catalyst (P, W)-MoO2/NF exhibits excellent catalytic activities with lower overpotentials of 308 mV and 89 mV to deliver 40 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. More significantly, when directly assembled in the electrolyzer as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, it only requires a cell voltage of 1.65 V to deliver a current density of 30 mA cm(-2). The as-prepared catalyst (P, W)-MoO2/NF also displays splendid long-term stability over 20 h without a visible decrease in an alkaline solution. The blooming flower-like architecture can afford abundant active sites, and the doping of heteroatoms can tune the electronic transfer, which are both responsible for the enhancement in the electrocatalytic properties. This work provides a unique direction to the rational design and synthesis of highly efficient and stable non-noble metal molybdenum-based bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000564736000004

However, synthesizing MMHO and MMO with well-defined mesostructures remains a great challenge because of the weak interaction between surfactants and metal precursors. Herein we describe a chelation-induced cooperative self-assembly system in which the weak interaction can be cooperatively amplified through the use of a chelating ligand acting as a co-template. Both MMHO and MMO nanospheres with tunable diameters and high surface areas can be readily synthesized via this strategy. The as-synthesized mesoporous ZnO nanospheres exhibit excellent photoelectric performance, and as a highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst of low cost, the calcined Cu(OH) 2 nanospheres exhibit one of the best activities for the OER. Moreover, this cooperative method gives rise to an alternative to "classical" self-assembly methods for the preparation of mesostructured nanomaterials and, in some cases, the only viable synthetic route toward MMHO and MMO nanostructures.									17	1	0	0	3	0	17			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000428787600039	29537010

The declines in the height of thermoluminescence bands support the view and the damage of reaction center II could be central to the senescence process in Arabidopsis leaves. The enhancement in the number of reduced quinones, signifying a loss in redox homeostasis in the electron transport chain between photosystem II and I leads to the creation of an energy imbalance. The view is supported by the decline in actual quantum yield of photosystem II in the light adapted state and maximum quantum yield of primary photochemistry in the dark adapted state of chlorophyll fluorescence. An increase in chlorophyll a fluorescence polarization and decline in carotenoid to chlorophyll energy transfer efficiency suggest the perturbation in thylakoid structure. A plausible mechanism illustrating the senescence mediated inactivation of oxygen evolving complex has been proposed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Herein, we demonstrate that iridium oxide nanoparticles (IrOx) possess acid-activated oxidase and peroxidase-like functions and wide pH-dependent catalase-like properties. The integration of glucose oxidase (GOD) unlocked the oxidase and peroxidase activities of IrOx by the production of gluconic acid from glucose by GOD catalysis in cancer cells, and the produced H2O2 was converted into O-2 to compensate its consumption in GOD catalysis owing to the catalase-like function of the nanozyme, thus resulting in the continual consumption of glucose and the self-supply of substrates to generate superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical. Moreover, IrOx can constantly consume glutathione (GSH) by self-cyclic valence alternation of Ir-IV and Ir-III. These cascade reactions lead to a "butterfly effect" of initial starvation therapy and the subsequent pressure of multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS) to completely break the self-adaption of cancer cells.									57	6	0	0	13	0	56			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000522740800001	32100926

Herein, this work reports a one-step controllable synthesis of trimetallic NiCoFe-layered double hydroxides (NiCoFe-LDHs) nanosheets (1.36 nm) for both an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and highly selective oxidation of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMFOR) into value-added 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). For comparison, two sets of bimetallic NiCo- and NiFe-LDHs were similarly synthesized and evaluated. In the OER process, the optimal NiCoFe-LDHs nanosheets exhibited the lowest necessary overpotential (288 mV) to reach 10 mA cm (-2) and the smallest Tafel slope of 92 mV dec(-1) compared with NiCo-LDHs (347 mV, 115 mV dec(-1)) and NiFe-LDHs (303 mV, 108 mV dec(-1)). The performance was also superior to most previously reported LDHs catalysts. Additionally, NiCoFe-LDHs nanosheets exhibited a much smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 1.0 Omega and a larger C-dl value of 2.62 mF cm(-2) compared with NiCo-LDHs (2.1 Omega, 1.94 mF cm(-2)) and NiFe-LDHs (1.4 Omega, 2.22 mF cm(-2)), indicating fast catalytic kinetics. Furthermore, the NiCoFe-LDHs nanosheets possessed excellent durability over 10 h, much better than that of NiCo- and NiFe-LDHs. NiCoFe-LDHs catalysts also exhibited high performance in the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to FDCA, which is a key precursor for the sustainable synthesis of polymers (e.g., polyethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate (PEF)). An ultralow overpotential of 280 mV was required to achieve 20 mA cm(-2), nearly 120 mV less than the activity in pure 1.0 M NaOH. The reaction intermediates and products were qualified by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy system (LC-MS) and LC, where 95.5% conversion of HMF and 84.9% yield of FDCA were obtained in 1 h. The reaction kinetics and possible pathways were further investigated. As a unique report utilizing trimetallic LDHs catalysts for OER and HMFOR, this study provides a promising perspective for energy conversion and electrocatalytic processing of biomass-derived monomers.									136	10	0	0	8	0	141			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800036

By the reduction of auxiliary ligand vanillin (VAN) and the introduction of Fe3O4, the mixed-valence Fe3+/Fe(2+)structure in Fe3O4/VAN@MIL-101(Fe) was obtained, which improves the band gap of the Fe(3+)reactive active center and increases the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. Owing to the partial difference in the structure between VAN and ligand terephthalic acid (H2BDC), hierarchical porous and vacant structures were effectively improved in Fe3O4/VAN@MIL-101(Fe), which can induce more active sites to adsorb more water molecules and shorten the electron-hole migration distance to improve the transfer efficiency of photogenerated carriers. Therefore, Fe3O4/VAN@MIL-101(Fe) presents excellent photocatalytic activities for improving the O(2)and H(2)production rate up to 360 000 mu mol g(-1)h(-1)and 584 mu mol g(-1)h(-1), respectively. Meanwhile, Fe3O4/VAN@MIL-101(Fe) maintains the excellent catalytic activity in OERs and HERs after recycling for 5 times. Moreover, the introduction of magnetic Fe(3)O(4)nanoplates into Fe3O4/VAN@MIL-101(Fe) can make it easily recyclable by magnetic separation, which can maximize its performance.									22	0	0	0	7	0	22			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000544063600031	32500125

Herein, a sequential synthetic strategy is considered to prepare a hierarchical nanostructure, in which each component can be configured to achieve their full potential so that endows the resulting nanocatalyst a good overall performance. In order to realize this, well-organized cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanopillars are firstly grown onto ultrathin 1Tmolybdenum sulfide (1T-MoS2) to obtain high surface area electrocatalyst, providing electron transfer pathways and structural stability. After that, zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) derived carbonization film is further in situ deposited on the surface of nanopillars to generate plentiful active sites, thereby accelerating OER kinetics. Based on the combination of different components, the electron transfer capability, catalytic activity and durability are optimized and fully implemented. The obtained nanocatalyst (defined as 1T-MoS2/Co3O4/CN) exhibits the superior OER catalytic ability with the overpotential of 202 mV and Tafel slope of 57 mV.dec(-1) at 10 mA.cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH, and good durability with a minor chronoamperometric decay of 9.15 % after 60,000 s of polarization.

Herein, a unique Mg-decorated three-dimensionally ordered mesoporous (3DOM) Co3O4 electrocatalyst is engineered and evaluated as cathodic material for zinc-air batteries. The modulation of electronic structure and bonding configuration of Co sites through coordination with substituted Mg atoms effectively enhance the interaction with oxygen species and, therefore, the ORR/OER activity. Meanwhile, the substitution of Co2+ with Mg2+ creates abundant, more catalytically active octahedral sites (Co3+) in 3DOM-MgxCo3-xO4. Moreover, the tailored 3D interpenetrating porous structure endows the electrocatalyst with large diffusion channels for oxygen species and highly accessible active sites. The as-prepared catalyst retains 99% and 98% of its initial ORR and OER current, respectively, after 16 h under chronoamperometric measurement. The zinc-air battery assembled with 3DOM-MgxCo3-xO4 exhibits a high power density of 253 mW cm(-2) and long-term cyclability over 236 h, outperforming the commercial noble-metal based catalysts in terms of performance and stability. This work offers a straightforward and promising design strategy for development of robust bifunctional electrocatalysts toward practical applications of zinc-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000811310400004

Results show that the generated hydrogen bubbles during charging process will gather on the surface of the middle of the anode and will cover the ZnO which is produced by the hydrolysis of Zn (OH)(4)(2-)and prevent ZnO participation in the charging process. Since the charge-discharge reaction only occurs at the edges of the bubbles, the multiple dissolution and redeposition of the active material results in the formation of a massive ZnO and a very low specific discharge capacity. This finding provides a new perspective for the deformation of zinc anodes of the secondary alkaline zinc-based batteries.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000577978500001

In this paper the morphology, crystallinity and performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of the catalyst iridium oxide supported on ATO at various calcination temperatures will be reported. The supported catalyst was synthesized using a modified Polyol method and calcined at temperatures of 200, 350, 500 and 700degC. The electrocatalysts were physically characterized by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area measurements. The catalysts were also electrochemically characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a typical three electrode system. The main focus of this work is to study the effect of calcination temperatures on the morphology of iridium oxide nano particles as a function of temperature and degree of crystallization. We find that iridium oxide nano particles synthesized with Polyol method has amorphous structure and calcining at temperatures higher than 400degC increases the particle size and changes its structure from amorphous to crystalline. It also was found that the amorphous iridium nano particles are highly active and efficient catalyst toward OER, while calcining the catalyst decreases the electrochemically active surface area and its activity.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1938-5862			INSPEC:15991638

The existence of ultra-massive white dwarf stars, M-WD greater than or similar to 1.05 M-circle dot, has been reported in several studies. These white dwarfs are relevant for the role they play in type Ia supernova explosions, the occurrence of physical processes in the asymptotic giant-branch phase, the existence of high-field magnetic white dwarfs, and the occurrence of double-white-dwarf mergers.Aims. We aim to explore the formation of ultra-massive, carbon-oxygen core white dwarfs resulting from single stellar evolution. We also intend to study their evolutionary and pulsational properties and compare them with those of the ultra-massive white dwarfs with oxygen-neon cores resulting from carbon burning in single progenitor stars, and with binary merger predictions. The aim is to provide a theoretical basis that can eventually help to discern the core composition of ultra-massive white dwarfs and the circumstances of their formation.Methods. We considered two single-star evolution scenarios for the formation of ultra-massive carbon-oxygen core white dwarfs, which involve the rotation of the degenerate core after core helium burning and reduced mass-loss rates in massive asymptotic giant-branch stars. We find that reducing standard mass-loss rates by a factor larger than 5-20 yields the formation of carbon-oxygen cores more massive than 1.05 M-circle dot as a result of the slow growth of carbon-oxygen core mass during the thermal pulses. We also performed a series of evolutionary tests of solar-metallicity models with initial masses between 4 and 9.5 M-circle dot and with different core rotation rates. We find that ultra-massive carbon-oxygen core white dwarfs are formed even for the lowest rotation rates we analyzed, and that the range of initial masses leading to these white dwarfs widens as the rotation rate of the core increases, whereas the initial mass range for the formation of oxygen-neon core white dwarfs decreases significantly. Finally, we compared our findings with the predictions from ultra-massive white dwarfs resulting from the merger of two equal-mass carbon-oxygen core white dwarfs, by assuming complete mixing between them and a carbon-oxygen core for the merged remnant.Results. These two single-evolution scenarios produce ultra-massive white dwarfs with different carbon-oxygen profiles and different helium contents, thus leading to distinctive signatures in the period spectrum and mode-trapping properties of pulsating hydrogen-rich white dwarfs. The resulting ultra-massive carbon-oxygen core white dwarfs evolve markedly slower than their oxygen-neon counterparts.Conclusions. Our study strongly suggests the formation of ultra-massive white dwarfs with carbon-oxygen cores from a single stellar evolution. We find that both the evolutionary and pulsation properties of these white dwarfs are markedly different from those of their oxygen-neon core counterparts and from those white dwarfs with carbon-oxygen cores that might result from double-degenerate mergers. This can eventually be used to discern the core composition of ultra-massive white dwarfs and their formation scenario.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000616969900001

However, an efficient hydrogen production is restricted by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the counter anode. Therefore, the development of new OER catalysts with high catalytic activities is crucial for high performance water splitting. Here, we report a novel sloughing method for the fabrication of an efficient OER catalyst on a stainless steel (SS) surface. A chalcogenide (Fe-S) overlayer generated by sulfurization on the SS surface is found to play a critical role as a precursor layer in the formation of an active surface during water oxidation. Interestingly, a newly exposed catalytic layer after sloughing off the Fe-S overlayer has a nanoporous structure with changed elemental composition, resulting in a significant improvement in OER performance with an overpotential value of 267 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (in 1 M KOH). Our novel method for the preparation of OER catalyst provides an important insight into designing an efficient and stable electrocatalyst for the water splitting community.									20	1	0	0	2	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000440511900019	29962200

In their preparation, surface oxidation by chemical oxidants is often necessary to purify MWNCTs, which also results in the formation of oxygen functional groups. However, the effect of these functionalities on electrochemical behavior of MWCNTs for alcohol oxidations remain largely unknown. In this study, we show that surface oxidation activates MWCNTs for electrochemical oxidation of alcohols in alkaline media (0.1 M KOH). Significantly enhanced catalytic activity in terms of higher current density (j) as well as lower alcohol oxidation onset potentials was observed following controlled oxidations via chemical or electrochemical methods. High-resolution XPS analysis suggests that the surface bound oxygen functionalities e.g. ketonic group (C=O) contribute primarily to the observed increase in catalytic performance. Moreover, to further increase the activity of MWCNTs, hydrothermal treatment was applied to repair the structural damage induced by the harsh oxidation treatment without the sacrifice of oxygen functional groups. Using the hydrothermally treated, surface-oxidized MWCNTs, EtOH undergoes oxidation into acetic acid with similar to 99% faradaic efficiency. This study reveals the unique role of oxygen functional groups on MWCNTs towards catalytic alcohol oxidations for possible applications in direct alcohol fuel cells and alcohol sensors.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10				2046-2069		WOS:000382539300020

Herein, a facile strategy for the in situ growth of MOFs combined with carbonization and subsequent solvothermal treatment for the rational design of thin MoS2 nanosheets grafted Co-N-C flakes (CoNC@MoS2) and grown on electrospun carbon nanofibers (CNFs) as bifunctional electrocatalysts for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) is reported. Binder-free CoNC@MoS2/CNF films exhibited unique hierarchical architectures with interconnected vine-like CNFs, which imparted favorable flexibility and satisfactory electrical conductivity to the self-supported electrocatalysts for electrochemical reactions. Due to the synergistic effect of the CoNC@MoS2 hybrid nanostructures and fast mass-transport properties of porous carbons, the resultant CoNC@MoS2/CNFs exhibited high catalytic activities and favorable stabilities for the HER and OER in a basic medium. When acting as electrocatalytic electrodes for overall water splitting, CoNC@MoS2/CNF films displayed a low overpotential of 1.62 V to generate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with remarkable stability at different voltages for 200 000 s, and even outperformed Pt/C-RuO2 electrode in high current density water electrolysis. This study highlights the rational design of hybrid nanostructures based on MOFs and CNFs as efficient self-supported electrocatalysts, opening new possibilities for the fabrication of functional free-standing materials in energy chemistry.									104	9	0	0	6	0	105			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000415990800055

Due to the high surface area and correspondingly increased electroactive sites derived from the mesoporous and hollow characteristics, the obtained NixCo3-x(PO4)(2) shells exhibit excellent performance as a non-enzymatic glucose sensor, non-precious metal electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and electrode material for energy storage.									85	2	0	0	5	0	85			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000345066900032

However, smaller particles tend to aggregate into clusters or particles owing to their high surface energy. In addition, support materials that have strong interactions with isolated metal atoms, extremely large surface areas, and electrochemical stability are required. Therefore, sufficient information about these factors is needed to synthesize and utilize SACs. Herein, we review the recent investigations and advances in SACs for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We present not only the structural characterization of SACs, but alsoin situ/operandospectroscopic techniques and computational research for SACs to understand the mechanism and reveal the origin of their excellent OER activity. Furthermore, the OER catalytic activity and stability of SACs are summarized to evaluate the current level of SACs. Currently, research on single-atoms as OER catalysts is in the infant stage for synthesis, characterization and mechanism studies. We discuss some challenges for understanding the fundamentals of SACs and enhancing the catalytic performance of SACs for industrial applications.									28	2	0	0	0	0	27			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000580724600001	32985636

Recent structure-property relationships are based on the static catalytic process. In realistic reactions, the local catalytic environment varies, which further regulates the catalytic performance. To establish a dynamic catalytic theory to more accurately describe the structure-property, the synergetic cooperation between active sites and their local environments should be considered. Based on the transition-metal oxide electrocatalysts composed of the specific ligand units, we developed a concept of ligand field cooperative catalysis (LFCC) including the interaction among ligand units composed with metal centers and oxygen ligands. LFCC could be achieved through either the charge transfer between different ligand units or reactant adsorption configuration modifications. We further reviewed the recent strategies to modify the cooperative effects of ligand units, e.g., introducing doping, vacancy, strain, ligand, substrate, and interface. The concept of LFCC comprehensively considers both the metal central atom and adjacent ligand units during the catalytic reaction providing insights into the design of future oxide catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2052-1537		WOS:000683361000001

The onset potentials for R-Fe-Fe-(OH)(3) and R-Fe-Fe-O-3 surface terminations were determined. It is found that oxygen vacancy stabilizes O adsorption on both terminations. The electronic structure was studied in order to explain the obtained reaction energy landscape. The density of states (DOS), projected density of states (PDOS), and the projected Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (pCOHP) of the bond between the O and surface Fe atom of both terminations were plotted in order to explain the stabilization caused by oxygen vacancy. The pCOHP plot clearly illustrates a change in bond strength and provides a direct explanation for the stabilization. The results show that the presence of subsurface oxygen vacancies increase the overpotential for electro-oxidation of water and that the lowest overpotential is found on oxygen-terminated hematite.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000458348600014

Among them, multi-component metallic hollow nanocages/nanoframes show great potential as advanced catalysts because of their highly open structures, large surface area and good stability. Herein, we report a general uric acid-mediated solvothermal method for shape-controlled synthesis of rhombic-like Pt35Cu65 hollow nanocages (HNCs) with uric acid as co-reductant and co-structure-directing agent. Uric acid and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) played important roles in the hollow cages. The specific architectures showed remarkably enhanced catalytic properties towards glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the enhanced specific activity, outperforming commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). This work provides a new avenue for rational design of novel bimetallic nanocatalysts with enhanced characters in energy storage and conversion. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Limitations in computational methods, complicated by the unique environment of the electrode electrolyte interface, have compelled many studies to focus on the thermodynamics of reaction schemes and to generalize inferences about the kinetics of charge transfer. In instances where activation barrier estimates are available, they are typically assumed to follow the empirical Butler-Volmer (BV) model. In this Perspective, we illustrate that the relative magnitudes and potential-dependences of elementary barriers can have a marked effect on the properties of a catalyst deemed "optimal" for a given reaction. We use a simple pseudosteady-state analysis of two sequential surface-mediated charge transfers to assess the degree of rate control of each step as a function of the material and conditions. We compare BV kinetics to Marcus theory and also discuss more recent models that are specific to the interactions of an adsorbate with the electronic structure of a surface. Recent developments in the full simulation of charge transfer to surface species are also briefly discussed. Finally, we highlight the need for assessment of kinetics and identification of activity descriptors that are optimal at relevant operating conditions, and we conclude with an outlook on current research needs.									16	0	0	0	3	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000417230500072

Since CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at a cathode is always paired with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at an anode, the overall efficiency of electrical energy to chemical fuel conversion must consider the large energy barrier and sluggish kinetics of OER, especially in widely used electrolytes, such as the pH-neutral CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3. OER in such electrolytes mostly relies on noble metal (Ir- and Ru-based) electrocatalysts in the anode. Here, we discover that by anodizing a metallic Ni-Fe composite foam under a harsh condition (in a low-concentration 0.1 M KHCO3 solution at 85 degrees C under a high-current similar to 250 mA/cm(2)), OER on the NiFe foam is accompanied by anodic etching, and the surface layer evolves into a nickel-iron hydroxide carbonate (NiFe-HC) material composed of porous, poorly crystalline flakes of flower-like NiFe layer-double hydroxide (LDH) intercalated with carbonate anions. The resulting NiFe-HC electrode in CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 exhibited OER activity superior to IrO2, with an overpotential of 450 and 590 mV to reach 10 and 250 mA/cm(2), respectively, and high stability for >120 h without decay. We paired NiFe-HC with a CO2 RR catalyst of cobalt phthalocyanine/carbon nanotube (CoPc/CNT) in a CO2 electrolyzer, achieving selective cathodic conversion of CO2 to CO with >97% Faradaic efficiency and simultaneous anodic water oxidation to O-2. The device showed a low cell voltage of 2.13 V and high electricity-to-chemical fuel efficiency of 59% at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2).									30	1	0	0	3	0	30			0027-8424			WOS:000499101100014	31723041

This vascular bacterium is the causal agent of the citrus variegated chlorosis that causes severe economical losses to the Brazilian citrus industry. The responses of the photosynthetic oxygen evolution and the parameters related to chlorophyll a fluorescence to the increase in light intensity were evaluated at 35ºC and 45ºC in both healthy and infected leaf discs. The increase in temperature affected the photosynthetic apparatus of both healthy and infected plants, although infected plants showed higher photochemical sensitivity at the higher temperature (e.g. in the potential quantum efficiency of photosystem II, maximum and basal fluorescence yield, and in the relation between variable and basal fluorescence yield). This higher sensitivity of infected plants was not reflected in the overall photosynthetic reaction, since photosynthetic oxygen evolution values did not vary at 45ºC. Healthy and infected plants showed differences in photosynthetic oxygen evolution but displayed similar effective quantum efficiency of photosystem II as well as apparent electron transport rates at 35ºC. These results suggest that the limitations in photosynthesis observed on the infected plants might arise through impaired biochemical reactions.

Respostas da evolução de oxigênio fotossintético e parâmetros relacionados com fluorescência da clorofila a ao aumento da intensidade luminosa foram avaliadas a 35ºC e 45ºC, em discos foliares sadios e infectados. O aumento da temperatura afetou a maquinaria fotossintética das plantas sadias e infectadas, mostrando as plantas infectadas maior sensibilidade fotoquímica (i.e., na eficiência quântica potencial do fotossistema II, fluorescência máxima e basal e na relação entre fluorescência variável e basal). Essa maior sensibilidade das plantas infectadas não refletiu menores taxas de fotossíntese, uma vez que os valores da evolução de oxigênio fotossintético não mudaram a 45ºC. Plantas sadias e infectadas apresentaram diferenças na evolução de oxigênio fotossintético, mas valores similares de eficiência quântica efetiva do fotossistema II e da taxa aparente de transporte de elétrons a 35ºC. Esses resultados sugerem que a limitação da fotossíntese em plantas infectadas pela Xylella fastidiosa pode surgir de injúrias nas reações bioquímicas.							10	0	0	0	6	8	14			1677-0420			SCIELO:S1677-04202003000200004

However, due to the unavoidable transformation of the active M3+/4+ (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) ions into inert M-O-H species, their activity dramatically decreases after about 25 h during stability tests, which means the widely-adopted stability test with a duration of 24 h is not sufficient for LDHs. Herein, the in situ growth of Fe1Co1 and Fe1Ni1 LDH nanosheets on V-and Ni-doped AlOOH nanorods was extended for the duration of stable electrocatalysis to 50 h. The V and Ni dopants were found to promote the diffusion of active Fe, Co and Ni cations along the abundant {100} planes of AlOOH single-crystalline nanorods with their {100} family of crystal planes perpendicular to the lateral facet, avoiding the aggregation of the active species and their transformation into inert species and their following nucleation and growth. Besides, the nano-channels on the nanorods generated during the subsequent in situ growth of LDHs are beneficial for the supply of OH-and the transportation of O2, which enhance the activity and stability of these composites.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000470697800021	31107483

To solve this problem, we report here a method for converting the original HER cathode into one that enables the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) without having to build new electrolysis cells or be concerned about electrolyte leakage from the O-2 gas electrode. The viability of this method is demonstrated using the electrolytic production of ammonium persulfate (APS) as an example. The original carbon black electrode for the HER is converted to an ORR electrode by first undergoing in situ anodization and then contacting O-2 or air bubbled from the bottom of the electrode. With this sole change, APS production can achieve an electric energy saving of up to 20.3%. Considering the ease and low cost of this modification, such significant electricity savings make this method very promising in the upgrade of electrochemical oxidation processes, with wide potential applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1996-1944		WOS:000661230900001	34073284

Herein, bulk nitrogen-doped hierarchical structure cobalt carbide, which was composed of nano/micro-particles and coupled with carbon black (denoted as N-Co2C HS/EC), was developed as a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst. N-Co2C HS/EC exhibited a high half-wave potential of 0.825 V for the oxygen reduction reaction and a low overpotential of 287 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction, both of which were superior to those of precious Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. Impressively, a rechargeable zinc-air battery driven by bifunctional N-Co2C HS/EC delivered a larger peak power density (205 mW cm(-2)), a higher specific capacity (793.08 mW h g(Zn)(-1)), and better rate performance than the one driven by Pt/C + RuO2 mixture catalysts. Systematic characterization studies and theoretical calculations revealed that the enhanced oxygen electrocatalysis of N-Co2C HS/EC was attributed to the increased amount of active Co-N-x moieties and the tailored electronic structure due to nitrogen doping. Moreover, the integrated microrod/sheet array benefited the electrocatalytic stability and electron/mass transmission. This work proposed an in situ nitrogen-doping strategy to substantially boost the electrocatalytic performance of metal carbides, which may inspire more effort for developing efficient metal compound electrocatalysts for energy conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000853324800001

The phase purity of the nanoparticles was verified using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy measurements. La(2)MnNiO(6 )nanoparticles crystallize in a monoclinic structure (P2(1)/n space group) with refined lattice parameters of a = 5.461(5) angstrom, b = 5.512(3) angstrom, c = 7.760(5) angstrom, and beta = 90.10(2)degrees. The elemental composition, particle size, size distribution, and surface area of the La2MnNiO6 nanoparticles were also investigated. La(2)MnNiO(6 )nanoparticles are ferromagnetic in nature and exhibit hysteresis with a saturation magnetization value of approximately 9 emu/g. La2MnNiO6 nanoparticles exhibit highly efficient electro-catalytic activity for OERs with a low onset over-potential (approximately 65 mV) and low Tafel slope values (120 mV/dec) in alkaline media. The over-potential of La2MnNiO6 nanoparticles at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) is in good agreement with the reported over-potential (eta(10)) of double perovskites, commercial Pt/C and IrO2 electro-catalysts for promoting OERs.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000542949400048

Manganese plays a fundamental role in this history because it lends the critical redox behavior of the water-oxidizing complex of photosystem II. Constraints from the photoassembly of the Mn-bearing water-oxidizing complex fuel the hypothesis that Mn(II) once played a key role as an electron donor for anoxygenic photosynthesis prior to the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. Here we review the growing body of geological and geochemical evidence from the Archean and Paleoproterozoic sedimentary records that supports this idea and demonstrates that the oxidative branch of the Mn cycle switched on prior to the rise of oxygen. This Mn-oxidizing phototrophy hypothesis also receives support from the biological record of extant phototrophs, and can be made more explicit by leveraging constraints from structural biology and biochemistry of photosystem II in Cyanobacteria. These observations highlight that water-splitting in photosystem II evolved independently from a homodimeric ancestral type II reaction center capable of high potential photosynthesis and Mn(II) oxidation, which is required by the presence of homologous redox-active tyrosines in the modern heterodimer. The ancestral homodimer reaction center also evolved a C-terminal extension that sterically precluded standard phototrophic electron donors like cytochrome c, cupredoxins, or high-potential iron-sulfur proteins, and could only complete direct oxidation of small molecules like Mn2+, and ultimately water.									33	2	0	0	25	0	33			0169-6149	1573-0875		WOS:000358366700008	26017176

Herein, a multiscale structure surface engineering approach to construct Co(OH)(2)/Ag/FeP hybrid as efficient electrocatalysis for water splitting in alkaline media is reported. By optimizing the component ratio and engineering interfacial structure, the Co(OH)(2)/Ag/FeP hybrid eletrocatalyst exhibits promoted HER and OER activity as well as stability in alkaline media, achieving an overpotential of 118 and 236 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Further experimental characterizations demonstrate the electron structure changes in Co(OH)(2)/Ag/FeP hybrid after constructing the interfaces, which is beneficial to generate low-charge state Fe' and high-oxidized Co3+/4+. The first-principle calculations reveal that the dissociation of H2O at the interface region is energetically favorable, which is responsible for the enhanced HER and OER activity. Furthermore, two-electrode alkaline water electrolyzer constructed by Co(OH)(2)/Ag/FeP hybrid electrocatalysts only requires a voltage of 1.56 V to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to the commercial Pt/C IrO2 catalytic couple and makes it a promising material to be employed as effective bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting.									45	2	0	0	3	0	46			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000460365300030	30722660

Under flashing illumination, the metal cluster cycles among five S-n states, and oxygen is evolved from water. The essential YZ is transiently oxidized and reduced on each flash in a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction. Calcium is required for function. Of reconstituted divalent ions, only strontium restores oxygen evolution. YZ is predicted to hydrogen bond to calcium-bound water and to His190D1 in PSII structures. Here, we report a vibrational spectroscopic study of YZ radical and singlet in the presence of the metal cluster. The S-2 state is trapped by illumination at 190 K; flash illumination then generates the S(2)YZ radical. Using reaction-induced FTIR spectroscopy and divalent ion depletion/substitution, we identify calcium-sensitive tyrosyl radical and tyrosine singlet bands in the S-2 state. In calcium-containing PSII, two CO stretching bands are detected at 1,503 and 1,478 cm(-1). These bands are assigned to two different radical conformers in calciumcontaining PSII. At pH 6.0, the 1,503-cm(-1) band shifts to 1,507 cm(-1) in strontium-containing PSII, and the band is reduced in intensity in calcium-depleted PSII. These effects are consistent with a hydrogen-bonding interaction between the calcium site and one conformer of radical YZ. Analysis of the amide I region indicates that calcium selects for a PCET reaction in a subset of the YZ conformers, which are trapped in the S-2 state. These results support the interpretation that YZ undergoes a redox-coupled conformational change, which is calcium dependent.									6	0	0	0	4	0	6			0027-8424			WOS:000433283700047	29752381

Herein we report one-pot synthesis of carboxylic-functionalized Ni-doped AlOOH nanoflowers (AlOOH NFs) with high adsorptive capability toward various transition metal cations, and more importantly, the AlOOH NFs adsorbed with various transition metal cations were for the first time directly used as electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By simply manipulating the initial metal cation concentration and their molar ratio, the OER catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts could be modulated. The lowest overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) prepared from AlOOH NFs adsorbed with Fe-III and Ni-II is 0.32 V in 0.1 M KOH and 0.275 V in 1.0 M KOH. Such AlOOH-supported electrocatalyst demonstrates remarkable stability, which shows no evident increase of the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) after 2 h of steady electrolysis at an overpotential of 0.42 V. The excellent OER electrocatalytic activity originates from the on-site formation of ultrafine FeOOH and NiOOH nanoclusters with average sizes below 3 nm during the electrocatalytic process. As such, we demonstrate the workability of using functionalized AlOOH NFs as a bifunctional platform for adsorption of transition metal cations and easy preparation of efficient and cost-effective OER catalysts.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2168-0485			WOS:000461978200040

The electrocatalytic properties of these nanocrystalline materials have been studied for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 30 wt.% KOH aqueous solution at three different temperatures (308, 323 and 343 K) to determine the effect of Fe contamination. The methods employed were cyclic voltammetry, steady-state polarization (Tafel) techniques and ac impedance. For comparison, it was found that iron improved electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Important changes in the activity were obtained when the temperature was increased. The electrocatalytic effect of Mo became important at high overvoltages and temperatures. The MA Fe30Co15Ni55 and Co10Ni20Mo70 alloyed powders showed the best catalytic activities for HER. 2005 Elsevier Inc.

One long-standing challenge has been the development of an oxygen evolution reaction catalyzed by easily available, structurally simple, and purely organic compounds. Herein, we first generalize the performance of the known N-ethyl-flavinium ion to a number of derivatives. Furthermore, we demonstrate an unprecedented application of different pyridinium and related salts as very simple, inexpensive water oxidation organocatalysts consisting of earth-abundant elements (C, H, O, and N) exclusively. The results establish the prospects of heterocyclic aromatics for further design of new organic electrocatalysts for this challenging oxidation reaction.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2470-1343			WOS:000427939400015	29623302

We have successfully synthesized a tran-sition metal phosphide electrocatalyst (CoNi@CP) with coating structure. The CoNi@CP was prepared with the mild conditions. An organophosphorus ligand was synthesized by simple organic reaction. It was synthesized by coordination with Co2+ and Ni2+ and then calcined. CoNi@CP has abundant and uniform phosphorus atom doping, no energy con-sumption in phosphating process, and avoids the generation of highly toxic gas PH3. Because of its special coating structure, the adsorption of H* on its surface was enhanced, and the active center of CoNi was protected, which contributed greatly to the improvement of catalytic performance. At 10 mA/cm(2) current density, the overpotential of the catalyst only 74 mV, and the slope of Tafel was only 83 mVdec(-1). The performance of the catalyst remained unchanged after 1000 stability tests. In addition, we had proved theoretically that the catalyst had high HER activity by DFT calculation. Therefore, it provides inspiration for us to better develop efficient transition metal phosphide electrocatalysts.

Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) open-structured Co3O4@MnO2 heteromatrix has been designed through a facile two-step hydrothermal method. Unexpectedly, when it serves as oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction bifunctional catalytic cathodes for lithium-oxygen cells, the 3D open-structured Co3O4@MnO2 heteromatrix-catalyzed LOBs exhibit outstanding electrochemical performances (a high specific capacity of 12,980 mA h g(-1) during the initial discharge and long cycle life of 331, 197, and 14 times with specific capacities fixed at 500, 1000, and even 3000 mA h g(-1), respectively), obviously superior to reported batteries based on low-dimensional and closed-ended catalysts. We find that the enhanced electrochemical performances are ascribed to the bifunctional catalyst and the 3D open structure of the Co3O4@MnO2 heteromatrix, which can guide the homogeneous and fluffy deposition of discharge products Li2O2, demonstrating a promising application in both LOBs and flexible/wearable Li-air batteries.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2168-0485			WOS:000642355100011

Interfacial manipulation-induced electronic modulation represents a sophisticated strategy to enhance the intrinsic activity of a non-precious electrocatalyst. Herein, we demonstrate the straightforward construction of Co/MoS2 hetero-nanoparticles anchored on inverse opal-structured N,S-doped carbon hollow nanospheres with an ordered macroporous framework (denoted as Co/MoS2@N,S-CHNSs hereafter) via a template-assisted method. Systematic experimental evidence and theoretical calculations reveal that the formation of Co/MoS2 heterojunctions can effectively modulate the electronic configuration of active sites and optimize the reaction pathways, remarkably boosting the intrinsic activity. Moreover, the inverse opal-structured carbon substrate with an ordered porous framework is favorable to enlarge the accessible surface area and provide multidimensional mass transport channels, dramatically expediting the reaction kinetics. Thanks to the compositional synergy and structural superiority, the fabricated Co/MoS2@N,S-CHNSs exhibit excellent HER activity with a low overpotential of 105 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). The rationale of interface manipulation and architectural design herein is anticipated to be inspirable for the future development of efficient and earth-abundant electrocatalysts for a variety of energy conversion systems.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2766-8525	2688-819X		WOS:000854102300010

In this work, we investigate heteroepitaxial p-n junctions formed by La0.88Sr0.12FeO3 and n-SrTiO3(001). Sr substitution for La in LaFeO3 is shown to be effective for introducing p-type conductivity, lowering the optical bandgap, and enhancing electrocatalytic OER. A staggered, typeII band alignment with a large built-in potential within the LSFO forms due to the polar interface. This electronic structure facilitates charge transfer across the p-n junction and accounts for the strongly thickness-dependent extent of OER we observe.

The overpotential of the 20% B-doped Fe3N@C magnetic nanomaterial at 10 mA cm(-2) is only 216 mV, and Tafel slope is 133 mV dec(-1). They are promising as a non-noble metal catalyst for practical hydrogen evolution reaction.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0370-1972	1521-3951		WOS:000481942600001		
J	Zhang Hongsong; Xu Qiang; Wang Fuchi; Liu Ling								Analysis of Sm2Zr2O7 forming mechanism by x-ray diffraction								RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING				36				533	536					2	AUG 2007	2007	The forming mechanism Of Sm2Zr2O7 prepared by solid reaction was studied by X-Ray diffraction method. The results show that the gradual substitution Of Sm3+ for Zr(4+)site began from 1000 degrees C, and was ended basically up to 1400 degrees C. The solid solution reaction between Sm2O3 and ZrO2 took place in the range of 1200 degrees C similar to 1300 degrees C, resulting in forming Sm2Zr2O7 with pyrochlore structure. The reaction last up to 1500 degrees C, then was ended completely. When the temperature was over 1500 degrees C, Sm2Zr2O7 crystal grew up gradually, and finally an ideal Sm2Zr2O7 crystal was obtained. No other intermediate phases were found in the whole process.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1002-185X			WOS:000250915200153

The key to implementing the large-scale application of the biomass electrooxidation reaction (BEOR) depends on the rational construction of efficient catalysts, as well as the structural optimization and performance improvement of the constructed catalysts. Herein, the mechanism of the BEOR is summarized, followed by a review of the current popular non-noble-metal electrocatalysts. Thereafter, the relationship between structure/composition and catalytic activity is systemically discussed. Furthermore, protocols for developing an effective catalyst by modulating the electronic structure, in addition to heteroatom doping, defect engineering, and heterojunction construction, are summarized and highlighted. Finally, the limitations of the current research on the construction of efficient BEOR catalysts are summarized, methods and ideas required for in-depth research are proposed, and the goals and future development trends of BEOR research are discussed. This is expected to provide guidance for the large-scale application of electrochemical biomass upgrading.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9				2688-4062		WOS:000695560900001

To improve the efficiency of this process, it will be necessary to develop highly active electrocatalysts that promote the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In the present study, the OER activity of a nickel oxide electrocatalyst was dramatically improved following the addition of a diamine to the electrolyte solution during electrodeposition. Operando UV/vis absorption spectroscopy was used to assess a number of nickel catalysts containing various diamines and other organic compounds. The data indicate that Ni(ii) complexes were formed with the diamines during electrodeposition. Consequently, the catalytic activity of these materials was enhanced based on increased concentrations of active reaction sites for the OER process. Ni K-edge X-ray absorption spectra showed that these catalysts were composed of gamma-NiOOH with a Ni3.6+ valence state. The coordination of the diamine molecules to the gamma-NiOOH produced structural distortion that contributed to improved OER activity. This structural distortion is likely the most important factor in enhancing the OER activity of inorganic-organic composite catalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000705637300001	34633002

The behaviors of gas bubbles on solid interfaces, including generation, growth, coalescence, release, transport, and collection, are crucial to gas-bubble-related applications, which are always determined by gas-bubble wettability on solid interfaces. Here, the recent progress regarding the study of interfaces with gas-bubble superwettability in aqueous media, i.e., superaerophilicity and superaerophobicity, is summarized. Some examples illustrate how to design microstructures and chemical compositions to achieve reliable and effective manipulation of gas-bubble wettability on artificial interfaces. These designed interfaces exhibit excellent performance in gas-evolution reactions, gas-adsorption reactions, and directional gas-bubble transportation. Moreover, progress in the theoretical investigation of gas-bubble superwettability is reported. Lastly, some challenges are presented, such as the reliable manipulation of gas-bubble wettability and the establishment of mature theory for exactly and systematically explaining gas-bubble wetting phenomena.									95	6	0	0	5	0	96			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000416830800014	28902967

The (RB)-B-3 collaboration has performed a pilot experiment to study quasifree scattering reactions in inverse kinematics for a stable C-12 beam. The results from that experiment constitute the first quasifree scattering results in inverse and complete kinematics. This technique has lately been extended to exotic beams to investigate the evolution of shell structure, which has attracted much interest due to changes in shell structure if the number of protons or neutrons is varied.Purpose: In this work we investigate for the first time the quasifree scattering reactions (p, pn) and (p, 2p) simultaneously for the same projectile in inverse and complete kinematics for radioactive beams with the aim to study the evolution of single-particle properties from N = 14 to N = 15.Method: The structure of the projectiles O-23, O-22, and N-21 has been studied simultaneously via (p, pn) and (p, 2p) quasifree knockout reactions in complete inverse kinematics, allowing the investigation of proton and neutron structure at the same time. The experimental data were collected at the (RB)-B-3-LAND setup at GSI at beam energies of around 400 MeV/u. Two key observables have been studied to shed light on the structure of those nuclei: the inclusive cross sections and the corresponding momentum distributions.Conclusions: The knockout reactions (p, pn) and (p, 2p) with radioactive beams in inverse kinematics have provided important and complementary information for the study of shell evolution and structure. For the (p, pn) channels, indications of a change in the structure of these nuclei moving from N = 14 to N = 15 have been observed, i.e., from the 0d(5/2) shell to the 1s(1/2). This supports previous observations of a subshell closure at N = 14 for neutron-rich oxygen isotopes and its weakening for the nitrogen isotopes.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2469-9985	2469-9993		WOS:000424629200002

But it has given a new life after many years until the rediscovery of two-dimensional (2D) BP in 2014, which inspires the craze for studying BP once again. This review begins with the preparation of BP, which is divided into two parts: the preparation of bulk BP and 2D BR. This review highlights its catalytic potential on Oxygen Evolution Reaction no matter the morphology such as bulk BP, 2D BP and atomic doping, compared to that of the precious metals with high price. In addition, BP has excellent performance in sensors due to its special direct band gap and excellent electron mobility. BP owns specific high capacity making it stand out as a bright star as the electrode materials applied in Lithium battery. More importantly, the application restriction of BP is delicately analyzed and some suggestions are put forward. Finally, the outlook including future and development trends and application prospects lying in the road ahead of BP research are simultaneously discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

By contrast, cobalt-based catalysts are known to afford excellent ORR stability and OER activity, due to the weak Fenton reaction and low OER Gibbs free energy. Herein, a bimetal hydrogel template is used to prepare carbon aerogels containing Fe-Co bimetal sites (NCAG/Fe-Co) as bifunctional electrocatalysts towards both ORR and OER, with enhanced activity and stability, as compared to the monometal counterparts. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, elemental mapping and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements demonstrate homogeneous distributions of the metal centers within defected carbon lattices by coordination to nitrogen dopants. X-ray absorption spectroscopic measurements, in combination with other results, suggest the formation of FeN(3)and CoN(3)moieties on mutually orthogonal planes with a direct Fe-Co bonding interaction. Electrochemical measurements show that NCAG/Fe-Co delivers a small ORR/OER potential gap of only 0.64 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), 60 mV lower than that (0.70 V) with commercial Pt/C and RuO(2)catalysts. When applied in a flexible Zn-air battery, the dual-metal NCAG/Fe-Co catalyst also shows a remarkable performance, with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.47 V, a maximum power density of 117 mW cm(-2), as well as good rechargeability and flexibility. Results from this study may offer an ingenious protocol in the design and engineering of highly efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts based on dual metal-doped carbons.									50	1	0	0	3	0	50			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000542761900016

The reaction between uranyl oxalate and barium oxalate has been studied using thermogravimetric analysis. Oxalates of uranium and barium were prepared, and their thermal decomposition in argon environment has been studied. It has been observed that uranyl oxalate decomposes into mixture of U3O8 and UO2.13 with the evolution of carbon monoxide, oxygen and carbon dioxide in the temperature range of 573-673 K, but beyond this temperature U3O8 and UO2.13 appeared as intermediate and the final product has been found to be UO2.12. In case of solid-state reaction of barium oxalates, it has been observed that the reaction pathway of its decomposition is altered in the presence of uranium oxide. Barium oxalate first decomposes to barium carbonate followed by the reaction with uranium oxide at a relatively high temperature during the next step in TG. XRD characterization of the intermediates and end products indicated that BaUO4 is formed which gets partially reduced to BaUO3 at elevated temperature.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1388-6150	1572-8943		WOS:000372261900006

However, a single material generally fails to maintain simultaneous activities in both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we developed a hybrid electrocatalyst of a Fe-(NiS2/MoS2)/carbon nanotube (CNT) film by combining composite and doping strategies, followed by a microstructure design of laser-drilled micropores, for high-efficiency overall water splitting and pH-universal HER. The charge transfer between MoS(2)and NiS(2)synergistically enhances both the HER and OER, and the light Fe doping further promotes the synergistic effect. The microstructure with periodic pores favors the release of bubbles, ensuring long-term stabilities at both low and large current densities without activity degradation. Consequently, Fe-(NiS2/MoS2)/CNT exhibits an ideal voltage, even lower than that of noble-metal electrodes, of 1.51 V at 10 mA cm(-2)for overall water splitting in 1 M KOH, with eta(10)of the HER/OER at 87/234 mV, respectively. As a cathode, it also delivers low eta(10)values of 98 mV in 0.5 M H(2)SO(4)and 127 mV in 1 M PBS, showing a pH-universal HER activity. Our work provides a comprehensive strategy towards high-efficiency electrocatalysts for overall water splitting, which will find a broad range of green energy applications.									44	2	0	0	3	0	44			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000566092600017

Herein, we report a solid-liquid method to induce surface reorganization (formation of a chalcogenide layer with rich chalcogenide vacancies) and phase transformation (Co9S8-to-Co3S4) simultaneously on cobalt chalcogenide. Featuring a uniform 2D morphology and the in situ formation of sulfur (S) vacancies, in a 0.1 M KOH solution, it exhibits a low overpotential of 288 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 43.4 mV dec(-1), and strong cycling stability (35 h), outperforming commercial RuO2 and most reported OER electrocatalysts. In addition, we also investigate the OER activity of the Co-S-P electrode in 1.0 M KOH solutions. Co0.37S0.38P0.02 NSs only need 257 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, the Tafel slope of Co0.37S0.38P0.02 NSs (44.0 mV dec(-1)) is lower than those of other recently reported electrocatalysts. Also, it shows high HER electrocatalytic activity in alkaline and acidic solutions. Finally, the Co0.37S0.38P0.02 electrode is used as a cathode and anode simultaneously for overall water splitting, which merely requires a cell voltage of 1.59 V at 10 mA cm(-2) with excellent stability (40 h).									29	2	0	0	1	0	29			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000516533300023	31965124

Herein, we have performed a systematic theoretical study on the electrocatalytic HER over single-atom catalysts (SACs) based on low-cost TiN. Specifically, the TiN(100) surface with a Ti or N vacancy has been considered as the support. 20 transition-metal (TM) atoms and 3 nonmetallic atoms are embedded into the Ti or N vacancy, accordingly denoted as M@Tiv or M@Nv. All the single atoms can be stabilized by the surface vacancies, controlled by the adjustable chemical potential. Interestingly, for TM-embedded TiN(100), the hydrogen binding is much stronger over M@Nv than M@Tiv, which can be attributed to the more localized d states of the TM atoms anchored by the N vacancies, indicating a strong coordination effect. Among 43 catalysts, 10 (Ni, Zn, Nb, Mo, Rh@Tiv, and Au, Pd, W, Mo, B@Nv) were predicted to have high HER catalytic activity with near-zero hydrogen adsorption free energy. For the further gaseous hydrogen evolution, Zn@Tiv can adopt both Tafel (with an energy barrier of 0.68 eV) and Heyrovsky mechanisms, while the others may prefer the Heyrovsky mechanism. This work provides a promising strategy to realize cost-efficient electrocatalysts for the HER, and highlights the important role of the local coordination environment for SACs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000672953800001	34270659

Herein, by simply using conductive FeS microsheet arrays vertically pre-grown on iron foam (FeS/IF) as both substrate and source to in situ form vertically aligned NiFe(OH)(x) nanosheets arrays, a hierarchical electrode with a nano/micro sheet-on-sheet structure (NiFe(OH)(x)/FeS/IF) can be readily achieved to meet the requirements. Such hierarchical electrode architecture with a superhydrophilic surface also allows for prompt gas release even at high output. As a result, NiFe(OH)(x)/FeS/IF exhibits superior OER activity with an overpotential of 245 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) and can steadily output 1000 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 332 mV. The water-alkali electrolyzer using NiFe(OH)(x)/FeS/IF as the anode can deliver 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.50 V and steadily operate at 300 mA cm(-2) with a small cell voltage for 70 h. Furthermore, a solar-driven electrolyzer using the developed electrode demonstrates an exceptionally high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 18.6%. Such performance together with low-cost Fe-based materials and facile mass production suggest the present strategy may open up opportunities for rationally designing hierarchical electrocatalysts for practical water splitting or diverse applications.									117	11	0	0	7	0	119			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000478448300001		
J	Wang, Ying; Qiao, Mengfei; Mamat, Xamxikamar					Qiao, Mengfei/0000-0003-1523-9332			An advantage combined strategy for preparing bi-functional electrocatalyst in rechargeable zinc-air batteries								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				402						126214	10.1016/j.cej.2020.126214				DEC 15 2020	2020	The development of rechargeable zinc-air batteries requires the rational construction and exploration of robust and cost-effective bi-functional cathode catalysts to replace common noble metal-based ones for efficient oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR and OER). In this study, a new kind of hierarchically ordered porous carbon co-doped by FeCo alloy nanoparticles and FeN2 moiety was synthesized via a hard-templated molding and two-step pyrolysis strategies. Notably, rational modulation of FeCo and FeN2 endows maximal synergistic effect between the intrinsic activity of FeCo alloy nanoparticles and the atomically dispersed FeN2 moieties for OER and ORR, respectively. Furthermore, the ordered hierarchical porous structure carbon matrix possessing a large surface area can accelerate mass transfer, enlarge the contact area with electrolyte, and expose more active sites which buried deeply in the material. As a result, the obtained FeCo/FeN2/NHOPC exhibited remarkable bi-functional catalytic activity in terms of a more positive half-wave potential (0.86 V) compared with PVC (0.84 V) for ORR in alkaline medium, a low overpotential of 340 mV for OER in the same condition, and the reversible oxygen electrode index of 0.71 V. Moreover, when served as a cathode catalyst in a home-made rechargeable zinc-air battery, the material performs the superior reactive activity with a high energy density of 810.3 mWh g(zn)(-1) , a peak power density of 128.7 mW cm(-2) , and excellent stability over 120 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2) without apparent degradation. Importantly, the advantage combined strategy proposed in this work indicates an auspicious direction for synthesizing high-performance bi-functional catalysts.									14	1	0	0	4	0	14			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000573514500003

Herein, we designed and fabricated a unique hybrid structure comprising a protective layer of B-N co-doped carbon (BNC) coated on copper indium disulfide (CIS) on three-dimensional (3D) macroporous nickel foam (NF) by a two-step solvothermal process. The CIS-BNC/NF electrocatalyst demonstrated a promising electrocatalytic behavior for achieving a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 230 mV, whereas ruthenium on carbon (Ru/C) required 310 mV to attain the same current density. The excellent OER activity results from the synergetic effect of the high electrocatalytic activities of CIS (CuInS2) and the large surface area caused by the BNC. In addition, the hybrid structure of CIS-BNC/NF showed a 0.5% increase in potential after prolonged chronopotentiometry measurements (CP) for 110 h. The protection layer of the BNC not only provided a vast and readily accessible pathway for fast ion transportation but also acted as a shield for CIS from direct contact with the alkaline electrolyte. This study provides a breakthrough on hybrid carbon-transition metal structures as economic and ultra-stable electrocatalysts for hydrogen production.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000611410300056

Here, an electrocatalyst of both ruthenium (Ru) single atoms (SAs) and N-doped-graphitic(G(N))-shell-covered nitrided-Ru nanoparticles (NPs) (having a Ru-N-x shell) embedded on melamine-derived G(N) matrix {1: [Ru(SA)+Ru(NP)@RuNx@G(N)]/G(N)}, which exhibits superior HER activity in both acidic and basic media, is presented. In 0.5 m H2SO4/1 m KOH solutions, 1 shows diminutive "negative overpotentials" (-eta = |eta| = 10/7 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), lowest ever) and high exchange current densities (4.70/1.96 mA cm(-2)). The remarkable HER performance is attributed to the near-zero free energies for hydrogen adsorption/desorption on Ru(SAs) and the increased conductivity of melamine-derived G(N) sheets by the presence of nitrided-Ru(NPs). The nitridation process forming nitrided-Ru(NPs), which are imperfectly covered by a G(N) shell, allows superb long-term operation durability. The catalyst splits water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen at 1.50/1.40 V (in 0.1 m HClO4/1 m KOH), demonstrating its potential as a ready-to-use, highly effective energy device for industrial applications.									152	7	0	0	5	0	152			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000477779200008

Single atom catalysts (SACs) are encouraging to catalyze the electrochemical CO2RR due to the tunable electronic structure of the central metal atoms, which can regulate the adsorption energy of reactants and reaction intermediates. Moreover, SACs form a bridge between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, providing an ideal platform to explore the reaction mechanism of electrochemical reactions. In this review, we first discuss the strategies for promoting the CO2RR performance, including suppression of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), generation of C-1 products and formation of C2+ products. Then, we summarize the recent developments in regulating the structure of SACs toward the CO2RR based on the above aspects. Finally, several issues regarding the development of SACs for the CO2RR are raised and possible solutions are provided.									36	1	0	0	1	0	35			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000643915000001	34123313

The Li-O-2 discharge products may consist of composite structures of Li/O-2 compounds, such as Li2O2, O-rich Li2O2, LiO2-like superoxide, and Li2O, which can be both crystalline and amorphous phase. Some impurities can also be present owing to undesired parasitic reactions associated with electrolyte decomposition. In particular, the observation of unpaired spins associated with Li-O-2 discharge products may be because of the oxygen-rich environment of the Li-O-2 cell, which results in reduced oxygen radical species (e. g., O-2(-), LiO2, etc.). The presence of unpaired spins in Li-O-2 cell products can have a significant impact on electrolyte stability and cell performance (e. g., overpotential, electrical conductivity). Besides standard ex situ experimental characterization, accurate and robust in situ experimental characterizations (e. g., EPR, NMR, Raman, and FTIR spectroscopy) in combination with well-controlled materials synthesis techniques are further needed to probe the time-evolution reaction mechanism of these unpaired electron spins within the Li-O-2 cell environment for better materials understanding and future Li-O-2 battery design.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			2192-6506			WOS:000349469400005

Two-dimensional (2D) materials are widely explored for the purpose because of their unique physical and chemical properties, abundant active sites, and easy fabrication. Here, we present a new family of 2D M4B6X6 (2D Boridenes) and investigate their physical and chemical properties for their potential applications into electrocatalysis based on first-principles calculations. We demonstrate that 2D M4B6X6 (M=Cr, Mo, and W; X=O and F) are dynamically, thermodynamically, and mechanically stable, and show intriguing electronic and catalytic properties. Importantly, we find that M4B6O6 are intrinsically active for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our results demonstrate that: (1) the adsorbate-escape mechanism dominates the OER process with a low overpotential of 0.652 V on Cr4B6O6; (2) the partial surface-oxidization can improve the catalytic performance of M4B6F6 dramatically; and (3) the surface reconstruction greatly affects the OER performance of M4B6X6. Our findings illustrate that the surface reconstruction is critical to the OER activity, which may provide a new strategy on the design of 2D materials for electrocatalysis and offer theoretical insight into the catalytic mechanism.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000799426800001	35384321

However, few efforts have been made to clarify whether spin engineering could make a considerable enhancement for electrocatalytic water oxidation. Herein, we report the spin engineering of a nanocage-structured (Co,Ni)Se-2/C@FeOOH, that showed significant oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Magnetization measurement presented that the (Co,Ni)Se-2/C@FeOOH sample possesses higher polarization spin number (mu(b) = 6.966 mu B/f.u.) compared with that of the (Co,Ni)Se-2/C sample (mu(b) = 6.398 mu B/f.u.), for which the enlarged spin polarization number favors the adsorption and desorption energy of the intermediate oxygenated species, as confirmed by surface valance band spectra. Consequently, the (Co,Ni)Se-2/C@FeOOH affords remarkable OER product with a low overpotential of 241 mV at a current of 10 mA cm(-2) and small Tafel slope of 44 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 mol/L KOH alkaline solution, significantly surpassing the parent (Co,Ni)Se-2/C catalyst. This work will trigger a solid step for the design of highly-efficient OER electrocatalysts. (C) 2022, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Herein, this is remedied via the modification of nanostructured WO3 photoanodes with surface decorated PdO as an oxygen evolution co-catalyst (OEC). The photoanodes and co-catalyst particles are grown using an up-scalable aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition (AA-CVD) route, and their physical properties characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. Subsequent PEC and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements showed that the use of a PdO co-catalyst dramatically increases the faradaic efficiency (FE) of water oxidation from 52% to 92%, whilst simultaneously enhancing the photocurrent generation and charge extraction rate. The Pd oxidation state was found to be critical in achieving these notable improvements to the photoanode performance, which is primarily attributed to the higher selectivity towards oxygen evolution when PdO is used as an OEC and the formation of a favourable junction between WO3 and PdO, that drives band bending and charge separation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000610150200050	33367408

The synthesized ternary PANI-GR-TiO2 was thoroughly studied by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The PANI-GR-TiO2 hybrid displays promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity for photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation. Moreover, the durability of the ternary hybrid was greatly improved due to the coating of PANI and GR on the surface of TiO2. Finally, a reasonable mechanism was proposed to understand the enhanced activity of the PANI-GR-TiO2 hybrid using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy. Our results clearly demonstrate that integrating GR and PANI with TiO2 through a simple route results in an efficient ternary photocatalyst with prominent OER performance for visible-light photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation.									61	4	0	0	3	0	63			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000328886800027

Various heteroatom-doped carbons, beyond nitrogen-doping (N-doping), with distinctive features have also been developed for many specific reactions of practical significance (e.g., oxygen reduction (ORR), water splitting (OER and HER), CO(2)reduction (CO2RR), and N(2)reduction (NRR)). However, the topic of metal-free non-N-doped carbon electrocatalysts has not been reviewed till now. This article aims to review recent advances in non-N-doped carbon electrocatalysts with an emphasis on their synthesis, catalytic mechanisms, and catalytic performance in various electrochemical reactions, including the ORR, OER, HER, H(2)O(2)production, NRR, and CO2RR. Like N-doping, boron-doping, phosphorus-doping, and fluorine-doping are found to show similar catalytic efficiency for the ORR, OER, and HER. However, oxygen-doping and boron-doping are particularly favorable for the selective production of H(2)O(2)and NH3, respectively, exceeding the performance of N-doping. Along with the timely and critical overview on the non-N-doped carbon electrocatalysts, current challenges and future perspectives for this emerging field are also discussed.									17	0	0	0	3	0	17			2366-7486			WOS:000558057000001

PNV-CN demonstrates a high visible light photocatalytic activity of 62.4molh(-1) and an apparent quantum efficiency of 4.0% at 420nm with 17.3 and 5.5 times higher hydrogen evolution rate (HER) than bulk g-C3N4 (B-CN) prepared by thermal polymerization of DCDA and the loose g-C3N4 (LB-CN), prepared via thermal polymerization of a mixture (DMDN) consisting of dicyandiamide nitrate (DN), GLUN, and their hydrogen-bonding macromolecular compounds by drying the physical mixture of DCDA and nitric acid, respectively. The outstanding photocatalytic properties of PNV-CN for visible light-driven hydrogen evolution originate from the enhanced charge separation and migration, extending visible light absorption tails, promoting recombination of charge carriers, increased active sites, and strengthened mass transfer process that results from the synergistically promoting effect of hierarchical porous morphology, as-formed nitrogen defects, O-doping and the unique nanosheet structure.									10	2	0	0	0	0	11			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000471344300018

In order to investigate how MgO improves MLCC against dc degradation, both CaO doped and (CaO+MgO) codoped chips, pristine as well as highly accelerated life-tested, are studied. BaTiO3 grains are characterized by both the types I and II core shell structure, which is typical of MLCC exhibiting the X7R dielectric behavior. Intragranular voids are found in BaTiO3 grains in the vicinity of the electrode-dielectric interface. Void-containing grains are more frequently observed and voids are more abundant in (CaO+MgO) codoped chips than in CaO doped ones. Higher concentration of oxygen vacancies (V-O(center dot center dot)) is induced extrinsically from both MgO codoping and Ni diffusion into BaTiO3 grains along the electrode-dielectric interface during sintering. Such oxygen vacancies have reacted with both cation vacancies (V-Ba '' and V-Ti '''') by an inverse Schottky defect reaction and condensed to form voids. This reaction requiring cation and oxygen vacancies in the stoichiometric BaTiO3 composition of 1:1:3 has significantly decreased the randomly distributed mobile oxygen vacancies, and contributes to improve against dc degradation.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000272129400033

Herein, 3D binder-free bimetallic nickel-cobalt selenide nanosheets anchored on a macroporous conducing carbon membrane (NiCoSe2@PCM) have been developed. A unique interconnected macropores PCM was prepared via cryogelafion, freeze-drying, and subsequent carbonization. The PCM is used as a framework for the growth of a NiCoSe2 catalyst. Uniform and tightened nanosheets with a few-layers NiCoSe2 were obtained on the surface of the PCM, without the need for a transferring step or a conducive additive. The perpendicularly oriented NiCoSe2 nanosheets display superior electrochemical catalytic performance reflected in a low overpotential of 0.116 V (at 10 mA cm(-2)) with a Tafel slope of 66 mV dec(-1) and 1.37 V (at 10 mA cm(-2)) with a Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1) for HER and OER, respectively. Excellent stability with no current density decay was observed over a 23 h testing period. Bifunctional NiCoSe2@PCM was used in the assembly of a two-electrode electrolyzer, to obtain 10 mA cm(-2), at a low voltage of 1.73 V. The low-cost and simplicity of membrane fabrication and catalyst synthesis could be extended to other metal dichalcogenides to develop new types of efficient water splitting electrocatalysts.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000701843700005

Herein, we successfully synthesized Mo-doped CoFe layered double hydroxides (Mo-doped CoFe LDH/NF) nanosheets by electrochemical transformation of Mo-doped CoFe prussian blue nanocubes on nickel foam (Mo-doped CoFe PBA/NF) for highly efficient overall water splitting. The catalyst exhibits outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance after electrochemical transformation, which is due to the abundant edge defects of Mo-doped CoFe LDH/NF can expose more active sites. Meanwhile, Mo6+ has a strong electron absorption ability, which could adjust the electronic structure and stabilize the high valence active sites. It only requires a low overpotential for OER (331 mV) and HER (227 mV) to reach 100 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media, respectively. Notably, when it was employed as a bifunctional electrode, Mo-doped CoFe LDH/NF displays a low potential of 1.55 V to reach 100 mA cm(-2) coupled with long-term water splitting stability in an alkaline electrolyte. This work not only developed a novel method for the synthesis of efficient double-layer hydroxide catalysts, but also paved the way for the rational design of bifunctional electrocatalysts with practical application value.

The ZIF-67 dodecahedrons were prepared as first self-template to synthesize the Co-LDH hollow dodecahedrons, which were further used as self-template to fabricate Co3O4 NSHDs by a controlled calcination. The proposed two-step self-templated method not only brings hollow structures without auxiliary template, ultrathin nanosheet, ultrafine grains, and large surface areas, but also allows the easy and uniform surface modification, as demonstrated of PdO modification. The Co3O4 NSHDs with above features could show multifunctional applications, such as sensing and catalysis. Experiments suggest that the Co3O4 NSHDs show good gas sensing performances to trimethylamine at a low operating temperature (100 degrees C). They can be further enhanced by PdO surface modification, which have a low detection limit (250 ppb) and a short response time (4.5 s). In addition, the Co3O4 NSHDs exhibited excellent oxygen evolution reaction performances with a low overpotential of 359 mV, low Tafel slope of 80.7 mV dec(-1) and low electrochemical impedance, which was superior to those for the Co3O4 NCs obtained by directly calcinating the ZIF-67 templates, Ni foam and most common metal oxides catalysts.									17	3	0	0	1	0	17			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000450218200008

In this study, we report a novel high-performance electrocatalyst derived from a unique three-dimensional hierarchical network of two-dimensional iron-doped nickel selenide nanosheets (2D Fe-doped NiSe NSs) and high-quality carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown on a carbon paper substrate. The synergistic effects derived from Fe doping and interfering effects between 2D NSs and CNTs produce an enrichment of electroactive sites and good electrical conductivity, thereby significantly improving the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activities. As a result, the catalyst requires an overpotential of only 282.7 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. An electrolyzer of Pt/C(-)//Fe-doped NiSe NSs/CNTs(+) demonstrates a cell voltage of 1.57 V and effective durability, superior to the state-of-the-art Pt/C(-)//RuO2/C(+) system (1.66 V) as well as recently reported catalysts. The achievements indicate a prospective catalyst for enhancing the OER in overall water splitting application.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000742410000001

Herein we combine theoretical analysis and electrochemical methods to identify the active surfaces in a manganese oxide bi-functional catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). First, we electrochemically characterize the nanostructured alpha-Mn2O3 and find that it undergoes oxidation in two potential regions: initially, between 0.5 V and 0.8 V, a potential region relevant to the ORR and, subsequently, between 0.8 V and 1.0 V, a potential region between the ORR and the OER relevant conditions. Next, we perform density function theory (DFT) calculations to understand the changes in the MnOx surface as a function of potential and to elucidate reaction mechanisms that lead to high activities observed in the experiments. Using DFT, we construct surface Pourbaix and free energy diagrams of three different MnOx surfaces and identify 1/2 ML HO* covered Mn2O3 and O* covered MnO2, as the active surfaces for the ORR and the OER, respectively. Additionally, we find that the ORR occurs through an associative mechanism and that its overpotential is highly dependent on the stabilization of intermediates through hydrogen bonds with water molecules. We also determine that OER occurs through direct recombination mechanism and that its major source of overpotential is the scaling relationship between HOO* and HO* surface intermediates. Using a previously developed Sabatier model we show that the theoretical predictions of catalytic activities match the experimentally determined onset potentials for the ORR and the OER, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Consequently, the combination of first-principles theoretical analysis and experimental methods offers an understanding of manganese oxide oxygen electrocatalysis at the atomic level, achieving fundamental insight that can potentially be used to design and develop improved electrocatalysts for the ORR and the OER and other important reactions of technological interest.									259	6	1	0	11	1	263			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000309140400036	22990481

In addition, obvious hybridization and electron transfer between O 2p and Te 5p orbitals can effectively activate adsorbed oxygen on the two monolayer surfaces and subsequent steps of the oxygen reduction reaction are preferentially carried out through the four-electron (4e) dissociation paths. Especially, the overpotentials of the dominant dissociation paths on the 2D NbIrTe4 and TaRhTe4 monolayers can be very small, in the range of 0.18 to 0.47 V and 0.23 to 0.44 V, respectively; these values are comparable to or even lower than that on Pt (111) (0.48 V). Besides, the two 2D monolayers can also exhibit high selectivity, effectively preventing the formation of the by-product, H2O2. Moreover, the relevant mechanisms behind the high oxygen reduction activity are analyzed in detail, and it is also found that the topological state has an important influence on the excellent oxygen reduction catalytic activity of the two monolayers. This work can provide new ideas for realizing highly efficient oxygen reduction catalysts to replace precious metal Pt-based materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000870361200001

Replacing the OER with the thermodynamically more favorable electrocatalytic oxidation process is an effective strategy for highly efficient H-2 generation. Herein, Mn-doped CoS2 has predicted an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). With the introduction of Mn, the Gibbs free energy of the adsorbed H* and the potential rate-limiting step (the dehydrogenation of *NH2NH2 to *NHNH2) for the HzOR process of the catalyst can be significantly reduced. As expected, the Mn-CoS2 catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity and robust long-term stability for the HER and HzOR. In detail, the Mn-CoS2 catalyst only acquired potentials of 46 and 77 mV versus the reversible hydrogen electrode for achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the cathodic HER and anodic HzOR, respectively. In addition, the Mn-CoS2 electrode only needs a cell voltage of 447 mV to output 200 mA cm(-2) in the overall hydrazine splitting system as well as exhibits a robust long-term H-2 production. This work provides theoretical guidance for the design of advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts and promotes high efficiency and energy-saving H-2 production technology.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2052-1553			WOS:000797037600001

However, both encounter various challenges induced by gas mixing due to the simultaneous generation of H-2 and O-2 in the same cell compartment.

A bench test has been conducted for more than six years and is based on practical photovoltaic operating conditions. The best performance is exhibited by gel batteries and by vented, pasted-plate batteries with electrolyte agitation. The over-discharge of series-connected cells in large solar battery packs influences the lifetime. Results are given for the discharge and over-discharge characteristics of lead/acid batteries, i.e., battery voltage, cell voltage, positive and negative electrode potentials, gassing rate, oxygen evolution, and sulfuric acid density.

Although direct growth of active two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets on the current collector is an effective method to improve the exposure of active sites, the inefficient electron transfer and weak electron interaction between 2D nanosheets and current collectors greatly limit their overall electrochemical performance. Herein, a unique sandwich structure of CoMnP/Ni2P/NiFe is successfully designed via introducing a Ni2P interlayer between CoMnP nanosheets and nickel-iron (NiFe) foam to achieve an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst in alkaline media. The metallic Ni2P interlayer does not only improve the electron transfer from the current collector of NiFe foam to the catalyst of CoMnP, but also enhances the intrinsic activity of each active site via strong electron interaction. Electrochemical studies show that the resulting electrocatalyst exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity, such as giving a low cell voltage of only 1.48 V at 10 mA cm(-2) stably for a long time when applied as both the cathode and anode in alkaline solutions. These results evidently indicate the superior electrochemical characteristics of this sandwich structure, which may provide a new insight into the design of electrocatalysts for different utilizations.									48	4	0	0	1	0	48			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472465300068

Unfortunately, the serious environmental and health concerns related to hexavalent chromium mean there is an urgent need to find an alternative solution to achieve the required selectivity.In this study sodium permanganate is evaluated as a possible alternative to chromate, with positive results. The permanganate additive is stable in hypochlorite-containing solutions, and during electrolysis a thin film is reductively deposited on the cathode. The deposit is identified as amorphous manganese oxide by Raman spectroscopic and X-ray diffraction studies. Using different electrochemical techniques (potentiodynamic measurements, galvanostatic polarization curves) we demonstrate that the reduction of hypochlorite is suppressed, while the hydrogen evolution reaction can still proceed. In addition, the formed manganese oxide film acts as a barrier for the reduction of dissolved oxygen.The extent of hydrogen evolution selectivity in hypochlorite solutions was quantified in an undivided electrochemical cell using mass spectrometry. The cathodic current efficiency is significantly enhanced after the addition of permanganate, while the effect on the anodic selectivity and the decomposition of hypochlorite in solution is negligible. Importantly, similar results were obtained using electrodes with manganese oxide films formed ex situ. In conclusion, manganese oxides show great promise in inducing selective hydrogen evolution, and may open new research avenues to the rational design of selective cathodes, both for the chlorate process and for related processes such as photocatalytic water splitting.

Moreover, in the synthesis process, the corners of edge cut Cu@Ni nanocubes and mesoporous Cu-Ni nanocages can be etched to produce the highly catalytically active (111) facets. Impressively, compared to edge-notched Cu@Ni nanocubes and edge-cut Cu@Ni nanocubes, the Cu-Ni nanocages exhibit higher electrocatalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under alkaline conditions. When obtained overpotential is 140 mV, the current density can reach 10 mA cm(-2); meanwhile, the corresponding Tafel slope is 79 mV dec(-1). Moreover, from the calculation results of density functional theory (DFT), it can be found that the reason why the activity of pure Ni is lower than that of Cu-Ni alloy is that the adsorption energy of the intermediate state (adsorbed H*) is too strong. Meanwhile the Gibbs free-energy (vertical bar Delta G(H*)vertical bar) of (111) facets is smaller than that of (100) facets, which brings more active sites or adsorbs more hydrogen.									75	9	0	0	3	0	76			2155-5435			WOS:000471212600036

Here, we report the fabrication of heterostructured Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets/Ni3S2 nanoneedles grown on Ni foam, Ni(OH)(2)/Ni3S2/NF, as a highly active and mechanically strong bifunctional electrode for overall water splitting. The results indicate that heterostructured Ni(OH)(2)/Ni3S2 interfaces are the reactive center for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The redistribution of electrons and formation of the Ni delta+ and S delta- active species serve as the hydroxyl and proton acceptors and significantly promote the transformation of intermediate species and charge transfer processes in both the OER and HER The Ni(OH)(2)/Ni3S2/NF electrode shows overpotentials as low as 252, 279, and 319 mV to reach 30, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, for OER and 48, 79, and 185 mV to achieve 10, 20, and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, for HER in 1.0 M KOH solution. An alkaline electrolyzer assembled by bifunctional Ni(OH)(2)/Ni3S2/NF electrodes displays cell voltages of 1.80 V to deliver 100 mA cm(-2) and is stable for over 100 h. This study demonstrates promising potential of the Ni(OH)(2)/Ni3S2/NF bifunctional electrode for advancing water-splitting technologies.									26	0	0	0	1	0	25			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000499741900159

In this experiment, nanosized titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2) particles are used to photocatalytically split water, which is then monitored by an oxygen sensor. Sacrificial reagents such as organics (EDTA) and metal ions (Fe3+) are also included in the solutions with powder nano-TiO2 as photocatalyst to help elucidate the photocatalytic reactions. In solutions containing nano-TiO2 and Fe3+, the quantity of dissolved oxygen increases, but the quantity of dissolved oxygen decreases upon addition of EDTA. This experiment provides a simple and convenient methodology to indirectly study the photocatalytic water-splitting process and to assess the effectiveness of scavenging toxic chemicals such as organics and metal ions in water. This work should provide valuable experience for undergraduate students in understanding the role of a photocatalyst in water splitting as well as methods for removing toxic substances in water. The proposed photocatalytic system in conjunction with an oxygen sensor and a data logger shows fast response time and good sensitivity for monitoring the photocatalytic reaction. It is more cost-effective and convenient as compared to other conventional methods.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0021-9584			WOS:000308788300021

Isothermal calorimetric analyses on the oxidation of two coals were conducted at five incremental temperatures of 30-70 degrees C. The measured heat generation rates versus time were interpreted by fitting with simple kinetic models. The results showed the first-order kinetics fairly well representing the heat evolution after early hours (similar to 12 h) of the reaction while Elovich equation roughly following the heat evolution at the early stage. Empirical expressions, considering the overall oxidation as two reaction pathways, chemisorption and first-order direct burn-off reaction, can describe the heat evolution over entire process. While fitting with empirical expressions provides little kinetic information, fitting the measured heat generation rate after early hours with the first-order kinetics yields the apparent kinetic parameters and the heat of reaction of low-temperature coal oxidation. The parameters are valuable for using simple kinetic model to evaluate or numerically simulate the self-heating of coals in terms of engineering applications.					8th International Symposium on Coal Combustion (ISCC)8th International Symposium on Coal Combustion (ISCC)	JUL 19-22, 2015JUL 19-22, 2015		Tsinghua Univ, Inst Thermal Engn, Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINATsinghua Univ, Inst Thermal Engn, Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	1	0	0	0	0	0	1					978-981-10-2023-0; 978-981-10-2022-3	WOS:000389590100075

Herein, we demonstrated that Ru nanoclusters anchored on Co/N-doped carbon nanotubes (Ru@Co/N-CNTs) are highly active for HER both in acid and alkaline electrolytes. The catalyst can be fabricated by facile and controlled steps involving the Co self-catalyzed Co/N-doped carbon nanotube formation and the subsequent Ru nanocluster deposition by a galvanic replacement reaction. The spectroscopic and morphological observations confirmed the self-catalyzed Co/N-doped carbon nanotube fabrication and Ru nanocluster deposition. Because of the strong electronic effect and high exposure of Ru active sites, this optimal hybrid catalyst exhibited remarkable catalytic activity and superior stability toward HER. It required low overpotentials of 48 and 92 mV to offer 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline and acidic media, respectively, which outperformed most of the Ru-based and Co-based catalysts reported in the literature. The high catalytic activity, stability, as well as the catalytic efficiency expressed by the specific activity and cost per current density of the prepared catalyst were also analyzed by comparing with those of Ru/C and Pt/C, and the higher cost efficiency makes it a very promising alternative HER catalyst.									44	2	0	0	3	0	43			2168-0485			WOS:000543715400027

However, improving the electroactivity and durability of Pt-containing catalysts is an important step for the commercialization of these catalysts. In this study, in order to increase the HER activity of the Pt catalyst, which is widely used for HER, carbon supported PtPd catalysts in different atomic ratios, were prepared by adding Pd as a second metal nearby Pt, on HER performance effect was investigated. These ratios determined as (1:1), (1:2), and (2:1). The prepared catalysts were characterized by XRD, TEM, ICP-MS, EDS, XPS and information about their structural and morphological aspects was obtained. In addition, the electrochemical properties of the catalysts were determined by CV analysis in an acidic medium, and the HER activities of the catalysts were compared using linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometry (CA) measurements. As a result of electrochemical measurements, it was found that Pt2Pd1/C catalyst had the best HER activity. For this reason, we emphasize the necessity of investigating the effect of the composition and structure of the electrocatalysts on the HER activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000848235000014

In this report, we describe a highly effective reversal-tolerant anode catalyst (RTA) based on Pt/Ti4O7 with a very small amount of Ir. A membrane electrode assembly (MEA) using a Pt/Ti4O7 RTA including 0.04 mg(Ir) cm(-2) shows almost no performance loss even after severe cell reversal. This is in clear contrast with the results obtained with an PVC RTA including the same amount of Ir, for which a significant voltage loss is observed after a cell reversal test. Moreover, the reversal-tolerance of Pt/Ti4O7 RTA is considerably high even with a very small amount of Ir, as low as 0.014 mgIr cm(-2). An Ir/Ti4O7 based anode also shows superior RTA property as well as the mitigation of start-up/shut-down degradation due to the limited activity of Ir for the oxygen reduction reaction. A post-mortem analysis of the tested MEA confirmed that PV Ti4O7 RTA alleviates damage to not only the catalyst layer but also the micro porous layer, which leads to a better RTA property for the Pt/Ti4O7.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000517663800077

Herein, interfacially engineered CoS@NiV-LDH heterostructures are fabricated by a simple top-down approach and used as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Experimental results proved that the creation of an interface between pristine CoS and NiV-LDH can optimize the electronic structure of the active sites by transferring electrons from the NiV-LDH site to CoS, which boosts the formation of the NiOOH active phase, enhancing the catalytic performance in a 1 M KOH solution. While coupled with the heterostructure CoS@NiV-LDH as the anode and cathode, it demands a cell voltage of just 1.57 V to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with remarkable stability for 70 h. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal improved catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for CoS@NiV-LDH with a lower energy barrier originating from the charge transfer-induced synergistic mechanism at the CoS and NiV-LDH interface. Moreover, the observed downshift of the d-band center for the CoS@NiV-LDH heterostructure explains their enhanced performance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), facilitating the H* adsorption/desorption process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000849783400001

Inclusions with refractory mineral assemblages such as this one are proposed to record inner nebula processes during the earliest epoch of solar nebula evolution. Mineralogical and textural analyses indicate that this primordial particle formed by high-temperature gas-solid reactions, partial melting, evaporation, and condensation. The radially distributed oxygen isotopic heterogeneity measured among multiple occurrences of several minerals, including spinel, requires the existence of O-16-poor gas at the beginning of solar system formation, 10(5) yr earlier than it can be produced by photochemical self-shielding in the solar nebula and introduced to the inner protoplanetary disk.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000516538200002

Herein, a precise electrochemical reconstruction of IrTe(2)hollow nanoshuttles (HNSs) is performed for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER), the two half reactions of water splitting. It is determined that the reconstruction of IrTe(2)HNSs can be regulated by adjusting the potential during electrochemical dealloying, in which mild and high potentials lead to the formation of IrTe(2)HNSs with metal Ir shell (D-IrTe(2)HNSs) and IrO(x)surface (DO-IrTe(2)HNSs), respectively. Detailed analyses reveal that such electrochemical reconstruction has produced abundant defects in D-IrTe(2)and DO-IrTe(2)HNSs. As a result of this, D-IrTe(2)HNSs present a very low HER overpotential of 54 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)in 1.0mKOH. Moreover, the turnover frequency of DO-IrTe(2)HNSs is 0.36 O(2)s(-1)at an OER overpotential of 250 mV in 0.5mH(2)SO(4), outperforming the most of reported Ir-based catalysts. Furthermore, the D-IrTe2||DO-IrTe(2)couple exhibits promising activity for the overall water splitting in both 1.0mKOH and 0.5mH(2)SO(4). This study promotes the fundamental research for the design of efficient catalysts via surface engineering.									52	1	0	0	4	0	53			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000566516400001

Key to addressing this issue lies not only in the synthesis of new materials, but also in the elucidation of their active sites, their structure under operating conditions and ultimately, extraction of the structure-function relationships used to spearhead the next generation of catalyst development. In this work, we present a complete cycle of synthesis, operando characterization, and redesign of an amorphous cobalt phosphide (CoPx) bifunctional catalyst. The research was driven by integrated electrochemical analysis, Raman spectroscopy and gravimetric measurements utilizing a novel quartz crystal microbalance spectroelectrochemical cell to uncover the catalytically active species of amorphous CoPx and subsequently modify the material to enhance the activity of the elucidated catalytic phases. Illustrating the power of our approach, the second generation cobalt-iron phosphide (CoFePx) catalyst, developed through an iteration of the operando measurement directed optimization cycle, is superior in both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactivity over the previous material and is capable of overall water electrolysis at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with 1.5 V applied bias in 1 M KOH electrolyte solution.									51	2	0	0	3	0	51			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000436027800002	30009004

In this study, Co phosphate (CP) nanoparticles encapsulated in three-dimensional porous N,P-codoped carbon networks (NPC) were fabricated by direct growth on carbon cloth (CC), which were further used as an integrated three-dimensional (3D) electrode for cost-effective and energy efficient HER and OER both in acid and alkaline medium. Impressively, the as-obtained flexible integrated electrode exhibited excellent activities and robust stability, due to the unique 3D architecture with improved electron transport capability, high number of active sites, and channels for reactant/product transfer. Our experimental results show significantly enhanced performance for such engineered nanostructures due to the synergistic effect from nanoparticles encapsulation and nitrogen and phosphorus doping on carbon structures. Such an versatile electrode can serve as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting with excellent catalytic performance and durability in a more direct and simple way, which reduces the production cost of practical technological devices. The new design demonstrated here opened avenues for simple, low-cost, and scalable manufacture of high performance bifunctional catalysts for renewable energy technologies.									25	1	0	0	0	0	25			2168-0485			WOS:000391246000063

However, the relationship between its oxygen vacancies and PEC conversion efficiency has yet to be determined. Herein, we demonstrate a rapid and highly efficient strategy for rationally constructing oxygen vacancies on Co3O4 cocatalysts by Ar-plasma treatment, which could significantly enhance the PEC water oxidation reactivity of TiO2-based photoanodes. The photocurrent density could be achieved up to 2.5 mA cm(-2) (1.23 V-RHE) under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm(-2)), up to 2 times higher than that of the untreated Co3O4/TiO2 samples. More specifically, the oxygen vacancy formation on Co3O4 cocatalysts not only facilitates the hole trapping ability for promoting interfacial charge separation and migration, but also provides more active sites for water oxidation. The rapid and highly efficient activation of OER cocatalysts by producing oxygen vacancies may be potentially a universal strategy for improving the photo-conversion efficiency of PEC photoanodes now available.									51	2	0	0	2	0	53			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451600200045
